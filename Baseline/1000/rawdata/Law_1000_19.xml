'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the course of [[Enlargement of the European Union|EU accession negotiations]] [[Croatia]] harmonised its media legislation to European standards. This process touched also legislation on access to public information which has been amended to reflect European and international standards.&lt;ref name=KAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.13596/ |title=Media Freedom in Croatia (2006-2016) |last= |first= |date=2016 |website= Kas.de |publisher=KAS Media Program South East Europe |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Croatia thus adopted its law on the Right of Access to Public Information in 2013, after a decade of advocacy, campaigns, and public discussions led by civil society organisations.&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/croatia |title=Croatia. Freedom of the Press 2015 |last= |first= |date=2015 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher=Freedom House |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ECPMF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecpmf.eu/news/ecpmf/interviews-balkan/barbara-matejcic-freelance-journalist-croatia |title=”I can’t say it raised the level of general transparency” |last= |first= |date=12 January 2017 |website= Ecpmf.eu |publisher=European Centre for Press and Media Freedom |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the improvements of the legal framework regulating access to public information, problems remain in the implementation, especially for journalists willing to request and obtain information from the government.&lt;ref name="KAS" /&gt;
 
==Legal framework==
 
In Croatia, access to public information has become a constitutional right with the 2010 amendments of the Constitution.&lt;ref name=GONG&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nives Miošić and Duje Prkut  |date=July 2012 |title=Access to information in Croatia: Exercise of a Constitutional Right in an Institutional Culture of Secrecy|url= https://dgap.org/sites/default/files/article_downloads/GONG%20(Zagreb)_Access%20to%20information%20in%20Croatia.pdf  |publisher=GONG Policy Research Center |issue= |access-date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regulated by the '''Law on the Right to Access Information''' adopted by the [[Croatian Parliament]] in 2013. The Law also regulates the [[re-use of information]] held by public authorities. The Law complies with the Directive 2003/98/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] on the re-use of public sector information and with Regulation 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revizija.hr/en/access-to-information/law-on-the-right-to-access-information |title=Law on the Right of Access to Information |last= |first= |date= |website=Revizija.hr |publisher=Republic of Croatia. State Audit Office |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the Law, the right of access to information encompasses the right of the beneficiaries, i.e. any local or foreign natural person or legal entity, to seek and acquire information, as well as the obligation of public authorities to guarantee access to requested information, regardless of the request.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
The Croatian law on Access to public information is  in informed by four principles:
 	
* the principle of '''publicity''' and '''free access''', meaning that information are available to any national or foreign natural persons or legal entity as established by the Law;
* the principle of '''timeliness, entirety and accuracy''' of information, meaning that information disclosed under the Law must be timely provided, complete and accurate;
* the principle of '''equality''', meaning that the right of access to information is granted to every beneficiary in an equal manner;	
* the principle of '''disposal of information''', meaning that beneficiaries that obtained the information in accordance with the Law, are entitled to disclose this information in public.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

Public bodies are obliged to publish on the Internet the following relevant information: laws and other regulations in their field of activity, including draft proposals of laws; general acts and decisions affecting the interests of beneficiaries; annual plans, programmes, strategies and financial reports referring to the work of public authority bodies; information on budget, financing sources and subsidies; information on their internal organisation; notes and conclusions from official sessions; information on public procurement and tenders; information on the way of exercising rights of access to and re-use of information, including contact details of the Information Commissioner and the fee required to access and re-use of information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
For the purpose of ensuring the right of access to information, the Law establishes that public bodies are obliged to appoint an [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]], a special official in charge of resolving the issues emerging from the exercise of the right of access to information. Specifically, the Information Commissioner shall conduct the tasks connected to disclosure of public information in accordance with the Law, including providing the necessary assistance to applicants, improving the manner of processing, classification and safe-keeping of the information, and maintaining the Information Commissioner Register.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

===Restrictions to the right of access to information===
 
Public authority bodies may restrict access to information if:
 		 
* the information has been classified, in accordance with the law regulating classified information;
 
* if the information represents a trade or professional secret;
 
* in the information is a tax-related secret;
 
* is the information is protected by the law regulating the protection of personal information;
 
* the information may seriously undermine an ongoing decision-making process;
 
* the information is restricted in accordance with international treaties.
 
Moreover, restrictions may be operated when there can be reasonable doubts that disclosing the requested information might  prevent the efficiency, independence or impartiality of ongoing proceedings or the execution of court orders and sentence.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test===
 
The public authority body in charge of acting upon the request of access to information is obliged to conduct the Proportionality Interest Test in order to reach the decision about disclosure. [[Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test]] refer to the assessment of proportionality between reasons for granting access to information and reasons for imposing restrictions and granting access to information only when the public interest prevails. If, on the basis of the Test, the public interest prevails over the damage caused to other protected interests, the information shall be disclosed.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Procedures===
 
Public authorities are bound to grant access to information by timely publishing the information on their work in an accessible manner, i.e. on the webpage, or in the Official Gazette and the Central catalogue of officials documents of the Republic of Croatia, etc. Information can be provided directly, or in writing, or by giving insight into documents and making copies of the documents containing the requested information, or by delivering copies of the requested information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Applicants can submit the request either orally or in written form. The submitter of the request is not obliged to mention any reason for requesting access to information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Access to public information does not require paying any administrative and court fees. The beneficiaries might only be called to pay for the actual costs of providing the information requested.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Authorities are obliged to issue their decisions within 15 days from the day of submitting a request. This deadline can be prolonged  by other 15 days in case of complex requests (e.g. when the information must be sought outside the offices of the public authority concerned, when a single request contains a request for different information, or when the situation requires to conduct the Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test, etc.) &lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
If the public authority does not hold the information, it is obliged to transfer the request to the body that might have it and notify the submitter thereof.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Right to appeal===
 
Against the Decision taken by the public authority, the applicant may file a Complaint to the Commissioner within 15 days since the Decision has been delivered. 
 
No complaint may be filed against the decision issued by the Commission, but an administrative dispute may be initiated before the High Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Re-use of information===
 
The Croatian law on access to public information regulates also the right to re-use information for commercial or non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 

==Access to public information in practice==
 
The Croatian law on access to public information is quite advanced and in line with international standards and best practices. However, in the country a culture of secrecy persists. &lt;ref name=MySociety&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mysociety.org/2016/09/29/journalists-celebrate-freedom-of-information-croatia/  |title=Journalists celebrate Freedom of Information: Croatia |last= |first= |date=29 September 2016 |website=Mysociety.org |publisher=mySociety |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the law, by itself, has not changed this and so far it has not raised the level of general transparency in Croatian society and institutions.&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt;&lt;ref name=MySociety/&gt;
 	
One of the main problem affecting the realization of the right of access to public information is the lack of adequate resources allocated to the office of the Commissioner. According to the 2015 Report on the implementation of the law presented to the Parliament, an increase in the resources for the functioning of the Commissioner’s Office if compared with previous years, they are still too limited to allow for the full application of the law. Over the course of 2015, the number of cases dealt with by the Commissioner’s Office has increased. However, the report showed that, due to a lack of staff and resources, not all the complaints received during 2015 have been solved by the Commissioner’s Office.&lt;ref name=HALTER&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Croazia/Croazia-al-di-sopra-dell-opinione-pubblica-17749 |title=Croazia: al di sopra dell'opinione pubblica |last=Gabrić |first=Toni |date=14 February 2017 |website=Balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa|language=Italian |access-date=14 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another problem concerns the limited application of proactive disclosure, which - according to the Commissioner [[Anamarija Musa]] - together with re-use of information, a milestone of access to public information in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Also, according to Commissioner Musa, the implementation of the law is particularly problematic at regional and local level and when it comes to requesting information to private entities providing a public service or to enterprises where the state holds the majority of capital shares.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Moreover, Commissioner Musa deems particularly concerning the fact that access to public information requests are regularly ignored, so that the two thirds of the overall complaints received by the Commissioner are caused by this reason.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt;
 
===''Imamo pravo znati'' (“We have right to know”) platform===
 	
In Croatia, the web platform imamopravoznati.org, developed using the Alavetely software, has been launched to facilitate citizens' exercise of the right of access to public information. It allows to submit requests for public information to Croatian public authorities, and track their answers. Historic requests, any correspondence between the applicant and public authorities, are archived and publicly online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imamopravoznati.org |title= Imamo pravo znati |last= |first= |date= |website=Imamopravoznati.org |publisher= |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montenegro]], access to information is a right guaranteed by the Constitution and regulated under the law. Montenegro first adopted the Law on Free Access to Information in 2005; in 2013 a new law entered into force, providing a better standard of protection for freedom of information than the previous legal act.&lt;ref name=MANS&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |title=Freedom of information in Montenegro. Analysis of the Legal Framework, Practice and Implementation of ECHR Case Law and other International Standards with Recommendations for Improvement |url=http://www.mans.co.me/en/wp-content/uploads/fai/FreedomOfInformation-Internship.pdf |publisher=MANS. Network for Affirmation of NGO Sector  |issue= |access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite some positive developments achieved with the adoption of the new Law, Montenegro still has problems with its implementation.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-ngo-doubts-govt-s-plan-to-open-public-records-04-01-2016 |title=Montenegro Plan to Open Public Records Doubted |last= |first= |date=1 April 2016 |website=Balkaninsight.com |publisher= BalkanInsight |access-date=9 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Montenegro started the process of reforming the current law: a draft proposal was formulated by the Culture of Ministry in 2016 following some pressure from the [[European Union]] to align Montenegrin legislation with EU standards.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Legal framework==
The Constitution of Montenegro states, in Article 51, that everyone shall have the right of access to public information held by state authorities and organisations exercising public functions.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt; Furthermore, the '''2013 Law on Free Access to Information''' establishes a precise procedure for obtaining public information. The law entitles any natural or legal person the right to access information held in any form by state and local authorities, public companies and other entities which exercise public functions. Public authorities have 15 working days for deciding on the disclosure of a required information.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt;

The new law introduced a new supervisory body, called Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Free Access to Information which works on the appeal process of freedom of information requests.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt; Another positive development in the 2013 law is the introduction of fines to be imposed upon public bodies which fail to fulfill with their duties with regard to access to information.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==
According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] Progress Report on Montenegro, the law on Access to public information lack effective monitoring and supervision.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; According to the newspaper [[Vijesti]], the experience of journalists and NGOs in the country shows that, despite FOI legal provisions, in practice it is difficult to get information of public importance. &lt;ref name=OBCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Montenegro/Montenegro-i-silenzi-della-pubblica-amministrazione-177586 |title=Montenegro: i silenzi della pubblica amministrazione |last=Čađenović |first=Ivan |date=10 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucasto Transeuropa / Vijesti |access-date=21 February 2017 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last years the proportion of requests refused by public authorities in Montenegro improved from 24% in 2014 to 18% in 2015. Also, the 2016 budget of the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Access to Information was increased by 50%.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Montenegro 2016 Report |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_montenegro.pdf  |publisher=European Commission |access-date=9 February  2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited capacity and resources of the Agency was an issue of concern for some NGOs advocating for access to information.&lt;ref name="MANS" /&gt;

In 2015, out of a total of 4.434 requests for access to information, the information requested was not provided in 805 cases.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; The Agency for Personal Data Protection and Free Access to Information received a total of 1.431 complaints in 2015. The majority of cases received by the Agency concerned [[administrative silence]]: in these cases the request remained unanswered.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

The majority of FOI requests, around 70%, are filed by NGOs, among which stands the NGO MANS.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; This data shows the low awareness and knowledge by the general public of the right of access to information and its legal provisions.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; In the majority of cases applicants are get the required information with large delays, beyond the time frame established by the law, and often after having filed a complaint to the Ombudsbam.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

Another issue of concern is that court decisions on cases concerning access to information are not effectively enforced.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; The report of the EC also points out that in some cases public authorities in Montenegro seem to abuse the possibility of declaring requested documents confidential in order to avoid their disclosure.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; Indeed, according to the NGO MANS, the law includes a series of unnecessary reasons for exceptions for limiting disclosure. The formulation of the exceptions enshrined in the law seems to be too vague and too general, thus giving room for public institutions to interpret it in a way that restricts access to information.&lt;ref name="MANS" /&gt;

Another reason of concern is the high percentage of requests that remain unanswered.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

According to the [[Balkan Insight|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] (BIRN), problems in realizing the right of access to public information arise in particular when journalists and NGOs seek information about the privatization process or seek information that could potentially reveal cases of corruption or illegal activity. &lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2015 |title=Montenegro 2015 Human Rights Report. Executive Summary |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253093.pdf |publisher=US State Department|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NGO MANS, the respect of the law on access to public information is particularly problematic when it comes to make public information concerning enterprises where the State owns the majority of shares.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

The EC Progress Report recommends to enhance the implementation of the law especially in corruption-prone cases.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

'''Air rights''' are the property interest in the "space" above the earth's surface. Generally speaking, owning, or renting, land or a [[building]] includes the right to use and develop the space above the land without interference by others.

This legal concept is encoded in the Latin phrase ''[[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos]]'' ("''Whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to Heaven and down to Hell''."), which appears in [[medieval Roman law]] and is credited to 13th-century [[glossator]] [[Accursius]]; it was notably popularized in [[common law]] in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1766) by [[William Blackstone]]; see [[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos#Origins|origins of phrase]] for details.&lt;!-- See refs there --&gt;

== Air travel ==
&lt;!---knowledgeable people can add other countries here, but the first part is germane to all countries---&gt;
{{Further information|Flyover rights}}
Property rights defined by points on the ground were once believed to extend indefinitely upward. This notion remained unchallenged before [[air travel]] became popular in the early 20th century. To promote air transport, legislators established a legal right for the public to transit at high altitudes, regardless of real estate ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Paris Convention of 1919 (Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation, Oct. 13, 1919, 11 L.N.T.S. 173) and the Pan American Convention on Commercial Aviation, U.S.-Cuba, Feb. 20, 1928, see 47 Stat. 1901)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the public easement in the space at these higher altitudes and landowner rights to the exclusive use of the airspace at lower altitudes have been well documented by the U.S. judiciary.

New technologies have again raised questions about ownership of "space" and the upward bounds of national sovereignty.  With the advent of space travel above earth's atmosphere, the height at which national sovereignty extends and therefore nations can regulate transit is often debated.

In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) has the sole authority to control all "publicly owned" [[airspace]], exclusively determining the rules and requirements for its use.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C. 180, 49 U.S.C.A. 18 , §&amp;nbsp;40103 "use of airspace"&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the Federal Aviation Act provides that: "The [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/40103- |title=49 U.S.C. 40103(a)(1) |accessdate=2009-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all the airspace is "possessed" by the United States.  For non-public airspace, Congress has provided authority for the FAA to purchase this non-public airspace near airports to accommodate planes taking off and landing.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C §&amp;nbsp;40110&lt;/ref&gt;  The "navigable airspace" in which the public has a right of transit without affecting a landowner's property rights has been set at the height of 500&amp;nbsp;ft in urban or suburban areas,&lt;ref&gt;"Argent v. U.S. 124 F.3rd 1277,1281 (1997) citing Lacey v. United States, 219 Ct.Cl. 551, 595 F.2d 614, 616 (1979) (treating 500 feet as line of demarcation between compensatable property taking and non-compensatable overflights); Matson v. United States, 145 Ct.Cl. 225, 171 F.Supp. 283, 286 (1959) (providing compensation for flights under 500 feet).Aaron v. United States, 160 Ct.Cl. 295, 311 F.2d 798, 801 (1963) (allowing claims based on flights below 500ft, while denying those based on flights over 500ft).”&lt;/ref&gt; and 360 feet above the surface or tallest structure in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;   The exact altitude(s) at which the  airspace over private land becomes "public" airspace, or where the upward bounds of national sovereignty extends is often debated, but the Supreme Court rulings and space treaties are clear.  A landowner's domain extends up to at least 365 feet above the ground. see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17209011020287234065 Causby v US (1946)],&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; and no nation can prevent orbits above the Earth's atmosphere.

The FAA is required to pay financial compensation to property owners when their property interests are taken for overflights.   Compensated landowners may then be required to waive any putative damages for interference with "air rights" in order to avoid [[lawsuit]]s from future owners' nuisance claims against low flying aircraft.  This is called a navigation or navigational [[easement]].

The low cost of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (also called drones) in the 2000s re-raised legal questions regarding whose permission is required to fly at low altitudes; the landowner, the FAA or both.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=317074394&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the FAA reestablished that navigable airspace is the space above 500 feet,&lt;ref&gt;Doc. No. 18334, 54 FR 34294, Aug. 18, 1989, as amended by Amdt. 91-311, 75 FR 5223, Feb. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the FAA also set regulations which allow drones to fly below 400 feet in order to prevent interference with planes above that height.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-15079.pdf F.R. 2016 6-28-2016 Pgs 42063- 42214 DOC #: 2016-15079]&lt;/ref&gt;  The FAA's actions are expected to see challenges in the judiciary.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

== Railroads and air rights ==
[[Rail transport|Railroads]] were the first companies to realize the potential of making money from their air rights. A good example of this is [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]], where [[William J. Wilgus]], chief engineer of the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central and Hudson River Railroad]], devised a plan to earn profit from air rights. At first, the railroad simply constructed a platform above the rail yards to allow for the development of buildings overhead. By 1954, the railroad began to realize it could sell more air rights and Grand Central Terminal was proposed to be replaced by a 50-story tower. This is how the [[MetLife Building|Pan Am Building]] came to be built next to the station, after public protest regarding the demolition of Grand Central Terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |title=Grand Central Terminal; The 23-Story, Beaux-Arts 1913 Tower That Wasn't |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 11, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/realestate/streetscapes-grand-central-terminal-23-story-beaux-arts-1913-tower-that-wasn-t.html |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been used in Chicago since the construction of the [[One Prudential Plaza|Prudential Building]] in 1955 above active railroad tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Dedicate New Prudential 41 Story Building |last=Fuller|first=Ernest |date=December 9, 1955 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1955/12/09/page/13/article/dedicate-new-prudential-41-story-building |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, to the west of the Chicago River, [[River Point]] and [[150 North Riverside]] were built above tracks leading to the Amtrak station.

Building on platforms over railroad tracks is still potentially very profitable. In the mid-2000s, New York's [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) attempted to sell air rights to the [[New York Jets]] so that they could build the [[West Side Stadium]] over Manhattan's [[West Side Yard]], near [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], as part of the [[Hudson Yards Redevelopment]]. The [[Hudson Yards (development)|Hudson Yards mega-development]] was eventually built over the rail yard. In Brooklyn, the [[Barclays Center]] and [[Pacific Park, Brooklyn|Pacific Park]] have been constructed over Atlantic Yards.

== Roads and air rights ==
Similar to railroads, builders of [[highway]]s have proposed selling their air rights; [[Boston]] did this in connection with the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCown |first=James |date=September 4, 2002 |title=Boston Air Rights |journal=Architecture Week |volume=113 |issue=4 |url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0904/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles|city of Los Angeles]] funded a $100,000 feasibility study [[RFP]] in January 2007 to explore building a freeway cap park in [[Hollywood]].  The park would be built above [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US highway 101]] and contain {{convert|24|acre|m2}} of new parkland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodfreewaycentralpark.org/ » Community-Wide Hollywood Central Park Meeting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air rights in development ==
The owner of the land has the exclusive development rights in the 'space' above his lands. Under common law, building a 'hangover' that breaks the vertical plane of a neighbor's property is a trespass and the property owner has the right to remove the offending structure. The airspace is property and retains developmental rights which can be sold or transferred. Thus in a dense downtown area, each building in the area may have the right to thirty-five stories of airspace above his own property. The owners of an older building of only three stories high could make a great deal of money by selling their building and allowing a thirty-five-story skyscraper to be built in its place. For example, a skyscraper developer may purchase the unused airspace from an adjacent landowner in order to develop a broader building. In November 2005, Christ Church in New York sold its vertical development rights for a record $430 per square foot, making more than $30 million on the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bagli |first=Charles V. |title=$430 a Square Foot, for Air?

The '''American rule''' (capitalized as '''American Rule''' in some jurisdictions) is a legal rule controlling assessment of [[attorneys' fees]] arising out of [[litigation]]. The American rule provides that each party is responsible for paying its own attorney's fees,&lt;ref&gt;''Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society'', {{ussc|421|240|1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frcp54"&gt;See {{cite web|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 54. Judgment; Costs|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_54|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless specific authority granted by [[statute]] or [[contract]] allows the assessment of those fees against the other party.  The American rule contrasts with the [[English rule (attorney's fees)|English rule]], under which the losing party pays the prevailing party's attorneys' fees.

==Exceptions==

The American rule is merely a default rule, not the blanket rule in the United States. Many statutes at both the federal and state levels allow the winner to recover reasonable attorney's fees, and there are two major exceptions in federal case law as well.&lt;ref&gt;see Henry Cohen, "Awards of Attorneys' Fees by Federal Courts and Federal Agencies," in {{cite book|last1=Capiscio|first1=Mary V.|title=Awards of Attorneys Fees by Federal Courts, Federal Agencies and Selected Foreign Findings|date=2002|publisher=Novinka Books|location=New York|isbn=1590332466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9oW90RSR7wC|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] 54(d)(1),&lt;ref name="frcp54"/&gt; federal statutes may supersede the default rule of not awarding attorney fees. The [[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]] is one such federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=12 Reasons to Love the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act|journal=Journal of Texas Consumer Law|date=2008|volume=11|page=127|url=http://www.jtexconsumerlaw.com/V11N3/JCCL_Magnuson.pdf|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states also have exceptions to the American rule in both statutes and case law. For example, in [[California]], the [[California Consumers Legal Remedies Act|Consumers Legal Remedies Act]] allows plaintiffs to recover attorney's fees,&lt;ref&gt;See subsection (e), {{cite web|title=California Civil Code, Sec. 1780|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;chapter=4.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.5.|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[insurance bad faith]] cases, a policyholder may be able to recover attorney's fees as a separate component of damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brandt v. Superior Court, 693 P. 2d 796, 37 Cal. 3d 813, 210 Cal. Rptr. 211 (1985)|url=http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C3/37C3d813.htm|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevada Rule of Civil Procedure 68 is unique in that a party who declines a pretrial offer of judgment (essentially a settlement offer) and fails to obtain a better result at trial is liable for all reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the offeror after the time the offer was given.

In May 2017, the state of [[Oklahoma]] unintentionally removed the American rule for all civil cases not involving real property. [[Oklahoma House of Representatives|House]] Bill 1470 was originally intended to increase the age at which victims of child sexual abuse could sue their abusers from 20 to 45. An amendment removing the American rule was added before the bill passed both houses of the legislature and was signed into law by Governor [[Mary Fallin]]. According to the original author of the [[Oklahoma Senate|Senate's]] version of the bill, the amendment was initially believed to apply only to losers of civil cases involving child sexual abuse, but the scope of the amendment proved far greater than many legislators intended. The new law took effect on November 1, 2017, and a spokesperson for Fallin said that legislators had several options for correcting the apparent error before that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/unsuccessful-civil-cases-could-cost-thousands-more-as-new-law/article_685a39a2-2cdc-5adc-9964-8b6130b965ea.html |title=Unsuccessful civil cases could cost thousands more as new law would make loser pay all attorney fees |first=Barbara |last=Hoberock |newspaper=[[Tulsa World]] |date=May 15, 2017 |accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==

The rationale for the American rule is that people should not be discouraged from seeking redress for perceived wrongs in court or from trying to extend coverage of the law. The rationale continues that society would suffer if a person was unwilling to pursue a meritorious claim merely because that person would have to pay the [[defendant]]'s expenses if they lost.

'''Book of business''' is common parlance in the United States legal services sector and refers to the collection of clients that a [[lawyer]] (usually a partner) has assembled throughout his or her career. It is often used to refer to the valuation of such client following.{{Clarify|date=June 2014}}

Since most U.S. [[law firm]]s are organized as [[limited liability partnerships]] or [[professional corporation]]s, each partner is usually responsible for cultivating his or her own clients in that partner's specific area of focus, e.g. [[litigation]], [[tax]] or [[securities]]. In the competitive legal market, especially in large city markets, partners are evaluated by committees of their fellow partners with assistance of non-legal market and financial professionals both in-house and outside the firm on a yearly basis and set guidelines on billable targets. An [[equity partner]] with a stagnant or declining book of business can be "de-equitized" or demoted from the status of a partner who receives a share of the firm's profits to that of a salaried partner or counsel.

Firms seeking to expand often retain outside legal recruiters and specify the minimum book of business they require for a lateral candidate, usually between $1–$3 million in larger legal markets. When a partner resigns from his or her law firm, [[American Bar Association]] and local bar rules require his or her clients to be notified, giving them a chance to decide whether to follow the lawyer to the new firm, or stay. Given the fierce competition among law firms in the past 20 years, anecdotal reports suggest that partners are informing their clients before handing in their resignations to determine how much of their business is portable.

A [[conflict of interest]] check is also an important step before a book of business can be considered portable.  For example, a partner whose primary clients are insurance policyholders would generally be unable to take most of his book of business to a firm that represents insurers.

A '''casebook''' is a type of [[textbook]] used primarily by students in [[law school]]s.&lt;ref name="ah83"&gt;Wayne L. Anderson and Marilyn J. Headrick, ''The Legal Profession: Is it for you?'' (Cincinnati: Thomson Executive Press, 1996), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than simply laying out the [[legal doctrine]] in a particular area of study, a casebook contains excerpts from [[legal case]]s in which the law of that area was applied.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; It is then up to the student to analyze the language of the case in order to determine what rule was applied and how the [[court]] applied it.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt;  Casebooks sometimes also contain excerpts from [[law review]] articles and [[legal treatise]]s,  historical notes, editorial commentary, and other related materials to provide background for the cases.

The teaching style based on casebooks is known as the [[casebook method]] and is supposed to instill in law students how to "think like a [[lawyer]]."&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; The casebook method is most often used in law schools in countries with [[common law]] [[legal systems of the world|legal systems]], where [[case law]] is a major [[source of law]].

Most casebooks are authored by law [[professors]], usually with two, three, or four authors, at least one of whom will be a professor at the top of his or her field in the area under discussion. New editions of casebooks often retain the names of famous professors on their covers decades after those professors have died. Updating of the books, then, falls on the shoulders of a younger generation of their colleagues. Such casebooks are often known by the names of the leading professor authors, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Prosser]], Wade, &amp; Schwartz's, ''[[Torts]]: Cases &amp; Materials'' (now in a 13th edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The leading publishers of casebooks in the United States are [[Thomson West]] (publisher of the Foundation Press and American Casebook Series imprints), [[Aspen Publishing]], and [[LexisNexis]]. Each of these publishers uses a quickly identifiable color and pattern for their book covers across all subjects.  Traditionally, the covers of casebooks come in the colors red, blue, or brown,&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; although West's American Casebook Series has switched to faded black cloth as an environmental move.

The prevalence of the casebook method in American law schools has given rise to a market for commercial study aids "keyed" to a particular casebook edition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; These study aids are generally summaries ("[[Brief (law)|briefs]]") of the cases from the casebook to which it is "keyed," presenting them in the same order as the casebook. Often written by the same author who wrote the associated casebook, and published by the same company, "keyed" study aids are useful in distilling cases down to [[Black letter law|black-letter law]]. Popular study aid product lines include Legalines, High Court Case Summaries, and Gilbert Law Summaries published by West Thomson Reuters, Casenotes Legal Briefs by Aspen, and the Understanding series and Q&amp;A series by LexisNexis.

'''Clandestine chemistry''' is [[chemistry]] carried out in secret, and particularly in [[Illegal drug trade|illegal drug]] [[Laboratory|laboratories]]. Larger labs are usually run by [[gang]]s or [[organized crime]] intending to produce for distribution on the black market. Smaller labs can be run by individual chemists working clandestinely in order to synthesize smaller amounts of controlled substances or simply out of a hobbyist interest in chemistry, often because of the difficulty in ascertaining the purity of other, illegally synthesized drugs obtained on the [[Underground economy|black market]]. The term ''clandestine lab'' is generally used in any situation involving the production of illicit compounds, regardless of whether the facilities being used qualify as a true laboratory.

==History==
Ancient forms of clandestine chemistry included the manufacturing of explosives.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Another old form of clandestine chemistry is the illegal [[brewing]] and [[distillation]] of [[alcohol]]. This is frequently done to avoid taxation on spirits.

From [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|1919]] to [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|1933]], the United States [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibited the sale, manufacture, or transportation of alcoholic beverages]]. This opened a door for brewers to supply their own town with alcohol. Just like modern-day drug labs, distilleries were placed in [[rural]] areas. The term ''[[moonshine]]'' generally referred to "corn whiskey", that is, a [[whiskey]]-like liquor made from [[maize|corn]]. Today, American-made corn whiskey can be labeled or sold under [[corn whiskey|that name]], or as [[bourbon whiskey|Bourbon]] or [[Tennessee whiskey]], depending on the details of the production process.

==Precursor chemicals==
Prepared substances (as opposed to those that occur naturally in a consumable form, such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[psilocybin mushrooms]]) require [[reagents]]. Some drugs, like cocaine and morphine, are extracted from plant sources and refined with the aid of chemicals. Semi-synthetic drugs such as [[heroin]] are made starting from [[alkaloid]]s extracted from plant sources which are the precursors for further synthesis. In the case of heroin, a mixture of alkaloids is extracted from the [[opium poppy]] (''Papaver somniferum'') by incising its seed capsule, whereupon a milky fluid (the opium 'latex') bleeds out of the incisions which is then left to dry out and scraped off the bulbs, yielding raw opium. Morphine, one of many alkaloids in opium, is then extracted out of the opium by [[acid-base extraction]] and turned into heroin by reacting it with [[acetic anhydride]]. Other drugs (such as [[methamphetamine]] and [[MDMA]]) are normally made from commercially available chemicals, though both can also be made from naturally occurring precursors. [[Methamphetamine]] can also be made from [[ephedrine]], one of the naturally occurring alkaloids in [[ephedra]] (''Ephedra sinica''). MDMA can be made from [[safrole]], the major constituent of several etheric oils like sassafras. Governments have adopted a strategy of chemical control as part of their overall drug control and enforcement plans. Chemical control offers a means of attacking illicit drug production and disrupting the process before the drugs have entered the market.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Because many legitimate industrial chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia and iodine are also necessary in the processing and synthesis of most illicitly produced drugs, preventing the diversion of these chemicals from legitimate commerce to illicit drug manufacturing is a difficult job. Governments often place restrictions on the purchase of large quantities of chemicals that can be used in the production of illicit drugs, usually requiring licenses or permits to ensure that the purchaser has a legitimate need for them.

==Suppliers of precursor chemicals==
Chemicals critical to the production of cocaine, heroin, and synthetic drugs are produced in many countries throughout the world. Many manufacturers and suppliers exist in Europe, China, India, the United States, and a host of other countries.

Historically, chemicals critical to the synthesis or manufacture of illicit drugs are introduced into various venues via legitimate purchases by companies that are registered and licensed to do business as chemical importers or handlers. Once in a country or state, the chemicals are diverted by rogue importers or chemical companies, by criminal organizations and individual violators, or acquired as a result of coercion and/or theft on the part of drug traffickers. In response to stricter international controls, drug traffickers have increasingly been forced to divert chemicals by mislabeling the containers, forging documents, establishing front companies, using circuitous routing, hijacking shipments, bribing officials, or smuggling products across international borders.

==Enforcement of controls on precursor chemicals==

===General===
The Multilateral Chemical Reporting Initiative encourages governments to exchange information on a voluntary basis in order to monitor international chemical shipments.&lt;ref name="INCB1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Board|first1=INCB - International Narcotics Control|title=Precursors and chemicals frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances : report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 1997 on the implementation of Article 12 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988.|date=1998|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|isbn=92-1-148105-8|pages=8–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3PCAwn7oS0C&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–9}} Over the past decade, key international bodies like the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the U.N. General Assembly's Special Session (UNGASS) have addressed the issue of chemical diversion in conjunction with U.S. efforts.&lt;ref name="INCB1998"/&gt;{{rp|9, 67–74}} These organizations raised specific concerns about [[potassium permanganate]] and acetic anhydride.&lt;ref name="World2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=UNITED NATIONS OFFICE ON DRUGS AND CRIME Vienna|title=World Drug Report 2014|date=2014|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|isbn=978-92-1-148277-5|pages=xiv, 68|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr2014/World_Drug_Report_2014_web.pdf|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate the international flow of information about precursor chemicals, the United States, through its relationship with the Inter-American Drug Control Abuse Commission (CICAD), continues to evaluate the use of precursor chemicals and assist countries in strengthening controls.&lt;ref name="INCB1998"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Many nations still lack the capacity to determine whether the import or export of precursor chemicals is related to legitimate needs or illicit drugs. The problem is complicated by the fact that many chemical shipments are either brokered or transshipped through third countries in an attempt to disguise their purpose or destination.&lt;ref name="UNStrategy2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Drug Control Strategy: 2000 Annual Report|date=2000|publisher=White House, Office of National Drug Control Policy|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in July 2001, the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) has opted to organize an international conference with the goal of devising a specific action plan to counter the traffic in MDMA precursor chemicals.&lt;ref name="Report2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=REPORT  2015 International Narcotics Control Board|title=Report  2015|date=2 March 2016|publisher=United Nations|url=https://www.incb.org/documents/Publications/AnnualReports/AR2015/English/AR_2015_E.pdf|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}} They hope to prevent the diversion of chemicals used in the production of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), including [[MDMA]] (ecstasy) and [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref name="Report2015"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

In June 2015, the European Commission approved Regulation (EU) 2015/1013 which outlined for the monitoring of drug precursors traded between the Union and third countries. The Regulation also establishes uniform procedures for licensing and registration of operators and users who are listed in a European database tracking drug precursors.&lt;ref name="Report2015"/&gt;{{rp|88}}

Despite this long history of law enforcement actions, restrictions of chemicals, and even covert military actions, many illicit drugs are still widely available all over the world.

===Cocaine===
Operation Purple is a U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] driven international chemical control initiative designed to reduce the illicit manufacture of [[cocaine]] in the Andean Region, identifying rogue firms and suspect individuals; gathering intelligence on diversion methods, trafficking trends, and shipping routes; and taking administrative, civil and/or criminal action as appropriate. Critical to the success of this operation is the communication network that gives notification of shipments and provides the government of the importer sufficient time to verify the legitimacy of the transaction and take appropriate action. The effects of this initiative have been dramatic and far-reaching. Operation Purple has exposed a significant vulnerability among traffickers, and has grown to include almost thirty nations. According to the DEA, Operation Purple has been highly effective at interfering with cocaine production. However, illicit chemists always find new methods to evade the DEA's scrutiny.

In countries where strict chemical controls have been put in place, illicit drug production has been seriously affected. For example, few of the chemicals needed to process coca leaf into cocaine are manufactured in Bolivia or Peru. Most are smuggled in from neighbouring countries with advanced chemical industries or diverted from a smaller number of licit handlers. Increased interdiction of chemicals in Peru and Bolivia has contributed to final product cocaine from those countries being of lower, minimally oxidized quality.

As a result, Bolivian lab operators are now using inferior substitutes such as cement instead of lime and [[sodium bicarbonate]] instead of [[ammonia]] and recycled solvents like ether. Some non-solvent fuels such as [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]] and [[diesel fuel]] are even used in place of solvents. 
Manufacturers are attempting to streamline a production process that virtually eliminates oxidation to produce cocaine base. Some laboratories are not using sulfuric acid during the maceration state; consequently, less cocaine alkaloid is extracted from the leaf, producing less cocaine hydrochloride, the powdered cocaine marketed for overseas consumption.

===Heroin===
Similarly, heroin-producing countries depend on supplies of [[acetic anhydride]] (AA) from the international market. This heroin precursor continues to account for the largest volume of internationally seized chemicals, according to the International Narcotics Control Board. Since July 1999, there have been several notable seizures of acetic anhydride in Turkey (amounting to nearly seventeen metric tons) and Turkmenistan (totaling seventy-three metric tons).

Acetic anhydride, the most commonly used chemical agent in [[heroin]] processing, is virtually irreplaceable. According to the DEA, Mexico remains the only heroin source route to heroin laboratories in Afghanistan. Authorities in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan routinely seize ton-quantity shipments of diverted acetic anhydride.

The lack of acetic anhydride has caused clandestine chemists in some countries to substitute it for lower quality precursors such as [[acetic acid]] and results in the formation of impure [[black tar heroin]] that contains a mixture of drugs not found in heroin made with pure chemicals.

DEA's Operation Topaz is a coordinated international strategy targeting acetic anhydride. In place since March 2001, a total of thirty-one countries are currently organized participants in the program in addition to regional participants. The DEA reports that as of June 2001, some 125 consignments of acetic anhydride had been tracked totaling 618,902,223 kilograms. As of July 2001, there has been approximately 20 shipments of AA totaling 185,000 kilograms either stopped or seized.

===Amphetamines===

The practice of clandestine chemistry to synthesize [[controlled substance]] analogues and circumvent drug laws was first noticed in the late 1960s, as types of drugs became [[controlled substance]]s in many countries.&lt;ref name="Karch"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karch|first1=Steven B.|title=Drug abuse handbook|date=2006|publisher=CRC/Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9780849316906|page=4|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFbm2SRUUNsC&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Title 21 United States Code (USC) Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of October 27, 1970 [[amphetamines]] became controlled substances in the United States.&lt;ref name="Controlled Substances Act"&gt;{{cite web | title=Controlled Substances Act | url=http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/ucm148726.htm | work=United States Food and Drug Administration | date=11 June 2009 | accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleiman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleiman|first1=Mark A.R.|last2=Hawdon|first2=James E.|title=Encyclopedia of drug policy|date=2011|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=978-1412976954|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OePnCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT113|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bzptablet.jpg|right|thumb|An impure tablet sold as MDMA seized by law enforcement in the United States. The tablet was determined to contain no MDMA; instead, it contained a mixture of [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[caffeine]].]]
As of the early 1990s, [[methamphetamine]] use was concentrated among young white males in California and nearby states. Since then its use has spread both demographically and geographically.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobkin|first1=Carlos|last2=Nicosia|first2=Nancy|title=The War on Drugs: Methamphetamine, Public Health, and Crime|journal=American Economic Review|date=February 2009|volume=99|issue=1|pages=324–349|doi=10.1257/aer.99.1.324|pmc=2883188|pmid=20543969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Methamphetamine has been a favorite among various populations including [[biker gang|motorcycle gangs]],&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt; truckers,&lt;ref name="Garriott"/&gt; laborers, soldiers, and [[rave]]rs.&lt;ref name="Pine"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cansler|first1=Clay|first2=Jason|last2=Pine|title=Making sense of making meth|journal=Distillations|date=2015|volume=1|issue=4|pages=36–39 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/making-sense-of-making-meth|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as a "[[club drug]]", the National Institute on Drug Abuse tracks its incidence of use in children as young as twelve, and the prevalence of users increases with age.&lt;ref name="Club"&gt;{{cite web|title=Club Drugs|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/club-drugs|website=National Institute on Drug Abuse|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and early 1990s, most methamphetamine production in the United States occurred in small independent laboratories.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt; [[Phenylacetone]], one precursor of methamphetamine, became a [[List of Schedule II drugs (US)|Schedule II controlled immediate precursor]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS  BOARD OF PHARMACY  PHARMACY – CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES|url=http://w3.lara.state.mi.us/orrsearch/1478_2014-140LR_AdminCode.pdf|website=Michigan.gov|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Underground [[chemist]]s searched for alternative methods for producing methamphetamine. The two predominant methods which appeared both involve the reduction of [[ephedrine]] or [[pseudoephedrine]] to methamphetamine.&lt;ref name="Wallach"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallach|first1=Jason|title=A Comprehensive Guide to the Clandestine Chemistry of 'Breaking Bad'|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-clandestine-chemistry-of-breaking-bad|website=Motherboard|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, neither was a [[watched chemical]], and pills containing the substance could be bought by the thousands without raising any kind of suspicion.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt;

In the 1990s, the DEA recognized that legally imported precursors were being diverted to the production of methamphetamine.  Changes to federal regulations in 1988 and throughout the 1990s enabled the DEA to more closely track the  ephedrine and pseudoephedrine precursors.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt; Many individual States have enacted precursor control laws which limit the sale of over-the-counter cold medications which contain ephedrine or pseudoephedrine.&lt;ref name="NAMSDL"&gt;{{cite web|title=States That Schedule Ephedrine|url=http://www.namsdl.org/library/80C5FDEA-1C23-D4F9-74225C89E6806A41/|website=THE NATIONAL ALLI ANCE FOR MODEL STATE DRUG LAWS|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it somewhat more difficult for underground chemists to produce methamphetamine.  In May 1995, the DEA shut down two major suppliers of precursors in the United States, seizing 25 metric tons of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine from Clifton Pharmaceuticals and 500 cases of pseudoephedrine from X-Pressive Looks, Inc. (XLI).  The immediate market impact suggests that they had been providing more than 50 percent of the precursors used nationally to produce methamphetamine. However, the market rapidly rebounded.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt;

The methamphetamine situation also changed in the mid-1990s as Mexican organized crime became a major player in its production and distribution, operating "super-labs" which produced a substantial percentage of the drugs being sold.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt; According to the DEA, the seizure of 3.5 metric tons of [[pseudoephedrine]] in Texas in 1994 revealed that Mexican trafficking groups were producing methamphetamine on an unprecedented scale.&lt;ref name="NDCP2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on Programs and Initiatives  6. REDUCING THE SUPPLY OF ILLEGAL DRUGS|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/ondcppubs/publications/policy/ndcs01/chap3_6.html|website=The National Drug Control Strategy: 2001 Annual Report|publisher=Office of National Drug Control Policy|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent reports indicate an ongoing presence of Mexican trafficking.&lt;ref name="NDIC2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Methamphetamine Threat Assessment 2008|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs26/26594/strat.htm|website=National Drug Intelligence Center|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the prevalence of domestic meth labs continues to be high in western states, they have spread throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="NDCP2001"/&gt; It has been suggested that "do-it-yourself" meth production in rural areas is reflective of a broader DIY approach that includes activities such as hunting, fishing, and fixing one’s cars, trucks, equipment, and house.&lt;ref name="Pine"/&gt; Toxic chemicals resulting from methamphetamine production may be hoarded or clandestinely dumped, damaging land, water, plant life and wild life, and posing a risk to humans.&lt;ref name="NDCP2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pine"/&gt;  Waste from methamphetamine labs is frequently dumped on federal, public, and tribal lands. The chemicals involved can explode and clandestine chemistry has been implicated in both house and wild land fires.&lt;ref name="NDCP2001"/&gt;

Statistics reporting the prevalence of meth labs and arrest of meth producers can vary greatly from county to county and state to state. Factors affecting policing and reporting include funding, specialized training, support from local residents, willingness to make the issue a priority in policing. How information is categorized and tracked may also inflate or minimize the apparent results. [[Missouri]], which has tended to report some of the highest numbers of meth-lab arrests in the country, has pursued an aggressive and highly publicized policing policy, resulting in as many as 205 cases a year in one county.&lt;ref name="Pine"/&gt; In contrast, [[West Virginia]] tends to report and prosecute very few cases, possibly because there the agency that reports a meth lab is held responsible for paying for its cleanup. Cleanup of toxic and hazardous materials at a single site may cost tens of thousands of dollars. This is a disincentive for agencies with limited budgets.&lt;ref name="Garriott"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garriott|first1=William|title=Policing methamphetamine : narcopolitics in rural America|date=2011|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814732403|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michigan]] reported an increase in incidents in 2016, following the formation of the Midland County Methamphetamine Protocol Team in 2015.

[[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] El Paso Intelligence Center data is showing a downward trend in the number of clandestine drug labs seized for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine down from a high of 15,196 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Methamphetamine Lab Incidents, 2004-2014|url=https://www.dea.gov/resource-center/meth-lab-maps.shtml|accessdate=10 January 2017|work=DEA Drug Enforcement Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seizures"&gt;{{cite news|title=Meth lab seizures down in 2012|url=http://www.twincities.com/2013/09/11/apnewsbreak-meth-lab-seizures-down-in-2012/amp/|accessdate=10 January 2017|work=Pioneer Press|date=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug seizure quantities, on the other hand, are steadily increasing since 2007, according to data from the DEA's System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) (see table to the right). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=71|author=PARLIAMENT OF VICTORIA LAW REFORM, DRUGS AND CRIME PREVENTION COMMITTEE|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1433_inquiry.pdf|website=Law Reform, Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee|publisher=Melbourne, Victoria|date=2014|title=INQUIRY INTO THE SUPPLY AND USE OF METHAMPHETAMINES, PARTICULARLY ICE, IN VICTORIA Final Report }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleanup===
Clean up processes were regulated by the EPA as of 2007.&lt;ref name="Cleanup"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntary Guidelines for Methamphetamine Laboratory Cleanup|url=https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/voluntary-guidelines-methamphetamine-laboratory-cleanup|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2007 required EPA to develop guidelines for remediation of former methamphetamine labs. This creates guidelines for States and local agencies to improve "our national understanding of identifying the point at which former methamphetamine laboratories become clean enough to inhabit again." The legislation also required that EPA periodically update the guidelines, as appropriate, to reflect the best available knowledge and research.
 		
Making a former meth lab site safer for habitation requires two basic efforts:
 		
Gross chemical removal: This is the process in which law enforcement or a Drug Enforcement Administration contractors removes the obvious dangers from the site. Obvious dangers include containers of chemicals, equipment, and apparatus that could be used to make illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, and other illegal items. This process does not cleanup or remove chemical spills, stains or residue that could be harmful to inhabitants. A property that has had only a gross chemical removal is not fit for habitation. 
 		
Clandestine Remediation: The cleaning of interior structures and, if applicable, the surrounding land, surface waters and groundwater by an EPA approved or National Crime Scene Clean Up Association certified company. This is the process of removing the residue and waste from the site after the gross chemical removal is done. A property that has been re-mediated should present minimal to no health risk to occupants.

==Explosives==
Clandestine chemistry is not limited to [[recreational drug use|drugs]]; it is also associated with [[explosives]], and other illegal chemicals. Of the explosives manufactured illegally, [[nitroglycerin]] and [[acetone peroxide]] are easiest to produce due to the ease with which the precursors can be acquired.

[[Uncle Fester (author)|Uncle Fester]] is a writer who commonly writes about different aspects of clandestine chemistry. ''Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture'' is among one of his most popular books, and is considered required reading for DEA Agents. More of his books deal with other aspects of clandestine chemistry, including explosives, and poisons. Fester is, however, considered by many to be a faulty and unreliable source for information in regard to the clandestine manufacture of chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[File:Old woman draught at Ratcliffe Highway.png|thumb|250px|right|Punishing a common scold in the [[ducking stool]]]]

In the [[common law]] of [[criminal law|crime]] in [[England and Wales]], a '''common [[wiktionary:scold|scold]]''' was a type of public nuisance—a troublesome and angry person who broke the public peace by habitually chastising, arguing and quarrelling with their neighbours. The majority of individuals punished for scolding were women, though men could also be labelled scolds. 

The offence, which was exported to North America with the colonists, was punished by monetary fines, but also by methods intended to publicly humiliate such as [[cucking stool|ducking]]: being placed in a chair and submerged in a river or pond. Although rarely prosecuted it remained on the [[statute book]]s in England and Wales until 1967.

==The offence and its punishment==

=== Medieval England ===
The offence of scolding developed from the late middle ages in England. It has been suggested that attempts to control and punish 'bad speech' increased after the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]], when demographic shift led to greater resistance and threats to the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardsley|first=Sandy|date=2006|title=Sin, Speech and Scolding in Late Medieval England|url=|journal=Fama: The Politics of Talk and Reputation in Medieval Europe, ed. Thelma Fenster and Daniel Lord Smail|volume=|pages=146-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included prosecutions for scolding. Scolds were described using a number of Latin terms, including ''objurgator, garulator, rixator'' and ''litigator'', found in both masculine and feminine forms in medieval legal records and all referring to negative forms of speech, chatter, quarrelling or reproachment. Scolding offences were commonly presented and punished in [[Manorial court|manorial]] and borough courts that governed the behaviour of peasants and townspeople across England. Scolds were also presented in church courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=Jones|first=Karen|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=104-106|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common punishment was a monetary fine.

Various historians have argued that scolding and bad speech were coded as feminine offences by the late medieval period. Women of all marital statuses were prosecuted for scolding, though married women featured most frequently, while widows were rarely labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=123-125|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places, such as Exeter, scolds were typically poorer women, whereas elsewhere scolds could include members of the local elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=135-136|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who were also charged with other offences, such as violence, nightwandering, eavesdropping or sexual impropriety were also likely to be labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=137|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals were frequently labelled 'common scolds', indicating the impact of their behaviour and speech on the whole community. Karen Jones identified 13 men prosecuted for scolding in Kent's secular courts, compared to 94 women and 2 couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=1939-|first=Jones, Karen,|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=108|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men accused of scolding were often charged alongside their wives. Helen, wife of Peter Bradwall scolded Hugh Welesson and Isabel, his wife, in Middlewich in 1434, calling Isabel a "child murderer" and Hugh a "skallet [wretched] knave". Isabel and Hugh also scolded Helen, calling her a "lesyng blebberer" (lying bletherer). All parties were fined for the offences, though Hugh and Isabel were fined jointly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=102|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like women, male scolds were often accused of many other offences, such as fornication, theft, illegal trading, and assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=103|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later punishments of scolding ===
Later legal treatises reflected the dominance of scolding as a female offence. In the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]] says of this offence:

{{quote|text=Lastly, a common scold, {{lang|la|communis rixatrix}}, (for our law-latin confines it to the feminine gender) is a public nuisance to her neighbourhood. For which offence she may be indicted; and, if convicted, shall be sentenced to be placed in a certain engine of correction called the trebucket, castigatory, or cucking stool, which in the Saxon language signifies the scolding stool; though now it is frequently corrupted into ducking stool, because the residue of the judgment is, that, when she is so placed therein, she shall be plunged in the water for her punishment.|sign=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Bl. Comm.]] IV:13.5.8, p. *169}} 
[[Image:The Branks from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896) - 02.jpg|thumb|right|Scold's bridles or branks were probably used as a punishment but no official records of their use have been found.]]
The prescribed penalty for this offence involved dunking the convicted offender in water in an instrument called the "[[cucking stool]]".  The cucking stool, according to Blackstone, eventually became known as a ''ducking stool'' by [[folk etymology]].

Other writers disagree with Blackstone's assertion equating the two sorts of punishment seat.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' notes the use of a cucking stool at [[Chester]], a seat also known as {{lang|la|cathedra stercoris}}, a "dung chair", whose punishment apparently involved exposing the sitter's buttocks to onlookers.  This seat served to punish not only scolds, but also brewers and bakers who sold bad ale or bread, whereas the ducking stool dunked its victim into the water. [[Francois Maximilian Misson]], a French traveller and writer, recorded the method used in England in the early 18th century:&lt;ref name="AME"&gt;{{cite book |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |chapter=The Ducking Stool |author=Alice Morse Earle |year=1896 |url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |accessdate=18 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117004233/http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |archivedate=17 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The way of punishing scolding women is pleasant enough. They fasten an armchair to the end of two beams twelve or fifteen feet long, and parallel to each other, so that these two pieces of wood with their two ends embrace the chair, which hangs between them by a sort of axle, by which means it plays freely, and always remains in the natural horizontal position in which a chair should be, that a person may sit conveniently in it, whether you raise it or let it down. They set up a post on the bank of a pond or river, and over this post they lay, almost in equilibrio, the two pieces of wood, at one end of which the chair hangs just over the water. They place the woman in this chair and so plunge her into the water as often as the sentence directs, in order to cool her immoderate heat.}}

The ducking stool, rather than being fixed in position by the river or pond, could be mounted on wheels to allow the convicted woman to be paraded through the streets before punishment was carried out. Another method of ducking was to use the tumbrel, which consisted of a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This would be pushed into the ducking pond and the shafts would be released, tipping the chair up backwards and ducking the occupant.&lt;ref name="ne"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Ducking and Cucking Stools |volume=8 |page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[scold's bridle]], known in Scotland as a brank, consists of a locking metal mask or [[head cage]] that contains a tab that fits in the mouth to inhibit talking. Some have claimed that convicted common scolds had to wear such a device as a preventive or punitive measure. Legal sources do not mention them in the context of the punishment of common scolds, but there are anecdotal reports of their historical use as a public punishment.&lt;ref name="Dugdale"&gt;{{cite book|title=England and Wales Delineated: Historical, Entertaining &amp; Commercial|author=Thomas Dugdale, William Burnett|year=1860|pages=1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LandC"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire|author=Frederick W. Fairholt|title=On a Grotesque Mask of Punishment Obtained in the Castle of Nuremberg|publisher=J.H. Parker for the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire|location= 377, Strand. London|year=1855|pages=62–64|volume=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 17th-century [[New England]] and [[Long Island]], scolds or those convicted of similar offences—both men and women—could be sentenced to stand with their tongue in a cleft stick, a more primitive but easier-to-construct version of the scold's bridle,&lt;ref name="AME2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days|chapter=Branks and gags|author=Alice Morse Earle|year=1896|url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-8.html|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ducking stool also made the trip across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="AME" /&gt;

==Historical prosecutions==
[[Image:The Ducking-Stool from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896).jpg|right|thumb|This [[woodcut]] shows the wheels on the ducking stool which allowed the occupant to be wheeled through the streets before being ducked.]]

A plaque on the Fye Bridge in [[Norwich]], England claims to mark the site of a "cucking" stool, and that from 1562–1597 "[[strumpet]]s" and common scolds suffered the punishment of dunking there.  In the ''Percy Anecdotes'', published pseudonymously by [[Thomas Byerley (journalist)|Thomas Byerley]] and [[Joseph Clinton Robertson]] in 1821{{ndash}}23, the authors state that "How long the ducking-stool has been in disuse in England does not appear."&lt;ref name="percy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Percy Anecdotes|author=[[Reuben Percy]] and [[Sholto Percy]]|year=1823|publisher=Printed for T. Boys|location=London|url=http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910073842/http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|archivedate=10 September 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anecdotes'' also suggest [[penology|penological]] ineffectiveness as grounds for the stool's disuse; the text relates the 1681 case of a Mrs. Finch, who according to this account had received three convictions and duckings as a common scold.  On her fourth conviction, the [[King's Bench]] declined to dunk her again, and instead ordered her to pay a fine of three [[mark (money)|marks]], and ordered her imprisoned until payment took place.

The ''Percy Anecdotes'' also quote a pastoral poem by [[John Gay]] (1685{{ndash}}1732), who wrote that:

{{poemquote|I'll speed me to the pond, where the high stool
On the long plank, hangs o'er the muddy pool,
That stool the dread of ev'ry scolding quean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?textsid=33871 |title=The Shepherd's Week : Wednesday; or, The Dumps |author=John Gay |date=1714 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and a 1780 poem by [[Benjamin West]], who wrote that:

{{poemquote|There stands, my friend, in yonder pool,
An engine call'd a ducking-stool;
By legal pow'r commanded down,
The joy and terror of the town.
If jarring females kindle strife...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34005/34005-h/34005-h.htm#Page_11 |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |author=Alice Morse Earle |website=Project Gutenberg |date=1896 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While these literary sources do not prove that the punishment still took place, they do provide evidence that it had not been forgotten.

In ''The Queen v. Foxby'', 6 Mod. 11 (1704), counsel for the accused stated that he knew of no law for the dunking of scolds.  Lord Chief Justice [[John Holt (judge)|John Holt]] of the Queen's Bench apparently pronounced this error, for he announced that it was "better ducking in a [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]], than a [[Michaelmas]] [[quarter Sessions|term]]", i.e. better carried out in summer than in winter.  The tenor of Holt's remarks however suggests that he found the punishment an antiquarian curiosity and something of a joke.&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs19.html|title=The Founders Constitution:Volume 5, Amendment VIII, Document 19|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last recorded uses of the stool for ducking involve a Mrs. Ganble at [[Plymouth]] (1808) and Jenny Pipes, a notorious scold from  [[Leominster]] (1809). In 1817 Sarah Leeke, also from Leominster was sentenced to be ducked but the water in the pond was so low that the authorities merely wheeled her round the town in the chair.&lt;ref name="ne" /&gt;

The English common law as received by the law of the United States included the offence of being a common scold.  In 1829, a Washington, D.C. court found the American [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] writer [[Anne Royall]] guilty of being a common scold, the outcome of a campaign launched against her by local clergymen.  Despite the construction of the traditional engine of punishment by sailors at the Navy Yard, the court ruled the punishment of the cucking-stool obsolete, and instead improvised a fine of ten dollars.&lt;ref name="LC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0001/royall.html|title=An Uncommon Scold|publisher=Library of Congress|author=Cynthia Earman|date=January 2001|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status of the law==
In England and Wales, the only part of the United Kingdom where the law had any effect, no prosecutions of common scolds occurred for a considerable period.{{vague|date=November 2017}} Counsel in ''Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1962] AC 528 described the offence as "obsolete", and section 13(1)(a) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] eventually abolished it.

The common law offence of being a common scold was extant in New Jersey until struck down in 1972 by Circuit Judge McCann who found it had been subsumed in the provisions of the Disorderly Conduct Act of 1898, was bad for vagueness and offended the [[14th Amendment to the US Constitution]] for sex discrimination. Long before this decision, the punishment of ducking, together with all other forms of corporeal punishment, had become unlawful under the provisions of the [[New Jersey Constitution of 1844]] or even as early as 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=State of New Jersey v. Marion Palendrano |vol= 120 N.J. Super. 336 (1972)|reporter= |opinion= McCann JCC|court= Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division (Criminal)|date= 13 July 1972|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-published/1972/120-n-j-super-336-0.html |accessdate=28 May 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, many states have laws restricting public [[profanity]], excessive [[noise (environmental)|noise]], and [[disorderly conduct]]. None of these laws carry the distinctive punishment originally reserved for the common scold, nor are they gender-specific as the common scold offense was.

'''Constant visual observation''', often abbreviated to "constant visual", is a term used in various [[Mental Health]] [[Service (economics)|Services]], [[Prison]]s and [[Special School]]s to describe the status of a prisoner or [[patient]] who poses a threat to himself or a third party, and must therefore be kept under constant observation.

There are essentially two levels of constant visual observations. The highest level, employed only for those patients who are considered to be extremely high risk to either themselves or a third party, involves a care worker remaining within arms reach of the service user at all times. The second level involves only maintaining a constant watch on a patient, sometimes from a distance.

Constant visual observations have been criticised by many service user groups.

'''Consumer Court'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ncdrc.nic.in/ | title=National Consumer Forum India }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the special purpose court, in [[India]], that deals with cases regarding consumer disputes and grievances. These are judiciary hearings set up by the government to protect the consumer rights. Its main function is to maintain the fair practices by the sellers towards consumers. Consumers can file a case against a seller if they are harassed or exploited by sellers. The court will only give a verdict in favour of the consumers/customers if they have proof of exploitation, i.e., bills or other documents. If a consumer does not have the proper documents required for filing a case then it would be very difficult for the consumer to win or even file a case.&lt;ref name="NCDRC Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSUMER PROTECTION AND NATIONAL CONSUMER DISPUTES REDRESSAL COMMISSION|url=http://ncdrc.nic.in/|publisher=NCDRC|accessdate=18 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172525/http://ncdrc.nic.in/|archivedate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consumer movement ==
The consumer movement as a social force originated with the necessity of protecting and promoting the interests of consumers against unethical and unfair trade practices. Rampant food shortages, hoarding, [[black market]]ing, [[adulteration of food]] and [[edible oil]] gave birth to the consumer movement in an organized form in the 1960s.

The movement succeeded in bringing pressure. A major step was taken in 1986 by the [[Govt of India|Indian government]] with the enactment of the [[Consumer Protection Act of 1986]] (COPRA).&lt;ref name="NCDRC Website"/&gt;

== Objectives ==
The main function of consumer court is to provide some extra privilege to the consumers and to maintain fair practice by the seller or the service provider towards the consumer. Submitting complaint is very simple and a consumer has no need to hire any lawyer. Approaching a consumer court is very simple and extremely cheap as you can represent yourself without having to hire a lawyer and not required to pay any court fee but just a nominal fee.&lt;ref name=" NCDRC Website"/&gt;

The '''corporation counsel''' is the title given to the [[chief legal officer]] who handles civil claims against the city in some US municipal and county jurisdictions, including negotiating settlements and defending the city when it is sued. Most corporation counsel do not prosecute criminal cases, but some prosecute traffic and [[local ordinance]] violations. In [[Washington, D.C.]], the former corporation counsel, now known as attorney general, prosecutes [[juvenile delinquency]] cases in addition to traffic and local ordinance violations.

In [[New York City]], the corporation counsel prosecutes juvenile delinquency proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Juvenile Justice in New York City|publisher=Citizens Crime Commission of New York City|date=May 2010|url=http://www.nycrimecommission.org/pdfs/GuideToJuvenileJusticeInNYC.pdf|accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cities of New York and [[Chicago]], among others, use this title. Counties in [[Hawaii]] and [[Wisconsin]] have corporation counsel as well.

In some jurisdictions, such as counties in [[Ohio]], the [[prosecutor|county prosecuting attorney]] is, by law, corporation counsel for the county and other governmental entities in the county.

{{globalize|date=December 2010}}
The '''crime against nature''' or '''unnatural act''' has historically been a legal term in [[English language|English]]-speaking [[State (polity)|states]] identifying forms of [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] not considered [[natural]] or decent and are legally punishable [[offence (law)|offenses]].&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (1753), [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]], Book 4, Chapter 15, Section 4&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual practices that have historically been considered to be "crimes against nature" include [[anal sex]]&lt;ref name="See Rose v 1975"&gt;See Rose v. Locke, 1975, 96 S.Ct. 243, 423 U.S. 48, 46 L.Ed.2d 185.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="Andrews v. Vanduzer 1814"&gt;Andrews v. Vanduzer, [[Supreme Court of New York|N.Y.Sup.]] 1814 (January Term, 1814)(Vanduzer accused Andrews of having had connection with a cow and then a mare and the court understood this to mean that Vanduzer was going around telling others that Andrews had been guilty of the crime against nature with a beast.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and terminology==

For much of modern history, a "crime against nature" was understood by courts to be synonymous to "[[buggery]]", and to include [[anal sex]] (copulation ''per anum'') and [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="See Rose v 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews v. Vanduzer 1814"/&gt; Early court decisions agreed that [[fellatio]] (copulation ''per os'') was not included, though mainly because that practice was virtually unknown when the common-law definition was established (it remained so rare that first attempted fellatio prosecutions under the "crime against nature" statute date to 1817 in England and 1893 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rex v. Samuel Jacobs (1817); Prindle v. State of Texas, 21 S.W. 360 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt;) Likewise, sexual activities between two women were not covered. Over time, particularly starting in the early 20th century, some jurisdictions started enacting statutes or developing precedents the extended the scope of the crime to include fellatio and, sometimes, other sexual activities.

The term ''crime against nature'' is closely related to, and was often used interchangeably with, the term ''[[sodomy]]''. (This varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Sometimes the two terms were understood to be synonymous; sometimes sodomy was limited to sexual activities between two humans;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/oldwiki/images/8/81/Ausman_v._Veal,_10_IN_355.pdf|title=Ausman v. Veal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes sodomy was taken to include anal sex or bestiality, whereas ''crime against nature'' also included fellatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4736&amp;context=jclc|title=The role of common law concepts in modern jurisprudence}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Until the early 19th century, courts were divided on whether the act needed to be completed (to result in ejaculation) in order to be a punishable offense. This question was deemed sufficiently important that, in 1828, English law was explicitly amended to specify that proof of ejaculation was not necessary for convictions for buggery and rape.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American and English Encyclopedia of Law|author= Charles F. Williams|year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crime was not limited to same-sex activities, and, in case of an act between two adults, both participants were guilty, regardless of consent. Attempted or completed act of sodomy, committed by a husband against his wife, was grounds for divorce in common law.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;

Historically, the offense was usually referred to by its longer name, the ''detestable and abominable'' (or ''abominable and detestable'', or, sometimes, ''infamous'') ''crime against nature, committed with mankind or beast''. This phrase originates in [[Buggery Act 1533]], with words "crime against nature" substituted for "vice of buggery" in the original, and it was present in one of these forms in criminal codes of most U.S. states.  Specific acts included under this heading were typically deemed too detestable to list them explicitly, resulting in a number of vagueness-based legal challenges to corresponding statutes. One of the most recent, and one of the rare successful challenges, is the 1971 Florida case of ''[[Franklin v. State]]''. On the other hand, just 7 years prior, a similar challenge (''Perkins v. State''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/234/333/1671292/|title=Perkins v. State of North Carolina, 234 F. Supp. 333 (W.D.N.C. 1964)}}&lt;/ref&gt;) failed in North Carolina. (In ''Perkins'', the Court wrote that, if this were a new statute, it would have been "obviously unconstitutional for vagueness", but, since this was a statute whose history was traceable back to the reign of [[Henry VIII]], it accumulated a number of judicial interpretations, and, backed with these interpretations, it was not unconstitutionally vague.)

Penalties for this offense varied greatly over time and between jurisdictions. Crime against nature remained punishable by death or life imprisonment both in the UK and in many U.S. states well into the 19th century. Liberalization of sexual morals led to reduction of penalties or decriminalization of the offense during the second half of the 20th century, so that, by 2003, it was no longer a punishable offense in 36 out of 50 U.S. states, and was only punishable by a fine in some of the remaining 14. (See [[Sodomy laws in the United States]] for details.)

==Current use==
Currently, the term crime against nature is still used in the [[statutes]] of the following [[United States|American]] states. However, these laws are unconstitutional to enforce for sexual conduct between consenting adults in light of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003). The crime against nature statutes are however still used to criminalize sexual conduct involving minors, [[incest]], public sex, [[prostitution]] and [[bestiality]].

==Repeal and unconstitutionality==
Except for the above nine states, all other states in the United States have repealed their "crimes against nature" laws. Furthermore, in 2003, in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', the US Supreme Court held that nonremunerative sex between consenting adults in private was protected by the Constitution and could not be criminalized under "crimes against nature" laws. Thus, fellatio, cunnilingus and homosexual sex can no longer fall within the scope of such laws.

The '''crumbling skull rule''' is a well-established [[legal doctrine]] used in some [[tort law]] systems.  It holds that where a plaintiff had a condition or injury that predates the tort and would have naturally deteriorated or worsened over time (e.g. a crumbling skull), the defendant is not responsible to the degree that the condition or injury would have naturally worsened over time.  A defendant is only liable for the degree the injury was worsened or the hastening or acceleration of the damage caused by the tort.  The crumbling skull rule should not be confused with the related [[Eggshell skull|thin skull rule]].&lt;ref&gt;''Athey v. Leonati'', [1996] 3 S.C.R. 458, at para. 34-36, online at: http://canlii.ca/t/1fr63&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is sometimes applied without specific reference to the crumbling skull rule, instead being expressed as a non-absolute application of the thin skull rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Kavanagh v Akhtar Matter No Ca 40492/97'', [1998] NSWSC 779, online at: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/779.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Commonwealth v WL McLean: Developments Inconsistent with the Traditional Nature of the Egg Shell Scull Principle |first=Tanya |last=Jones |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JCULawRw/2001/6.pdf |journal=James Cook University Law Review |date= 2001 |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6135">{{Expand German|Tanzverbot|date=November 2012}}
'''Dancing bans''' are legal or religious prohibitions against dancing, which have been applied at various times in various jurisdictions around the world. Even more controversial than recreational or artistic dancing have been sexually suggestive forms such as [[lap dancing]], [[topless dancing]], and [[rave]] dancing.

==Legal bans==
''Tanzverbot'' is the German term for "dancing ban". In Germany and Switzerland, dancing on some holidays is banned by most [[German states|state]] or [[Swiss cantons|canton]] governments. These occasions are certain [[Christianity|Christian]] and secular holidays aimed at mourning or contemplation, such as [[Good Friday]], [[All Saints' Day]] (from its association with [[All Souls' Day]] practices) or memorial days like [[Volkstrauertag]]. The German and Swiss dancing bans prohibit public parties, but not dancing in one's private residence.

Until 1999, an ordinance in [[Pound, Virginia]] required that dance hall permits not be granted "to anyone who is not a proper person, nor to a person who is not a person of good moral character". After community opposition to granting him a permit, a lawsuit by William Elam, owner of the Golden Pine restaurant, resulted in the ordinance being struck down as unconstitutionally vague and infringing on free expression protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. A replacement ordinance drafted more narrowly prompted a 2001 lawsuit from Elam, though the restaurant later went out of business after revocation of its alcohol license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/identity/dance_pound.htm|title=Pound, Virginia Bans Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/z/gpine.htm|title=Part 2: ABC revokes Golden Pine restaurant's license to sell alcohol|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1926, the [[New York City Cabaret Law]] has prohibited dancing in all spaces open to the public that sell food and/or drink with the exception of those who obtain a cabaret license. This law was still enforced until it was repealed in 2017. 

Between 1985 and 2002, a [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] law called the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] enacted strict legal requirements for those wishing to have dancing by youth under the age of 21, effectively banning events that would feature young people dancing.

===Historic bans===
From the 1830s to 1950s, [[play party (U.S. traditional)|play parties]] became popular as a means to circumvent restrictions on dancing.

The events of the [[Footloose (1984 film)|1984 film ''Footloose'']] were inspired by a dancing ban in the heavily [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] town of [[Elmore City, Oklahoma]], which lasted until 1980.
==Religious bans==
===Christianity===
Various Christian groups believe that dancing is either inherently sinful or that certain forms of dancing could lead to sinful thoughts or activities, and thus proscribe it either in general or during religious services. These include some adherents of [[Mennonite]], [[Hutterite]], [[Baptist]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]], and [[Holiness movement]] sects. [[Jehovah's Witness]]es disfavor events where there might be sexually suggestive dancing or excessive drinking of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defendingjehovahswitnesses.blogspot.com/2012/01/how-do-jehovahs-witnesses-view-dancing.html|title=How Do Jehovah's Witnesses View Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Church of the Nazarene]] recommends against "All forms of dancing that detract from spiritual growth and break down proper moral inhibitions and reserve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|title=Manual|page=51|year=2005–2009|author=Church of the Nazarene|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302214359/http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian churches determine doctrine locally and may be non-denominational, and these vary on their stances on social dancing.

In contrast, some strains of [[Charismatic Christianity]] practice rituals in which the [[Holy Spirit]] is believed to cause spontaneous dancing, among other behaviors. [[Mormonism]] has embraced social dancing to some degree since its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5654 |contribution= Dance |pages= 354-355 |last= Jacobson |first= Phyllis C. |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H. Ludlow |year= 1992 |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishing]] |isbn= 0-02-879602-0 |oclc= 24502140 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Islam===
In Islam, [[Salafists]] and [[Wahhabis]] consider dancing in general to be ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-31/news/33500441_1_music-and-dance-couples-dances-anti-dance|date=2012-08-31|title=Does Islam ban dancing and music?|agency=Slate|author=Brian Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Islamic and [[Orthodox Jewish]] traditions prohibit contact between men and women in public (especially those not married to each other), and thus in these societies men and women either dance separately or not at all.

In contrast, [[Sufism]] encourages dancing, for example [[Sufi whirling]] and dancing to celebrate [[Mela Chiraghan]]. This has resulted in conflict in areas influenced by the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/07/pakistani-festival-dancer_n_183960.html|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2009-05-08|title=Pakistani Festival Dancers Banned By Religious Group|author=Stuart Whatley|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally these decemvirs were a jury of ten men, serving under the presidency of a magistrate, but later this court became the [[magistratus minores]], or lower judiciary of the [[Roman Republic]], and was included among the [[vigintisexviri]], or twenty-six magistrates elected by the ''[[Tribal Assembly|comitia tributa]]''.  According to [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]], [[Augustus]] assigned the presidency of the court of the [[centumviri]] to the decemviri stlitibus judicandis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1253">In [[law]], the '''family purpose doctrine''' is a rule that holds the owner of an [[automobile]] [[liable]] for [[damages]] to others while a member of the family is driving the vehicle, regardless of whether or not the owner gave permission.  The underlying theory is that the vehicle is owned for family purposes.

In the US, this is primarily a state-level rule with considerable variation in its application.  For example, in Arizona, the family purpose doctrine is applied very broadly and holds parents liable even for the [[negligence]] of a child driving a motor vehicle in defiance of driving restrictions placed upon him.&lt;ref&gt;Young v. Beck, Case No. 1 CA-CV 09-0188&lt;/ref&gt;  In Georgia, the 'family purpose' liability extends to third parties allowed by the teenage driver to operate the car.  Georgia also extends the rule to adult children in some cases and explicitly extends the rule to family boats.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart v. Stephens, 225 Ga. 185, 166 S.E. 2d 890 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Colorado, on the other hand, the same term is used to describe [[joint and several liability]] for household bills.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.douglasturner.com/2007/10/09/the-family-purpose-doctrine/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Framework laws''' are [[law]]s that are more specific than [[constitution]]al provisions. They lay down general obligations and principles but leave to governing authorities the task of [[enactment of a bill|enacting]] the further [[legislation]] and other specific measures, as may be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Concepts}}

'''Freedom of contract''' is the freedom of private or public individuals and groups (of any legal entity) to form nonviolent contracts without [[Economic regulation|government restrictions]].  This is opposed to government restrictions such as [[minimum wage|minimum-]] or [[maximum wage|maximum-wage laws]], [[competition laws]], [[economic sanctions]], restrictions on [[price fixing]], or restrictions on contracting with [[second-class citizens]] or [[undocumented workers]].  The freedom to contract is the underpinning of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics and is a cornerstone of [[Free market|free-market]] [[libertarianism]].  Through freedom of contract, individuals possess a general [[freedom of choice|freedom to choose]] with whom to contract, whether to contract or not, and on which terms to contract.

==History==
[[Henry James Sumner Maine]] proposed that social structures evolve from roles derived from [[social status]] to those based on contractual freedom. A status system establishes obligations and relationships by birth, but a contract presumes that the individuals are free and equal. Modern libertarianism, such as that advanced by [[Robert Nozick]], sees freedom of contract as the expression of the independent decisions of separate individuals pursuing their own interests under a "[[night-watchman state|minimal state]]."

==United States==
===''Lochner v. New York''===
{{Main|Lochner v. New York}}
In 1902 a New York baker named Joseph Lochner was fined for violating a state law limiting the number of hours his employees could work. He sued the state on the grounds that he was denied his right to "due process." Lochner claimed that he had the right to freely contract with his employees and that the state had unfairly interfered with this. In 1905, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] used the [[due process clause]] to declare unconstitutional the New York state statute imposing a limit on hours of work. [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham]] wrote for the majority: "Under that provision no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The right to purchase or to sell labor is part of the liberty protected by this amendment."

Writing in dissent, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] accused the majority of basing its decision on [[laissez-faire]] ideology. He believed that it was making law based on economics rather than interpreting the constitution. He believed that "Liberty of Contract" did not exist and that it was not intended in the Constitution.

===Afterward===
In his "Liberty of Contract" (1909), [[Roscoe Pound]] critiqued freedom-of-contract laws by laying out case after case in which labor rights were struck down by state and federal Supreme Courts. Pound argued the courts' rulings were "simply wrong" from the standpoint of common law and "even from that of a sane individualism" (482). Pound further compared the situation of labor legislation in his time to common opinion of [[usury]] and that the two were "of the same type" (484). Pound lamented that the legacy of such "academic" and "artificial" judicial rulings for liberty of contract engendered a "lost respect for the courts" but predicted a "bright" future for labor legislation (486-487).&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe Pound, "Liberty of Contract," 18 Yale Law Journal 454 (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court applied the liberty of contract doctrine sporadically over the next three decades but generally upheld reformist legislation as being within the states' police power. In 1937 the Court reversed its view in the case ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]''. In that case the court upheld a [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]] law setting a [[minimum wage]].

==United Kingdom==
In the late 19th century, the English judiciary espoused "freedom of contract" as a generally applicable feature of public policy, best expressed in ''[[Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1875) 19 Eq 462, 465, regarding freedom of contract and patents&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Sir George Jessel MR]]. In the later 20th century, the view of the common law had changed completely. In ''[[George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd]]'', [[Lord Denning MR]] compared "freedom of contract" with oppression of the weak, as he outlined the development the law had undergone.

{{quote|''The heyday of freedom of contract''

None of you nowadays will remember the trouble we had – when I was called to the Bar – with exemption clauses. They were printed in small print on the back of tickets and order forms and invoices. They were contained in catalogues or timetables. They were held to be binding on any person who took them without objection. No one ever did object. He never read them or knew what was in them. No matter how unreasonable they were, he was bound. All this was done in the name of "freedom of contract". But the freedom was all on the side of the big concern which had the use of the printing press. No freedom for the little man who took the ticket or order form or invoice. The big concern said, "Take it or leave it." The little man had no option but to take it. The big concern could and did exempt itself from liability in its own interest without regard to the little man. It got away with it time after time. When the courts said to the big concern, "You must put it in clear words", the big concern had no hesitation in doing so. It knew well that the little man would never read the exemption clauses or understand them.

It was a bleak winter for our law of contract. It is illustrated by two cases, ''[[Thompson v. London, Midland and Scottish Railway Co.]]'' [1930] 1 K.B. 41 (in which there was exemption from liability, not on the ticket, but only in small print at the back of the timetable, and the company were held not liable) and ''[[L'Estrange v. F. Graucob Ltd.]]'' [1934] 2 K.B. 394 (in which there was complete exemption in small print at the bottom of the order form, and the company were held not liable).

''The secret weapon''

Faced with this abuse of power – by the strong against the weak – by the use of the small print of the conditions – the judges did what they could to put a curb upon it. They still had before them the idol, "freedom of contract". They still knelt down and worshipped it, but they concealed under their cloaks a secret weapon. They used it to stab the idol in the back. This weapon was called "the true construction of the contract". They used it with great skill and ingenuity. They used it so as to depart from the natural meaning of the words of the exemption clause and to put upon them a strained and unnatural construction. In case after case, they said that the words were not strong enough to give the big concern exemption from liability; or that in the circumstances the big concern was not entitled to rely on the exemption clause. If a ship deviated from the contractual voyage, the owner could not rely on the exemption clause. If a warehouseman stored the goods in the wrong warehouse, he could not pray in aid the limitation clause. If the seller supplied goods different in kind from those contracted for, he could not rely on any exemption from liability. If a shipowner delivered goods to a person without production of the bill of lading, he could not escape responsibility by reference to an exemption clause. In short, whenever the wide words – in their natural meaning – would give rise to an unreasonable result, the judges either rejected them as repugnant to the main purpose of the contract, or else cut them down to size in order to produce a reasonable result. This is illustrated by these cases in the House of Lords: ''[[Glynn v. Margetson &amp; Co.]]'' [1893] A.C. 351; ''[[London and North Western Railway Co. v. Neilson]]'' [1922] 2 A.C. 263; ''[[Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd. v. Buerger]]'' [1927] A.C. 1; and by ''[[Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v The King]]'' [1952] A.C. 192 and ''[[Sze Hai Tong Bank Ltd. v. Rambler Cycle Co. Ltd.]]'' [1959] A.C. 576 in the Privy Council; and innumerable cases in the Court of Appeal, culminating in ''[[Levison v. Patent Steam Carpet Cleaning Co. Ltd.]]'' [1978] Q.B. 69. But when the clause was itself reasonable and gave rise to a reasonable result, the judges upheld it; at any rate, when the clause did not exclude liability entirely but only limited it to a reasonable amount. So where goods were deposited in a cloakroom or sent to a laundry for cleaning, it was quite reasonable for the company to limit their liability to a reasonable amount, having regard to the small charge made for the service. These are illustrated by ''[[Gibaud v. Great Eastern Railway Co.]]'' [1921] 2 K.B. 426; ''[[Alderslade v Hendon Laundry Ltd]]'' [1945] K.B. 189 and ''[[Gillespie Bros. &amp; Co. Ltd. v Roy Bowles Transport Ltd.]]'' [1973] Q.B. 400.}}

The '''Gorgoroth name dispute''' refers to a legal dispute between musicians from Norwegian [[black metal]] band [[Gorgoroth]] over who had ownership of the band's name, which was derived from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]]. The parties to the dispute were band founder [[Infernus]] (Roger Tiegs) and members [[Gaahl]] (Kristian Espedal) and [[King ov Hell]] (Tom Cato Visnes). It began in October 2007, when it was announced that Gaahl and King had decided to part ways with Infernus, although the former two claimed to have "fired" the latter.&lt;ref name="Blabsplit"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH To Split Up? |date=2007-10-21 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BlabberMouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83227 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022112108/http://roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83227 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-22 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roadrunnerrecords2007"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH Vocalist, Bassist Vow To Carry On Following Split With Guitarist |date=2007-10-21 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83230 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421205803/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83230 |archivedate=2008-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blabflame"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH Frontman: 'We Will Raise The Flame Higher And Brighter Than Ever' |date=2007-10-23 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83230 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421205803/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83230 |archivedate=2008-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was concluded in March 2009 when a court verdict recognising Infernus as the legitimate user of the name was announced, and the outcome of the dispute also established a [[precedent]] in Norway for subsequent similar disputes.&lt;ref name="imhotep2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imhotep.no/?did=9088703|title=imhotep.no|website=imhotep.no|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Background===
{{main article|Gorgoroth}}
Gorgoroth was formed in 1992 by guitarist [[Infernus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gorgoroth.info/band.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413004943/http://www.gorgoroth.info/band.htm |archivedate=2009-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1993 and 1998, the band released one demo - ''[[A Sorcery Written in Blood]]'' (1993), three studio albums - ''[[Pentagram (Gorgoroth album)|Pentagram]]'' (1994), ''[[Antichrist (Gorgoroth album)|Antichrist]]'' (1996) and ''[[Under the Sign of Hell]]'' (1997), and one EP - ''[[The Last Tormentor]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorgoroth.info/sorcery.htm Gorgoroth - Albums] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331141646/http://www.gorgoroth.info/sorcery.htm |date=2009-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infernus wrote much of the material on ''Pentagram'' and the entirety of ''Antichrist'' and ''Under the Sign of Hell'', and he performed the bass lines on the latter two albums. This period saw several line-up changes - as would happen throughout the band's history - as well as extensive live performances which included two European tours. The band was signed to the major German [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] record label [[Nuclear Blast]] after being approached by them on their headlining European tour in 1997. This would be crucial for Gorgoroth to earn the attention of a wider audience through Nuclear Blast's distribution facilities in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
[[File:Gorgoroth live in Bergen 20102000.jpg|thumb|300px|Gorgoroth live in Bergen, Norway - October 20, 2000. Gaahl and Infernus]]
Vocalist Gaahl joined Gorgoroth in 1998, and was heard on the title track of ''[[Destroyer (Gorgoroth album)|Destroyer]]'' (1998). Bassist King ov Hell joined the band in 1999 and made his studio debut on ''[[Incipit Satan]]'' (2000), which was also the first Gorgoroth album to feature Gaahl as the main vocalist. Between 2002 and 2004, King composed the Gorgoroth songs that would comprise the majority of those on ''[[Twilight of the Idols (album)|Twilight of the Idols]]'' (2003) and the entirety of those on ''[[Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam]]'' (2006), the only Gorgoroth releases between 2000 and 2007. Gaahl wrote lyrics for two songs ''Incipit Satan'', the majority of those on ''Twilight of the Idols'' and the entirety of those on ''Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam''. By the summer of 2007, three songs written by King and five songs with lyrics written by Gaahl were played in live performances.&lt;br&gt; 
Although Infernus contributed little material to ''Twilight of the Idols'' and none to ''Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam'', he conceived the titles of the albums, rooted in his [[Satanism]] and his influences by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He also continued to participate in the production and mastering of Gorgoroth albums. His songs also continued to comprise the majority of the material performed live. He reportedly had begun work on new material for a new album in October 2006 and was first reported writing it in March 2007, the title for which he revealed to be ''[[Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt]]'' in October 2007.&lt;ref name="writingoctober"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mortemzine.net/show.php?id=992 |title=MORTEM ZINE Interview with Infernus |publisher=Mortemzine.net |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530074743/http://www.mortemzine.net/show.php?id=992 |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Update"&gt;[http://gorgoroth.org/news/archive.html Update]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226192520/http://gorgoroth.org/news/archive.html |date=December 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt; Furthermore, Infernus continued to promote the band and its releases in interviews and by other means such as the ''Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam'' listening session in Berlin, May 2006, as did King through interviews and seminars in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gorgoroth.info/news.htm Gorgoroth official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414155041/http://www.gorgoroth.info/news.htm |date=2009-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prominence of each Infernus and King was further reinforced through their statuses as official band contacts as well as by the sleeves of albums such as ''Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam'' - Infernus in particular was emphasised as "Satan's Minister on Earth" and he was largely responsible for negotiations with [[Regain Records]].

More controversy surrounded the band in this period, which resulted from a [[Black Mass Krakow 2004|controversial performance in Kraków, Poland]] in 2004 after which the relations with Nuclear Blast ceased, Gaahl and Infernus receiving prison sentences for excessive violence and gross negligent rape respectively, and appearances made by Gaahl in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Gorgoroth/723/|title=Tartarean Desire - Gorgoroth - Black metal band from Norway|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in part because of some of these events that ''Twilight of the Idols'' and ''Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam'' were the only Gorgoroth releases in this time period.&lt;ref name="vds1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/gorgoroth.htm|title=www.voicesfromthedarkside.de|first=|last=www.voicesfromthedarkside.de|website=www.voicesfromthedarkside.de|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of Gaahl and King ov Hell to the name===
Publicly, Gaahl and King cited multiple reasons behind their decision to exclude founding member Infernus and work under the name Gorgoroth. The claims most frequently iterated throughout the dispute were allegations of Infernus investing no interest in promoting Gorgoroth or participating creatively, and that he was abusive and disrespectful towards promoters, session members and other working partners, while Gaahl and King had "creatively defined" Gorgoroth throughout a period of eight years.&lt;ref name="Blabflame" /&gt; Other claims also included Gaahl's apparent objection to Infernus' support of the late [[Euronymous]]' ''Never Stop the Madness'' campaign through his now-defunct [[Deathlike Silence Productions]] label, while King felt averse to being with Infernus in the wake of rape allegations (resulting in his eventual conviction for 'gross negligent rape') against the latter, despite having also expressed in regards to Gaahl's convictions for assault that "If Gaahl had been in America and attacked in his own house and he decided to defend himself and punish the attacker, the aggressor, he would get a medal."&lt;ref name="revolver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/content/gorgoroth |title=Infernal Affairs |quote=Why the most dangerous true Norwegian black-metal band of the decade turned on itself |publisher=[[Future US]] |work=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] |date=21 October 2007 |first=Kory |last=Grow |accessdate=13 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515141650/http://www.revolvermag.com/content/gorgoroth |archivedate=15 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their decision had been made by summer 2007, and it was in September that King - with the assistance of [[Anders Odden]] - filed a trademark application to [[Norwegian Industrial Property Office|Patentstyret]] for the name and logo of Gorgoroth.&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingapplication"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dbsearch.patentstyret.no/Vis_patent.aspx?idappl=200710859&amp;domene=V&amp;version=1&amp;tyapplication= |title=Information on King's Gorgoroth trademark application |publisher=Dbsearch.patentstyret.no |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response of Infernus===
Although Infernus declared he would not defend himself against any accusations about him raised throughout the dispute and did not directly counter the claims of Gaahl and King outside of formal environments, he nevertheless stated that he could be "difficult to work with", and stated that Gaahl and King should have decided to adopt a new name instead.&lt;ref name="Blabback"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH Guitarist INFERNUS: 'I Promise For Satan That I Will Come Back' |date=2007-10-31 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83837 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67LxEhSeA?url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83837 |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fifteenyears"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83446 |title=Gorgoroth Guitarist Infernus: 'My Intention Is to Continue for Another 15 Years!' |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=24 October 2007 |accessdate=13 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422030945/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83446 |archivedate=22 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pretrialinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femforgacs.hu/interju/405/Gorgoroth_interview |title=Gorgoroth interview |publisher=Fémforgács |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Infernus' work on ''Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt'' had been reported various times in the media.&lt;ref name="writingoctober" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Update"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt;

====Claims====
Select clauses of the '''Patentstyret Trademark Act''', such as § 2. and § 14. 7., were cited in Infernus' favour throughout the dispute and determined the eventually concluded illegality and invalidity of King's trademark application, which also failed to satisfy § 8.:&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roadrunnerrecords1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=115817 |title=Infernus Claims Victory in Gorgoroth Name Dispute |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929160959/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=115817 |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hordaland1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Roy Hilmar Svendsenroy.hilmar.svendsen@nrk.no |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.6517787 |title=Retten: - Infernus er Gorgoroth - Hordaland - NRK Nyheter |publisher=Nrk.no |date=10 March 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lovdata.no/all/hl-19610303-004.html |title=LOV 1961-03-03 nr 04: Lov om varemerker |publisher=Lovdata.no |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814174248/http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-19610303-004.html |archivedate=August 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;§ 2. The exclusive right to a trademark may also be acquired without registration when the trademark is established by use.

A trademark is considered to be established by use when it is well known within the circle of trade concerned in this country as a distinctive sign for someone's goods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;§ 14. A trademark may not be registered if:

7. it is liable to be confused with a trademark which someone else has started to use before the applicant, and the applicant was aware of this use when he filed his application for registration;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;§ 8. Even though a registered trademark is liable to be confused with a sign which has an earlier right, it shall be allowed to co-exist validly with the latter, provided the application for registration was filed in good faith and the holder of the earlier right has knowingly tolerated the use of the later trademark in this country for five consecutive years from the date of registration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Misconceptions===
Frequent misconceptions throughout the dispute - perpetuated by various media outlets such as ''[[Terrorizer Magazine]]'' - were that the acceptance of King's trademark application by Patentstyret in December 2007-January 2008 was a court verdict, and that at least one lawsuit had taken place prior to the one Infernus filed in September 2008, which reached [[Oslo District Court]] (Norwegian:''Oslo tingrett'') in January 2009.&lt;ref name="imhotep2009" /&gt;

==History==

===Prelude (September 2007)===
Whatever the motives were of bassist King ov Hell and vocalist Gaahl in claiming the use of the band name Gorgoroth for themselves and excluding founding member Infernus, the first move was made when King - with the assistance of [[Anders Odden]] - filed a trademark application to Patenstyret for the name and logo of Gorgoroth.&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingapplication"/&gt;

===Departure from Infernus (October - November 2007)===
In October 2007, Infernus announced on the band's official [[Myspace]] page that "a decision to split up the band" had been made with him on one side, and Gaahl and King on the other.&lt;ref name="Blabsplit"/&gt; The statement explained that the members were unable to continue working together any longer and further noted that both sides intended to continue under the band's name.&lt;ref name="Blabsplit"/&gt; A statement from Gaahl and King was also issued on the same day.&lt;ref name="roadrunnerrecords2007"/&gt; Gaahl issued another statement two days later claiming that the band had not split up but "continued on in a different form."&lt;ref name="Blabflame"/&gt; The statement further claimed that Infernus had not been a creative force throughout the course of eight years and had "shown no interest in the art [of] defining Gorgoroth during that same period of time."&lt;ref name="Blabflame"/&gt; Infernus responded on the following day with a statement noting that he claimed the legal right to band's name as "the founder and only original member of the band."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH Guitarist INFERNUS: 'My Intention Is To Continue For Another 15 Years!' |date=2007-10-24 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83446 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422030945/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83446 |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaahl and King announced that [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]] (Jan Axel Blomberg) of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and [[Dimmu Borgir]] would join them on drums from the beginning of 2008, however this never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MAYHEM Drummer HELLHAMMER Joins GAAHL-Fronted Version Of GORGOROTH |date=2007-10-25 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83492 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308075044/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83492 |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teloch of Nidingir (who had also previously been a live session member for Gorgoroth) and [[Nicholas Barker]] (formerly of [[Cradle of Filth]] and Dimmu Borgir) were also revealed as members of their touring line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH Recruits Drummer NICK BARKER For European Tour |date=2007-10-29 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83715 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422012908/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83715 |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gorgoroth 201107 Paris 01.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Gaahl (left) and King ov Hell (right) performing in November 2007.]]

Another statement (intended to be the 'last in a line of short open letters to the media') from Infernus arrived a week later claiming that Gaahl had "been considering quitting the band numerous times" while King had left the band the previous year "due to difficulties combining playing in a clear-cut Satanic metal band as Gorgoroth with the fact that he is full-time employed as a primary school teacher."&lt;ref name="Blabback"/&gt; Infernus further noted that as the band's founding member, he would "not agree on giving away the name [he] rightfully own to [their] third vocalist and sixth or seventh (!) bass player for whatever reasons they might have."&lt;ref name="Blabback"/&gt; Furthermore, he said that he was in the process of finishing and preparing the material he reportedly started in October 2006 and was first reported writing when he was released on parole in March 2007, declaring the title to be ''Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt''.&lt;ref name="writingoctober"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blabback"/&gt;

King's trademark application was revealed by Infernus to the public, and that this was done without the latter's knowledge.&lt;ref name="Kingapplication"/&gt; Infernus' attorney Egil Horstad of Vogt &amp; Wiig warned Gaahl and King that this application was in abrogration of select sections of the Patentstyret Trademark Act.&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt;  On their November European tour - which Gorgoroth had been scheduled to embark on several months before the split, Gaahl and King frequently used the name "The Force Gorgoroth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=xtinemp3|url=http://www.mp3.com/hard-rock-metal/genre/359/show_site_blog_entry.html?genre_id=359&amp;topic_id=1773035&amp;print=1 |title=Interview with The force Gorgoroth |publisher=MP3.com |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.metal-hammer.de/archive/index.php/t-19009.html |title=Tour diary |publisher=Forum.metal-hammer.de |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224230128/http://forum.metal-hammer.de/archive/index.php/t-19009.html |archive-date=2008-12-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wacken.com/en/woa2008/main-news/news/archiv/archiv-single/article/gorgoroth-is-back/ |title=Wacken Open Air announcement |publisher=Wacken.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there also existed a King ov Hell/Gaahl trademark application for this band name.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dbsearch.patentstyret.no/Vis_patent.aspx?idappl=200715620&amp;domene=V&amp;version=1&amp;tyapplication= |title=Information on King and Gaahl's The Force Gorgoroth trademark application |publisher=Dbsearch.patentstyret.no |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2009-03-13 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceptance of King's trademark application by Patentstyret (December 2007 - January 2008)===
In December, [[Regain Records]] issued a press release announcing their decision to "continue the co-operation with the band's original member Infernus with a new line-up" and that the label recognised "Infernus as the rightful owner of the bands name, logo and trademark" as well as their preparation "to take any legal steps necessary to prevent any third party from exploiting it, artistically and commercially."&lt;ref name="regainsupport"&gt;{{cite web |title=Record Label Takes Guitarist's Side In GORGOROTH Name Dispute |date=2007-12-13 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=86725 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422005419/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=86725 |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Gaahl and King delivered a statement claiming that it had been "legally determined" by the [[Norwegian Industrial Property Office|Norwegian patent office]] that they retained "the rightful ownership and use of the name and logo, now and in the future."&lt;ref name="Blabretain"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH's GAAHL, KING Retain Ownership Of Band's Name And Logo |date=2007-12-19 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=87015 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6515uXtRb?url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=87015 |archivedate=2012-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Patent Office's first department had thus accepted King's Gorgoroth trademark application, King and Gaahl withdrew their application for the trademark of "The Force Gorgoroth".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The statement also declared that Gaahl and King had severed ties with Regain Records for "their disloyal acts" and were "carefully choosing a new label for the release of their next full-length album."&lt;ref name="Blabretain"/&gt; Infernus subsequently declared that the Norwegian patent office decision would be appealed by Regain Records and himself.&lt;ref name="blaborb"&gt;{{cite web |title=ORGOROTH Guitarist INFERNUS Says New Lineup Will Include Members Of OBITUARY, DISSECTION |date=2007-12-26 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=87333 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67M1pRJEO?url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=87333 |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-negotiable offer (March 2008)===

According to the bulletin, Regain Records had "illegally removed King's bass tracks and mixed the recordings without the knowledge of Gaahl and King". King and Gaahl claimed that Regain Records thus broke their contract with them. The bulletin also announced that they planned on taking further action against Regain Records.&lt;ref name="haltalbum1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=101702 |title=GORGOROTH's GAAHL, KING Force REGAIN RECORDS To Stop Distribution Of 'Live In Greighallen' - July 27, 2008 |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331091026/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=101702 |archivedate=March 31, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Regain Records released a response to the announcement, stating that the ceasing and sales of marketing was "only an interemistic decision made by the court to stop all actions in regards of the album" until "the case is settled and there's no verdict made on the matter yet".&lt;ref name="haltalbum2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=101801 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - REGAIN RECORDS Issues Statement Regarding GORGOROTH 'Live In Grieghallen' Dispute |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221153714/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=101801 |archivedate=2008-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2008, Infernus issued a statement saying that the Gorgoroth trademark matter would not be decided until a verdict was made in a yet to be announced trial in [[Oslo]], Norway, and that the conflict between Regain Records and Gaahl/King ov Hell about ''True Norwegian Black Metal - Live in Grieghallen'' would be decided in another to-be-announced trial in [[Malmö]], Sweden; until then, a [[temporary injunction]] has stopped Regain Records from promoting and distributing the album.&lt;ref name="augustupdate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=102676 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - Guitarist Infernus Vows to Continue Fightover Gorgoroth Name |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221153359/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=102676 |archivedate=2008-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaahl and King ov Hell stated that they would be entering the studios on August 25 to record a new album featuring Teloch as well as Ice Dale of [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]] on guitars, and [[Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad|Frost]] of [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]] and [[1349 (band)|1349]] (who was also at different points a full-time and session member of Gorgoroth) on drums.

By October 2008, everything except the vocals had been recorded for the new album of Gaahl and King that in the aftermath of the name dispute was expected to materialise into the debut God Seed album. At certain points in time it was publicly stated by Gaahl and/or other parties that he had begun working on lyrics and vocal arrangements, but apparently on none of these occasions did Gaahl fulfil these, and his lack of enthusiasm would contribute to his decision to retire from metal in July 2009.&lt;ref name="gaahlretire"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=125599 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - GAAHL On Decision To Retire From Metal: 'For Me, It's Not Heartfelt Anymore' |access-date=2009-09-15 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Yw7XlSu?url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=125599 |archive-date=2012-02-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, studio times were allocated so Gaahl could begin work, prompting the cancellation of a tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=103412 BLABBERMOUTH.NET - GAAHL-Fronted GORGOROTH Cancels Dates Due To Recording Schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330202442/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=103412 |date=2009-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in December 2008 when interviewed by Faceculture, Gaahl implied that he had not yet worked on lyrics and vocal arrangements and intended to do so somepoint after the completion of his band's European tour with Cradle of Filth.&lt;ref name="faceculture"&gt;[http://faceculture.nl/artist.php?id=666 Gaahl / Video interview / Artists / FaceCulture - Online Multimedia Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230153807/http://faceculture.nl/artist.php?id=666 |date=2009-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2009, Gaahl and his partner Robin went on vacation in Spain for two months.&lt;ref name="gaahlretire" /&gt; While Gaahl was abroad, King claimed that he was using this time to work on lyrics and vocal arrangements, but after Gaahl returned from Spain it was stated by King that these had still yet to be done:&lt;ref name="gaahlspain2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imhotep.no/?did=9088770|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724180242/http://www.imhotep.no/?did=9088770|dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 July 2011|title=From Imhotep to Eternal Terror|date=24 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have recorded everything in the studio and are just waiting for Gaahl to put on vocals on it. So we have only vocals and the final mix to go before it's all done. It's sometimes a nightmare to work with him in the studio because of the pride he puts into the smallest details. If he is not in the right mood or doesn't find the correct words we get nothing done. At times I've spent days in the studio counting seconds with nothing happening. It's the same way now, but I know in the end the result will be unique and powerful. We have to wait till Gaahl is done writing his lyrics to choose the title for the album.

On December 1, 2008, it was announced on Infernus' official Gorgoroth website that a trial date was scheduled in Oslo, Norway and would take place in the last week of January 2009.&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorgoroth.info/menu.html |title=Gorgoroth official website |publisher=Gorgoroth.info |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080730205323/http://www.gorgoroth.info/menu.html| archivedate = July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial took place between January 28–30, 2009, and on March 10, 2009, Infernus announced the verdict had been reached:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Oslo City District Court has today delivered a verdict on the main question in the Gorgoroth trademark case, which took place at the end of January 2009. The court has decided that King ov Hell's trademark registration # 243365 of the band name Gorgoroth is NOT valid and shall therefore be deleted. The court states that King ov Hell and Gaahl excluded themselves from the band Gorgoroth when they tried to fire Infernus in October 2007. The court further states that Infernus cannot be excluded from Gorgoroth, unless he himself decides to quit. Infernus is very pleased, but not surprised, by this verdict. The remaining issues concerning financial matters and such are yet to be decided upon."&lt;ref name="roadrunnerrecords1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name was considered to have already been trademarked by use before Gaahl and King joined the band in 1998 and 1999 respectively.&lt;ref name="hordaland1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avis2.no/musikk_og_film/Dom_fastslaar:_Infernus_er_Gorgoroth |title=Dom fastslår: Infernus er Gorgoroth - AVIS2 |publisher=Avis2.no |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320160011/http://www.avis2.no/musikk_og_film/Dom_fastslaar%3A_Infernus_er_Gorgoroth |archive-date=2009-03-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Infernus' lawyer Erik Rødsand, Gaahl and King are prohibited from choosing band names that are "confusingly alike to" Gorgoroth. This would also include their previously registered "The Force Gorgoroth".&lt;ref name="hordaland1"/&gt; The domain name gorgoroth.org which had been under their control was redirected to the official website at www.gorgoroth.info until the lease eventually expired in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorgoroth.org |title=Gorgoroth |publisher=Gorgoroth |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaahl and King assumed the name [[God Seed]] after the verdict, although the lineup was to dissolve in July 2009 after having had performed at two festivals following Gaahl's decision to leave and retire from metal music.&lt;ref name="godseed"&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=116645 BLABBERMOUTH.NET - Former GORGOROTH Members Launch GOD SEED] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327031540/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=116645 |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gorgoroth DA and other subsequent events (April - May 2009)===
In early April 2009, Infernus revealed to the public that Gaahl and King had opened a small business called "Gorgoroth DA", apparently intended to be in connection with the Gorgoroth band name, and that the business was to be ordered to be shut down.&lt;ref name="gorgorothda1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/interviews/730/Gorgoroth.html|title=Gorgoroth html - The Gauntlet|website=www.thegauntlet.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 2009, an article in the Norwegian financial newspaper [[Dagens Næringsliv]] revealed that the remaining issues in Infernus' lawsuit had been agreed upon by the two parties, and that a settlement had been made. The details of the settlement are confidential, but Infernus commented that he was content with the outcome. In the same article, King and Gaahl's lawyer, Lars Christian Fjeldstad, confirmed that the verdict concerning the trademark registration was final - meaning it cannot be appealed - and that a settlement had been made regarding the remaining issues of the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Anders W. ''Forlikte satanister'', [[Dagens Næringsliv]], 02.06.2009, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''indeterminacy debate in legal theory''' can be summed up as follows: Can the law constrain the results reached by adjudicators in legal disputes? Some members of the [[critical legal studies]] movement — primarily [[jurist|legal academics]] in the [[United States]] — argued that the answer to this question is "no." Another way to state this position is to suggest that disputes cannot be resolved with clear answers and thus there is at least some amount of uncertainty in legal reasoning and its application to disputes. A given body of legal doctrine is said to be "indeterminate" by demonstrating that every legal rule in that body of legal doctrine is opposed by a counterrule that can be used in a process of legal reasoning.

The ''indeterminacy thesis'' emerged as a far-left reply to [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s "right answer" thesis. In its strongest form it is an extreme version of [[legal realism]]. It argues that nothing is law until it has been promulgated by an official - either a judge or the legislature. For example, a statute that says "No person may smoke in a hospital" does not mean that "John Doe may not smoke in a hospital"; the second statement is the law only if a legitimate authority declares so.

This is because one cannot describe a legal statement as right or wrong without making a normative value judgment about what the law should be.{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

In the 1990s the indeterminacy thesis came under heavy attack by [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Conservatism|conservative]] defenders of the [[rule of law]], and the debate, though its mantle is in the process of being taken up by a new generation of scholars, has left the intellectual spotlight for the time being.

The thesis can be criticised because the concept of legal mistake is recognised in a determinative theory of law. While such a mistake necessarily involves a normative judgment, it is not truly subjective. A positivist Hartian theory contends that this judgment is conventionally objective because the rule of recognition fails to recognise the mistake as legally valid. According to a liberal theory such as Dworkin's, the normativity of the judgment is one of reason rather than of value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3283">The '''Institute for Law, Science and Global Security [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/]''' in the Department of Government at [[Georgetown University]] was established to promote teaching and research in the area of intersection between [[international law]] and [[international relations]]. The Institute sponsors undergraduate and graduate courses and runs a Master's Program in International Law and Global Security [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/programs/maprogram/]. The Institute seeks to inform the public policy debate about the nature, role and importance of international law as it connected to issues of science and global security. To this end, it sponsors a series of specific programs including the Program on Non-Proliferation Law and Policy [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/programs/nlp/], which is jointly run with the James Martin Center of the [[Monterey Institute of International Studies]]. 

Most recently, the Institute has begun a special initiative in the area of cyber security [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/events/disciplines/][http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/events/colloquium/cybersecurity/]. Among the participants in this initiative have been former Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[Michael Hayden (general)|General Michael Hayden]][http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=48778], Siobhan Gorman, national security correspondent of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and [[Suzanne Spaulding]], former General Counsel for the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]. Since its creation, the Institute has also sponsored events with a variety of other speakers, including [[Paul D. Clement]], former [[Solicitor General of the United States]], [[Bill Richardson]], the Governor of New Mexico, [[Neal Katyal]], Deputy Solicitor General of the United States and legal counsel to former detainee [[Salim Hamdan]], and [[David H. Remes]], a former partner at [[Covington &amp; Burling]] and currently representing detainees in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camps]]. 

The Institute was founded by Professors [[Christopher C. Joyner]] and [[Anthony Clark Arend]], and was initially called '''The Institute for International Law and Politics.''' It is currently directed by Professor Joyner, and Professor [[Catherine Lotrionte]] serves as the Associate Director of the Institute. [[Amit Yoran]], former Chief of the National Cyber Security Division at the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and Phillip A. Karber serve on the Board of Advisers of the Institute.  From 2007 to 2009, Brendan P. Geary--previously an Associate Attorney at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP and currently an Attorney in the Department of Justice's National Security Division--served as the Institute's William V. O'Brien Fellow.

'''Internet access''' is the ability of individuals and organizations to connect to the [[Internet]] using [[computer terminal]]s, [[computer]]s, and other devices; and to access services such as [[email]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. Various technologies, at a [[data signaling rate|wide range of speeds]] have been used by [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) to provide this service.

Internet access was once rare, but has grown rapidly. In 1995, only {{val|.04}} percent of the world's population had access, with well over half of those living in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=431|oclc=907585907}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consumer use was through [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up]]. By the first decade of the 21st century, many consumers in developed nations used faster [[broadband]] technology, and by 2014, 41 percent of the world's population had access,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=431–432|oclc=907585907}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadband was almost ubiquitous worldwide, and global average connection speeds exceeded 1 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Akamai Releases Second Quarter 2014 ‘State of the Internet' Report |url=http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2014/press-093014.html |work=Akamai |date=30 September 2014 |accessdate=11 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020060839/http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2014/press-093014.html |archivedate=20 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
{{Main article |History of the Internet}}

The Internet developed from the [[ARPANET]], which was funded by the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] to support projects within the government and at universities and research laboratories in the US – but grew over time to include most of the world's large universities and the research arms of many technology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ben Segal | title=A Short History of Internet Protocols at CERN | year=1995 | url=http://www.cern.ch/ben/TCPHIST.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[RIPE|Réseaux IP Européens]] (RIPE)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Internet History in Asia | work=16th APAN Meetings/Advanced Network Conference in Busan | url=http://www.apan.net/meetings/busan03/cs-history.htm | accessdate=25 December 2005 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060201035514/http://apan.net/meetings/busan03/cs-history.htm | archivedate=1 February 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use by a wider audience only came in 1995 when restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic were lifted.&lt;ref name=ConneXions-April1996&gt;[http://www.merit.edu/networkresearch/projecthistory/nsfnet/nsfnet_article.php "Retiring the NSFNET Backbone Service: Chronicling the End of an Era"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719235238/http://www.merit.edu/networkresearch/projecthistory/nsfnet/nsfnet_article.php |date=2011-07-19 }}, Susan R. Harris and Elise Gerich, ''ConneXions'', Vol. 10, No. 4, April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early to mid-1980s, most Internet access was from [[personal computers]] and [[workstations]] directly connected to [[Local Area network|local area networks]] or from [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up connections]] using [[modems]] and analog [[telephone lines]]. LANs typically operated at 10 Mbit/s,&lt;!-- 100 Mbit/s only came in 1995 --&gt; while modem data-rates grew from 1200 bit/s in the early 1980s, to 56 kbit/s by the late 1990s. Initially, dial-up connections were made from [[Computer terminals|terminals]] or computers running [[Terminal emulator|terminal emulation software]] to [[terminal server]]s on LANs. These dial-up connections did not support end-to-end use of the Internet protocols and only provided terminal to host connections. The introduction of [[network access server]]s supporting the [[Serial Line Internet Protocol]] (SLIP) and later the [[point-to-point protocol]] (PPP) extended the Internet protocols and made the full range of Internet services available to dial-up users; although slower, due to the lower data rates available using dial-up.
 
Broadband Internet access, often shortened to just broadband, is simply defined as "Internet access that is always on, and faster than the traditional dial-up access"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= What is Broadband? |work= The National Broadband Plan |publisher= US Federal Communications Commission |url= http://www.broadband.gov/about_broadband.html/ |accessdate= July 15, 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713053907/http://www.broadband.gov/about_broadband.html |archivedate= July 13, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inquiry Concerning the Deployment of Advanced Telecommunications Capability to All Americans in a Reasonable and Timely Fashion, and Possible Steps to Accelerate Such Deployment Pursuant to Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as Amended by the Broadband Data Improvement Act |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |work=GN Docket No. 10-159, FCC-10-148A1 |date=August 6, 2010 |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db0806/FCC-10-148A1.pdf |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135629/http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db0806/FCC-10-148A1.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and so covers a wide range of technologies. Broadband connections are typically made using a computer's built in [[Ethernet]] networking capabilities, or by using a [[Network interface controller|NIC]] [[expansion card]].

Most broadband services provide a continuous "always on" connection; there is no dial-in process required, and it does not interfere with voice use of phone lines.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; Broadband provides improved access to Internet services such as:
* Faster [[world wide web]] browsing
* Faster downloading of documents, photographs, videos, and other large files
* [[Internet telephony|Telephony]], [[Internet radio|radio]], [[Internet television|television]], and [[videoconferencing]]
* [[Virtual private network]]s and remote system administration
* [[Online game|Online gaming]], especially [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s which are interaction-intensive

In the 1990s, the [[National Information Infrastructure Protection Act|National Information Infrastructure]] initiative in the U.S. made broadband Internet access a public policy issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Jeffrey A.

By 2004, broadband had grown and dial-up had declined so that the number of subscriptions were roughly equal at 130 million each.

The broadband technologies in widest use are [[ADSL]] and [[cable Internet]] access. Newer technologies include [[VDSL]] and [[optical fibre]] extended closer to the subscriber in both telephone and cable plants. [[Fibre-optic communication]], while only recently being used in [[fibre to the x|premises and to the curb]] schemes, has played a crucial role in enabling broadband Internet access by making transmission of information at very high data rates over longer distances much more cost-effective than copper wire technology.

In areas not served by ADSL or cable, some community organizations and local governments are installing [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|Wi-Fi]] networks. Wireless and satellite Internet are often used in rural, undeveloped, or other hard to serve areas where wired Internet is not readily available.

Newer technologies being deployed for fixed (stationary) and mobile broadband access include [[WiMAX]], [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]], and [[fixed wireless]], e.g., [[Motorola Canopy]].

Starting in roughly 2006, [[mobile broadband]] access is increasingly available at the consumer level using "[[3G]]" and "[[4G LTE|4G]]" technologies such as [[High-Speed Packet Access|HSPA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EV-DO]], [[HSPA+]], and [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]].

==Availability==
In addition to access from home, school, and the workplace Internet access may be available from [[public place]]s such as [[libraries]] and [[Internet cafes]], where computers with Internet connections are available. Some libraries provide stations for physically connecting users' [[laptop]]s to [[local area network]]s (LANs).

Wireless Internet access points are available in public places such as airport halls, in some cases just for brief use while standing. Some access points may also provide coin-operated computers. Various terms are used, such as "public [[Internet kiosk]]", "public access terminal", and "Web [[payphone]]". Many hotels also have public terminals, usually fee based.

Coffee shops, shopping malls, and other venues increasingly offer wireless access to computer networks, referred to as [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspots]], for users who bring their own wireless-enabled devices such as a [[laptop]] or [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based. A [[Wi-Fi]] hotspot need not be limited to a confined location since multiple ones combined can cover a whole campus or park, or even an entire city can be enabled.

Additionally, [[Mobile broadband]] access allows [[smart phones]] and other digital devices to connect to the Internet from any location from which a [[mobile phone]] call can be made, subject to the capabilities of that mobile network.

{{Main article |Data rates | Bit rates |Bandwidth (computing) |Device data rates}}
The bit rates for dial-up [[modems]] range from as little as 110 bit/s in the late 1950s, to a maximum of from 33 to 64 kbit/s ([[V.90 (recommendation)|V.90]] and [[V.92]]) in the late 1990s. [[Dial-up Internet access|Dial-up connections]] generally require the dedicated use of a telephone line. Data compression can boost the effective bit rate for a dial-up modem connection to from 220 ([[V.42bis]]) to 320 ([[V.44]]) kbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |title=What You Need to Know about Modems |accessdate=2008-03-02 |last=Willdig |first=Karl |author2=Patrik Chen |date=August 1994 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104124418/http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |archivedate=2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effectiveness of data compression is quite variable, depending on the type of data being sent, the condition of the telephone line, and a number of other factors. In reality, the overall data rate rarely exceeds 150 kbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/modem-compression-v-44-v-42bis |title=Modem compression: V.44 against V.42bis |accessdate=2008-03-02 |last=Mitronov |first=Pavel |date=2001-06-29 |publisher=Pricenfees.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202062749/https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/modem-compression-v-44-v-42bis |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadband technologies supply considerably higher bit rates than dial-up, generally without disrupting regular telephone use. Various minimum data rates and maximum latencies have been used in definitions of broadband, ranging from 64&amp;nbsp;kbit/s up to 4.0&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref name="Birth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/publications/birthofbroadband/faq.html |title=Birth of Broadband |publisher=ITU |date=September 2003 |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701173257/http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/publications/birthofbroadband/faq.html |archivedate=July 1, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 the [[ITU-T|CCITT]] standards body defined "broadband service" as requiring transmission channels capable of supporting [[bit rate]]s greater than the [[Primary Rate Interface|primary rate]] which ranged from about 1.5 to 2&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.113-199706-I!!PDF-E |title= Recommendation I.113, Vocabulary of Terms for Broadband aspects of ISDN |publisher= ITU-T |date= June 1997 |orig-year= originally 1988 |accessdate= 19 July 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121106141554/http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.113-199706-I!!PDF-E |archivedate= 6 November 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) report defined broadband as having download [[data transfer rates]] equal to or faster than 256&amp;nbsp;kbit/s.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/broadband.html |title=2006 OECD Broadband Statistics to December 2006 |publisher=OECD |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507202240/http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/broadband.html |archivedate=May 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2015 the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) defined "Basic Broadband" as data transmission speeds of at least 25 Mbit/s downstream (from the Internet to the user’s [[computer]]) and 3&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s upstream (from the user’s computer to the Internet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-331760A1.pdf |title=FCC Finds U.S. Broadband Deployment Not Keeping Pace |publisher=FCC |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419074040/https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-331760A1.pdf |archivedate=April 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend is to raise the threshold of the broadband definition as higher data rate services become available.&lt;ref name="engadget08"&gt;{{cite web |first=Nilay |last=Patel |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/19/fcc-redefines-broadband-to-mean-768kbps-fast-to-mean-kinda/ |title=FCC redefines "broadband" to mean 768&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, "fast" to mean "kinda slow" |publisher=Engadget |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213175111/http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/19/fcc-redefines-broadband-to-mean-768kbps-fast-to-mean-kinda |archivedate=February 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher data rate dial-up modems and many broadband services are "asymmetric"—supporting much higher data rates for download (toward the user) than for upload (toward the Internet).

Data rates, including those given in this article, are usually defined and advertised in terms of the maximum or peak download rate. In practice, these maximum data rates are not always reliably available to the customer.&lt;ref name="100mb"/&gt; Actual end-to-end data rates can be lower due to a number of factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Tom Phillips |title= 'Misleading' BT broadband ad banned |work= UK Metro |date= August 25, 2010 |url= http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/839014-misleading-bt-broadband-ad-banned |accessdate= July 24, 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110906220840/http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/839014-misleading-bt-broadband-ad-banned |archivedate= September 6, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2016, internet connection speeds averaged about 6 Mbit/s globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ben Munson |title=Akamai: Global average internet speeds have doubled since last Olympics |work=FierceOnlineVideo |date=June 29, 2016 |url=http://www.fierceonlinevideo.com/story/akamai-global-average-internet-speeds-have-doubled-last-olympics/2016-06-29 |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702073650/http://www.fierceonlinevideo.com/story/akamai-global-average-internet-speeds-have-doubled-last-olympics/2016-06-29 |archivedate=July 2, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical link quality can vary with distance and for wireless access with terrain, weather, building construction, antenna placement, and interference from other radio sources. Network bottlenecks may exist at points anywhere on the path from the end-user to the remote server or service being used and not just on the first or last link providing Internet access to the end-user.

===Network congestion===
Users may share access over a common network infrastructure. Since most users do not use their full connection capacity all of the time, this aggregation strategy (known as [[contended service]]) usually works well and users can burst to their full data rate at least for brief periods. However, [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) [[file sharing]] and high-quality streaming video can require high data-rates for extended periods, which violates these assumptions and can cause a service to become oversubscribed, resulting in congestion and poor performance. The TCP protocol includes flow-control mechanisms that automatically throttle back on the bandwidth being used during periods of [[network congestion]]. This is fair in the sense that all users that experience congestion receive less bandwidth, but it can be frustrating for customers and a major problem for ISPs. In some cases the amount of bandwidth actually available may fall below the threshold required to support a particular service such as video conferencing or streaming live video–effectively making the service unavailable.

When traffic is particularly heavy, an ISP can deliberately throttle back the bandwidth available to classes of users or for particular services. This is known as [[traffic shaping]] and careful use can ensure a better [[quality of service]] for time critical services even on extremely busy networks. However, overuse can lead to concerns about fairness and [[network neutrality]] or even charges of [[censorship]], when some types of traffic are severely or completely blocked.

===Outages===
An Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions. Disruptions of [[submarine communications cable]]s may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the [[2008 submarine cable disruption]].  Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links.  Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access|title=Georgian woman cuts off web access to whole of Armenia|date=6 April 2011|accessdate=11 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825075603/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access|archivedate=25 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of [[Internet censorship]], as in the blockage of the [[Internet in Egypt]], whereby approximately 93%&lt;ref name="renesys1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cowie |first=James |title=Egypt Leaves the Internet |publisher=Renesys |url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml |accessdate=28 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w51j0pga?url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml |archivedate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|anti-government protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 | work=BBC News | title=Egypt severs internet connection amid growing unrest | date=28 January 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123164134/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 | archivedate=23 January 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies==
When the Internet is accessed using a [[modem]], [[digital data]] is converted to [[analog signal|analog]] for transmission over analog networks such as the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone]] and [[Cable television|cable]] networks.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;[http://www.explainthatstuff.com/howbroadbandworks.html "How Broadband Works"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913021130/http://www.explainthatstuff.com//howbroadbandworks.html |date=2011-09-13 }}, Chris Woodford, Explain that Stuff, 20 August 2008. Retrieved 19 January.&lt;/ref&gt; A computer or other device accessing the Internet would either be connected directly to a modem that communicates with an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) or the modem's Internet connection would be shared via a [[Local Area Network]] (LAN) which provides access in a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office building.

Although a connection to a LAN may provide very high data-rates within the LAN, actual Internet access speed is limited by the upstream link to the ISP. LANs may be wired or wireless. [[Ethernet]] over [[twisted pair]] cabling and [[Wi-Fi]] are the two most common technologies used to build LANs today, but [[ARCNET]], [[Token Ring]], [[Localtalk]], [[FDDI]], and other technologies were used in the past.

[[Ethernet]] is the name of the [[IEEE 802.3]] standard for physical LAN communication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124030206/http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.3.html |archivedate=2017-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wi-Fi]] is a trade name for a [[wireless local area network]] (WLAN) that uses one of the [[IEEE 802.11]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Wi-Fi (wireless networking technology)|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1473553/Wi-Fi|accessdate=2010-02-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627181935/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1473553/Wi-Fi|archivedate=2010-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethernet cables are interconnected via switches &amp; routers. Wi-Fi networks are built using one or more wireless antenna called [[Wireless access point|access points]].

Many "modems" provide the additional functionality to host a LAN so most Internet access today is through a LAN{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}, often a very small LAN with just one or two devices attached. And while LANs are an important form of Internet access, this raises the question of how and at what data rate the LAN itself is connected to the rest of the global Internet. The technologies described below are used to make these connections.

===Hardwired broadband access===

The term [[broadband]] includes a broad range of technologies, all of which provide higher data rate access to the Internet. The following technologies use wires or cables in contrast to wireless broadband described later.

====Dial-up access====
{{Listen
|filename = Dial up modem noises.ogg
|title = "Dial up modem noises"
|description = Typical noises of a [[dial-up|dial-up modem]] while establishing connection with a local [[Internet service provider|ISP]] in order to get access to the [[Internet]].
|pos=right}}
[[Dial-up Internet access]] uses a modem and a phone call placed over the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) to connect to a pool of modems operated by an ISP. The [[modem]] converts a computer's digital signal into an analog signal that travels over a phone line's [[local loop]] until it reaches a telephone company's switching facilities or central office (CO) where it is switched to another phone line that connects to another modem at the remote end of the connection.&lt;ref name=Network&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks, 5th Ed|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating on a single channel, a dial-up connection monopolizes the phone line and is one of the slowest methods of accessing the Internet. Dial-up is often the only form of Internet access available in rural areas as it requires no new infrastructure beyond the already existing telephone network, to connect to the Internet. Typically, dial-up connections do not exceed a speed of 56 [[kbit/s]], as they are primarily made using modems that operate at a maximum data rate of 56 kbit/s downstream (towards the end user) and 34 or 48 kbit/s upstream (toward the global Internet).&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt;

====Multilink dial-up====
[[Multilink striping|Multilink]] dial-up provides increased bandwidth by [[channel bonding]] multiple dial-up connections and accessing them as a single data channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.56k.com/reports/bonding.shtml "Bonding: 112K, 168K, and beyond "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310194539/http://www.56k.com/reports/bonding.shtml |date=2007-03-10 }}, 56K.com&lt;/ref&gt; It requires two or more modems, phone lines, and dial-up accounts, as well as an ISP that supports multilinking – and of course any line and data charges are also doubled. This [[inverse multiplexing]] option was briefly popular with some high-end users before ISDN, DSL and other technologies became available. [[Diamond Multimedia|Diamond]] and other vendors created special modems to support multilinking.&lt;ref name="fail"&gt;[http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/top_tech_blunders_10_products_massively_failed "Diamond 56k Shotgun Modem"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331173853/http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/top_tech_blunders_10_products_massively_failed |date=2012-03-31 }}, maximumpc.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrated Services Digital Network====
[[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN) is a switched telephone service capable of transporting voice and digital data, as well as one of the oldest Internet access methods. ISDN has been used for voice, video conferencing, and broadband data applications. ISDN was very popular in Europe, but less common in North America. Its use peaked in the late 1990s before the availability of [[DSL]] and [[cable modem]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Stallings |title=ISDN and Broadband ISDN with Frame Relay and ATM |edition=4th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1999 |page=542 |isbn=0139737448 |url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/ISDN-and-Broadband-ISDN-with-Frame-Relay-and-ATM-4E/9780139737442.page |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924071103/http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/ISDN-and-Broadband-ISDN-with-Frame-Relay-and-ATM-4E/9780139737442.page |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic rate ISDN, known as ISDN-BRI, has two 64 kbit/s "bearer" or "B" channels. These channels can be used separately for voice or data calls or bonded together to provide a 128&amp;nbsp;kbit/s service. Multiple ISDN-BRI lines can be bonded together to provide data rates above 128&amp;nbsp;kbit/s. Primary rate ISDN, known as ISDN-PRI, has 23 bearer channels (64&amp;nbsp;kbit/s each) for a combined data rate of 1.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s (US standard). An ISDN E1 (European standard) line has 30 bearer channels and a combined data rate of 1.9&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.

====Leased lines====
[[Leased line]]s are dedicated lines used primarily by ISPs, business, and other large enterprises to connect LANs and campus networks to the Internet using the existing infrastructure of the [[Public switched telephone network|public telephone network]] or other providers. Delivered using wire, [[optical fiber]], and [[radio]], leased lines are used to provide Internet access directly as well as the building blocks from which several other forms of Internet access are created.&lt;ref name="Horak"&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470396075.html ''Telecommunications and Data Communications Handbook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308075758/http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470396075.html |date=2013-03-08 }}, Ray Horak, 2nd edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2008, 791 p., {{ISBN|0-470-39607-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T-carrier]] technology dates to 1957 and provides data rates that range from 56 and {{val|64|u=kbit/s}} ([[Digital Signal 0|DS0]]) to {{val|1.5|u=Mbit/s}} ([[Digital Signal 1|DS1]] or T1), to {{val|45|u=Mbit/s}} ([[Digital Signal 3|DS3]] or T3). A T1 line carries 24 voice or data channels (24 DS0s), so customers may use some channels for data and others for voice traffic or use all 24 channels for clear channel data. A DS3 (T3) line carries 28 DS1 (T1) channels. Fractional T1 lines are also available in multiples of a DS0 to provide data rates between 56 and {{val|1,500|u=kbit/s}}. T-carrier lines require special termination equipment that may be separate from or integrated into a router or switch and which may be purchased or leased from an ISP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks|edition=5th|publisher=Course Technology, Cengage Learning|year=2009|url=http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|ISBN=1-4239-0245-9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420223256/http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|archivedate=2013-04-20|df=}} pp 312–315.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan the equivalent standard is J1/J3. In Europe, a slightly different standard, [[E-carrier]], provides 32 user channels ({{val|64|u=kbit/s}}) on an E1 ({{val|2.0|u=Mbit/s}}) and 512 user channels or 16 E1s on an E3 ({{val|34.4|u=Mbit/s}}).

[[Synchronous Optical Networking]] (SONET, in the U.S. and Canada) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH, in the rest of the world) are the standard multiplexing protocols used to carry high-data-rate digital bit-streams over optical fiber using [[lasers]] or highly [[coherent light]] from [[light-emitting diodes]] (LEDs). At lower transmission rates data can also be transferred via an electrical interface. The basic unit of framing is an [[OC-3c]] (optical) or [[Synchronous optical networking#The basic unit of transmission|STS-3]]c (electrical) which carries {{val|155.520|u=Mbit/s}}. Thus an OC-3c will carry three [[Optical Carrier#OC-1|OC-1]] (51.84 Mbit/s) payloads each of which has enough capacity to include a full DS3. Higher data rates are delivered in OC-3c multiples of four providing [[OC-12]]c ({{val|622.080|u=Mbit/s}}), [[OC-48]]c ({{val|2.488|u=Gbit/s}}), [[OC-192]]c ({{val|9.953|u=Gbit/s}}), and [[OC-768]]c (39.813 Gbit/s). The "c" at the end of the OC labels stands for "concatenated" and indicates a single data stream rather than several multiplexed data streams.&lt;ref name="Horak" /&gt;

The 1, 10, 40, and 100 gigabit Ethernet ([[GbE]], [[10 GbE]], [[100 Gigabit Ethernet|40/100 GbE]]) [[IEEE 802.3|IEEE standards (802.3)]] allow digital data to be delivered over copper wiring at distances to 100 m and over optical fiber at distances to {{val|40|u=km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/3/ "IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Working Group"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012182235/http://www.ieee802.org/3/ |date=2014-10-12 }}, web page, IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee, accessed 8 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cable Internet access====
{{main article|Cable Internet access}}
Cable Internet provides access using a [[cable modem]] on [[Hybrid fibre-coaxial|hybrid fiber coaxial]] wiring originally developed to carry television signals. Either fiber-optic or coaxial copper cable may connect a node to a customer's location at a connection known as a cable drop. In a [[cable modem termination system]], all nodes for cable subscribers in a neighborhood connect to a cable company's central office, known as the "head end." The cable company then connects to the Internet using a variety of means – usually fiber optic cable or digital satellite and microwave transmissions.&lt;ref name="Dean322"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks|edition=5th|publisher=Course Technology, Cengage Learning|year=2009|url=http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|ISBN=1-4239-0245-9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420223256/http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|archivedate=2013-04-20|df=}} p 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Like DSL, broadband cable provides a continuous connection with an ISP.

[[Downstream (computer science)|Downstream]], the direction toward the user, bit rates can be as much as 400&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] for business connections, and 320&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s for residential service in some countries. Upstream traffic, originating at the user, ranges from 384&amp;nbsp;kbit/s to more than 20&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. Broadband cable access tends to service fewer business customers because existing television cable networks tend to service residential buildings and commercial buildings do not always include wiring for coaxial cable networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks|edition=5th|publisher=Course Technology, Cengage Learning|year=2009|url=http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|ISBN=1-4239-0245-9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420223256/http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|archivedate=2013-04-20|df=}} p 323.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, because broadband cable subscribers share the same local line, communications may be intercepted by neighboring subscribers. Cable networks regularly provide encryption schemes for data traveling to and from customers, but these schemes may be thwarted.&lt;ref name="Dean322"/&gt;

====Digital subscriber line (DSL, ADSL, SDSL, and VDSL)====
[[Digital Subscriber Line]] (DSL) service provides a connection to the Internet through the telephone network. Unlike dial-up, DSL can operate using a single phone line without preventing normal use of the telephone line for voice phone calls. DSL uses the high frequencies, while the low (audible) frequencies of the line are left free for [[Plain old telephone service|regular telephone]] communication.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; These frequency bands are subsequently separated by filters installed at the customer's premises.

DSL originally stood for "digital subscriber loop". In telecommunications marketing, the term digital subscriber line is widely understood to mean [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line]] (ADSL), the most commonly installed variety of DSL. The data throughput of consumer DSL services typically ranges from 256&amp;nbsp;kbit/s to 20&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s in the direction to the customer (downstream), depending on DSL technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. In ADSL, the data throughput in the upstream direction, (i.e. in the direction to the service provider) is lower than that in the downstream direction (i.e. to the customer), hence the designation of asymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/?tag=ADSL_Theory "ADSL Theory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724040222/http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/?tag=ADSL_Theory |date=2010-07-24 }}, Australian broadband news and information, Whirlpool, accessed 3 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL), the downstream and upstream data rates are equal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line#SDSL "SDSL"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418172858/http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line |date=2012-04-18 }}, ''Internetworking Technology Handbook'', Cisco DocWiki, 17 December 2009, accessed 3 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[VDSL2]] (ITU-T G.993.2) is a second-generation version and an enhancement of VDSL.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{Cite news |title= New ITU Standard Delivers 10x ADSL Speeds: Vendors applaud landmark agreement on VDSL2 |date= 27 May 2005 |work= News release |publisher= International Telecommunication Union |url= http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2005/06.html |accessdate= 22 September 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160903203113/http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2005/06.html |archivedate= 3 September 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approved in February 2006, it is able to provide data rates exceeding 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s simultaneously in both the upstream and downstream directions. However, the maximum data rate is achieved at a range of about 300 meters and performance degrades as distance and loop [[attenuation]] increases.

====DSL Rings====
[[DSL Rings]] (DSLR) or Bonded DSL Rings is a ring topology that uses DSL technology over existing copper telephone wires to provide data rates of up to 400&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref name="financialpost"&gt;{{cite news

====Fiber to the home====
[[Fiber to the x|Fiber-to-the-home]] (FTTH) is one member of the Fiber-to-the-x (FTTx) family that includes Fiber-to-the-building or basement (FTTB), Fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP), Fiber-to-the-desk (FTTD), Fiber-to-the-curb (FTTC), and Fiber-to-the-node (FTTN).&lt;ref name="council"&gt;{{cite web |title= FTTH Council – Definition of Terms |date= January 9, 2009 |url= http://ftthcouncil.eu/documents/Reports/FTTH-Definitions-Revision_January_2009.pdf |publisher= FTTH Council |accessdate= September 1, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods all bring data closer to the end user on optical fibers. The differences between the methods have mostly to do with just how close to the end user the delivery on fiber comes. All of these delivery methods are similar to [[hybrid fiber-coaxial]] (HFC) systems used to provide [[cable Internet access]].

The use of [[Fiber-optic communication|optical fiber]] offers much higher data rates over relatively longer distances. Most high-capacity Internet and cable television backbones already use fiber optic technology, with data switched to other technologies (DSL, cable, [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]) for final delivery to customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiopt.com/primer.php "FTTx Primer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011033903/http://www.fiopt.com/primer.php |date=2008-10-11 }}, Fiopt Communication Services (Calgary), July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Power-line Internet====
[[Power-line Internet]], also known as [[Broadband over power lines]] (BPL), carries Internet data on a conductor that is also used for [[electric power transmission]].&lt;ref name="BERGU14"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Lars T.|last2=Schwager|first2=Andreas |last3=Pagani|first3=Pascal|last4=Schneider|first4=Daniel M.|date=February 2014|title=MIMO Power Line Communications: Narrow and Broadband Standards, EMC, and Advanced Processing|publisher=CRC Press|series=Devices, Circuits, and Systems|isbn=9781466557529|url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1201/b16540-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the extensive power line infrastructure already in place, this technology can provide people in rural and low population areas access to the Internet with little cost in terms of new transmission equipment, cables, or wires. Data rates are asymmetric and generally range from 256 kbit/s to 2.7 Mbit/s.&lt;ref name="HSW-BPL"&gt;[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bpl.htm "How Broadband Over Powerlines Works"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512090550/http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bpl.htm |date=2012-05-12 }}, Robert Valdes, ''How Stuff Works'', accessed 5 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these systems use parts of the radio spectrum allocated to other over-the-air communication services, interference between the services is a limiting factor in the introduction of power-line Internet systems. The [[IEEE P1901]] standard specifies that all power-line protocols must detect existing usage and avoid interfering with it.&lt;ref name="HSW-BPL" /&gt;

Power-line Internet has developed faster in Europe than in the U.S. due to a historical difference in power system design philosophies. Data signals cannot pass through the step-down transformers used and so a repeater must be installed on each transformer.&lt;ref name="HSW-BPL" /&gt; In the U.S. a transformer serves a small cluster of from one to a few houses. In Europe, it is more common for a somewhat larger transformer to service larger clusters of from 10 to 100 houses. Thus a typical U.S. city requires an order of magnitude more repeaters than in a comparable European city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/north-american-versus-european-distribution-systems "North American versus European distribution systems"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507211603/http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/north-american-versus-european-distribution-systems |date=2012-05-07 }}, Edvard, Technical articles, Electrical Engineering Portal, 17 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====ATM and Frame Relay====
[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) and [[Frame Relay]] are wide-area networking standards that can be used to provide Internet access directly or as building blocks of other access technologies. For example, many DSL implementations use an ATM layer over the low-level bitstream layer to enable a number of different technologies over the same link. Customer LANs are typically connected to an ATM switch or a Frame Relay node using leased lines at a wide range of data rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.150-199902-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items ''B-ISDN asynchronous transfer mode functional characteristics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012161801/http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.150-199902-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items |date=2012-10-12 }}, ITU-T Recommendation I.150, February 1999, International Telecommunications Union&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/definition/frame-relay "Frame Relay"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409171824/http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/definition/frame-relay |date=2012-04-09 }}, Margaret Rouse, TechTarget, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

While still widely used, with the advent of Ethernet over optical fiber, [[MPLS]], [[VPN]]s and broadband services such as [[cable modem]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]], ATM and Frame Relay no longer play the prominent role they once did.

===Wireless broadband access===
[[Wireless broadband]] is used to provide both fixed and mobile Internet access with the following technologies.

Satellites in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) operate in a fixed position 35,786&amp;nbsp;km (22,236 miles) above the Earth's equator. At the speed of light (about 300,000&amp;nbsp;km/s or 186,000 miles per second), it takes a quarter of a second for a radio signal to travel from the Earth to the satellite and back. When other switching and routing delays are added and the delays are doubled to allow for a full round-trip transmission, the total delay can be 0.75 to 1.25 seconds. This latency is large when compared to other forms of Internet access with typical latencies that range from 0.015 to 0.2 seconds. Long latencies negatively affect some applications that require real-time response, particularly online games, [[voice over IP]], and remote control devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Basics of Satellite Communication| author=Joseph N.

Satellites in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO, below 2000&amp;nbsp;km or 1243 miles) and [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO, between 2000 and 35,786&amp;nbsp;km or 1,243 and 22,236 miles) are less common, operate at lower altitudes, and are not fixed in their position above the Earth. Lower altitudes allow lower latencies and make real-time interactive Internet applications more feasible. LEO systems include [[Globalstar]] and [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]]. The [[O3b (satellite)|O3b Satellite Constellation]] is a proposed MEO system with a latency of 125 ms. COMMStellation™ is a LEO system, scheduled for launch in 2015, that is expected to have a latency of just 7&amp;nbsp;ms.

====Mobile broadband====
[[File:Mobile Broadband service mark.jpg|thumb |150px |Service mark for [[GSM Association|GSMA]] ]]
[[Mobile broadband]] is the marketing term for wireless Internet access delivered through mobile phone towers to computers, [[mobile phone]]s (called "cell phones" in North America and South Africa, and "hand phones" in Asia), and other digital devices using [[portable modem]]s. Some mobile services allow more than one device to be connected to the Internet using a single cellular connection using a process called [[tethering]]. The modem may be built into laptop computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices, added to some devices using [[PC card]]s, [[USB modem]]s, and [[USB sticks]] or [[PC Card dongle|dongles]], or separate [[wireless modem]]s can be used.&lt;ref name="ergen"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mobile Broadband: including WiMAX and LTE |publisher= Springer Science+Business Media |year= 2009 |author= Mustafa Ergen |isbn= 978-0-387-68189-4 |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-0-387-68189-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New mobile phone technology and infrastructure is introduced periodically and generally involves a change in the fundamental nature of the service, non-backwards-compatible transmission technology, higher peak data rates, new frequency bands, wider channel frequency bandwidth in Hertz becomes available. These transitions are referred to as generations. The first mobile data services became available during the second generation (2G).

[[WiMAX]] was originally developed to deliver fixed wireless service with wireless mobility added in 2005. CDPD, CDMA2000 EV-DO, and MBWA are no longer being actively developed.

In 2011, 90% of the world's population lived in areas with 2G coverage, while 45% lived in areas with 2G and 3G coverage.&lt;ref name=ITU-ITCFacts&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/facts/2011/material/ICTFactsFigures2011.pdf "The World in 2011: ITC Facts and Figures"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510070621/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/facts/2011/material/ICTFactsFigures2011.pdf |date=2012-05-10 }}, International Telecommunications Unions (ITU), Geneva, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====WiMAX====
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access ([[WiMAX]]) is a set of interoperable implementations of the [[IEEE 802.16]] family of wireless-network standards certified by the [[WiMAX Forum]]. WiMAX enables "the delivery of [[last mile]] wireless broadband access as an alternative to cable and DSL".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimaxforum.org/technology/ |title=WiMax Forum – Technology |accessdate=2008-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722062158/http://www.wimaxforum.org/technology/ |archivedate=2008-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original IEEE 802.16 standard, now called "Fixed WiMAX", was published in 2001 and provided 30 to 40 megabit-per-second data rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/interviews/blog/speeding-up-wimax/?cs=40726 |title= Speeding Up WiMax |author= Carl Weinschenk |date= 16 April 2010 |work= IT Business Edge |quote= Today the initial WiMax system is designed to provide 30 to 40 megabit-per-second data rates. |accessdate= 31 August 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110905081903/http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/interviews/blog/speeding-up-wimax/?cs=40726 |archivedate= 5 September 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobility support was added in 2005. A 2011 update provides data rates up to 1 Gbit/s for fixed stations. WiMax offers a metropolitan area network with a signal radius of about 50&amp;nbsp;km (30 miles), far surpassing the 30-metre (100-foot) wireless range of a conventional [[Wi-Fi]] [[local area network]] (LAN). WiMAX signals also penetrate building walls much more effectively than Wi-Fi.

====Wireless ISP====
[[File:Wi-Fi Logo.svg|thumb|150px|Wi-Fi logo]]
[[Wireless Internet service provider]]s (WISPs) operate independently of [[mobile phone operator]]s. WISPs typically employ low-cost IEEE 802.11 [[Wi-Fi]] radio systems to link up remote locations over great distances ([[Long-range Wi-Fi]]), but may use other higher-power radio communications systems as well.

Traditional 802.11a/b/g/n/ac is an unlicensed omnidirectional service designed to span between 100 and 150 m (300 to 500&amp;nbsp;ft). By focusing the radio signal using a [[directional antenna]] (where allowed by regulations), 802.11 can operate reliably over a distance of many km(miles), although the technology's line-of-sight requirements hamper connectivity in areas with hilly or heavily foliated terrain. In addition, compared to hard-wired connectivity, there are security risks (unless robust security protocols are enabled); data rates are usually slower (2 to 50 times slower); and the network can be less stable, due to interference from other wireless devices and networks, weather and line-of-sight problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Certified Wireless Network Administrator Official Study Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnMunBGVDuMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cwna+official+study+guide&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EJaXTpSaFMPSiALTu4HCDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Joshua Bardwell|author2=Devin Akin|page=418|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2005|edition=Third|isbn=978-0-07-225538-6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109135240/https://books.google.com/books?id=QnMunBGVDuMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cwna+official+study+guide&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EJaXTpSaFMPSiALTu4HCDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing popularity of unrelated consumer devices operating on the same 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band, many providers have migrated to the [[List of WLAN channels#5.C2.A0GHz .28802.11a.2Fh.2Fj.2Fn.2Fac.29.5B18.5D|5GHz ISM band]]. If the service provider holds the necessary spectrum license, it could also reconfigure various brands of off the shelf Wi-Fi hardware to operate on its own band instead of the crowded unlicensed ones. Using higher frequencies carries various advantages:
* usually regulatory bodies allow for more power and using (better-) directional antennae,
* there exists much more bandwidth to share, allowing both better throughput and improved coexistence,
* there are less consumer devices that operate over 5&amp;nbsp;GHz than on 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz, hence less interferers are present,
* the shorter wavelengths propagate much worse through walls and other structure, so much less interference leaks outside of the homes of consumers.

Proprietary technologies like [[Motorola Canopy]] &amp; Expedience can be used by a WISP to offer wireless access to rural and other markets that are hard to reach using Wi-Fi or WiMAX. There are a number of companies that provide this service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wispa.org/directories/member-directory "Member Directory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220031021/http://www.wispa.org/Directories/Member-Directory |date=2017-02-20 }}, Wireless Internet Service Providers’ Association (WISPA), accessed 5 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Local Multipoint Distribution Service====
[[Local Multipoint Distribution Service]] (LMDS) is a broadband wireless access technology that uses microwave signals operating between 26&amp;nbsp;GHz and 29&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cis788-99/ftp/lmds/index.html "Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LDMS)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010031040/http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cis788-99/ftp/lmds/index.html |date=2012-10-10 }}, Vinod Tipparaju, November 23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Originally designed for digital television transmission (DTV), it is conceived as a fixed wireless, point-to-multipoint technology for utilization in the last mile. Data rates range from 64 kbit/s to 155 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/nd/ramdinchacha/DEC00.html "LMDS: Broadband Out of Thin Air "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415040102/http://www.angelfire.com/nd/ramdinchacha/DEC00.html |date=2014-04-15 }}, Niraj K Gupta, from My Cell, Voice &amp; Data, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Distance is typically limited to about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, but links of up to 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) from the base station are possible in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijest.info/docs/IJEST09-01-01.pdf "Review and Analysis of Local Multipoint Distribution System (LMDS) to Deliver Voice, Data, Internet, and Video Services"], S.S. Riaz Ahamed, International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology, Vol. 1(1), October 2009, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

LMDS has been surpassed in both technological and commercial potential by the LTE and WiMAX standards.

===Hybrid Access Networks===
{{See also |Hybrid Access Networks}}

In some regions, notably in rural areas, the length of the copper lines makes it difficult for network operators to provide high bandwidth services. An alternative is to combine a fixed access network, typically [[XDSL]], with a wireless network, typically [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]. The [[Broadband Forum]] has standardised an architecture for such [[Hybrid Access Networks]].

===Non-commercial alternatives for using Internet services===
{{See also |Project Loon}}

====Grassroots wireless networking movements====
Deploying multiple adjacent Wi-Fi access points is sometimes used to create [[Municipal wireless network|city-wide]] wireless networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.wi-fi.org/discover-and-learn | title = Discover and Learn | publisher = The Wi-Fi Alliance | accessdate = 6 May 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120510032811/http://www.wi-fi.org/discover-and-learn | archivedate = 10 May 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually ordered by the local municipality from commercial WISPs.

[[Grassroots]] efforts have also led to [[wireless community network]]s widely deployed at numerous countries, both developing and developed ones. Rural wireless-ISP installations are typically not commercial in nature and are instead a patchwork of systems built up by hobbyists mounting antennas on [[radio masts and towers]], agricultural [[storage silo]]s, very tall trees, or whatever other tall objects are available.

Where radio spectrum regulation is not community-friendly, the channels are crowded or when equipment can not be afforded by local residents, [[Free-space optical communication#LEDs|free-space optical communication]] can also be deployed in a similar manner for point to point transmission in air (rather than in fiber optic cable).

====Packet radio====
{{Main article |Packet radio|AMPRNet}}

Packet radio connects computers or whole networks operated by radio amateurs with the option to access the Internet. Note that as per the regulatory rules outlined in the HAM license, Internet access and e-mail should be strictly related to the activities of hardware amateurs.

====Sneakernet====
{{Main article |Sneakernet}}

The term, a [[tongue-in-cheek]] play on ''net(work)'' as in ''[[Internet]]'' or ''[[Ethernet]]'', refers to the wearing of [[sneakers (footwear)|sneakers]] as the transport mechanism for the data.

For those who do not have access to or can not afford broadband at home, downloading large files and disseminating information is done by transmission through workplace or library networks, taken home and shared with neighbors by sneakernet.

There are various decentralized, [[Delay-tolerant networking|delay tolerant]] peer to peer applications which aim to fully automate this using any available interface, including both wireless (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi mesh, P2P or hotspots) and physically connected ones (USB storage, ethernet, etc.).

Sneakernets may also be used in tandem with computer network data transfer to increase data security or overall throughput for big data use cases. Innovation continues in the area to this day, for example AWS has recently announced Snowball, and bulk data processing is also done in a similar fashion by many research institutes and government agencies.

==Pricing and spending==
[[File:Broadband Affordability.png|thumb|400px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;'''Broadband affordability in 2011'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;small&gt;This map presents an overview of broadband affordability, as the relationship between average yearly income per capita and the cost of a broadband subscription (data referring to 2011). Source: Information Geographies at the Oxford Internet Institute.&lt;ref name=InternetPopulation2011&gt;[http://geography.oii.ox.ac.uk/#broadband-affordability "Broadband affordability"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614024048/http://geography.oii.ox.ac.uk/ |date=2014-06-14 }}, Information Geographies at the Oxford Internet Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]

Internet access is limited by the relation between pricing and available resources to spend. Regarding the latter, it is estimated that 40% of the world's population has less than US$20 per year available to spend on [[information and communications technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019 | volume=38 | title=When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide?

From Latin America it is known that the borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the “magical number” of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year.&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"/&gt; This is the amount of ICT spending people esteem to be a basic necessity. Current Internet access prices exceed the available resources by large in many countries.

Dial-up users pay the costs for making local or long distance phone calls, usually pay a monthly subscription fee, and may be subject to additional per minute or traffic based charges, and connect time limits by their ISP. Though less common today than in the past, some dial-up access is offered for "free" in return for watching banner ads as part of the dial-up service. [[NetZero]], [[Kmart#BlueLight internet service|BlueLight]], [[Juno Online Services|Juno]], [[Freenet (ISP)|Freenet (NZ)]], and [[Free-net]]s are examples of services providing free access. Some [[Wireless community network]]s continue the tradition of providing free Internet access.

Fixed broadband Internet access is often sold under an "unlimited" or [[flat rate]] pricing model, with price determined by the maximum data rate chosen by the customer, rather than a per minute or traffic based charge. Per minute and traffic based charges and traffic caps are common for mobile broadband Internet access.

Internet services like [[Facebook]], [[Wikipedia]] and [[Google]] have built special programs to partner with [[mobile network operator]]s (MNO) to introduce ''[[zero-rating]]'' the cost for their data volumes as a means to provide their service more broadly into developing markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/feedback-review/zero-rating-development-darling-or-net-neutrality-nemesis |title=Zero-rating: Development Darling or Net Neutrality Nemesis? |accessdate=July 26, 2014 |last=McDiarmid |first=Andrew |publisher=Knight News Challenge |date=March 18, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808054736/https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/feedback-review/zero-rating-development-darling-or-net-neutrality-nemesis |archivedate=August 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increased consumer demand for streaming content such as video on demand and peer-to-peer file sharing, demand for bandwidth has increased rapidly and for some ISPs the flat rate pricing model may become unsustainable. However, with [[fixed costs]] estimated to represent 80–90% of the cost of providing broadband service, the marginal cost to carry additional traffic is low. Most ISPs do not disclose their costs, but the cost to transmit a gigabyte of data in 2011 was estimated to be about $0.03.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/gadgets-and-gear/hugh-thompson/what-is-a-fair-price-for-internet-service/article1890596/ "What is a fair price for Internet service?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209005530/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/gadgets-and-gear/hugh-thompson/what-is-a-fair-price-for-internet-service/article1890596/ |date=2012-02-09 }}, Hugh Thompson, ''Globe and Mail'' (Toronto), 1 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ISPs estimate that a small number of their users consume a disproportionate portion of the total bandwidth. In response some ISPs are considering, are experimenting with, or have implemented combinations of traffic based pricing, time of day or "peak" and "off peak" pricing, and bandwidth or traffic caps. Others claim that because the marginal cost of extra bandwidth is very small with 80 to 90 percent of the costs fixed regardless of usage level, that such steps are unnecessary or motivated by concerns other than the cost of delivering bandwidth to the end user.&lt;ref name=Hansell-2008&gt;{{cite news |first=Saul |last=Hansell |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/time-warner-download-too-much-and-you-might-pay-30-a-movie/?ref=technology |title=Time Warner: Download Too Much and You Might Pay $30 a Movie |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 17, 2008 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061232/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/time-warner-download-too-much-and-you-might-pay-30-a-movie/?ref=technology |archivedate=January 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comparebroadband.com.au/article_64_On--and-Off-Peak-Quotas.htm "On- and Off-Peak Quotas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331205209/http://www.comparebroadband.com.au/article_64_On--and-Off-Peak-Quotas.htm |date=2012-03-31 }}, Compare Broadband, 12 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leslie |last=Cauley |title=Comcast opens up about how it manages traffic |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Story?id=4692338&amp;page=1 |publisher=ABC News |date=April 20, 2008 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215205818/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4692338&amp;page=1 |archivedate=February 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bandwidth divide===

Traditionally the divide has been measured in terms of the existing numbers of subscriptions and digital devices ("have and have-not of subscriptions"). Recent studies have measured the digital divide not in terms of technological devices, but in terms of the existing bandwidth per individual (in kbit/s per capita).&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2jp4w5rq | doi=10.1016/j.telpol.2016.01.006 | volume=40 | title=The bad news is that the digital access divide is here to stay: Domestically installed bandwidths among 172 countries for 1986–2014 | year=2016 | journal=Telecommunications Policy | pages=567–581 | last1=Hilbert | first1=Martin | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604191331/http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2jp4w5rq | archivedate=2016-06-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/asi.23020 | volume=65 | title=Technological information inequality as an incessantly moving target: The redistribution of information and communication capacities between 1986 and 2010 | year=2013 | journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology | pages=821–835 | last1=Hilbert | first1=Martin | url=http://martinhilbert.net/TechInfoInequality.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027053254/http://www.martinhilbert.net/TechInfoInequality.pdf | archivedate=2016-10-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the Figure on the side, the digital divide in kbit/s is not monotonically decreasing, but re-opens up with each new innovation. For example, "the massive diffusion of narrow-band Internet and mobile phones during the late 1990s" increased digital inequality, as well as "the initial introduction of broadband DSL and cable modems during 2003–2004 increased levels of inequality".&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt; This is because a new kind of connectivity is never introduced instantaneously and uniformly to society as a whole at once, but diffuses slowly through social networks. As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. [[3G]] and fiber optics [[FTTH]]).&lt;ref&gt;SciDevNet (2014) How mobile phones increased the digital divide; {{cite web |url=http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307214246/http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the Figure, Internet access in terms of bandwidth is more unequally distributed in 2014 as it was in the mid-1990s.

===Rural access===
{{main article|Broadband universal service}}

One of the great challenges for Internet access in general and for broadband access in particular is to provide service to potential customers in areas of low [[population density]], such as to farmers, ranchers, and small towns. In cities where the population density is high, it is easier for a service provider to recover equipment costs, but each rural customer may require expensive equipment to get connected. While 66% of Americans had an Internet connection in 2010, that figure was only 50% in rural areas, according to the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Home-Broadband-2010/Part-1/Broadband-adoption-among-African-Americans-grew-significantly-between-2009-and-2010.aspx |title=Trends in broadband adoption |work=Home Broadband 2010 |first=Aaron |last=Scott |publisher=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project |date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=December 23, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219195728/http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Home-Broadband-2010/Part-1/Broadband-adoption-among-African-Americans-grew-significantly-between-2009-and-2010.aspx |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Virgin Media]] advertised over 100 towns across the [[United Kingdom]] "from [[Cwmbran]] to [[Clydebank]]" that have access to their 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s service.&lt;ref name="100mb"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mediacentre.virginmedia.com/Stories/Virgin-Media-s-ultrafast-100Mb-broadband-now-available-to-over-four-million-UK-homes-211c.aspx |title= Virgin Media’s ultrafast 100Mb broadband now available to over four million UK homes |work= News release |publisher= Virgin Media |date= June 10, 2011 |accessdate= August 18, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120710052836/http://mediacentre.virginmedia.com/Stories/Virgin-Media-s-ultrafast-100Mb-broadband-now-available-to-over-four-million-UK-homes-211c.aspx |archivedate= July 10, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wireless Internet service provider]]s (WISPs) are rapidly becoming a popular broadband option for rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news71497509.html Wireless World: Wi-Fi now in rural areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916103841/http://www.physorg.com/news71497509.html |date=2011-09-16 }} July 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The technology's line-of-sight requirements may hamper connectivity in some areas with hilly and heavily foliated terrain. However, the Tegola project, a successful pilot in remote Scotland, demonstrates that wireless can be a viable option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tegola.org.uk | title=Tegola project linking Skye, Knoydart and Loch Hourne | accessdate=2010-03-16 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015180711/http://www.tegola.org.uk/ | archivedate=2012-10-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Broadband for Rural Nova Scotia initiative]] is the first program in North America to guarantee access to "100% of civic addresses" in a region. It is based on [[Motorola Canopy]] technology. As of November 2011, under 1000 households have reported access problems. Deployment of a new cell network by one Canopy provider ([[EastLink (company)|Eastlink]]) was expected to provide the alternative of 3G/4G service, possibly at a special unmetered rate, for areas harder to serve by Canopy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ns.ca/econ/broadband/ "Broadband for Rural Nova Scotia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519220248/http://www.gov.ns.ca/econ/broadband/ |date=2012-05-19 }}, Economic and Rural Development, Nova Scotia, Canada, access 27 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, a fund has been formed by the government to improve rural broadband,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rural Broadband Initiative 2|url=http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/technology-communications/fast-broadband/new-initiatives/rbi2-mbsf-policy-settings|accessdate=30 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424200803/http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/technology-communications/fast-broadband/new-initiatives/rbi2-mbsf-policy-settings/|archivedate=24 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mobile phone coverage. Current proposals include: (a) extending fibre coverage and upgrading copper to support VDSL, (b) focussing on improving the coverage of cellphone technology, or (c) regional wireless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rural broadband extension bids: Your guide to the RBI2 runners and riders|url=https://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=21425|accessdate=30 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417110115/https://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=21425|archivedate=17 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access as a civil or human right===
{{Further information |Digital rights|Right to Internet access}}

The actions, statements, opinions, and recommendations outlined below have led to the suggestion that Internet access itself is or should become a civil or perhaps a human right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.du.edu/gsis/hrhw/volumes/2004/best-2004.pdf "Can the Internet be a Human Right?"], Michael L.

Several countries have adopted laws requiring the state to work to ensure that Internet access is broadly available and/or preventing the state from unreasonably restricting an individual's access to information and the Internet:
* [[Costa Rica]]: A 30 July 2010 ruling by the Supreme Court of Costa Rica stated: "Without fear of equivocation, it can be said that these technologies [information technology and communication] have impacted the way humans communicate, facilitating the connection between people and institutions worldwide and eliminating barriers of space and time. At this time, access to these technologies becomes a basic tool to facilitate the exercise of fundamental rights and democratic participation (e-democracy) and citizen control, education, freedom of thought and expression, access to information and public services online, the right to communicate with government electronically and administrative transparency, among others. This includes the fundamental right of access to these technologies, in particular, the right of access to the Internet or World Wide Web."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151217120514/http://200.91.68.20/pj/scij/busqueda/jurisprudencia/jur_texto_sentencia.asp?nValor2=483874&amp;tem1=013141&amp;param7=0&amp;lResultado=3&amp;nValor1=1&amp;strTipM=T&amp;strLib=LIB "Judgement 12790 of the Supreme Court"], File 09-013141-0007-CO, 30 July 2010.

:1. We, the representatives of the peoples of the world, assembled in Geneva from 10–12 December 2003 for the first phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, declare our common desire and commitment to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life, premised on the purposes and principles of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] and respecting fully and upholding the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

:3. We reaffirm the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the [[right to development]], as enshrined in the [[Vienna Declaration]]. We also reaffirm that [[democracy]], [[sustainable development]], and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as good governance at all levels are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. We further resolve to strengthen the rule of law in international as in national affairs.

The [[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]] Declaration of Principles makes specific reference to the importance of the right to [[freedom of expression]] in the "[[information society|Information Society]]" in stating:
:4. We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the [[information society|Information Society]], and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of opinion and expression]]; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers."&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt;

The 88 recommendations made by the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in a May 2011 report to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] include several that bear on the question of the right to Internet access:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf "VI. Conclusions and recommendations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402152208/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf |date=2012-04-02 }}, ''Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue'', Human Rights Council, Seventeenth session
Agenda item 3, United Nations General Assembly, 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
:67. Unlike any other medium, the Internet enables individuals to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds instantaneously and inexpensively across national borders. By vastly expanding the capacity of individuals to enjoy their right to freedom of opinion and expression, which is an “enabler” of other human rights, the Internet boosts economic, social and political development, and contributes to the progress of humankind as a whole. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages other Special Procedures mandate holders to engage on the issue of the Internet with respect to their particular mandates.

:78. While blocking and filtering measures deny users access to specific content on the Internet, States have also taken measures to cut off access to the Internet entirely. The Special Rapporteur considers cutting off users from Internet access, regardless of the justification provided, including on the grounds of violating intellectual property rights law, to be disproportionate and thus a violation of article 19, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

:79. The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to ensure that Internet access is maintained at all times, including during times of political unrest.

:85. Given that the Internet has become an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human progress, ensuring universal access to the Internet should be a priority for all States. Each State should thus develop a concrete and effective policy, in consultation with individuals from all sections of society, including the private sector and relevant Government ministries, to make the Internet widely available, accessible and affordable to all segments of population.

===Network neutrality===
{{Net neutrality}}
{{main article |Net neutrality }}

Network neutrality (also net neutrality, Internet neutrality, or net equality) is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF|title=Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination|publisher=Journal on telecom and high tech law|author=Tim Wu|year=2003|accessdate=23 Apr 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424062409/http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF|archivedate=2014-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kraemer-def&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krämer | first1 = J | last2 = Wiewiorra | first2 = L. | last3 = Weinhardt | first3 = C. | year = 2013 | title = Net Neutrality: A progress report | url = http://www.im.uni-karlsruhe.de/Upload/Publications/336c39b3-7a62-4159-bb1a-483f39dd5b24.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 37 | issue = 9 | pages = 794–813 | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.08.005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6YjuB9cRc?url=http://www.im.uni-karlsruhe.de/Upload/Publications/336c39b3-7a62-4159-bb1a-483f39dd5b24.pdf | archivedate = 2015-05-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berners-lee-def"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/144 |title=Net Neutrality: This is serious |accessdate=26 December 2008 |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee |date=21 June 2006 |work=timbl's blog |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227100511/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/144 |archivedate=27 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nn-for-google-users"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |url= https://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html |title=A Guide to Net Neutrality for Google Users |accessdate=7 December 2008 |publisher=[[Google]] |deadurl=yes |archivedate=1 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901084929/https://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of net neutrality have raised concerns about the ability of broadband providers to use their [[last mile]] infrastructure to block Internet applications and content (e.g. websites, services, and protocols), and even to block out competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. 1999.

==Natural disasters and access==

Natural disasters disrupt internet access in profound ways. This is important—not only for telecommunication companies who own the networks and the businesses who use them, but for emergency crew and displaced citizens as well. The situation is worsened when hospitals or other buildings necessary to disaster response lose their connection. Knowledge gained from studying past internet disruptions by natural disasters could be put to use in planning or recovery. Additionally, because of both natural and man-made disasters, studies in network resiliency are now being conducted to prevent large-scale outages.&lt;ref name="omer"&gt;[http://www.stevens-tech.edu/csr/fileadmin/csr/Publications/Omer_Measuring_the_Resilience_of_the_Global_Internet__Infrastructure.pdf Measuring the Resilience of the Global Internet Infrastructure System]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2009 3rd Annual IEEE Systems Conference, 156–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

One way natural disasters impact internet connection is by damaging end sub-networks (subnets), making them unreachable. A study on local networks after [[Hurricane Katrina]] found that 26% of subnets within the storm coverage were unreachable.&lt;ref name="Erjongmanee"&gt;[http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~jic/katrina.pdf Inference of Network-Service Disruption upon Natural Disasters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523173124/http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~jic/katrina.pdf |date=2013-05-23 }}, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At Hurricane Katrina’s peak intensity, almost 35% of networks in Mississippi were without power, while around 14% of Louisiana’s networks were disrupted.&lt;ref name="Katrina"&gt;[http://www.renesys.com/tech/presentations/pdf/Renesys-Katrina-Report-9sep2005.pdf Impact of Hurricane Katrina on Internet Infrastructure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115094240/http://www.renesys.com/tech/presentations/pdf/Renesys-Katrina-Report-9sep2005.pdf |date=2012-11-15 }}, Renesys Report, 9 September 2005, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those unreachable subnets, 73% were disrupted for four weeks or longer and 57% were at “network edges where important emergency organizations such as hospitals and government agencies are mostly located”.&lt;ref name="Erjongmanee" /&gt; Extensive infrastructure damage and inaccessible areas were two explanations for the long delay in returning service.&lt;ref name="Erjongmanee" /&gt; The company Cisco has revealed a Network Emergency Response Vehicle (NERV), a truck that makes portable communications possible for emergency responders despite traditional networks being disrupted.&lt;ref name="NERV"&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/business&amp;id=8867345 Cisco trucks help restore internet after disasters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303132941/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news%2Fbusiness&amp;id=8867345 |date=2013-03-03 }}, ABC News report, 30 October 2012, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second way natural disasters destroy internet connectivity is by severing submarine cables—fiber-optic cables placed on the ocean floor that provide international internet connection. A [[2006 Hengchun earthquakes|sequence of undersea earthquakes]] cut six out of seven international cables connected to that country and caused a tsunami that wiped out one of its cable and landing stations.&lt;ref name="telkom"&gt;[http://www.telkom.co.id/media-corner/press-release/taiwan-s-earthquake-and-tsunami-caused-internet-access-s-interference.html Taiwan’s Earthquake and Tsunami Caused Internet access’s Interference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605104155/http://www.telkom.co.id/media-corner/press-release/taiwan-s-earthquake-and-tsunami-caused-internet-access-s-interference.html |date=2013-06-05 }}, Telkom Indonesia Press Release, 27 December 2006, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HKUST"&gt;[http://www.ust.hk/itsc/channel/2007feb/earthquake.html Impact of Taiwan Earthquake on Internet Access] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228000932/http://www.ust.hk/itsc/channel/2007feb/earthquake.html |date=2008-12-28 }}, Choy, C.

With the rise in popularity of [[cloud computing]], concern has grown over access to cloud-hosted data in the event of a natural disaster. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been in the news for major network outages in April 2011 and June 2012.&lt;ref name="AWS2011"&gt;[http://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/ Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907143711/https://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/ |date=2013-09-07 }}, AWS message, 29 April 2011, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWS2012"&gt;[https://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/ Summary of the AWS Service Event in the US East Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724051708/http://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/ |date=2013-07-24 }}, AWS message, 2 July 2012, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; AWS, like other major cloud hosting companies, prepares for typical outages and large-scale natural disasters with backup power as well as backup data centers in other locations. AWS divides the globe into five regions and then splits each region into availability zones. A data center in one availability zone should be backed up by a data center in a different availability zone. Theoretically, a natural disaster would not affect more than one availability zone.&lt;ref name="justinsb"&gt;[http://justinsb.posterous.com/aws-down-why-the-sky-is-falling AWS is down: Why the sky is falling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223213308/http://justinsb.posterous.com/aws-down-why-the-sky-is-falling |date=2012-12-23 }}, justinsb's posterous, 21 April 2011, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory plays out as long as human error is not added to the mix.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29295">'''Judicial independence''' is the concept that the [[judiciary]] should be independent from the other [[Separation of powers|branches of government]]. That is, [[court]]s should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government or from private or partisan interests. Judicial independence is important to the idea of [[separation of powers]].

Different countries deal with the idea of judicial independence through different means of judicial selection, or choosing [[judge]]s. One way to promote judicial independence is by granting [[life tenure]] or long tenure for judges, which ideally frees them to decide [[Legal case|cases]] and make [[Court order|rulings]] according to the [[rule of law]] and [[judicial discretion]], even if those decisions are politically unpopular or opposed by powerful interests. This concept can be traced back to 18th-century England.

In some countries, the ability of the judiciary to check the legislature is enhanced by the power of [[judicial review]]. This power can be used, for example, by mandating certain action when the judiciary perceives that a branch of government is refusing to perform a constitutional duty or by declaring laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional.

==Theory of judicial independence==
[[File:Hamilton small.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], by portraitist Daniel Huntington ''c.'' 1865. In ''[[Federalist No. 78|The Federalist No. 78]]'', published 28 May 1788, Hamilton wrote: "The complete independence of the courts of justice is particularly essential in a limited constitution."]]

===Importance===
Judicial independence serves as a safeguard for the rights and privileges provided by a limited constitution and prevents [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature|legislative]] encroachment upon those rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Alexander Hamilton|authorlink=Alexander Hamilton|contribution=The Federalist No. 78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-7DDxR-3KQC&amp;pg=PA524|editor=Jacob E. Cooke, ed.|title=The Federalist|location=Middletown, Conn.|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|year=1982|origyear=1961|pages=521–530 at 524|isbn=978-0-819-53016-5|quote=The complete independence of the courts of justice is particularly essential in a limited constitution. By a limited constitution I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority ... Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice; whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a foundation for the [[rule of law]] and [[democracy]]. The rule of law means that all authority and power must come from an ultimate source of law. Under an independent judicial system, the courts and its officers are free from inappropriate intervention in the [[judiciary]]'s affairs. With this independence, the judiciary can safeguard people's rights and freedoms which ensure equal protection for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Li-ann Thio|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|chapter=Rule of Law within a Non-liberal 'Communitarian' Democracy: The Singapore Experience|editor=Randall Peerenboom, ed.|title=Asian Discourses of Rule of Law: Theories and Implementation of Rule of Law in Twelve Asian Countries, France and the U.S.|location=London; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Routledge|RoutledgeCurzon]]|year=2004|pages=183–224 at 188|isbn=978-0-415-32613-1|quote=As the partisan administration of law erodes rule of law, a central institutional requirement is an independent, accessible judiciary.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of the law and the respect that people have for the law and the government which enacts it is dependent upon the judiciary's independence to mete out fair decisions. Furthermore, it is a pillar of economic growth as multinational businesses and investors have confidence to invest in the economy of a nation who has a strong and stable judiciary that is independent of interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Roger K. Warren|title=The Importance of Judicial Independence and Accountability|url=https://ncsc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/judicial/id/207/download |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Center for State Courts]]|date=January 2003 |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111072722/https://ncsc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/judicial/id/207/download |archive-date=11 November 2018 |ref=CITEREFWarren (2003)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judiciary's role in deciding the validity of presidential and parliamentary elections also necessitates independence of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 93A, and the {{Singapore legislation|title=Presidential Elections Act|cap=204A|ed=2007}}, ss. 71–80; and the {{Singapore legislation|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|cap=218|ed=2007}}, ss. 92–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
The disadvantages of having a judiciary that is seemingly too independent include possible abuse of power by judges. Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any [[separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=2–3}} The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and interdependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=3–5}}

Also, an extremely independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, which is the duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or harm. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=4-5}}

==Economic basis==
[[Constitutional economics]] studies issues such as the proper distribution of national wealth including government spending on the judiciary. In transitional and developing countries, spending on the judiciary may be controlled by the executive. This undermines the principle of judicial independence because it creates a financial dependence of the judiciary on the executive. It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and privileges) being the most dangerous, and private. State corruption of the judiciary can impede the ability of businesses to optimally facilitate the growth and development of a [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, the constitution also prohibits the legislative branch from reducing salaries of sitting judges.

==Development of the concept==

===National and international developments===

The development of judicial independence has been argued to involve a cycle of national law having an impact on international law, and international law subsequently impacting national law.&lt;ref name=Shetreet2009&gt;S Shetreet, ‘The Normative Cycle of Shaping Judicial Independence in Domestic and International Law: The Mutual Impact of National and International Jurisprudence and Contemporary Practical and Conceptual Challenges’ (2009) 10 Chicago Journal of International Law 275-332&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to occur in three phases: the first phase is characterized by the domestic development of the concept of judicial independence, the second by the spread of these concepts internationally and their implementation in international law, and the third by the implementation in national law of these newly formulated international principles of judicial independence.&lt;ref name=Shetreet2009/&gt;

A notable example illustrating this cycle is the United Kingdom. The first phase occurred in England with the original conception of judicial independence in the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally Shimon Shetreet book, Judges on Trial.&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase was evident when England’s concepts regarding judicial independence spread internationally, and were adopted into the domestic law of other countries; for instance, England served as the model for Montesquieu’s [[separation of powers]] doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;See Baron de Montesquieu, The Sfdfsdfpirit of the Laws (Hafner 1949) (Thomas Nugent, trans).&lt;/ref&gt; and the Founding Fathers of the [[US Constitution]] used England as their dominant model in formulating the Constitution’s Article III, which is the foundation of American judicial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Article III of the US Constitution provides that “the judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.”&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[common law]] countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, also adopted the British model of judicial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Shetreet, Judicial Independence. See also Peter H. Russell, The Judiciary in Canada: The Third Branch of Government (McGraw-Hill Ryerson 1987); John Bell, Judicial Cultures and Judicial Independence, 4 Cambridge YB Eur Legal Studies 47 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades the third phase of judicial independence has been evident in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;UK Human Rights Act - 1998&lt;/ref&gt; as it has been significantly influenced by judicial independence principles developed by international human rights constitutional documents. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) has had a significant impact on the conceptual analysis of judicial independence in England and Scotland. This process began in the 1990s with the ECtHR hearing UK cases and, more significantly, in the application of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in British law through the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which came into force in the UK in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Act (1998), ch 42 (UK), available online at &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901121920/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |archivedate=2010-09-01 |df= }}&gt; (visited Mar 27, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where British national law had previously impacted the international development of judicial independence, the British [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]]&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Reform Act (2005), ch 4 (UK). For a detailed analysis of the history of this act, see Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: The Politics of Constitutional Reform, 2006 Pub L 35; Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: Ministers, Judges and Constitutional Change, 2005 Pub L 806. For accounts of the main players, see Lord Woolf, The Pursuit of Justice 161–74 (Oxford 2008); Lord Phillips, Constitutional Reform: One Year On, The Judicial Studies Board Annual Lecture (Mar 22, 2007); Lord Woolf, The Rule of Law and a Change in the Constitution, 2004 Camb L J 317; Tom Bingham, The Business of Judging: Selected Essays and Speeches 55–68 (Oxford 2000). All three authors served as lord chief justice in these formative years. Lord Woolf was active in the shaping of the legislation and Lord Phillips succeeded him&lt;/ref&gt; marked a shift, with international law now impacting British domestic law. The Constitutional Reform Act dramatically reformed government control over the administration of justice in England and Wales; importantly, it discontinued the position of the [[Lord Chancellor]], one of the country’s oldest constitutional offices, who was entrusted with a combination of legislative, executive, and judicial capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chancellor served as speaker of the Upper House of Parliament, the [[House of Lords]]; as a member of the executive branch and member of the senior cabinet; and as the head of the judiciary. Historically, the appellate function had a connection with the executive branch due to the types of cases typically heard – impeachment and the hearing of felony charges against peers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stevens, Law and Politics: The House of Lords as a Judicial Body, 1800-1976 (University of North Carolina Press, 1978), at 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Reform Act established new lines of demarcation between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary, transferring all the judicial functions to the judiciary and entrusting the Lord Chancellor only with what are considered administrative and executive matters. In addition, the Constitutional Reform Act replaced the Lord Chancellor by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] as head of the judiciary, separated the judicial [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] from the legislative parliament, reforming it as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], and creating a [[Judicial Appointments Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the Supreme Court was important, for it finally separated the highest court of appeal from the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the United Kingdom, where judicial independence began over three hundred years ago, illustrates the interaction over time of national and international law and jurisprudence in the area of judicial independence. In this process, concepts and ideas have become enriched as they have been implemented in successive judicial and political systems, as each system has enhanced and deepened the concepts and ideas it actualized. In addition to the UK, similar developments of conceptual cross-fertilization can be seen internationally, for example in [[European Union law]],&lt;ref&gt;See Treaty on European Union, art F, 1992 OJ (C 191) 1 (Jul 29, 1992). Paragraph 2 of Article F states, “The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . . . and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.”&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries such as Austria, and in other common law jurisdictions including Canada.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Valente v The Queen, [1985] 2 SCR 673 (Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;

===International standards===
The [[International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace]] produced the Mt. Scopus International Standards of Judicial Independence between 2007 and 2012. These built on the same association's New Delhi Minimum Standards on Judicial independence adopted in 1982 and their Montréal Universal Declaration on the Independence of Justice in 1983. Other influences they cite for the standards include the UN Basic Principles of Judicial Independence from 1985, the Burgh House Principles of Judicial Independence in International Law (for the international judiciary), Tokyo Law Asia Principles, Council of Europe Statements on judicial independence (particularly the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the independence, efficiency and role of judges), the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct 2002, and the American Bar Association's revision of its ethical standards for judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mt. Scopus Approved Revised International Standards of Judicial Independence Approved March 19, 2008|url=http://www.jiwp.org/#!mt-scopus-standards/c14de|publisher=International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace - International Project of judicial independence|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The justice system===

In recent years, the principle of judicial independence has been described as one of the core values of the justice system.&lt;ref&gt;Shimon Shetreet, Fundamental Values of the Justice System, 23 THE EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW REVIEW 61-76, (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
[[Canada]] has a level of judicial independence entrenched in its [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], awarding superior court justices various guarantees to independence under sections 96 to 100 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. These include rights to tenure (although the Constitution has since been amended to introduce mandatory retirement at age 75) and the right to a salary determined by the [[Parliament of Canada]] (as opposed to the executive). In 1982 a measure of judicial independence was extended to inferior courts specializing in [[criminal law]] (but not [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]) by [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], although in the 1986 case ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'' it was found these rights are limited. They do, however, involve tenure, financial security and some administrative control.

The year 1997 saw a major shift towards judicial independence, as the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the [[Provincial Judges Reference]] found an unwritten constitutional norm guaranteeing judicial independence to all judges, including civil law inferior court judges. The unwritten norm is said to be implied by the [[preamble]] to the Constitution Act, 1867. Consequently, judicial compensation committees such as the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]] now recommend judicial salaries in Canada.
There are two types of judicial independence: institutional independence and decisional independence. Institutional independence means the judicial branch is independent from the executive and legislative branches. Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.

== Hong Kong ==
In [[Hong Kong]], independence of the judiciary has been the tradition since the territory became a British crown colony in 1842. After the 1997 transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the [[People's Republic of China]] pursuant to the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], an international treaty registered with the [[United Nations]], independence of the judiciary, along with continuation of English [[common law]], has been enshrined in the territory's constitutional document, the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html "The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China"- Chapter 1], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008. Retrieved 2016-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html#section_4 "The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China"- Chapter 4, Section 4], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008. Retrieved 2016-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singapore ==
{{main|Judicial independence in Singapore}}
Judicial independence in Singapore is protected by the [[Constitution of Singapore]], statutes such as the State Courts Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act, and the [[common law]]. To safeguard judicial independence, [[law of Singapore|Singapore law]] lays down special procedures to be followed before the conduct of [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] [[judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore#The Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal, and Judges and Judicial Commissioners of the High Court|judges]] may be discussed in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|State Courts]], and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases in which they are personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges.

The [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] and other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the [[President of Singapore]] acting on the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore]]. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet's advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy [[security of tenure]] up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis.

===England and Wales===
{{main|Judiciary of England and Wales}}
====History====
During the [[middle ages]], under the Norman monarchy of the [[Kingdom of England]], the king and his [[Curia Regis]] held judicial power. Judicial independence began to emerge during the [[early modern period]]; more courts were created and a judicial profession grew. By the fifteenth century, the king's role in this feature of government became small.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Gerard La Forest]], [[Provincial Judges Reference]], [[Supreme Court of Canada]], para. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, kings could still influence courts and dismiss judges. The [[Stuart dynasty]] used this power frequently in order to overpower the [[Parliament of England]]. After the Stuarts were removed in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, some advocated guarding against royal manipulation of the judiciary. King [[William III of England|William III]] approved the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which established tenure for judges unless Parliament removed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justice Gerard La Forest, Provincial Judges Reference, para. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary usage====
Under the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], there are two important [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] which help to preserve judicial independence. The first is that the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] does not comment on the cases which are before the court. The second is the principle of [[parliamentary privilege]]: that [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] are protected from prosecution in certain circumstances by the courts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Furthermore, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitutional reform|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/constitutional-reform/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to try to promote the independence of the judiciary, the selection process is designed to minimize political interference. The process focuses on senior members of the judiciary rather than on politicians. Part 2 of the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] aims to increase [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among the judiciary.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The pay of judges is determined by an independent pay review body. It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence from a variety of sources. The government accepts these recommendations and will traditionally implement them fully. As long as judges hold their positions in "good order," they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the [[mandatory retirement]] age of 70.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Until 1 January 2010, the legal profession was self-regulating; with responsibility for implementing and enforcing its own professional standards and disciplining its own members. The bodies which performed this function were the [[Bar Council]] and the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]]. However, this self-regulation came to an end when approved regulators came under the regulation of the [[Legal Services Board]], composed of non-lawyers, following the passage of the [[Legal Services Act 2007]]. This saw the establishment of the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]] to regulate [[solicitor]]s and the [[Bar Standards Board]] to regulate [[barrister]]s.&lt;ref name="legal_serves_act_2007"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Legal Services Act 2007|chapter=29|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States of America==

===Federal courts===
[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the [[United States Constitution]] establishes the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] as part of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]].

The Constitution provides that [[United States federal judge|federal judges]], including judges of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] "by and with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]." Once appointed, federal judges:

{{quote|...both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.}}

Federal judges vacate office only upon death, resignation, or [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment and removal from office]] by [[United States Congress|Congress]]; only 13 federal judges have ever been impeached. The phrase "during good behavior" predates the Declaration of Independence. [[John Adams]] equated it with ''quamdiu se bene gesserint'' in a letter to the [[Boston Gazette]] published on 11 January 1773,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of John Adams, Vol 3|last=Adams|first=John|year=1851|publisher=Little and Brown|place=Boston|page=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that first appeared in section 3 of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] in England.

The President is free to appoint any person to the federal bench, yet typically he consults with the [[American Bar Association]], whose Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rates each nominee "Well Qualified," "Qualified" or "Not Qualified."

===State courts===
[[State court (United States)|State courts]] deal with independence of the judiciary in many ways, and several forms of judicial selection are used for both [[trial court]]s and [[appellate court]]s (including [[state supreme court]]s), varying between states and sometimes within states. In some [[U.S. state|states]], judges are elected (sometime on a partisan ballot, other times on a [[nonpartisan]] one), while in others they are appointed by the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].

The 2000 case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', in which a majority of the Supreme Court, including some appointees of President George H. W. Bush, overruled challenges to the election of the [[George W. Bush]] then pending in the [[Florida Supreme Court]], whose members had all been appointed by Democratic governors, is seen by many as reinforcing the need for judicial independence, both with regard to the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court. This case has increased focus and attention on judicial outcomes as opposed to the traditional focus on judicial qualifications.

'''Kelemedi Rakuve Bulewa''' {{IPA-fj|ke le me ndi mbu le wa|}} (May 16, 1951 – 2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daurewa|first1=Alisi Waqanika|title=Is there truth in Fijian history?|url=http://vutikalulu.blogspot.co.nz/|website=Vutikalulu|accessdate=30 October 2015|date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Fiji]]an lawyer and former politician, who served as [[Attorney General of Fiji]] from 1992 to 1996. 

Bulewa was known for his strongly pro-[[Fijians|ethnic Fijian]] views and was often associated with the nationalist [[Taukei movement]] that was supportive of the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|1987 coups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lal|first1=Brij V.|title=In the Eye of the Storm: Jai Ram Reddy and the Politics of Postcolonial Fiji|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=tzqfQ6Q2rwUC&amp;pg=PA573&amp;lpg=PA573&amp;dq=%22Kelemedi+Bulewa%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0UqJK-WIE4&amp;sig=HHq6YhPN0JG9xR00-H5jjcna71s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwB2oVChMI7uDf4prqyAIVhJ2UCh0T3g8z#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kelemedi%20Bulewa%22&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=ANU E Press, 2010|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bulewa was elected to the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]] in the [[Fijian general election, 1992|1992 election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of the House of Representatives|url=http://www.appf.org.pe/countries/fiji/houser/members.htm|website=House of Representatives Members|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first post-coup election, and was appointed Attorney General later that year upon the resignation of [[Apaitia Seru]].

Bulewa disagreed with, and attempted to change, laws dating from [[Colony of Fiji|colonial times]], that repressed the practice of the pre-Christian Fijian religion, saying that while he was not advocating it, he believed that freedom to practice it should be allowed for. Although most [[Fijians]] were now Christians, he said, many had only reluctantly abandoned worship of their ancestral gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newson|first1=Leanne|last2=Aldous|first2=Jules|title=The Legal Maze: VCE Units 1 &amp; 2|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=C6PN-8VcYcAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Kelemedi+Bulewa%22+%2B+%22died%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6L_dMU7W-0&amp;sig=GP3PHKL0zF5b0SPrkL1R_OudLpg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwA2oVChMIgdz4spvqyAIVwrqUCh3FcAwz#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kelemedi%20Bulewa%22%20%2B%20%22died%22&amp;f=false|website=The Legal Maze: VCE Units 1 &amp; 2|publisher=Macmillan Education AU, 2005|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''law school of Beirut''' (also known as the '''law school of Berytus''' and the '''school of Roman law at Berytus''') was a center for the study of [[Roman law]] in [[classical antiquity]] located in [[Beirut]] ({{Lang-la|Berytus}}). It flourished under the patronage of the [[Roman emperor]]s and functioned as the [[Roman Empire]]'s preeminent center of [[jurisprudence]] until its destruction in AD 551.

The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial [[Constitution (Roman law)|constitutions]] and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of [[jurist]]s in referring to legal [[precedent]]s. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure, but probably it was under [[Augustus]] in the first century. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 AD, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]]. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the "Mother of Laws". Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] shut down other provincial law schools.

The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical legal texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of [[Phoenicia|Phoenicia Maritima]] and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.

The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a [[551 Beirut earthquake|massive earthquake]] that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to [[Sidon]] but did not survive the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] of 635 AD. Ancient texts attest that the school was next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the [[Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Beirut Central District|Beirut's historic center]].

==Background==
As the guarantor of justice, the [[Roman emperor]] was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|chief magistrate]] whose major prerogative (''[[Ius|jus]]'') was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"&gt;Walker 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and [[Roman governor|governors]], the emperors were careful to consult with the [[jurist]]s (''iuris consulti''), who were usually secretaries drafted from the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrian order]]. From the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial [[edict]]s (''constitutiones''), and legal scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored legal scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the [[Western world]], aimed specifically at training professional jurists.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"/&gt;

==History==
During the reign of Augustus, [[Beirut]] was established under the name ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Named after Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charnock 1859, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; (and granted the status of ''[[Ius Italicum]]'') as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] for [[Battle of Actium]] veterans from the [[Legio V Macedonica|fifth Macedonian]] and the [[Legio III Gallica|third Gallic]] legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], which had a history of belligerence against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1107/features/beirut_lebanon_urban_archaeology.html | title=Rebuilding Beirut |author=Lawler, Andrew | journal=Archaeology |date=July–August 2011 | volume=64 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. George's Cathedral, Beirut.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large church at the edge of an archaeological field.|St. George's Cathedral sits on the axis of Beirut's ancient [[Cardo|Cardo Maximus]]. The law school used to be located next to the Byzantine Anastasis church, a precursor of the cathedral.]]
Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239 works of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]], the bishop of [[Niksar|Neo-Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaumaturgus 239, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. [[Edward Gibbon]] suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor [[Alexander Severus]], who reigned during AD 222–235;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon 1854, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; this hypothesis had been supported by [[Gilles Ménage]], a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]], however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian [[Karl Hase]] advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 16–20&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;Rudorff  1857, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer 1868, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Mommsen]] linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[publishing|published]] and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 AD, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the [[Codex Gregorianus|Gregorian Codex]], but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen 1901, pp. 139–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Alexandria]] lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd-century emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jidejian 1973, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, the Greek [[rhetoric]]ian [[Libanius]] reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of [[Latin]], which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark 2011, p. 36"&gt;Clark 2011, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174"&gt;Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of legal learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed “ecumenical masters”.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy 2012, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; From 425, the law school of [[Constantinople]] became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after [[Justinian I]] closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and [[Athens]] in 529&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt; because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle 2008, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high-magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a [[tsunami]] and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of [[Sidon]], pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 AD when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 635 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 54–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to [[Roman law]]; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.

===Preparatory studies===
Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical legal references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===

Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the 5th century. The ''[[Scholia Sinaitica]]'' and the ''[[Scholia]]'' to the ''[[Basilika|Basilica]]'' provide glimpses of the school's [[teaching method]], comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze legal texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as [[Ulpian]]. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut,&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt; which was the long-established [[lingua franca]] of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks 2009, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;

The ''Omnem'' constitution at the beginning of the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] is the only source of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], Ulpian, [[Aemilius Papinianus|Papinian]] and [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]]. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' ''[[Responsa]]''; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, ''Dupondii''; second, ''Edictales''; third, ''Papinianistae''; fourth, ''Lytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 224–240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard 1999, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian's ''Omnem'' constitution fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years.&lt;ref name="Corcoran"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | title=Law-school texts after 533 | publisher=University College London | work=The Epitome of Julian | date=July 20, 2009 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 | author=Corcoran, Simon | authorlink=Simon Corcoran | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106095259/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | archivedate=November 6, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"&gt;Monro 1872, pp. xviii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', namely the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'' (Institutes), ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'' (Digest) and ''[[Codex Justinianus|Codex]]'' (Code).&lt;ref name="Corcoran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on the first part of the Digest;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 1–4 of the Digest are called the ''Prota''.&lt;/ref&gt; second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The ''de iudiciis'' (books 5–11), the ''de rebus'' (books 12–19) and  the ''libri singularis'' (books 23, 26, 28 and 30).&lt;/ref&gt; and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the ''leges singulares''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 24, 25, 27, 29 and 31–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous ''Dupondii'' (which means "two pennies") to ''Iustiniani novi'' and dubbed fifth-year students ''Prolytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckland 1921, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;

===Professorial body===
Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, works of legal scholarship, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.

[[Antioch]]-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a 4th-century law school professor. In 360, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500, was known as the era of the "Ecumenical Masters" (Greek: τῆς οἰκουμένης διδάσκαλοι). During this period, a succession of seven highly esteemed law masters was largely responsible for the revival of legal education in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The seven revered masters, cited with praise by 6th-century scholars, were [[Cyrillus]], [[Patricius (jurist)|Patricius]], [[Domninus (jurist)|Domninus]], [[Demosthenes (jurist)|Demosthenes]], [[Eudoxius (jurist)|Eudoxius]], [[Leontius (jurist)|Leontius]] and [[Amblichus]].&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"/&gt;

Cyrillus was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt; He is believed to have taught as of {{circa|lk=no|400}} or {{circa|lk=no|410}}. Styled "the great" due to his reputation as a teacher, he was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions that supplied the materials for many important ''scholia'' appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the ''Basilica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cyrillus |volume=7 |page=706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;
Patricius was praised in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (''Tanta-Dedoken'') as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius.&lt;ref&gt;Jalabert 1906, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 132–138&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], who was his first-year student in 487 or 488, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian prefect of the East]] under Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] between 503 and 504, and became [[Magister militum]] in 528. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 141–154&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's ''Libri ad Edictum''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the "Ecumenical Masters". Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460 religious controversy caused by [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timothy Aelurus]], which opposed the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] to the followers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]], Anatolius (son of Leontius) and Julianus were school professors contemporary to Justinian I. The first two were summoned to the imperial court and commissioned to draft the ''Digesta''. Under the supervision of [[Tribonian]], Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus, a Constantinopolitan law teacher, in drafting the ''Institutiones''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 186–189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest2"&gt;Monro 1872, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus, the last known professor of Beirut's law school, was extolled by Theaetetus as "the light of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Pringsheim 1921, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; After the earthquake, Julianus left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Epitome Iuliani]]'' in 555.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the [[Praeses|governor]] of Phoenicia Maritima.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable students===
While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.

According to [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the 3rd century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the [[presbyter]] of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers [[Aphian]] and [[Aedesius of Alexandria|Aedesius]], born to a noble [[Lycia]]n family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-century historian [[Eunapius]] wrote of [[Anatolius]], a high-ranking Roman official known to his enemies as ''Azutrio''. Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, [[vicarius]] of the [[Diocese of Asia]], [[proconsul]] of Constantinople, [[List of urban prefects of Constantinople|urban prefect of Constantinople]] in 354, and [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Praetorian prefect of Illyricum]] until his death in 360. In his account of Anatolius, Eunapius summarized: "He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies".&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eunapius 1596, pp. 148–151&lt;/ref&gt;
Libanius' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the law school of Beirut; Gaianus became the [[List of Roman governors of Syria#Consularis Governors of Syria Phoenicia (c. 295 to c. 395)|consular governor of Phoenicia]] in 362.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gaza City|Gazan]] lawyer and church historian [[Sozomen]], also a law student at Beirut, wrote in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' about [[Triphyllius]], a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received legal training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher [[Saint Spyridon]] for his [[atticism]] and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"/&gt;

Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492, then worked as a lawyer in Constantinople until his imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of [[Mytilene]]. Among Rhetor's works is the biography of [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]], the last miaphysite patriarch of Antioch and one of the founders of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who had also been a law student in Beirut as of 486.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 46–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7"&gt;Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Another late 5th-century student was [[John Rufus]], an anti-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] priest who moved to [[Maiuma]] after the expulsion of his master, [[Peter the Fuller]]. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the ''Plerophoriae'' and the ''Life of [[Peter the Iberian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sterk 2009, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Historically, Roman ''stationes'' or ''auditoria'', where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350,&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; but the description does not specify its location. In the 5th century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 63–73&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, archaeological excavations in the [[souq]] between the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and [[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites]] unearthed a funerary [[stele]] etched with an epitaph to a man named Patricius, "whose career was consecrated for the study of law".&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The epitaph was identified as being dedicated to the famous 5th-century law school professor.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 61–73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in [[Beirut Central District]]'s Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to an area of {{convert|316|m2|sqft}} and failed to unearth the interred school.&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skaf 2005, pp. 224–229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and legacy==

The law school of Beirut supplied the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson 2004, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 by Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]]. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern [[praetorian prefect]]ure had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 454–455&lt;/ref&gt;

The in-depth studies of the classical legal works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's legal reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical legal texts, the imperial laws of the late 5th and early 6th centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early [[Postclassical Era]], according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel 1973, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuz"&gt;Schulz 1967, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"/&gt; His 533 ''Omnem'' constitution read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 3rd century, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], [[Severus of Antioch]] and [[Aphian]]. Under [[Cyrillus]], the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the legal training.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attridge  1992, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his ''Tanta'' constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian,&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534. The ''Tanta'' passage reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and quæstorian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus,we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...&lt;ref name="digest2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the [[Byzantine law]] and the [[Western law|Western legal tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 1995, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted "a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time."&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digesto 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Title page of an old book with ornate decorative motifs depicting a mermaid, a merman and various other creatures surrounding the Title text |Title page of a late 16th-century edition of the ''Digesta'', part of Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'']]
The ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' remained the basis of Byzantine law until the publication of the ''[[Byzantine law#Ecloga|Ecloga legum]]'' in 741 by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and his son and co-regent [[Constantine V]]. The ''Ecloga'' was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with [[Christian values]]. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 35"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192"&gt;Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Basil I]], who ruled in the 9th century, issued the ''Prochiron'' and the ''Epanagoge'', which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restoring the Justinian laws.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 405"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91"&gt;Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prochiron'' served as the basis for the legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, [[Saint Sava]]. His legal compilation was intended for the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian church]] but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches.&lt;ref name="Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307"&gt;Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; Around 900, Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] commissioned the ''Basilica'', a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, pp. 35–36"&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the legal history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and lay forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070.&lt;ref name="Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300"&gt;Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; In 1088, [[Irnerius]], a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in [[Bologna]], was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these "[[glossator]]s" spread to the universities and law courts of Europe.&lt;ref name="Evans 2005, p. 25"&gt;Evans 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 2"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 128"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The reputation of Beirut as "mother of laws" reemerged in modern times.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; In 1913, [[Paul Huvelin]], the first dean of the newly established [[Saint Joseph University|Université Saint-Joseph]]'s Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical law school of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 199"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the Beirut Bar Association, founded in 1919.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; It is also featured in the seal and flag of the Municipality of Beirut.&lt;ref name="log"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://beirut.gov.lb/ | title = Beirut Official Website | publisher = Municipality of Beirut | accessdate = June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal archaeology''' is an area of legal scholarship "involving detailed historical reconstruction and analysis of important cases." &lt;ref name = &gt;Charles L. Knapp, Nathan M. Crystal, and Harry G. Prince, ''Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials: Fifth Edition'', pp. 749-50, Aspen Publishers, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

While most legal scholars confine their research to published opinions of court cases, legal archaeologists examine the historical and social context in which a court case was decided. These facts may show what social and cultural forces were at work in a particular case. Professors can use legal archaeology to "sensitize students as to how inequality, specifically with regard to race, gender and class affects what occurs throughout the cases they study." &lt;ref name = Vogel&gt;Joan Vogel, ''Cases in Context: Lake Champlain Wars, Gentrification, and Ploof v. Putnam'', 45 St. Louis U. L. J. 791, 792.&lt;/ref&gt; A legal archaeologist might also research biographical material on the judges, attorneys, and parties to a court case. Such information might show whether a judge held particular biases in a case, or if one party had superior legal representation that caused the party to prevail in a case. &lt;ref name = Maute&gt;Judith Maute, ''Response: The Values of Legal Archaeology'', 2000 Utah L. Rev. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is altogether a new subject for the students preparing for the said examinations. In the absence of any comprehensive book on this topic in.."&lt;/ref&gt;

Public legal education, sometimes called civics education, comprises a range of activities intended to build public awareness and skills related to [[law]] and the justice system. This term also refers to the fields of practice and [[wikt:study|study]] concerned with those activities, and to a social and professional [[social movement|movement]] that advocates greater societal commitment to [[education|educating]] people about the law. Anna-Marie Marshall explains that  "in order to realize their rights, people need to take the initiative to articulate them. This initiative, in turn, depends on the availability and the relevance of legal schema to people confronting problems." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Anna-Marie|title=Idle Rights: Employees’ Rights Consciousness and the Construction of Sexual Harassment Policies.|journal=Law and Society Review|date=2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=83–124|doi=10.1111/j.0023-9216.2005.00078.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because laws exist as part of a larger organizational ecosystem in which the interests of the organization as well as those of the actors become inextricably linked to the ways in which they are enacted.
 
Distinct from the education of students in [[law school]] seeking a degree in law (which is often simply called "[[legal education]]") and the [[continuing education#Continuing education for professionals|continuing professional education]] of [[lawyer]]s and [[judge]]s (which is sometimes called "[[continuing legal education]]"), public legal education is principally aimed at people who are not lawyers, judges, or degree-seeking law students.

The term "public legal education" (PLE) is related to, and may encompass, several similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;

The term "law-related education" (LRE) usually refers to public legal education in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools (and sometimes in [[higher education]]), as opposed to PLE for adults and outside of school.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Wanda (2000).

==Definition==
According to the [[American Bar Association]], Commission on Public Understanding, legal awareness is, "the ability to make critical judgments about the substance of the law, the legal process, and available legal resources and to effectively utilize the legal system and articulate strategies to improve it is legal literacy".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

The [[Canadian Bar Association]] (1992, 23) defines legal literacy as, "the ability to understand words used in a legal context, to draw conclusions from them, and then to use those conclusions to take action."&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Good Citizens: Literacy Training in Anxious Time. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014. Project MUSE. Web. Feb. 2015. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

With little change to the Multiple Action Research Group's(MARG, an NGO working for the promotion of legal awareness) definition, legal awareness can be defined as, "critical knowledge of legal provisions and processes, coupled with the skills to use this knowledge to respect and realize rights and entitlements".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;&lt;ref name="MARG"&gt;[http://www.ngo-marg.org/legal-awareness Multiple Action Research Group - Justice through research empowerment] (Accessed on 2 Apr 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought, philosophy, and different approaches to legal literacy==

The "continuum approach" considers legal literacy as, "a capacity spread along a continuum, with lawyers and judges at one end and relatively incapable laypersons at the other". This approach was adopted by the legal scholar White who considered legal literacy to mean, "that degree of competence in legal discourse required for meaningful and active life in our increasingly [[legal culture|legalistic and litigious culture]]".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

Author Bilder (1999) defines legal literacy as a, "spectrum of functional skills", related to the conduct of [[litigation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Bilder1999, 51)&lt;/ref&gt; The continuum approach explains, "a certain degree of legal literacy is required for effective participation in modern society, but it is not necessary for the average citizen to reach the professional standard of 'thinking (and writing) like a lawyer.'"&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

One of the recent approaches considers legal literacy as a metaphor. According to this view, the term is "intended to suggest some parallels between the institution of the law, and a system of language to be mastered, knowledge gained and understanding achieved".&lt;ref&gt;(Manley-Casimir, Michael E., Wanda M. Cassidy, and Suzanne de Castell 1986, 47)&lt;/ref&gt; These authors suggest that the term legal literacy can also function as a model for educators who seek to promote such literacy. Proponents of legal literacy may thus look to the teaching of language for guidance.&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

==Need and importance==
Anoop Kumar, a researcher of Legal Literacy Mission, says in his study, "the legislature of the state and the parliament, while enacting the legislation, consider the objectives of it. Some laws lay down the substantive rights of the masses and some touch upon the procedural aspect of certain laws. But it is due to lack of awareness of beneficiaries that most of the legislations are ineffective at the stage of their execution."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Anoop, Social science research network National Legal Literacy Mission - An Evaluative Analysis {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.2240008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beljaars, Ben. "Implementing Legal Information Literacy: A Challenge for the Curriculum", International Journal of Legal Information. Journal. Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal awareness can empower people to demand justice, accountability and effective remedies at all levels.&lt;ref name=MARG/&gt; Legal needs always stand to become crisis oriented because their ignorance prevents them from anticipating legal troubles and approaching a lawyer for consultation and advice in time. This magnifies the impact of their legal troubles and difficulties when they come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hslsa.nic.in/Resume.htm Justice P.N. Bhagwati, In 1986, in case of Sukhdas V.

Without (legal) literacy people can get intimidated and alienated from law. This may evolve into a situation which results in people coming into conflict with the law, or being unable to obtain help from it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Canadian Bar Association 1992)]&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have acknowledged the barrier raised by a lack of literacy to asserting guaranteed rights effectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (The John Howard Society of Canada1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; Low literacy may block people’s access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Council of Canadian Administrative Tribunals 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; At times, literacy requirements have been used to block access to rights and benefits&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (South Carolina v.

===Goals and objectives===
[[File:Womens read about their legal rights in a public awareness campaing (Benin) (5579786047).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Women read about their legal rights in a public awareness campaign ([[Benin]])]]

Goals of the legal literacy programs can be broadly divided in three types. Namely educational, competency and critical.&lt;ref name="www2.athabascau.ca"&gt;http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf Retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Reading the Legal World'', author Laird Hunter expects legal literacy to achieve:&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Kumar, Anoop, National Legal Literacy Mission - An Evaluative Analysis (March 26, 2013). {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.2240008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"People using the legal system must be able to guide themselves through a process that they understand [...] and, at appropriate places along the way"
*recognize they have a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]] or [[Law of obligations|responsibility]], in order to exercise or assume it;
*recognize when a problem or conflict is a legal conflict and when a legal solution is available;
*know how to take the necessary action to avoid problems and where this is not possible, how to help themselves appropriately;
*know how and where to find information on the law, and be able to find information that is accessible to them,
* know when and how to obtain suitable legal assistance;
* have confidence that the legal system will provide a remedy, and
* understand the process clearly enough to perceive that justice has been done

Depending on the goals there can be a number of objectives for legal literacy programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawforlife.org.uk/introduction/cambodian-community-empowerment-and-legal-awareness-programme,10181,FP.html retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods adopted to promote legal awareness===
There have been many cases where governments have promoted long-term legal literacy missions or awareness campaigns. An example of this is when institutions arrange legal literacy events.

Legal awareness is also achieved through camps, lectures, and interactive workshops or crash programs on the essential and elementary legal laws. Among the general public, many wish to spend time listening to scholars on contemporary issues that have significant bearing on the rights and livelihood of ordinary people.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt; Other methods are road shows, radio talks, street and theatre plays, as well as the publication of relevant books, periodicals, posters, and charts that deal with particular laws, the distribution of pamphlets, brochures, and stickers, the display of paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Aid and Literacy Cell|url=http://www.symlaw.ac.in/legal-aid-and-literacy-cell.php|website=symlaw.ac.in|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrations in comics,&lt;ref name="morungexpress"&gt;{{cite news|title = Legal awareness through grassroots comics|url = http://www.morungexpress.com/local/124381.html|accessdate = 8 December 2014|publisher = morungexpress.com|date = November 11, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141211044243/http://www.morungexpress.com/local/124381.html|archive-date = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other ways to ensure publicity for various [[legal mobilisation]] activities.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

Strategically located display boards in public places (railway stations, bus stations, market places, in front of major government offices and police stations) are also used to help government officials, police, and the public to understand the spirit of law.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

==Obstacles==
According to Lorenzo Cotula, laws are usually published in the official gazette, few people outside legal circles have access to [[legal information]].&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date=1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illiteracy,&lt;ref name="Cotula" /&gt; economic barriers,&lt;ref name="UNSG"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Poverty/A-67-278.pdf  " Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights" page 6 from Note by the Secretary-General on Extreme poverty and human rights for UN GA 67th session A67/278 Distri:General 9 Aug 2012]  www.ohchr.org webpage retrieved 30 March 2013 16.00 IST&lt;/ref&gt; language barriers, social taboos&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=irvxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Obstacles+in+%22legal+awareness%22&amp;dq=Obstacles+in+%22legal+awareness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5xBXUffCA4fXrQeHhIGoAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgo Arise: A Women's Developmental Magazine Published by Acfode, Issues 2-16 ] snippet view as seen/referred to on 30 March 2013 on Google books&lt;/ref&gt; and a lack of zeal among the legal fraternity may lead to obstacles in gaining requisite levels of legal literacy. According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, at times lack of zeal among lawyers make them prone to saying no and killing a deal rather than working through the issues and finding solutions that are both practical and legally sound.&lt;ref name="HannaHK"&gt;{{cite book| first = Hanna | last = Hasl-Kelchner| title = The business guide to legal literacy: what every manager should know about the law| isbn = 9780787982553 | year = 2006| pages = 1–12 &amp; inside flap page|accessdate=9 Nov 2013| url = http://www.legalliteracybooktour.com/LegalLiteracy-FreeChapters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a note to the UN General Assembly 67th session, the UN Secretary General states, "the deprivations that persons living in poverty encounter throughout their lives — lack of access to quality education, reduced access to information, limited political voice and social capital — translate into lower levels of legal literacy and awareness of their rights, creating social obstacles to seeking redress".&lt;ref name=UNSG/&gt;

The absence of a [[legal culture]] and the resulting illiteracy are the main reasons for the large number of cases in the courts. If the accused citizen knows that an act is a crime punishable by law, they may not do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.omanobserver.om/node/89239 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130413235533/http://main.omanobserver.om/node/89239 |archivedate=2013-04-13 |df= }} website retrieved 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the domain of law a vast category of users need to exchange [[legal information]] worldwide and carry out activities in a context where a common understanding of law beyond language is highly desirable. However, this requirement is hard to meet, due to the variety of languages and modes in which the legal discourse is expressed as well as to the diversity of legal orders and the legal concepts on which these systems are founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webfolder.eurac.edu/EURAC/LexALP_shared/media/Peruginelli.pdf Multilingual Legal Information Access: an Overview- Ginevra Peruginelli] Retrieved 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

About lesser significance to legal literacy in US legal education, Leonard J. Long professor of law, [[Quinnipiac University School of Law]] says, "law students, law firms, consumers of legal services, and society as a whole would benefit from having a legal profession comprised and dominated by people who are literate in American law, its history, and its jurisprudence. But legal literacy is not promoted mainly because it is not viewed as necessary for the practice of law. This is part of the anti-intellectual tradition in American law generally, and in American legal education specifically".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.siu.edu/journal/34fall/1%20-%20Long.pdf RESISTING ANTI -INTELLECTUALISM AND PROMOTING LEGAL LITERACY by Leonard J. Long Professor of Law, Quinnipiac University School of Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064648/http://www.law.siu.edu/journal/34fall/1%20-%20Long.pdf |date=2014-04-21 }} Retrieved 31 March 2013 12.30pm IST&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Mary. "Use of Plain English in Legal System Advocated". "The Irish Times" Sept. 6, 2003: Pg. 4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional and corporate legal literacy==
Corporate, institutions and NGOs are subject to and are supposed to follow various sets of laws.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

===Corporate legal literacy===
Legal awareness is an important part of professional work life.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=1T5BHBHNNN0C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=%22legal+awareness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2--T8XgEY3JrQeY-qW1DQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBTi0AQ&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Akula, when law-sensitive issues arise, corporate executives often find themselves in what is, for them, unmapped territory, often without requisite law training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iedp.com/Blog/Importance_Legal_Literacy_Executives_MITSloan The Importance of Legal Literacy for Executives-John Akula, Senior lecturer in Law at MIT Sloan School of Management] Retrieved 31 March 2013 13.00pm IST&lt;/ref&gt; When corporate executives work with attorneys they need to develop a common language to bridge probable communication gaps to achieve legal astituteness.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=I2ezeH8IpSgC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=need+of+legal+literacy+to+corporate+executives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qO9XUcrEJ4OsrAeM5YGgCQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=need%20of%20legal%20literacy%20to%20corporate%20executives&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, legal literacy can help to bridge the gap between law and business by simplifying legal terms into language that makes business sense and offers a new way to think about the law as a useful business tool.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;
She says, "corporate legal literacy involves balanced understanding of cross disciplinary influences bringing in legal risk exposure, avoiding lawsuits and transforming potential business legal issues that threaten growth and profitability, into opportunities for building stronger business relationships, delivering sustainable stakeholder value, improving competitive advantage and foremost embedding compliance into the corporate culture to achieve organizational excellence".&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

According to Hasl-Kelchner, corporate legal literacy tackles companies' legal risk profiles on both the employee and organizational levels. There is a need to identify the infrastructure needed to support legal literacy and promote effective communications throughout the organization.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

===Institutional legal literacy===
George Pulikuthiyil, executive director of NGO Jananeethi in his essay ''Legal Literacy for Social Empowerment'' says that, 'Well educated and highly placed professionals too are often not aware of provisions in laws and implications of their violations. Many would not know the nitty-gritty of several statutory laws and their applications.&amp;nbsp;... However, the fact remains that vast majority of the officers and professionals like clinical psychologists, therapeutic counsellors, welfare officers, social workers, institutional heads and academia are ignorant of their role and responsibilities as contemplated in the Act. NGOs do take pains to organize workshops to sensitize them with respect to such new generation legislations wherein the pro-active role of various stake holders are great significance.' &lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pulikuthiyil|first1=George|title=Legal Literacy for Social Empowerment|url=http://www.jananeethi.org/jananeethi/reports/esseylegalliteracy.htm|publisher=jananeethi.org/|accessdate=2 December 2014|quote=Bare-foot lawyers/para-legal activists"There may be para-legal workers specially trained in specific thrust areas like minorities, indigenous people, child rights, gender issues, right to information, consumer rights, torture and custodial violence etc. "}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Pulikuthiyil further believes non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, faith groups, various service providers, trade unions, youth clubs, police personnel, elected representatives to local bodies, PG students of social work and service organizations also have larger scope of improving the quality of life provided they are made conversant with respective legislations.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

===Designated legal officers===
Apart from external legal advisors, [[General counsel|internal legal officers]]&lt;ref name="ACC"&gt;The 2011 In-House Counsel Compensation Survey, Question 10,[http://www.acc.com/chapters/socal/upload/2011-In-House-Counsel-Compensation-Survey_4-13-11.pdf] Profiles of In-House Counsel 2006 [http://www.acc.com/vl/public/Surveys/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;amp;pageid=16297] Who Does Your Counsel Report To? (2001) (The Majority Report to the CEO)[http://www.acc.com/legalresources/resource.cfm?show=145939]&lt;/ref&gt;  and in certain countries like Australia and India, The [[company secretary]] is responsible for advising on good governance practices and compliance of corporate governance norms as prescribed under various corporate, securities and other business laws, regulations and guidelines made thereunder.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;[http://www.companysecretary.com.au/articles/WhatIsCS.pdf What is a Company Secretary?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csindia&gt;[http://www.icsi.edu/Student/ROLEOFCOMPANYSECRETARY.aspx ROLE OF COMPANY SECRETARY]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
There are certain related concepts including [[legal consciousness]], [[legal mobilization]] and [[legal socialization]], [[Empowerment#Legal empowerment|legal empowerment]], that helps to put legal literacy in perspective.&lt;ref name="www2.athabascau.ca"/&gt;

===Civics and socio-legal literacy===
Despite semantic proximity education of [[civics]], civics literacy and legal literacy are not exactly the same. In the "legal literacy" semantic components are the dominant notion of the "right," "law," "responsibility to the law," and "civic literacy" added to them the concept of "civil society", "individual rights and freedoms" and "man's responsibility to civil society".&lt;ref&gt;http://academia.lndb.lv/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1173/natalia-gendina-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the formal civic education system, human rights can be taken up as a part of civic education, values education and social studies, though they may have the limitation of presenting only certain aspects of human rights rather than their integrated whole, and duties of citizens may be overly emphasized to the detriment of certain rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurights.or.jp/english/education/overview-human-rights-education-in-the-asia-pacific.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the elementary school level, usually minimal level legal literacy introduction is taught through [[civics]], but which is not necessarily adequate for the rest of life.&lt;ref name="Civic Education, Crittenden &amp; Levine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crittenden|first1=Jack|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|title=Civic Education|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civic-education/|website=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=22 June 2017|page=Para 2 and also para 1|date=27 December 2007&lt;!--substantive revision Thu May 30, 2013--&gt;|quote=Paragraph no. 2  Nevertheless, most scholarship that uses the phrase “civic education” investigates deliberate programs of instruction within schools or colleges,...........Nevertheless, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that civic education takes place at all stages of life and in many venues other than schools.  also Para 1  ...It is certainly not limited to schooling and the education of children and youth. Families, governments, religions, and mass media are just some of the institutions involved in civic education, understood as a lifelong process.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied legal education is imparted through business and commerce school and some other branches. News media also plays a part, but is unable to meet all socio-legal literacy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J.|last1=Deepika|first2=D.|last2=Ratna Kumari|title=A Study on Awareness on Legal Acts of Consumer Protection among Students|journal=International Journal of Science and Research |date=November 2014|volume=3|issue=11|url=http://www.ijsr.net/archive/v3i11/T0NUMTQxMjgw.pdf|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NGOs and legal aid centres may provide for limited legal literacy related to specific thrust areas.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil /&gt;

==Internet and legal literacy==
The Internet as a [[legal research|legal research tool]] is advantageous for most primary legal research materials, which can be located for free to supplement fee-based services and library collections. The Internet offers increased access to resources, low- or no-cost access, and real-time information via social media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Publications/products/Law-Librarians-Making-Information-Work/pll-guide-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, MARG(Multiple Action Research Group), an organization working for [[empowerment#Legal|empowerment]] is using internet and social networking sites to empower netizens. The organization posts  every Friday "friday facts" in their [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] &amp; [[Instagram]] pages.These posts/pictures focuses on rights of the citizens and all other important information about laws in India.

==Important institutions promoting legal awareness and legal literacy==
[[Bar council]]s, lawyer federations and various NGOs take the lead in promoting legal awareness and legal literacy. In India, as per the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, the [[National Legal Services Authority]] (NLSA) has been designated to take appropriate measures for spreading legal literacy and legal awareness amongst the people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nalsa.gov.in/actrules.html The act as seen on 26 Feb 2013 14.30 GMT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729091927/http://nalsa.gov.in/actrules.html |date=2016-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms '''legal case management''' ('''LCM''') or '''matter management''' refer to a subset of [[law]] practice management and cover a range of approaches and technologies used by law firms and courts to leverage [[knowledge]] and methodologies for managing the life cycle of a case or matter more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;In the U.S., the term 'case' is customarily applied to a matter in which there are opposing parties or which involves a conflict between parties ''Capturing More Time ... And Keeping Your Clients Happy While Doing It'', Law Practice Today, March 2007.[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/articles/bot03071.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the terms refer to the sophisticated information management and workflow practices that are tailored to meet the legal field's specific needs and requirements.

As attorneys and law firms compete for clients they are routinely challenged to deliver services at lower costs with greater efficiency, thus firms develop practice-specific processes and utilize contemporary technologies to assist in meeting such challenges. Law practice management processes and technologies include case and matter management, time and billing, litigation support, research, communication and collaboration, [[data mining]] and modeling, and [[data security]], storage, and archive accessibility.

==Case management software==
Legal case or matter management software has two primary functions: it helps to better use, manage, consolidate, share, and protect information, and it tracks and shapes the business process. Because the most useful forms of such software can integrate data from multiple systems, departments, users, and business entities, its use can increase a firm's business advantage.

Case or matter management systems having the capacity to push and pull data over the Internet, whether within the software itself or within an integrated software framework or environment became an industry standard with the advent of the [[LexisNexis|Lexis]] and [[Westlaw]] legal research platforms.

Case management software is marketed to specific segments of the legal marketplace, with some products designed for small firms and others for large multinational firms, and a few claim to be scalable to all. Cost-containment and competition concerns facing small-to-mid-size firms that cannot afford a full-time IT staff often drive custom solutions incorporating muliple integrated products.

==In-house legal departments==
In-house legal teams (in the public and private sectors) have their own needs: generally these require less emphasis on billing and accounts (since clients tend to be internal), and even more on traceability, real-time integration and configurability. The need to improve productivity of the team and reduce costs to taxpayers, or the business, is often a key driver.  Some in-house teams have reduced their external legal bills by using case management software to increase their capacity and bring case work in-house.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Teh, Telegraph Media Group on [http://www.iken.biz www.iken.biz] January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case management in the U.S. federal courts==
As electronic court systems continue to increase their online presence, many now require case filings to be accomplished electronically.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., News Release, ''Electronic Case Filing in Federal Courts Reaches Milestone'', November 21, 2005.{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/cmecfat10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515005302/http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/cmecfat10.html |archivedate=2009-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Courts, ''About Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF)'', July 2009.{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/cmecf/cmecf_about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602021153/http://www.uscourts.gov/cmecf/cmecf_about.html |archivedate=2009-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many legal software vendors' products include the ability to take advantage of such electronic filing by pulling data from the case management product and pushing it into court filing systems.

==e-Discovery systems==
In litigation, the discovery process often results in enormous amounts of information that must be managed, and with the revision of the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in 2006 to include electronic means of discovery&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/#chapter_v FRCP]&lt;/ref&gt; came a new subset of case management systems that incorporated those changes, often dubbed 'electronic evidence' or 'e-discovery' management systems.&lt;ref&gt;See Kaplan, ''Industry Research Report, A Conversation with Corporate Counsel: e-Discovery Trends and Perspectives'', Fios, Inc. and Ari Kaplan Advisors, 2008.[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/docs/LPT608AriKaplan-ResearchStudy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/articles/tch04081.shtml Blake, ''Are You Litigation-Ready?'', Law Practice Today, April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the new rules took effect, e-Discovery firms as outside service vendors have flourished.

== Case management and the regulation of mediation in Australia ==
The term '''case management''' is also used to refer to systems in which court or tribunal officials assume closer administrative control over the litigation process than is traditionally associated with [[common law]] [[litigation]].&lt;ref name="Boulle"&gt;Boulle, L. (2005). Mediation: Principles Process Practice. 2nd Edition. Queensland, Australia. LexisNexis Butterworths.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assisted Dispute Resolution program was introduced into the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] in 1990 after a number of cases failed to reach resolutions having several directional hearings. In those cases the parties were not able to isolate the issues requiring determination. With the new program, judges can refer the parties to a court registrar for mediation. This is stated in the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Section 53A(1):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s53a.html|title=Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 53A|last=|first=|date=|website=www.austlii.edu.au|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504050856/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s53a.html|archive-date=2007-05-04|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|(1)  Subject to the Rules of Court, the Court may by order refer the proceedings in the Court, or any part of them or any matter arising out of them, to a mediator or an arbitrator for mediation or arbitration, as the case may be, in accordance with the Rules of Court. 

(1A)  Referrals under subsection (1) to a mediator may be made with or without the consent of the parties to the proceedings. However, referrals to an arbitrator may be made only with the consent of the parties.}} 

Case management in the State of New South Wales includes governing civil court proceedings by court management rules, which are the ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' (NSW)[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2005/28/full] and ''Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005'' (NSW)[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2005/418/full]. The overriding purpose of case management in the ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' is 'to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution' to the matter at dispute in the civil court proceedings (s56(1), ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' (NSW) [http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2005/28/part6/div1/sec56]).

In Australia, mediation as an [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) method is designed to avoid resorting to formal court-based adjudication and is now also being applied to criminal matters. Traditional theories of criminal justice view the matter as one between the offender and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Sarre, R. and Earle, K. (2004). Restorative Justice in Key Issues in Criminal Justice Sarre R, and Tomaino, J. (eds) Key Issues in Criminal Justice, Adelaide: Australian Humanities Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary to have the parties consent to the mediation process and a judge can direct the mediation. In this sense, case management is designed to identify and define issues in dispute and to reduce delays, costs and unnecessary pre-trial activities. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hat was born of resistance and opposition to the formal justice system has been extensively integrated and co-opted into the system.&lt;ref&gt;Astor, H &amp; Chinkin, C. M. (2nd Edition, 2002). Dispute Resolution in Australia. Sydney Australia.. LexisNexis Butterworths&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Legal positivism''' is a school of thought of [[analytical jurisprudence]] largely developed by legal thinkers in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]. While Bentham and Austin developed legal positivist theory, [[empiricism]] set the theoretical foundations for such developments to occur. The most prominent legal positivist writing in English has been [[H. L. A. Hart]], who in 1958 found common usages of "positivism" as applied to law to include the contentions that:
# laws are commands of human beings
# there is no necessary connection between law and morality, that is, between law as it is and as it ought to be.
# analysis (or study of the meaning) of legal concepts is worthwhile and is to be distinguished from history or sociology of law, as well as from criticism or appraisal of law, for example with regard to its moral value or to its social aims or functions
# a legal system is a closed, logical system in which correct decisions can be deduced from predetermined legal rules without reference to social considerations
# moral judgments, unlike statements of fact, cannot be established or defended by rational argument, evidence, or proof ("noncognitivism" in ethics)&lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals" (1958) 71 ''Harvard Law Review'' 593, 601-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically, legal positivism sits in opposition to [[natural law]] theories of jurisprudence, with particular disagreement surrounding the natural lawyer's claim that there is a necessary connection between law and morality.

== Etymology ==
The term ''positivism'' is derived from ''ponere'', ''positum'', meaning, "to put". "Positive law" is that which is man-made, ''i.e.'', formally laid down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/legal-positivism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Green|first=Leslie|date=2009|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

==Legal validity and the sources of law==

In the positivist view, the "source" of a law is the establishment of that law by some socially recognised legal authority. The "merits" of a law are a separate issue: it may be a "bad law" by some standard, but if it was added to the system by a legitimate authority, it is still a law.

''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' summarises the distinction between merit and source like so: "The fact that a policy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient reason for thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is unjust, unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason for doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has been posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.); as we might say in a more modern idiom, positivism is the view that law is a [[social construction]]."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Green, Leslie, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/ Legal Positivism]" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal positivism does not claim that the laws so identified should be followed or obeyed or that there is value in having clear, identifiable rules (although some positivists may also make these claims). Indeed, the laws of a legal system may be quite unjust, and the state may be quite illegitimate. As a result, there may be no obligation to obey them.  Moreover, the fact that a law has been identified by a court as valid provides no guidance as to whether the court should apply it in a particular case. As John Gardner has said, legal positivism is 'normatively inert'; it is a theory of law, not a theory of legal practice, adjudication, or political obligation. Legal positivists believe that intellectual clarity is best achieved by leaving these questions to a separate investigation.

==Legal positivism and legal realism==
Legal positivism should be distinguished from ''[[legal realism]]''. The differences are both analytically and normatively important.  Both systems consider that law is a human construct. Unlike the American legal realists, positivists believe that in many instances, the law provides reasonably determinate guidance to its subjects and to judges, at least in trial courts.

[[Niklas Luhmann]] asserts "We can reduce... positive law to a formula, that law is not only posited (that is, selected) through decision, but also is valid by the power of decision (thus contingent and changeable)."&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; However, no positivist has ever asserted that law is made valid by anyone's decision.  In Hart's opinion, the validity of law is a matter of the customary and collective practices of the courts. As for the moral validity of law, both positivists and realists maintain that this is a matter of moral ''principles''.  'The power of decision' has no essential role in either, since individual decision rarely suffices to create a social practice of recognition, and it would be implausible to suppose that moral principles are made so by anyone's decision.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/moral-relativism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Gowans|first=Chris|date=2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==History==

=== Antecedents of legal positivism ===
The main antecedent of legal positivism is [[Empiricism]], whose thinkers range back as far as [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], [[David Hume]], and [[Auguste Comte]]. Central to the empiricism is the claim that all knowledge of fact must be validated by sense experience or be inferred from propositions derived unambiguously from sense data. Further, empiricism stands in opposition to metaphysics; for instance, Hume rejected metaphysics as mere speculation beyond what can be learnt from sense experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/rationalism-empiricism/|title=Rationalism vs. Empiricism|last=Markie|first=Peter|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings of the empiricists acted as a harbinger for a systematic version of a positivist approach to problems of comprehension and analysis, which was later mirrored in legal positivism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jurisprudence Lecture Notes|last=Curzon|first=Peter|publisher=Cavendish Publishing|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=82.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Logical positivists]], such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer|Alfred Jules Ayer]] paved the way for another important tenet of legal positivism, namely, that propositions and the use of words must be examined in order to understand reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A sentence has literal significance if, and only if, it expresses something which is either tautologous or empirically verifiable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legal positivism ===
'''Methodology'''

With the empiricist and logical positivist theoretical influences borne in mind, the essence of legal positivism as a descriptive investigation of particular legal orders is revealed, which, as Peter Curzon wrote, 'utilises in its investigations the inductive method (i.e., proceeding from observation of particular facts to generalisations concerning all such facts).'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During these investigations, matters of ethics, social policies and morality are eschewed; as [[Julius Stone]] wrote, it is concerned primarily with 'an analysis of legal terms, and an enquiry into the logical interrelations of legal propositions'. Further, law and its authority is seen as source-based; i.e., the validity of a legal norm depends not on the moral value attached thereto, but from the sources determined by a social community's rules and conventions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The source-based conception of law is reminiscent of the logical positivist, [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]], who starkly rejected metaphysics on the basis that it attempts to interpret the nature of reality beyond the physical and experiential.

'''Thomas Hobbes and ''Leviathan'''''

[[Thomas Hobbes]], in his seminal work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', postulated the first clear notion of law based on the notion of sovereign power. As Hampton writes, "law is understood [by Hobbes] to depend on the sovereign's will. No matter what a law's content, no matter how unjust it seems, if it has been commanded by the sovereign, then and only then is it law.'&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There is, however, debate surrounding Hobbes's status as a legal positivist.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hobbes and the Social Contract Tradition|last=Hampton|first=Jean|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=107.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=Brian|date=1968|title=Warrender and His Critics|url=|journal=Philosophy 43, 117-37, 131-32.|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=C. Murphy|first=Mark|date=1995|title=Was Hobbes a Legal Positivist|jstor=2382114|journal=The University of Chicago Press,  Ethics, Vol. 105, No. 4.|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeremy Bentham'''

The English jurist and philosopher, [[Jeremy Bentham]], is arguably the greatest historical figure in the British legal positivist movement. In ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation,'' Bentham laid the groundwork for a theory of law as the expressed will of a sovereign. Bentham made a sharp distinction between the following types of people:
* '''Expositors''' – those who explained what the law in practice was; and
* '''Censors''' – those who criticised the law in practice and compared it to their notions of what it ought to be.
The philosophy of law, considered strictly, was to explain the real laws of the expositors, rather than the criticisms of the censors.

Bentham was also noted for calling natural law "nonsense upon stilts."

[[File:John Austin.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]]]
'''John Austin's command theory''' 
John Austin followed in the theoretical footsteps of Bentham by writing ''The Province of jurisprudence Determined.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Province of Jurisprudence Determined|last=Austin|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|origyear=1832|date=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,  Austin departed from Bentham on a number of points, for example, by supporting the common law.

Differences aside, Austin embraced Hobbes's and Bentham's conception of law as a sovereign command, whose authority is recognised by most members of a society; the authority of which is enforced by the use of sanctions, but which is not bound by any human superior.  The criterion for validity of a legal rule in such a society is that it has the warrant of the sovereign and will be enforced by the sovereign power and its agents.

The three main tenets of Austin's command theory are:
* laws are commands issued by the uncommanded commander, i.e. the sovereign;
* such commands are enforced by sanctions; and
* a sovereign is one who is obeyed by the majority.

Austin considered the law as commands from a sovereign that are enforced by  threat of sanction. In determining 'a sovereign', Austin recognised it is one whom society obeys habitually. This sovereign can be a single person or a collective sovereign such as Parliament, with a number of individuals, with each having various authoritative powers. Austin's theory is also somewhat brief in his explanations of Constitutions, International Law, non-sanctioned rules, or law that ''gives'' rights. Insofar as non-sanctioned rules and laws that ''allow'' persons to do things, such as [[contract law]], Austin said that failure to obey the rules does result in sanctions; however, such sanctions are in the form of "the sanction of nullity."
[[File:Hans Kelsen (Nr. 17) - Bust in the Arkadenhof, University of Vienna - 0289.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Hans Kelsen]] in the Arkadenhof, University of Vienna]]
'''Hans Kelsen and Germanic positivism'''

The British legal positivism hitherto mentioned was founded on empiricism; by contrast, Germanic legal positivism was founded on the transcendental idealism of the German philosopher, [[Immanuel Kant]]. Whereas British legal positivists regard law as distinct from morals, their Germanic counterparts regard law as both separate from both fact and morals. The most famous proponent of Germanic legal positivism is Hans Kelsen, whose central thesis on legal positivism is unpacked by [[Suri Ratnapala]], who writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The key elements of Kelsen's theory are these. Facts consist of things and events in the physical world. Facts are about what there is. When we wish to know what caused a fact we look for another fact. A stone thrown in the air comes down because of the force of Earth's gravity. There are seasons because the Earth's axis is tilted at 23.5 degrees. A norm, unlike a fact, is not about what there is but is about what ought to be done or not done. Whereas facts exist in the physical world, norms exist in the world of ideas. Facts are caused by other facts. Norms are imputed by other norms. The requirement that a person who commits theft ought to be punished is a norm. It does not cease being a norm because the thief is not punished. (He may not get caught.) The norm that the thief ought to be punished exists because another norm says so. Not all norms are laws. There are also moral norms. Legal norms are coercive; moral norms are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jurisprudence|last=Ratnapala|first=Suri|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn= 978-0-511-59483-0|location=|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From this framework, Kelsen opined that the regression of validated norms cannot go on infinitely and must arrive at a First Cause, which he called a ''Grundnorm.'' The legal system is therefore a system of legal norms connected to each other by their common origin, like the branches and leaves of a tree.

For Kelsen, "sovereignty" was a loaded concept: "We can derive from the concept of sovereignty nothing else other than what we have purposely put into its definition."

Kelsen attracted disciples among scholars of public law worldwide. These disciples developed "schools" of thought to extend his theories, such as the Vienna School in Austria and the Brno School in Czechoslovakia. In English-speaking countries, H. L. A. Hart and [[Joseph Raz]] are perhaps the most well-known authors who were influenced by Kelsen, though both schools differed from Kelsen's theories in several respects.
[[File:H.L.A.Hart.jpg|thumb|[[H.L.A. Hart]]]]
'''H. L. A. Hart'''

H. L. A. Hart later addressed Austin.  Hart liked Austin's theory of a sovereign, but claimed that Austin's Command Theory failed in several important respects.  In the book ''[[The Concept of Law]]'', Hart outlined several key points:
Among the many ideas developed in this book are:
*A critique of [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin's]] theory that law is the command of the sovereign enforced by the threat of punishment.
*A distinction between the internal and external considerations of law and rules, close to (and influenced by) [[Max Weber]]'s distinction between the sociological and the legal perspectives of law.
*A distinction between primary and secondary legal rules, such that a primary rule governs conduct, such as criminal law, and secondary rules that govern the procedural methods by which primary rules are enforced, prosecuted and so on.  Hart specifically enumerates three secondary rules; they are:
:# The [[Rule of Recognition]], the rule by which any member of society may check to discover what the primary rules of the society are.  In a simple society, Hart states, the recognition rule might only be what is written in a sacred book or what is said by a ruler.  Hart claimed the concept of rule of recognition as an evolution from [[Hans Kelsen]]'s "''[[Grundnorm]]''", or "basic norm."
:# The Rule of Change, the rule by which existing primary rules might be created, altered or deleted.
:#The Rule of Adjudication, the rule by which the society might determine when a rule has been violated and prescribe a remedy.
*A late reply (1994 Edition) to [[Ronald Dworkin]], who criticized legal positivism in general and especially Hart's account of law in ''Taking Rights Seriously'' (1977), ''A Matter of Principle'' (1985), and ''[[Law's Empire]]'' (1986).
'''Joseph Raz'''{{Main article|Joseph Raz}}

A pupil of [[H. L. A. Hart]], [[Joseph Raz]] has been important in continuing Hart's arguments of legal positivism since Hart's death. This has included editing a second edition of Hart's ''The Concept of Law'', with an additional section including Hart's responses to other philosophers' criticisms of his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=H. L. A.|title=The Concept of Law|location=London|publisher=Oxford UP|date=1994|edition=2}};  superseded by 3rd edition 2012, edited by Leslie Green.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raz has also argued, contrary to Hart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concept of Law|last=Hart|first=H. L. A.|date=1994|publisher=Oxford UP|edition=2|location=London|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the validity of a law can ''never'' depend on its morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raz|first=Joseph|title=The Authority of Law: Essays on Law and Morality|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon P|date=1979|pages=47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Raz has come to accept that law may depend upon morality in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raz|first=Joseph|title=Between Authority and Interpretation|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford UP|date=2009|pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of official [[minimum wage]] rates of the 193 [[United Nations member states]] and former members of the [[United Nations]], and also includes the following territories and states with limited recognition: [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Northern Cyprus]], [[Kosovo]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and other independent countries. Some countries may have a very complicated minimum wage system; for example, India has more than 1202 minimum wage rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paycheck.in/main/salary/minimumwages |title=Minimum Wage in India 2013 |publisher=PayCheck.in |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Methodology ==
The minimum wages listed refer to a [[gross income|gross]] amount, that is before [[tax deduction|deduction of taxes]] and [[social security]] contributions, which vary from one country to another. Also excluded from calculations are regulated paid days off, including public holidays, sick pay, annual leave and [[social insurance]] contributions paid by the employer.

For the sake of comparison, an annual wage column is provided in [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international dollars]], a hypothetical unit of [[currency]] calculated based on the [[purchasing power parity]] of [[household final consumption expenditure]]. For calculating the annual wage, the lowest general minimum wage was used.

'''''Monitor Polski''''' ({{lang-en|Official Gazette of the Republic of Poland}}, abbreviated '''M. P.''' or '''MP''') is a publication of the [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland]]. It publishes legal acts in [[Polish law]] that are not a source of new laws, and various public decisions that are required to be made public. Unlike [[Dziennik Ustaw]], acts published in Monitor are not a source of laws or obligations on the part of Polish citizens.

There is also 'Monitor Polski B' which publishes financial statements of the Republic of [[Poland]].

'''''Natural Law and Natural Rights''''' is a 1980 book by the philosopher [[John Finnis]]. A restatement of [[natural law]] doctrine, it is considered a seminal contribution to the [[philosophy of law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oxf20|Oxford University Press 2013]].&lt;/ref&gt; The work was commissioned by [[H. L. A. Hart]] for the Clarendon Law Series.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;[[#Geo05|George 2005]]. p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Finnis argues that social theory cannot be value free and that Humean ethics, unlike genuine (as opposed to neo-scholastic) Thomist ethics, commits a [[naturalistic fallacy]]. He bases his radically rearticulated Aristotelian political and legal theory on dialectically defended first principles of [[practical reason]] and methodological principles of practical reasonableness (morality).&lt;ref name="George" /&gt; He defends the following basic human goods: life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, sociability (friendship), practical reasonableness, and religion, defined as "all those beliefs that can be called matters of ultimate concern; questions about the point of human existence."&lt;ref name="Buckle"&gt;[[#Buc97|Buckle 1997]]. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The philosophy lecturer Stephen Buckle sees Finnis's list of proposed basic goods as plausible, but notes that Finnis's account of the basic requirements of practical reasonableness is more controversial. Buckle sees Finnis's requirement of "respect for every basic value in every act" as intended both to rule out [[consequentialism]] in ethics and also to support the moral viewpoint of the [[Catholic Church]] on a range of contentious issues, including [[contraception]] and [[masturbation]], which in his view undermines its plausibility.&lt;ref name="Buckle" /&gt;

"'''No taxation without representation'''" is a [[slogan]] originating during the 1700s that summarized a primary grievance of the [[Colonial history of the United States#British colonies|American colonists]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], which was one of the major causes of the [[American Revolution]]. In short, [[Patriot (Revolution)|many in those colonies]] believed that, as they were not directly [[Representation (politics)|represented]] in the distant [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], any laws it passed affecting the colonists (such as the [[Sugar Act]] and the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]]) were illegal under the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], and were a denial of their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]].

[[Jonathan Mayhew]], [[Old West Church (Boston, Massachusetts)|Old West Church's]] second Congregational pastor, used the phrase, "no taxation without representation" in a sermon in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chris Beneke |year=2008 |title=The Critical Turn: Jonathan Mayhew, the British Empire, and the Idea of Resistance in Mid- Eighteenth-Century Boston |journal=Massachusetts Historical Review |volume=10|jstor=25478696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase revives a sentiment central to the cause of the [[English Civil War]] following the refusal of parliamentarian [[John Hampden]] to pay [[ship money]] tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English Civil War|page=97

{{wikisource author|wslink=John Oldmixon|title=Oldmixon}}
The English Parliament had controlled colonial trade and taxed imports and exports since 1660.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, pg. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1760s, the Americans were being deprived of a historic right.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution''. 1943. pp. 31, 99, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  The English [[Bill of Rights 1689]] had forbidden the imposition of taxes without the consent of Parliament.  Since the colonists had no representation in Parliament, the taxes violated the guaranteed [[Rights of Englishmen]].  Parliament initially contended that the colonists had [[virtual representation]], but the idea "found little support on either side of the Atlantic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBvNHl6UYKsC&amp;pg=PA126|title=Recreating the American Republic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dunmore Lang]] wrote in 1852, "The person who first suggested the idea [of Parliamentary representation for the colonies] appears to have been Oldmixon, an American annalist of the era of Queen Anne or George I.  It was afterwards put forward with approbation by the celebrated Dr. [[Adam Smith]], and advocated for a time, but afterwards rejected and strongly opposed, by Dr. [[Benjamin Franklin]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/journals/EB/freedom-and-independence-lang-1852/19-parliamentary-representation/ 1.9 Parliamentary Representation. • E-Books • Webjournals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703184301/http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/journals/EB/freedom-and-independence-lang-1852/19-parliamentary-representation/ |date=2013-07-03 }}.

The eloquent [[1768 Petition, Memorial, and Remonstrance]] objecting to taxation, written by the Virginia House of Burgesses and endorsed by every other Colony, was sent to the British Government, which seems to have ignored it.&lt;ref&gt;H.M.

Jared Ingersoll Snr., colonial agent for Connecticut, wrote to his American colleague, the Royal Governor of Connecticut Thomas Fitch, that following Isaac Barre's famous Parliamentary speech against the Stamp Act in 1764, Richard Jackson, M.P., supported Barre and other pro-American M.P.s by producing before the House copies of earlier Acts of Parliament that had admitted Durham and Chester seats upon their petitions for representation. The argument was put forward in Parliament that America ought to have representatives on these grounds too.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iqPdJyMcP4IC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=american+members+of+parliament&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jyjOUM_aOaHK0AXY8ICABw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=american%20members%20of%20parliament&amp;f=false Prologue To Revolution: Sources And Documents On The Stamp Act Crisis, 1764–1766].

==== The Knox-Burke debates ====
[[William Knox (British politician)|William Knox]], an aide of George Grenville, pamphleteer and subsequent Irish [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]], received an appointment in 1756 to the American provinces, and after his return to London in 1761, he recommended the creation of a colonial aristocracy and colonial representation in the British Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/WilliamKnox.php William Knox]. Libraryireland.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; He was shortly afterwards appointed agent for Georgia and East Florida, a post which he forfeited by writing in favour of the Stamp Act. In his Grenville-backed pamphlet of 1769, ''The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed'', Knox suggested that colonial representatives might have been offered seats in the British Parliament if they had sought such representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamknoxoname00knox#page/18/mode/2up/search/offer |title=William Knox on American taxation, 1769 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Knox submitted that, &lt;blockquote&gt;whilst [the radical colonists] exclaim against Parliament for taxing them when they are not represented, they candidly declare they will not have representatives [in Parliament] lest they should be taxed...The truth...is that they are determined to get rid of the jurisdiction of Parliament...and they therefore refuse to send members to that assembly lest they should preclude themselves of [the] plea [that Parliament's] legislative acts...are done without their consent; which, it must be confessed, holds equally good against all laws, as against taxes...The colony advocates...tell us, that by refusing to accept our offer of representatives they...mean to avoid giving Parliament a pretence for taxing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamknoxoname00knox#page/18/mode/2up/search/representatives |title=William Knox on American taxation, 1769 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Edmund Burke responded to Knox, who had drawn up ''The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed'' as well as ''The Present State of the Nation'' (1768) under the supervision of George Grenville, by opining in his political tract ''Observations on a Late State of the Nation'' (1769), &lt;blockquote&gt;NOW comes [Knox's] American representation...Is not the reader a little astonished at the proposal of an American representation from that quarter [of Grenville's]? It is proposed merely as a project of speculative improvement; not from the necessity in the case, not to add any thing to the authority of parliament: but that we may afford a greater attention to the concerns of the Americans, and give them a better opportunity of stating their grievances, and of obtaining redress. I am glad to find the author has at length discovered that we have not given a sufficient attention to their concerns, or a proper redress to their grievances. His great friend [Grenville] would once have been exceedingly displeased with any person, who should tell him, that he did not attend sufficiently to those concerns. He thought he did so, when he regulated the colonies over and over again: he thought he did so, when he formed two general systems of revenue; one of port-duties, and the other of internal taxation. These systems supposed, or ought to suppose, the greatest attention to, and the most detailed information of, all their affairs. However, by contending for the American representation, he seems at last driven virtually to admit, that great caution ought to be used in the exercise of all our legislative rights over an object so remote from our eye, and so little connected with our immediate feelings; that in prudence we ought not to be quite so ready with our taxes, until we can secure the desired representation in parliament. Perhaps it may be some time before this hopeful scheme can be brought to perfect maturity; although the author seems to be no wise aware of any obstructions that lie in the way of it.&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004899151.0001.000?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=american+representatives |title=The political tracts and speeches: of Edmund Burke, Esq.

While Knox, Grenville and Burke were not necessarily opposed in principle to direct colonial representation in Parliament, Grenville nonetheless conjectured that Parliament retained a constitutional right to virtually represent the colonial subjects.&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 69 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6K8pM6Z3BdAC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=grenville+knox+virtual+representation#v=onepage&amp;q=grenville%20knox%20virtual%20representation&amp;f=false|title=The Constitutional Origins of the American Revolution|isbn=978-1-139-49293-5|author1=Greene|first1=Jack P|date=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''On the American Taxation'' ====
Burke supported the doctrine of virtual representation in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Page 58 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xH2lEKIZ4yMC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=burke+virtual+representation+philip+reid#v=onepage&amp;q=burke%20virtual%20representation%20philip%20reid&amp;f=false|title=The Concept of Representation in the Age of the American Revolution|isbn=978-0-226-70898-0|author1=Reid|first1=John Phillip|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet in his Parliamentary speech of 1774, entitled ''On American Taxation'', Burke responded to the suggestion that America was virtually represented in Parliament by remarking, &lt;blockquote&gt;What! does the electric force of virtual representation more easily pass over the Atlantic than pervade Wales, which lies in your neighborhood? or than Chester and Durham, surrounded by abundance of representation that is actual and palpable? But, Sir, your ancestors thought this sort of virtual representation, however ample, to be totally insufficient for the freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are so near, and comparatively so inconsiderable. How, then, can I think it sufficient for those which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote?  You will now, Sir, perhaps imagine that I am on the point of proposing to you a scheme for a representation of the colonies in Parliament. Perhaps I might be inclined to entertain some such thought; but a great flood stops me in my course. Opposuit Natura. I cannot remove the eternal barriers of the creation. The thing, in that mode, I do not know to be possible. As I meddle with no theory, I do not absolutely assert the impracticability of such a representation; but I do not see my way to it; and those who have been more confident have not been more successful...My resolutions, therefore, mean to establish the equity and justice of a taxation of America by grant, and not by imposition; to mark the legal competency of the colony assemblies for the support of their government in peace, and for public aids in time of war; to acknowledge that this legal competency has had a dutiful and beneficial exercise, and that experience has shown the benefit of their grants, and the futility of Parliamentary taxation, as a method of supply.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm#AMERICAN_TAXATION |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Burke's Writings and Speeches, Volume the Second, by Edmund Burke |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Burke apparently qualified such remarks concerning America by stating in the same speech that, &lt;blockquote&gt;The Parliament of Great Britain...is never to intrude into the place of the [provincial legislatures], whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution. But in order to enable [Parliamentary]...superintendence, her powers must be boundless. The gentlemen who think the powers of Parliament limited may please themselves to talk of requisitions. But suppose the requisitions are not obeyed? What! shall there be no reserved power in the empire, to supply a deficiency which may weaken, divide, and dissipate the whole? We are engaged in waar,—the Secretary of State calls upon the colonies to contribute,—some would do it, I think most would cheerfully furnish whatever is demanded,—one or two, suppose, hang back, and, easing themselves, let the stress of the draft lie on the others,—surely it is proper that some authority might legally say, "Tax yourselves for the common Supply, or Parliament will do it for you." This backwardness was, as I am told, actually the case of Pennsylvania for some short time towards the beginning of the last war, owing to some internal dissensions in that colony. But whether the fact were so or otherwise, the case is equally to be provided for by a competent sovereign power. But then this ought to be no ordinary power, nor ever used in the first instance. This is what I meant, when I have said, at various times, that I consider the power of taxing in Parliament as an instrument of empire, and not as a means of supply.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== William Pitt the Elder ====
The views of Knox, Grenville and Burke did not go unchallenged: William Pitt was amongst those who disputed that a Parliamentary right or power existed to levy "internal" taxes "for the purposes of raising a revenue" without the consent of actual representatives of the "Commons of America".&lt;ref name="bartleby.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/3/23.html |title=II.

==== Colonial spokespersons ====
In 1764, the Massachusetts politician James Otis, Jr., said that, {{quote|When the parliament shall think fit to allow the colonists a representation in the house of commons, the equity of their taxing the colonies, will be as clear as their power is at present of doing it without, if they please...But if it was thought hard that charter privileges should be taken away by act of parliament, is it not much harder to be in part, or in whole, disfranchised of rights, that have been always thought inherent to a British subject, namely, to be free from all taxes, but what he consents to in person, or by his representative? This right, if it could be traced no higher than Magna Charta, is part of the common law, part of a British subjects birthright, and as inherent and perpetual, as the duty of allegiance; both which have been brought to these colonies, and have been hitherto held sacred and inviolable, and I hope and trust ever will. It is humbly conceived, that the British colonists (except only the conquered, if any) are, by Magna Charta, as well entitled to have a voice in their taxes, as the subjects within the realm. Are we not as really deprived of that right, by the parliament assessing us before we are represented in the house of commons, as if the King should do it by his prerogative? Can it be said with any colour of truth or justice, that we are represented in parliament?|sign=James Otis|source=''Rights of British Colonies Asserted''&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.libertyfund.org/files/2335/Otis_RightsBritishColonies1556.pdf The rights of the British Colonies 1556]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Otis, Jr., attended the Continental Congress of 1765 along with other colonial delegates.  The resolutions of the Congress stated that the Stamp Act had "a manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonists" and that "the only Representatives of the People of these Colonies, are Persons chosen therein by themselves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be Constitutionally imposed on them, but by their respective Legislature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1068&amp;Itemid=264 |title=Online Library of Liberty |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolu65.asp |title=Avalon Project – Resolutions of the Continental Congress October 19, 1765 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, it was declared that, "it is unreasonable and inconsistent with the Principles and Spirit of the British Constitution, for the People of Great-Britain, to grant to his Majesty the Property of the Colonists."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu" /&gt;

Daniel Dulany, Jr., of Maryland, wrote in 1765 that, "the Impropriety of a Taxation by the British Parliament...[is proven by] the Fact, that not one inhabitant in any Colony is, or can be actually or virtually represented by the British House of Commons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xGsBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=daniel+dulany+impropriety#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20dulany%20impropriety&amp;f=false|title=Considerations on the propriety of imposing taxes in the British colonies, for the purpose of raising a revenue, by act of parliament [by D.

In 1766, Benjamin Franklin told the House of Commons that, "an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/8/10.html |title=I.

==== Heightening of tensions ====
The Americans rejected the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]] brought in by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[George Grenville]], and violently rejected the remaining tax on [[tea]] [[import]]s, under the [[Tea Act]] passed in May 1773, at the [[Boston Tea Party]] on December 16, 1773. The Parliament considered this an illegal act because they believed it undermined the authority of the [[Crown-in-Parliament]]. When the British then used the military to enforce laws that the colonists believed Parliament had passed illegally, the colonists responded by forming [[militia]]s and seized political control of each colony, ousting the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|royal governor]]s – with the exception of the American-born Royal Governor of Connecticut, John Trumbull, who was allowed to remain as the new Patriot Governor.

The complaint was never officially over the amount of taxation (the taxes were quite low, though [[ubiquitous]]), but always on the political decision-making process by which taxes were decided in [[London]], i.e. without representation for the colonists in [[British Parliament]].

[[Patrick Henry]]'s resolution in the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia legislature]] implied that Americans possessed all the rights of Englishmen, that the principle of no taxation without representation was an essential part of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], and that [[Virginia]] alone had the right to tax Virginians.&lt;ref&gt;Miller p 122–25&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Efforts at conciliation ====

This offer of actual imperial representation was likewise re-stated to the delegates of the colonies via the colonial agents in 1774, according to Connecticut-born Reverend Thomas Bradbury Chandler, in his publication ''A Friendly Address to All Reasonable Americans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaVbAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=house&amp;f=false|title=A Friendly Address to All Reasonable Americans, on the Subject of Our ...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1775, Britain passed the [[Conciliatory Resolution]] which ended taxation for any colony which satisfactorily provided for the imperial defence and the upkeep of imperial officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycentral.com/documents/North.html |title=Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution [February 27, 1775&amp;#93; |publisher=Historycentral.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Had they, like the County and City of Chester, represented, that "for lack of Knights and Burgesses to represent them in the High Court of Parliament, they had been oftentimes TOUCHED and GRIEVED with Acts and Statutes made within the said Court, derogatory to their most ancient jurisdictions, liberties and privileges, and prejudicial to their quietness, rest and peace;" this Country [of Britain] would, I am persuaded, have no objection to their being represented in her Parliament... If they are not madly bent on independence, let them propose the conditions on which they wish to continue as subjects...The Legislature of this Kingdom cannot possibly depart from any part of its supremacy over the Colonies; but it is in the power of the Colonies to share in that supremacy. If they complain of being taxed without having the privilege of sending Members to Parliament, let them be represented. Nay, more: Let their representation increase in proportion to the Revenue they shall furnish. If they wish rather to vote their QUOTA towards the general supply, through their own General Courts and Assemblies, the resolution of Parliament on that subject is still open to their choice. But, as long as they assume the language of a Sovereign State, this Kingdom can enter into no negociation [sic], can meet no compromise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004772194.0001.000/1:2?firstpubl1=1700;firstpubl2=1800;rgn=div1;sort=occur;subview=detail;type=simple;view=fulltext;q1=american+representatives |title=The rights of Great Britain asserted against the claims of America: being an answer to the declaration of the General Congress |publisher=Quod.lib.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/rightsofgreatbri00macp |title=The rights of Great Britain asserted against the claims of America: being an answer to the Declaration of the general Congress : Macpherson, James, 1736–1796 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The noted economist Adam Smith seconded this view in his famous 1776 publication ''Wealth of Nations'' when he recommended the Americans "to send fifty or sixty new representatives to Parliament" on the basis of the amount of taxes they would contribute to the Imperial coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Smith |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-adam/works/wealth-of-nations/book04/ch07c-2.htm |title=Wealth of Nations  Bk 4 Chpt 07 (III p.2) |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in October 1776 to Lord North in ''Strictures upon the Declaration of the Congress'' of the recent Declaration of Independence, and particularly of James Otis, Jr.'s pamphlet ''Rights of the British Colonies'' and its endorsement by the Massachusetts Assembly, Governor Thomas Hutchinson said, &lt;blockquote&gt;The Assembly of Massachusetts Bay, therefore, was the first that took any publick of the [Sugar] Act, and the first which ever took exception to the right of Parliament to impose Duties or Taxes on the Colonies, whilst they had no representatives in the House of Commons. This they did in a letter to their Agent in the summer of 1764, which they took care to print and publish before it was possible for him to receive it. And in this letter they recommend to him a pamphlet, wrote by one of their members, in which there are proposals for admitting representatives from the Colonies to fit in the House of Commons. I have this special reason, my Lord, for taking notice of this Act of the Massachusetts Assembly; that though an American representation is thrown out as an expedient which might obviate the objections to Taxes upon the Colonies, yet it was only intended to amuse the authority in England; and as soon as it was known to have its advocates here [in London], it was renounced by the colonies, and even by the Assembly of the Colony which first proposed it, as utterly impracticable."&lt;ref name="oll.libertyfund.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchinson 1776" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Indeed, the resolves of the Continental Congresses of both 1765 and 1774 declared that imperial representation was too impractical on the footing that "local and other circumstances, cannot properly be represented in the British parliament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolves.asp |title=Avalon Project – Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Government, similarly, does not appear to have formally requested discussions with the Americans concerning the issue of Parliamentary seats until 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=550146|title=Chatham and the Representation of the Colonies in the Imperial Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqw3ou3i1McC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false John Phillip Reid, ''The Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority of Law'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In that year "the commissioners of the king of Great Britain," known as the Carlisle Peace Commission of 1778, made an offer to the Congress of "a reciprocal deputation of an agent or agents from the different states, who shall have the privilege of a seat and voice in the parliament of Great Britain".&lt;ref name="teachingamericanhistory.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, ''The Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority of Law'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2003), p. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Virtual representation ==
{{Main article|Virtual representation}}

In Britain, representation was highly limited due to unequally distributed voting constituencies and property requirements; only 3% of the population could vote and they were often controlled by local gentry.  This meant that spurious arguments had come to be employed in Britain to try to explain away and cover up the iniquities in its political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGee|first=Michael C.|title=The Rhetorical Process in Eighteenth Century England|url=http://mcgeefragments.net/OLD/rhetorical_process_england.htm |accessdate=March 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515204305/http://mcgeefragments.net/OLD/rhetorical_process_england.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/getting_vote.htm |title=Exhibitions &amp;#124; Citizenship &amp;#124; Struggle for democracy |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller p 212&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] tried to argue that the colonists had [[virtual representation]] in their interests.  In the winter of 1764–65, George Grenville, and his secretary Thomas Whately, invented the doctrine of 'virtual representation' in an attempt extend the scope of such unjust arguments to America, and thereby attempt to legitimise the pernicious policies of the Stamp Act.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 13: Law and the Origins of the American Revolution – {{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Law in America, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KeEi14czrnoC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;dq=whately+virtual+representation#v=onepage&amp;q=whately%20virtual%20representation&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-521-80305-2|author1=Grossberg|first1=Michael|last2=Tomlins|first2=Christopher|date=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Debating the Issues in Colonial Newspapers: Primary Documents on Events of ..|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bm6kNpvnnhgC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=thomas+whately+virtual+representation+secretary+grenville#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20whately%20virtual%20representation%20secretary%20grenville&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-313-30982-3|author1=Copeland|first1=David A|date=2000-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5: Transformation – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p6-tKuFD1KsC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=virtual+representation+american+revolution#v=onepage&amp;q=virtual%20representation%20american%20revolution&amp;f=false|title=THE IDEOLOGICAL ORIGINS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION|isbn=978-0-674-07666-2|author1=Bailyn|first1=Bernard|date=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In English history, "no taxation without representation" was an old principle and meant that Parliament had to pass all taxes. At first, the "representation" was held to be one of land, but, by 1700, this had shifted to the notion that, in Parliament, all British subjects had a "virtual representation." "We virtually and implicitly allow the institutions of any government of which we enjoy the benefit and solicit the protection," declared [[Samuel Johnson]] in his political pamphlet ''Taxation No Tyranny''. He rejected the plea that the colonists, who had no vote, were unrepresented. "They are represented," he said, "by the same virtual representation as the greater part of England."  However, the tradition of greater democracy amongst Americans gave impetus to the well-founded charge, voiced by Britons and colonists alike, that virtual representation was "sophistry" and "a mere Cob-web, spread to catch the unwary, and intangle [''sic''] the weak."&lt;ref&gt;Page 7 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xGsBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=daniel+dulany+cob-web,+spread+to+catch+the+unwary#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20dulany%20cob-web%2C%20spread%20to%20catch%20the%20unwary&amp;f=false|title=Considerations on the propriety of imposing taxes in the British colonies …|author1=Dulany|first1=Daniel|year=1765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 82 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jnNbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=sophistry+virtual+representation+british#v=onepage&amp;q=sophistry%20virtual%20representation%20british&amp;f=false|title=A Letter to the Right Honourable the Earl of Hilsborough, on the …, Volume 3|year=1769}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The colonial insistence on direct representation as opposed to virtual representation has thus been seen by later commentators to have "usher[ed] in a profound political and social revolution, which rooted out most of the remaining traces of monarchic rule and feudalism inherited from the only partially complete English bourgeois revolution. The Americans carried through the bourgeois democratic revolution on a scale never before seen in history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/class-struggle-and-the-american-revolution.htm|title=Class Struggle and the American Revolution|work=In defense of Marxism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial reactions ===
Virtual representation was wholly rejected in the colonies also  who said the "virtual" was a cover for [[political corruption]] and was irreconcilable with their belief that government derives its just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].  In 1765, the American lawyer and politician James Otis, Jr., responded to Soame Jenyns' ''The Objections to the Taxation of Our American Colonies, by the Legislature of Great Britain, Briefly Considered''.&lt;ref name="files.libertyfund.org"&gt;[http://files.libertyfund.org/files/2336/Otis_Considerations1555_Bk.pdf Considerations on behalf of the colonists in a letter to a noble Lord]&lt;/ref&gt;  Otis' own publication was entitled ''Considerations on Behalf of the Colonists, in a Letter to a Noble Lord''.&lt;ref name="files.libertyfund.org" /&gt;  He wrote in it, "To what purpose is it to ring everlasting changes to the colonists on the cases of Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield, who return no members?  If those now so considerable places are not represented, they ought to be."&lt;ref name="files.libertyfund.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 169 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p6-tKuFD1KsC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=virtual+representation+american+revolution#v=onepage&amp;q=virtual%20representation%20american%20revolution&amp;f=false|title=The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution|isbn=978-0-674-07666-2|author1=Bailyn|first1=Bernard|date=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in his 1763 publication ''The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved'', Otis declared that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every British subject born on the continent of America, or in any other of the British dominions, is by the law of God and nature, by the common law, and by act of parliament, (exclusive of all charters from the Crown) entitled to all the natural, essential, inherent and inseparable rights of our fellow subjects in Great Britain. Among those rights...which it is humbly conceived no man or body of men, not excepting the parliament, justly, equitably and consistently with their own rights and the constitution, can take away...[are that the] supreme and subordinate powers of the legislation should be free and sacred in the hands where the community have once rightfully placed them...[that the] supreme national legislative cannot be altered justly ’till the commonwealth is dissolved, nor a subordinate legislative taken away without forfeiture or other good cause. Nor then can the subjects in the subordinate government be reduced to a state of slavery, and subject to the despotic rule of others...Even when the subordinate right of legislature is forfeited, and so declared, this cannot affect the natural persons either of those who were invested with it, or the inhabitants, so far as to deprive them of the rights of subjects and of men — The colonists will have an equitable right notwithstanding any such forfeiture of charter, to be represented in Parliament, or to have some new subordinate legislature among themselves. It would be best if they had both...[Furthermore, the right of every British subject is that the] supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property, without his consent in person, or by representation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Frohnen |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=669&amp;chapter=206126&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=The American Republic: Primary Sources – Online Library of Liberty |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Otis simultaneously refuted, in ''The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved'', a contemporary argument that attempted to rationalise virtual representation on the basis of the [[Colonial agent|colonial agents']] alleged influence on British policy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;  "As to the colonists being represented by the provincial agents," he wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I know of no power ever given them but to appear before his Majesty, and his ministry. Sometimes they have been directed to petition the parliament: But they none of them have, and I hope never will have, a power given them, by the colonists, to act as representatives, and to consent to taxes; and if they should make any concessions to the ministry, especially without order, the provinces could not by that be considered as represented in parliament.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Colonists said no man was represented if he were not allowed to vote. Moreover, even "If every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold," said [[Daniel Dulany the Younger|Daniel Dulany]], "not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to become an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tracts of the American Revolution 1763–1776|editor=Merrill, Jensen|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cfo8b75HOT0C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=If+every+inhabitant+of+America+had+the+requisite+freehold+not+one+could+vote,+but+upon+the+supposition+of+his+ceasing+to+become+an+inhabitant+of+America,+and+becoming+a+resident+of+Great+Britain.%22#v=onepage&amp;q=If%20every%20inhabitant%20of%20America%20had%20the%20requisite%20freehold%20not%20one%20could%20vote%2C%20but%20upon%20the%20supposition%20of%20his%20ceasing%20to%20become%20an%20inhabitant%20of%20America%2C%20and%20becoming%20a%20resident%20of%20Great%20Britain.%22&amp;f=false|isbn=0-87220-693-9|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists and like-minded Britons insisted that representation was achieved only through an assembly of men actually elected by the persons they were intended to represent.&lt;ref name="google1" /&gt;

The argument between the colonies and Parliament sought to resolve how the British 'commoners' of the various part of the Empire were represented most constitutionally&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; – as Daniel Dulaney, an American Loyalist and lawyer, put it "[the] constitutional authority [of Parliament's rights to bind American subjects] depends upon the single question, Whether the Commons of Great-Britain are virtually the representatives of the Commons of America, or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/gkornbl/H397F10/Dulany-Considerations.htm |title=Considerations on the Propriety of Imposing Taxes in the British Colonies, for the Purpose of Raising a Revenue, by Act of Parliament |publisher=Oberlin.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pitt and Camden ===
The theory of virtual representation was attacked in Britain by [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden]], and his ally [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]].  William Pitt argued in 1766 that the Commons of Britain ought not to tax the '"Commons of America" without gaining consent of their representatives in stating, "even under former arbitrary reigns, Parliaments were ashamed of taxing a people without their consent, and allowed them representatives. Why did [Grenville] confine himself to Chester and Durham? He might have taken a higher example in Wales—Wales, that never was taxed by Parliament till it was incorporated."&lt;ref name="bartleby.com" /&gt; He then said, &lt;blockquote&gt;I am no courtier of America. I stand up for this kingdom. I maintain that the Parliament has a right to bind, to restrain America. Our legislative power over the colonies is sovereign and supreme. When it ceases to be sovereign and supreme, I would advise every gentleman to sell his lands, if he can, and embark for that country. When two countries are connected together like England and her colonies, without being incorporated, the one must necessarily govern. The greater must rule the less. But she must so rule it as not to contradict the fundamental principles that are common to both... let the sovereign authority of this country over the colonies be asserted in as strong terms as can be devised, and be made to extend to every point of legislation whatsoever; that we may bind their trade, confine their manufactures, and exercise every power whatsoever, except that of taking their money out of their pockets without their consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/cbo/chatham/chat08.htm#N_5_ |author=Earl of Chatham|title=Right of Taxing America|date=January 14, 1766 |publisher=Classicpersuasion.org |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his first speeches in Parliament, Lord Camden vigorously attacked the declaratory act which was proposed to mollify the crown on the repeal of the Stamp Tax. After his first affirmation of "no taxation without representation" Camden was attacked by British PM Grenville, [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas|Chief Justice]] [[James Mansfield]], [[Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;16 Parliamentary History of England, London: Hansard, 1813, pp. 170-77. "Lord Northington, leaving the woolsack, commenced in a tone most insulting to the new Peer, and, what was much worse, most insulting to the people of America,--Benjamin Franklin being a listener below the bar … ." 5 Lord Campbell, Lives of the Lord Chancellors, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; He responded:&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he British Parliament have no right to tax the Americans. I shall not consider the Declaratory Bill now lying on your table; for to what purpose, but loss of time, to consider the particulars of a Bill, the very existence of which is illegal, absolutely illegal, contrary to the fundamental laws of nature, contrary to the fundamental laws of this constitution? A constitution grounded on the eternal and immutable laws of nature; a constitution whose foundation and centre is liberty, which sends liberty to every individual who may happen to be within any part of its ample circumference. Nor, my Lords, is the doctrine new, it is as old as the constitution; it grew up with it; indeed it is its support; taxation and representation are inseparably united; God hath joined them, no British parliament can separate them; to endeavour to do it, is to stab our very vitals. … My position is this—I repeat it—I will maintain it to my last hour,—taxation and representation are inseparable; this position is founded on the laws of nature; it is more, it is itself an eternal law of nature; for whatever is a man's own, is absolutely his own; no man has a right to take it from him without his consent, either expressed by himself or representative; whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury; whoever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down and destroys the distinction between liberty and slavery. Taxation and representation are coeval with and essential to the constitution. … [T]here is not a blade of grass growing in the most obscure corner of this kingdom, which is not, which was not ever, represented since the constitution began; there is not a blade of grass, which when taxed, was not taxed by the consent of the proprietor. … I can never give my assent to any bill for taxing the American colonies, while they remain unrepresented; for as to the distinction of a virtual representation, it is so absurd as not to deserve an answer; I therefore pass it over with contempt. The forefathers of the Americans did not leave their native country, and subject themselves to every danger and distress, to be reduced to a state of slavery: they did not give up their rights; they looked for protection, and not for chains, from their mother country; by her they expected to be defended in the possession of their property, and not to be deprived of it: for, should the present power continue, there is nothing which they can call their own; or, to use the words of Mr. Locke, ‘What property have they in that, which another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to himself?’"&lt;ref&gt;16 Parliamentary History of England, London: Hansard, 1813, pp. 177-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In an appearance before Parliament in January, 1766, former Prime Minister [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea of a virtual representation of America in this House is the most contemptible that ever entered into the head of a man. It does not deserve a serious refutation. The Commons of America, represented in their several assemblies, have ever been in possession of the exercise of this their constitutional right, of giving and granting their own money. They would have been slaves if they had not enjoyed it.&lt;ref&gt;Walford Davis Green, ''William Pitt, Earl of Chatham and the Growth and Division of the British Empire, 1708–1778.'' 1901. p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Grenville responded to Pitt, saying the disturbances in America "border on open rebellion; and if the doctrine I have heard this day be confirmed, nothing can tend more directly to produce a revolution." External and internal taxes are the same, argued Grenville.&lt;ref&gt;sFor legal questions surrounding the constitutional nature of the Imperial Crown-in-Parliament's right to legislate and tax for the British Isles and Empire, and the colonies' chartered rights to legislate and tax themselves see {{Cite journal

[[File:No tuition without representation Shimer College.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shimer College]] student holds "No tuition without representation" sign during protest over school governance in 2010.]]
In the 1860s, [[suffragette]] [[Sarah E. Wall]] of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] invoked the principle of "no taxation without representation", initiating an anti-tax protest in which she encouraged women not to pay taxes until they were [[Women's suffrage in the United States|granted the right to vote]]. Soon after she began this movement, the Worcester city tax collector sued Wall for refusing to pay taxes, and the case reached the [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]] in 1863. In "Wheeler v. Wall," the court ruled against Wall and held that despite not having the right to vote, women are still obligated to meet their tax burden. Even still, Wall refused to cooperate with the collector, and as a result, officers seized and sold her property in order to raise the money necessary to meet her tax obligation. After several years, Wall's inexorability eventually prevailed, as the collector began to ignore Wall and allow her to abstain from paying taxes.&lt;ref name=UMKC&gt;{{cite web|title=Address of Susan B. Anthony|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/anthony/anthonyaddress.html|work=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, [[Susan B. Anthony]] cited Wall's audacity and willingness to stand up for women's suffrage, stating, "for the last twenty-five years, [she] has resisted the tax gatherer when he came around. I want you to look at her. She looks very harmless, but she will not pay a dollar of tax. She says when the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]] will give her the right of representation she will pay her taxes."&lt;ref name=Sven&gt;{{cite web|title=Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, 2d Session, 49th Congress, December 8, 1886, and January 25, 1887|url=http://www.sveninho.com/book/2259482/Debate-on-Woman-Suffrage-in-the-Senate-of-the-United-States--2d-Session--49th-Congress--December-8--1886--and-January-25--1887/|work=Sven Digital Books|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is also used by other groups in America who pay various types of taxes ([[Sales tax|sales]], [[income tax|income]], [[property tax|property]]) but lack the ability to vote, such as [[Felony|felons]] (who are, in many states, [[Disenfranchisement|barred from voting]]), people who work in one state and live in another (thus having to pay income tax to a state they don't live in), or [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|people under 18]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://16tovote.com/reasons.html Top Reasons National Youth Rights Association of Southeast Florida Wants a Lower Voting Age], 16tovote.com&lt;/ref&gt;

To become citizens of the United States, [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] most often must be permanent residents for a period of time (usually 5 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uscis.gov/graphics/services/factsheet/howdoi/B3.pdf |title=USCIS Home Page |publisher=Uscis.gov |accessdate=2011-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925104214/http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/services/factsheet/howdoi/B3.pdf |archivedate=September 25, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent residents must pay taxes on their worldwide income and, in most cases, cannot [[Elections in the United States|vote]]. However, throughout the 19th century, many states did allow immigrants to vote after they had declared their intention to become citizens. This was primarily because these new states were populated in large part by immigrants who had not yet attained citizenship. Throughout U.S. history, non-citizens have been allowed to vote in 40 U.S. states and territories.&lt;ref name=hayduk2006&gt;{{Citation

In 2009, the phrase "taxation without representation" was also used in the [[Tea Party protests]], where protesters were upset over increased government spending and taxes, and specifically regarding a growing concern amongst the group that the U.S. government is increasingly relying upon a form of taxation without representation through increased regulatory levies and fees which are allegedly passed via unelected government employees who have no direct responsibility to voters and cannot be held accountable by the public through elections.&lt;ref name=foxchicago&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxchicago.com/dpp/news/TeaParty |title=Protestors Gather for Self-Styled Tea Party |publisher=Myfoxchicago.com |date=February 27, 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified version of the phrase, "no tuition without representation", is sometimes used in disputes over [[governance in higher education]] in the United States to emphasize student's rights to a voice in institutional decisions.  The term first emerged in a 1977 dispute at [[Union County College]] in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Jersey's Union College: A History, 1933–1983|page=232

In the United States, the phrase is used in [[Washington, D.C.]] as part of the [[District of Columbia voting rights|campaign for a vote]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]], to publicize the fact that Washington residents pay Federal taxes, but do not have representation in Congress. In November 2000, the D.C.

== Modern use in the United Kingdom ==
British Prime Minister [[John Major]] used a modified version of the quote, with the order reversed, in October 1995, when at the [[United Nations]]'s 50th Anniversary celebrations he said, "It is not sustainable for states to enjoy representation without taxation," in order to criticize the billion-dollar [[arrears]] of the United States' payments to the UN, echoing a statement made the previous month at the opening session of the UN General Assembly by UK Foreign Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/finance/chronol/fin1995.htm |title=Chronology of the United Nations Financial Crisis: 1995 – Global Policy Forum |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use in Canada ==
In Canada, [[Québec]] politician [[Gilles Duceppe]], former leader of the [[Bloc Québécois]], has repeatedly cited this phrase in defending the presence of his party in [[Ottawa]]. The Bloc is a [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Québec sovereigntist]] party solely running candidates in Canadian Federal elections in the province of Québec. Duceppe's evocation of the phrase implies that the proponents of Quebec's sovereigntist movement have the right to be represented in the body (which they are), the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]], which levies taxes upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-bloc-at-20-a-conversation-with-gilles-duceppe/|magazine=Maclean's|date=2010-05-20|title=The Bloc at 20: a conversation with Gilles Duceppe|first=John|last=Geddes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will usually cite the sentence in its original English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|magazine=L'actualité|date=2005-11-01|first=Micheline|last=Lachance|title=Il fait bouger le Canada|url=http://www.lactualite.com/actualites/politique/il-fait-bouger-le-canada/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philip Morris v. Uruguay case'''  ({{lang-es|'''Caso Philip Morris contra Uruguay'''}}) started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational [[tobacco company]] [[Philip Morris International]] filed a complaint against [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |title = Philip Morris versus Uruguay |author = El Espectador |date = 9 March 2010 |accessdate = 15 November 2010 |language = Spanish |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100314160056/http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |archivedate = 14 March 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The company complains that Uruguay's [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]] devalues its cigarette trademarks and investments in the country and is suing Uruguay for compensation under the [[bilateral investment treaty]] between Switzerland and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; (Philip Morris is headquartered in [[Lausanne]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pmi.com/marketpages/pages/market_en_ch.aspx | title =Philip Morris International Management SA - Switzerland Operations Centre | author = [[Philip Morris International|PMI]] | accessdate = 15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty provides that disputes are settled by binding [[arbitration]] before the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uruguay-wins-dispute-tobacco-giant-philip-morris-40448855 | title=Uruguay Wins Dispute With Tobacco Giant Philip Morris | work=ABC News | date=8 July 2016 | author=AP | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709143704/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uruguay-wins-dispute-tobacco-giant-philip-morris-40448855 | archive-date=2016-07-09 | access-date=23 October 2016 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay had received accolades from the [[World Health Organization]] and from anti-smoking activists for its [[Tobacco control|anti-smoking campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/208683/cigarrillos-mentolados-aumentan-la-adiccion/|title = Cigarrillos mentolados aumentan la adicción|author = El Observador |date = 6 September 2011|accessdate =13 September 2011 |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2003, when the Uruguayan President was [[Jorge Batlle]], the [[General Assembly of Uruguay]] approved the [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], an agreement whereby Policies recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] were implemented.

In 2006, Uruguay under President [[Tabaré Vázquez]], an [[oncologist]] by profession, began to enact comprehensive [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]].
On 1 March 2006, Uruguay became the first country in [[Latin America]] to prohibit smoking in enclosed public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/461696-uruguay-cree-que-philip-morris-incumplio-pasos-previos-a-la-demanda| title = Uruguay cree que Philip Morris incumplió pasos previos a la demanda |author =LR21| date =9 July 2011|accessdate =4 August 2011|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 the legislature approved Law 18.256 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|title = Ley Nº 18.256 Control del Tabaquismo|author = Uruguay Legislature|date = 6 March 2008|accessdate = 10 March 2009|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140416104642/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|archivedate = 16 April 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes six strategies of anti-smoking policy.

Some of the measures by the government were the ban on selling different types of presentations of the same brand of cigarettes, the dissemination of images warning about the risks of smoking and covering at least 80% of the cigarette pack, raising of taxes, banning cigarette advertising in the media, and banning sponsorship of sports events. In addition, smoking was banned in public places such as offices, student centers, bars, restaurants, dances and public places, among others.

The smokefree campaign "Libre de Humo de Tabaco" was gradually implemented by the "Ministerio de Salud Pública del Uruguay" ([[List of Ministers for Public Health (Uruguay)|Ministry of Public Health of Uruguay]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|title = Campaña "Libre de Humo de Tabaco"|author = MSP|accessdate = 15 November 2010|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615005816/http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|archivedate = 15 June 2010|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complaint ==

[[Philip Morris International]] is a multinational company, a leading producer of cigarettes, of which it owns seven out of twenty global brands.

The tobacco company initiated a claim in the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), a part of the [[World Bank]] seeking $25 million in compensation from Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Alfred-Maurice de Zayas]]|title=How can Philip Morris sue Uruguay over its tobacco laws?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/16/philip-morris-uruguay-tobacco-isds-human-rights|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that forum, an arbitration tribunal was formed with one arbitrator appointed by each party and a third arbitrator elected by the arbitrators appointed by the parties. The plaintiffs are FTR Holding SA (Switzerland), Philip Morris Products SA (Switzerland) and Abal Hermanos SA (PMI representative in Uruguay) against Uruguay (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet|title = ICSID - Case Details|author = [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]]|date = 26 March 2010|accessdate =17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Morris has filed similar cases against [[Norway]] and [[Australia]].

== Decision == 
On 2 July 2013, the tribunal decided it had jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw1531.pdf |title =Decision on Jurisdiction |date=4 July 2013|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution of the case, which affected international&amp;nbsp;[[jurisprudence]], took 6 years; the case ended on 8 July 2016. The [[World Bank]] [ICSID] ruled in favor of Uruguay, forcing the demandant to pay the costs of the defendants and the court.
The final report established that [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] had to pay 7 million [[dollars]] to the country for judicial expenses, in addition to paying different amounts for the fees and administrative expenses of the three arbitrators and the CADI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/fallo-favorable-uruguay-juicio-philip-morris.html|title = Philip Morris deberá pagar a Uruguay US$ 7 millones por gastos judiciales|author = [[El País (Uruguay)|El País]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Born]] emitted a discordant decision in two of the points of the judicial failure.

== Effects ==

According to Enrico Bonadio, Senior Lecturer in Law at [[City University London]], the ruling in the case "may make it more difficult for tobacco companies to use lawsuits to produce a “[[chilling effect]]” and so discourage countries from introducing tobacco control policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/uruguays-victory-against-big-tobacco-is-more-than-just-a-local-triumph-62319|title=Uruguay's victory against Big Tobacco is more than just a local triumph|author= theconversation|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1707">A '''presumption of constitutionality''' shifts the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] from the government to the citizen, requiring them to prove that a statute is [[unconstitutional]]. 

In [[Federalist 78]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] wrote that courts should be able strike down a statute as unconstitutional only if there is an "irreconcilable variance" between the statute and the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander. [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa78.htm Federalist #78] (1788-06-14).&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, a statute should be upheld.

Likewise, at the 1787 [[Philadelphia Convention]], Virginia delegate [[George Mason]] said that judges "could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as Judges to give it a free course."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_7_2-3s4.html "Founders’ Constitution, Article 1, Section 7, Clauses 2 and 3"], Records of the Federal Convention (1787-06-04).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Randy Barnett]] argues that such a presumption is itself unconstitutional and suggests that government should be forced to prove that laws that violate liberty are necessary and prope in what he calls the "presumption of liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy.  ''[[Restoring the Lost Constitution|Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty]]'' (Princeton University Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Privacy may be lessened by [[surveillance]] – in this case through [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]].]]
'''Privacy''' is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a ''person'', it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them. The domain of privacy partially overlaps with [[security]] (confidentiality), which can include the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of [[bodily integrity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Herring, ''Medical Law and Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the [[government]], [[corporation]]s or [[individual]]s is part of many countries' [[#Privacy law|privacy laws]], and in some cases, [[constitution]]s. All countries have laws which in some way limit privacy. An example of this would be law concerning [[taxation]], which normally requires the sharing of information about personal [[income]] or [[earnings]]. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with [[freedom of speech]] laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures. This was a major concern in the United States, with the Supreme Court passage of [[Citizens United]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Privacy may be [[Communication privacy management theory|voluntarily sacrificed]], normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. For example, people may be ready to reveal their name, if that allows them to promote trust by others and thus build meaningful social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaudeul|first=Alexia|last2=Giannetti|first2=Caterina|title=The effect of privacy concerns on social network formation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167268117301853|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=141|pages=233–253|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2017.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that people are more willing to voluntarily sacrifice privacy if the data gatherer is seen to be transparent as to what information is gathered and how it is used.&lt;ref name="transparency"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oulasvirta |first=Antti |last2=Suomalainen |first2=Tiia |last3=Hamari |first3=Juho |last4=Lampinen |first4=Airi |last5=Karvonen |first5=Kristiina |date=2014 |title=Transparency of Intentions Decreases Privacy Concerns in Ubiquitous Surveillance |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264638054_Transparency_of_Intentions_Decreases_Privacy_Concerns_in_Ubiquitous_Surveillance |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=633–38 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for [[advertising]] purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize. A person may also disclose personal information as part of being an executive for a publicly traded company in the USA pursuant to federal securities law.&lt;ref&gt;Undressing the CEO: Disclosing Private, Material Matters of Public Company Executives, 11 Penn. Journal of Bus. Law 383 (2009), available at:http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040940&lt;/ref&gt; Personal information which is voluntarily shared but subsequently stolen or misused can lead to [[identity theft]].

The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct primarily associated with [[Western culture]], British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. According to some researchers, this concept sets [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American]] culture apart even from Western European cultures such as French or Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zemskaya|first=E. A.|title=Особенности русской речи эмигрантов четвертой волны (Features of the Russian language of fourth wave immigrants)|url=http://www.gramota.ru/biblio/magazines/gramota/28_520|publisher=Gramota.ru|accessdate=24 February 2009|language=Russian|date=9 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cultures, however, recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society—closing the door to one's home, for example.

The distinction or overlap between [[secrecy]] and privacy is [[ontology|ontologically]] subtle, which is why the word "privacy" is an example of an [[Untranslatability|untranslatable]] [[lexeme]],&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"/&gt; and many languages do not have a specific word for "privacy". Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of ''уединение''—solitude, ''секретность''—secrecy, and ''частная жизнь''—private life) or borrow from English "privacy" (as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''privasi'' or [[Italian language|Italian]] ''la privacy'').&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"&gt;{{cite book|title=Translation Today: Trends and Perspectives |last=Anderman |first=Gunilla M. |author2=Rogers, Margaret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJxVffwZEDgC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy&amp;f=false |publisher=Multilingual Matters |year=2003 |accessdate=1 January 2012|isbn=9781853596186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction hinges on the discreteness of [[wikt:interest#Noun|interests]] of parties (persons or groups), which can have [[emic and etic|emic]] variation depending on cultural mores of [[individualism]], [[collectivism]], and the negotiation between [[individual and group rights]]. The difference is sometimes expressed humorously as, "when ''I'' withhold information, it is privacy; when ''you'' withhold information, it is secrecy."

==Concepts==
A broad multicultural literary tradition going to the beginnings of recorded history discusses the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}} One way of categorizing all concepts of privacy is by considering all discussions as one of these concepts:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}}

# the right to be let alone
# the option to limit the access others have to one's personal information
# [[secrecy]], or the option to conceal any information from others
# control over others' use of information about oneself
# states of privacy
# [[personhood]] and autonomy
# self-identity and personal growth
# protection of [[intimate relationships]]

===Right to be let alone===
In 1890 the United States [[jurists]] [[Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]] wrote ''[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]'', an article in which they argued for the "right to be let alone", using that phrase as a definition of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being "let alone", and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose [[seclusion]] from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one’s own home.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}}

===Limited access===
Limited access refers to a person’s ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}

Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one’s personal information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}} [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] wrote in the late 19th century that "nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godkin|first1=E.L.|authorlink1=Edwin Lawrence Godkin|title=Libel and its Legal Remedy|journal=[[Atlantic Monthly]]|date=December 1880|volume=46|issue=278|pages=729–39|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0046-6;didno=atla0046-6;view=image;seq=0735;node=atla0046-6%3A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison&lt;ref name="transparency" /&gt; 9 years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gavison|first1=Ruth|authorlink1=Ruth Gavison|title=Privacy and the Limits of Law|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=1980|pages=421–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sissela Bok]] said that privacy is "the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others—either physical access, personal information, or attention."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bok|first1=Sissela|authorlink1=Sissela Bok|title=Secrets : on the ethics of concealment and revelation|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679724735|pages=10–11|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control over information===
Control over one's personal information is the concept that "privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is from Alan Westin.{{cite book|last1=Westin|first1=Alan F.|last2=Blom-Cooper|first2=Louis|authorlink1=Alan Westin|authorlink2=Louis Blom-Cooper|title=Privacy and freedom|date=1970|publisher=Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-0370013251|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Fried]] said that "Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves. Nevertheless, in the era of [[big data]], control over information is under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/46935|title=Predicting Data that People Refuse to Disclose; How Data Mining Predictions Challenge Informational Self-Determination|last=B.H.M.|first=Custers,|last2=Metajuridica|first2=Instituut voor|website=openaccess.leidenuniv.nl|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== States of privacy ===
Alan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude is a physical separation from others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privacy and Freedom|last = Westin|first = Alan|publisher = Atheneum|year = 1967|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimacy is a "close, relaxed, and frank relationship between two or more individuals" that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Anonymity is the "desire of individuals for times of 'public privacy.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, reserve is the "creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion"; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual's need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning himself or herself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Behavioural Understanding of Privacy and Its Implications for Privacy Law|last = Hughes|first = Kirsty|date = 2012|journal = The Modern Law Review|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In this sense, "accessing" an individual includes accessing personal information about him or her.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want them to access or experience him or her.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Secrecy===
Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to "conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage".{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=21}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|authorlink1=Richard Posner|title=The economics of justice|date=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674235267|page=271|edition=5. print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion if privacy is secrecy then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}} When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}}

===Personhood and autonomy===
Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood. Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one's ownership of his or her physical and mental reality and a moral right to his or her self-determination.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Intimacy, and Personhood|last = Reiman|first = Jeffrey|date = 1976|journal = Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the "social ritual" of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individual's privacy barriers, the social group communicates to the developing child that he or she has exclusive moral rights to his or her body—in other words, he or she has moral ownership of his or her body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This entails control over both active (physical) and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over one's movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one's physical existence and when.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Alternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency—as an individual with the capacity to choose.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Philosophical Dimensions of Privacy: An Anthology|last = Benn|first = Stanley|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = |editor-first = Ferdinand|chapter = Privacy, freedom, and respect for persons|editor-last = Schoeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy is required to exercise choice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a "determinate character" and "limited probabilities."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood. According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a "purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent" and an awareness of one's capacity to control the boundary between self and other—that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Autonomy, and Self-Concept|last = Kufer|first = Joseph|date = 1987|journal = American Philosophical Quarterly|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the self's boundaries—in other words, they must respect the individual's privacy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffman's study of "total institutions" such as prisons and mental institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates|last = Goffman|first = Erving|publisher = Doubleday|year = 1968|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one's sense of autonomy over time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Self-identity and personal growth ===
Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity. Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process. According to Irwin Altman, such barriers "define and limit the boundaries of the self" and thus "serve to help define [the self]."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Environment and Social Behavior: Privacy, Personal Space, Territory, and Crowding|last = Altman|first = Irwin|publisher = Brooks/Cole Publishing Company|year = 1975|isbn = |location = Monterey|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Control over the "permeability" of the self's boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity. Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy—solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles—individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to one's understanding of oneself and shapes one's sense of identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Intimacy===
In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or [[intimate relationships]] with other humans.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}} Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to self-disclose some information, but withholding other information, there is a concept of privacy as a part of the process by means of which humans establish relationships with each other.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}

[[James Rachels]] advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because "there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us, and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rachels|first1=James|authorlink1=James Rachels|title=Why Privacy is Important|journal=[[Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs]]|date=Summer 1975|volume=4|issue=4|pages=323–33|jstor=2265077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concepts in popular media===
Privacy can mean different things in different contexts; different people, cultures, and nations have different expectations about how much privacy a person is entitled to or what constitutes an [[invasion of privacy]].

====Personal privacy====
Most people have a strong sense of privacy in relation to the exposure of their body to others. This is an aspect of personal [[modesty]]. A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of [[clothing|clothes]]. Other ways include erection of [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, screens, use of [[cathedral glass]], partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways. People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others. At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of [[physical intimacy]], but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing. Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.

Physical privacy could be defined as preventing "intrusions into one's physical space or solitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwQBT2Mr1YoC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=physical+privacy&amp;sig=dvybgqk6wfkf_xGimY8lvtWVV3I|title=Managing Privacy: Information Technology and Corporate America|first=H. Jeff|last=Smith|date=14 April 1994|publisher=UNC Press Books|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This would include concerns such as:
* Preventing intimate acts or hiding one's body from others for the purpose of [[modesty]]; apart from being [[clothing|dressed]] this can be achieved by [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, privacy screens, [[cathedral glass]], partitions between [[urinal (restroom)|urinals]], by being far away from others, on a bed by a [[bed sheet]] or a [[blanket]], when changing clothes by a [[towel]], etc.; to what extent these measures also prevent acts being ''heard'' varies
* Video, of aptly named graphic, or intimate, acts, behaviors or body parts
* Preventing searching of one's personal possessions
* Preventing unauthorized access to one's home or vehicle
* [[Medical privacy]], the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third-party review, most widely applied to questions of contraception

An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which guarantees "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310024937/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-03-10 |work=Georgetown Law Journal |title=Fixing the Fourth Amendment with trade secret law: A response to Kyllo v. United States |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries have laws regarding [[trespassing]] and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.

Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness. There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |title=Security Recommendations For Stalking Victims |publisher=Privacyrights.org |accessdate=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111081006/http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |archive-date=2012-01-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil inattention]] is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.

====Informational====
{{Main|Information privacy}}

Information or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of, privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one's self. Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise. In some cases these concerns refer to how data are collected, stored, and associated. In other cases the issue is who is given access to information. Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.

Various types of [[personal information]] are often associated with privacy concerns. Information plays an important role in the decision-action process, which can lead to problems in terms of privacy and availability. First, it allows people to see all the options and alternatives available. Secondly, it allows people to choose which of the options would be best for a certain situation. An information landscape consists of the information, its location in the so-called network, as well as its availability, awareness, and usability. Yet the set-up of the information landscape means that information that is available in one place may not be available somewhere else. This can lead to a privacy situation that leads to questions regarding which people have the power to access and use certain information, who should have that power, and what provisions govern it. For various reasons, individuals may object to personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities being revealed, perhaps to avoid [[discrimination]], personal embarrassment, or damage to their professional reputations.

[[Financial privacy]], in which information about a person's financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of [[fraud]] including [[identity theft]]. Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits, etc. In addition to this, financial privacy also includes privacy over the bank accounts opened by individuals. Information about the bank where the individual has an account with, and whether or not this is in a country that [[Bank secrecy|does not share this information with other countries]] can help countries in fighting [[tax avoidance]].

[[Internet privacy]] is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the Internet, who has access to such information, and for what purposes one's information may or may not be used. For example, web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about them. Similarly, Internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their [[email]] was being accessed, read, stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent. Tools used to protect privacy on the Internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].

[[Medical privacy]] Protected Health Information OCR/HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments. Medical information could also reveal other aspects of one's personal life, such as sexual preferences or proclivity. A right to sexual privacy enables individuals to [[contraceptive security|acquire and use contraceptives]] without family, community or legal sanctions.

[[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways, since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote. Secret ballots are nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered a basic right of [[citizenship]], despite the difficulties that they cause (for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system: additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks).

Corporate privacy refers to the privacy rights of corporate actors like senior executives of large, publicly traded corporations. Desires for corporate privacy can frequently raise issues with obligations for public disclosures under securities and corporate law.

====Organizational====

Government agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various [[security]] practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential. Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets. For example, a government administration may be able to invoke [[executive privilege]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/amar/20040416.html |title=FindLaw's Writ – Amar: Executive Privilege |publisher=Writ.corporate.findlaw.com |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or declare certain information to be [[Classified information|classified]], or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

====Spiritual and intellectual====

The earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under [[British common law]], which protected "only the physical interference of life and property." Its development from then on became "one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law."&lt;ref name=Solove&gt;Solove, Daniel J., Rotenberg, Marc, Schwartz, Paul M. ''Privacy, Information, and Technology'', Aspen Publ. (2006) pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a "recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect."&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt; Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic "right to be let alone", and the former definition of "property" would then comprise "every form of possession—intangible, as well as tangible." By the late 19th century, interest in a "right to privacy" grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers.&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt;

==History==
{{further|Privacy laws of the United States}}
Privacy has historical roots in philosophical discussions, the most well-known being Aristotle's distinction between two spheres of life: the public sphere of the ''polis'', associated with political life, and the private sphere of the ''oikos'', associated with domestic life.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2015|title = Privacy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/privacy/|date = 2015-01-01|first = Judith|last = DeCew|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; More systematic treatises of privacy in the United States did not appear until the 1890s, with the development of privacy law in America.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Technology===
[[File:IllinoisTelephoneAndTelegraphAd.png|thumb|200px|Advertisement for dial telephone service available to delegates to the 1912 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] convention in [[Chicago]]. A major selling point of dial telephone service was that it was "secret", in that no operator was required to connect the call.]]

As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the [[printing press]] or the [[Internet]], the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the article by [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]], "[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]", [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html 4 ''Harvard Law Review'' 193 (1890)], that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Information Privacy, Official Reference for the Certified Information privacy Professional (CIPP), Swire, P.&amp;nbsp;P. [https://www.amazon.com/s?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Peter%20P.%20Swire]. and Bermann, S. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/privacy.htm |title=Privacy Law in the United States |publisher=Rbs2.com |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. For example, in the United States it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana-growing operations would be acceptable. However, in 2001 in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'' (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that the use of [[thermal imaging]] devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/ |title=Privacy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy. As large-scale [[information systems]] become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of [[information privacy]] has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe. [[Privacy law]] in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights. But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient. Proposals such as the [[APEC]] Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.

There are various theories about privacy and privacy control. The Invasion Paradigm defines privacy violation as the hostile actions of a wrongdoer who causes direct harm to an individual. This is a reactive view of privacy protection as it waits until there is a violation before acting to protect the violated individual, sometimes through criminal punishments for those who invaded the privacy of others. In the Invasion Paradigm this threat of criminal punishment that is supposed to work as deterrent. The Secrecy paradigm defines a privacy invasion as someone’s concealed information or hidden world being revealed through surveillance. The Negative Freedom Paradigm views privacy as freedom from invasion rather than a right, going against the more popular view of a "right to privacy." Finally, the Inaccessibility Paradigm states that privacy is the state where something is completely inaccessible to others. Daniel Solove, a law professor at George Washington University also has a theory of privacy. He believes that a conceptualized view of privacy will not work because there is no one core element. There are many different, interconnected elements involved in privacy and privacy protection. Therefore, Solove proposes looking at these issues from the bottom up, focusing on privacy problems. People may often overlook the fact that certain elements of privacy problems are due to the structure of privacy itself. Therefore, the architecture must change wherein people must learn to view privacy as a social and legal structure. He also states that people have to redefine the relationship between privacy and businesses and the government. Participation in certain privacy elements of the government and businesses should allow people to choose whether they want to be a part of certain aspects of their work that could be considered privacy invasion.

===Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}

The Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: "where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever", writes law professor and author [[Jeffrey Rosen]].&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology "The Web Means the End of Forgetting"] ''New York Times'', July 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This currently has an effect on employment. [[Microsoft]] reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and [[Twitter]]. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. [[Facebook]] for example, as of August 2015, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 1,490 million members, who upload over 4.75 billion pieces of content daily. Over 83.09 million accounts were fake. [[Twitter]] has more than 316 million registered users and over 20 million are fake users. The [[Library of Congress]] recently announced that it will be acquiring—and permanently storing—the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006, reports Rosen.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

Importantly, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Stillwell, D. |author3=Graepel, T. |title=Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2013|volume=110|issue=15|pages=5802–05|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1073/pnas.1218772110|pmid=23479631|pmc=3625324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Bachrach, Y. |author3=Stillwell, D.J. |author4=Kohli, P. |author5=Graepel, T. |title=Manifestations Of User Personality In Website Choice And Behaviour On Online Social Networks|journal=Machine Learning Journal|date=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, individual views and preferences can be revealed even if they were not directly expressed or indicated (e.g. by stating their political views on their Facebook profile, or visiting a gay community website).

According to some experts, many commonly used communication devices may be mapping every move of their users. Senator [[Al Franken]] has noted the seriousness of [[iPhones]] and [[iPads]] having the ability to record and store users' locations in unencrypted files,&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, Helen A.&amp;nbsp;S., [https://archive.is/20120714202126/http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/04/21/6508416-govt-officials-want-answers-to-secret-iphone-tracking "Gov't officials want answers to secret iPhone tracking"] ''MSNBC'', "Technology", April 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; although Apple denied doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216210/Apple_denies_tracking_iPhone_users_but_promises_changes?taxonomyId=84 "Apple denies tracking iPhone users, but promises changes"], ''Computerworld'', April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Grove]], co-founder and former CEO of [[Intel Corporation]], offered his thoughts on internet privacy in an interview published in May 2000:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/learned-andy-grove-0500 "What I've Learned: Andy Grove"], ''Esquire'' magazine, May 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Privacy is one of the biggest problems in this new electronic age. At the heart of the Internet culture is a force that wants to find out everything about you. And once it has found out everything about you and two hundred million others, that's a very valuable asset, and people will be tempted to trade and do commerce with that asset. This wasn't the information that people were thinking of when they called this the information age.}}

==Actions which take away privacy==
As with other concepts about privacy, there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove, challenge, lessen, or attack privacy. In 1960 legal scholar [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]] created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prosser|first1=William|authorlink1=William Prosser (academic)|title=Privacy|journal=[[California Law Review]]|date=1960|volume=48|issue=383|page=389|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol48/iss3/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Intrusion into a person’s private space, own affairs, or wish for solitude{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Encroaching someone’s personality rights, and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their own{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}

Building from this and other historical precedents, [[Daniel J. Solove]] presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}}

===Collecting information===
In the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Surveillance is an example of this, when someone decides to begin watching and recording someone or something, and interrogation is another example of this, when someone uses another person as a source of information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Examples of information collection agencies include the [[NSA]] and the participants in the [[Five Eyes]] program.

===Aggregating information===
It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set then processed in a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* [[data aggregation]], which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* identification, which can mean breaking the [[de-identification]] of items of data by putting it through a [[de-anonymization]] process, thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* insecurity, such as lack of [[data security]], which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a [[data breach]] which harms the people whose data it held{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* secondary use, which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose, but then the data is used in ways without the data donors’ [[informed consent]]{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* exclusion is the use of a person's data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Information dissemination===
{{quote|''Count not him among your friends who will retail your privacies to the world.''|[[Publilius Syrus]]}}
Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

There are various examples of this.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person’s information private, then breaks that promise.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxxing.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Appropriation is an attack on the [[personhood]] of someone, and can include using the value of someone's reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Invasions===
Invasion of privacy, a subset of [[expectation of privacy]], is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person's private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} "Decisional interference" is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person's private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

==Right to privacy==
{{main|Right to privacy}}

Privacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In North America, [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis D. Brandeis]] wrote that privacy is the "right to be let alone" (Warren &amp; Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals. This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as [[yellow journalism]].&lt;ref name=Brandeis&gt;Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 "The Right To Privacy"], 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his [[Louis Brandeis#Creating a Right to Privacy|''Harvard Law Review'' article]] in 1890. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying "the government [was] identified .... as a potential privacy invader." He writes, "Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet." At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].

===Definitions===

In recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a "right to privacy." Some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy "should not be defined as a separate legal right" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Haifa&gt;Yael Onn, et al., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&amp;f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''], Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology, (2005) pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Dean Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a "common ground" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of "privacy in the digital environment", suggests that the "right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself." It has therefore proposed a working definition for a "right to privacy":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.''&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An individual right===

[[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as "the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. These states must balance participation against norms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.
— Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968&lt;ref&gt;Westin, A. (1968). Privacy and freedom (Fifth ed.). New York: Atheneum.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].

David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves "the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information". This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used".&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posner | first1 = R. A. | year = 1981 | title = The economics of privacy | url = | journal = The American Economic Review | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 405–09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

===A collective "value" and a "human right"===

There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–42|edition=8th|authorlink=Privacy|editors=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy. This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2006). Communitarianism. In B. S. Turner (Ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology (pp. 81–83). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Etzioni believes that "[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others",&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2007). Are new technologies the enemy of privacy? Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy, 20, 115–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight (ibid). He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance by weakening informal social controls.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the government is no longer the only or even principle threat to people's privacy. Etzioni notes that corporate data miners, or "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf Privacy Merchants]," stand to profit by selling massive dossiers personal information, including purchasing decisions and Internet traffic, to the highest bidder. And while some might not find collection of private information objectionable when it is only used commercially by the private sector, the information these corporations amass and process is also available to the government, so that it is no longer possible to protect privacy by only curbing the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etzioni |first=Amitai |title=The Privacy Merchants: What is to be done? |journal=The Journal of Constitutional Law |date=March 2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=950 |url=http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection".&lt;ref&gt;Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]]: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (1948). Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Retrieved October 7, 2006 from {{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080853/http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, 28(1), 80–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection==
[[File:Privacy International 2007 privacy ranking map.png|thumb|300px|[[Privacy International]] 2007 privacy ranking&lt;br /&gt;green: Protections and safeguards&lt;br /&gt;red: Endemic surveillance societies]]

Most countries give citizen rights to privacy in their constitutions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Representative examples of this include the ''[[Constitution of Brazil]]'', which says "the privacy, private life, honor and image of people are inviolable"; the ''[[Constitution of South Africa]]'' says that "everyone has a right to privacy"; and the ''[[Constitution of the Republic of Korea]]'' says "the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights, court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Many countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions, including Australia’s [[Privacy Act 1988]], Argentina’s Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000, Canada’s 2000 [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and Japan’s 2003 Personal Information Protection Law.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Beyond national privacy laws, there are international privacy agreements.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3}} The United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] says "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980. The [[European Union]]'s 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] guides privacy protection in Europe.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The 2004 Privacy Framework by the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

In the 1960s people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} [[Vance Packard]]’s ''[[The Naked Society]]'' was a popular book on privacy from that era and led discourse on privacy at that time.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

===Free market versus consumer protection approaches===
Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ethics for the Information Age | author=Quinn, Michael J. | year=2009 | isbn=0-321-53685-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share. Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices. Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.

In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available. In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Privacy policies as decision-making tools: an evaluation of online privacy notices | author=Jensen, Carlos | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.

===Privacy law===
{{Main|Privacy law}}

Privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals. While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries. For example, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 12, states:

:''No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.''

====Australia====
{{main |Privacy in Australian law}}

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' is administered by the [https://www.oaic.gov.au Office of the Australian Information Commissioner].

Privacy law has been evolving in Australia for a number of years. The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector, specifically to Federal government departments, under the Information Privacy Principles. State government agencies can also be subject to state based privacy legislation. This built upon the already existing privacy requirements that applied to telecommunications providers (under Part 13 of the ''Telecommunications Act 1997''), and confidentiality requirements that already applied to banking, legal and patient / doctor relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/|title=Privacy Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' was then extended to include the private sector in 2000 with the introduction of the National Privacy Principles. These took effect in 2001. Small businesses with an annual turnover of $3m were excluded from meeting the obligations specified in the National Privacy Principles with some exceptions such as those whose primary business was dealing in personal information.

In 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) conducted a review of Australian Privacy Law. The resulting report [http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/report-108 For Your Information] was one of the largest reports ever released by the ALRC. Amongst its many recommendations were the consolidation of both the Information Privacy Principles and the National Privacy Principles to form what is now known as the Australian Privacy Principles.

This recommendation, and many others, were taken up and implemented by the Australian Government via the [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00197 Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012].

The Australian Privacy Principles, along with other key changes to the overall Act, took effect on 12 March 2014. The new structure of the privacy principles follow the information cycle and incorporate key emerging privacy concepts including privacy by design.

There are currently 14 Australian Privacy Principles:

# open and transparent management of personal information
# anonymity and pseudonymity
# collection of solicited personal information
# dealing with unsolicited personal information
# notification of the collection of personal information
# use or disclosure of personal information
# direct marketing
# cross-border disclosure of personal information
# adoption, use or disclosure of government related identifiers
# quality of personal information
# security of personal information
# access to personal information
# correction of personal information

As of 22 February 2018, the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 will introduce a mandatory data breach notification obligations for all organisations that are subject to Australia’s Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). This includes all Australian-registered companies and foreign-registered companies that carry on business in Australia or that interact with Australian data subjects.

===== Other Australian privacy laws =====

There are a range of other laws that provide privacy protection in Australia. These include, but are not limited to, the ''Telecommunications Act 1997'', ''Spam Act 2006'', the ''Do Not Call Register Act 2009'', general confidentiality obligations arising from certain professional relationships including with doctors, lawyers and other health providers, state based legislation including NSW [[Employee monitoring|workplace surveillance]] laws, state based laws that apply in NSW, Queensland and other states for the handling of health information and the handling of information by state government agencies.

====Brazil====
The [[Constitution of Brazil]] sets privacy as a major fundamental right. Even the State is not allowed to violate personal data, intimacy, private life, honor and image (article 5, incise X). In extreme situations, a judicial order can authorize some level of disclosure. But some data, such as correspondence, are absolutely inviolable, and not even judicial order can authorize the disclosure.

====China====

Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China

Article 245 Whoever unlawfully subjects another person to a body search or a search of his residence or unlawfully intrudes into another person's residence shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. Any judicial officer who abuses his power and commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be given a heavier punishment.

Article 246 Whoever, by violence or other methods, publicly humiliates another person or invent stories to defame him, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance or deprivation of political rights. The crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be handled only upon complaint, except where serious harm is done to public order or to the interests of the State.

Article 252 Whoever conceals, destroys or unlawfully opens another person's letter, thereby infringing upon the citizen's right to freedom of correspondence, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than one year or criminal detention.

Article 253 Any postal worker who opens without authorization or conceals or destroys mail or telegrams shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years or criminal detention. Whoever steals money or property by committing the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be convicted and given a heavier punishment in accordance with the provisions of Article 264 of this Law.

====Canada====
{{main |Canadian privacy law}}

[[Canadian privacy law]] is governed federally by multiple acts, including the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and the [[Privacy Act (Canada)]]. Mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations. [[Data privacy]] was first addressed with the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and provincial-level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations.

====European Union====
For [[Europe]], Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, one's home and correspondence. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The [[European Union]] requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy, through directives such as the 1995 [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data]]. It is regulated in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] and in France [[data protection]] is also monitored by the [[CNIL]], a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before it can be enacted. In civil law jurisdictions, the right to privacy fell within the ambit of the right to a private life (droit a la vie privee) from which the tort could be claimed. Personality rights and the broader tort based
interpretation of the right to privacy protected correspondence, personal information and dignity. These rights gave rise to causes for damages in most civil law jurisdictions and common law jurisdictions prior to the sui generis development of Data Protection.

Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection, some studies show that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws.&lt;ref&gt;Burghardt, Buchmann, Böhm, Kühling, Sivridis ''A Study on the Lack of Enforcement of Data Protection Acts'' Proceedings of the 3rd int. conference on e-democracy, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union is also championing for the 'Right to be Forgotten' concept (which allows individuals to ask that links leading to information about themselves be removed from internet search engine results) to be adopted by other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/french-official-campaigns-to-make-right-to-be-forgotten-global/|title=French Official Campaigns to Make 'Right to be Forgotten' Global|first=Mark|last=Scott|date=3 December 2014|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''India'''

Due to the introduction of the Aadhaar project inhabitants of India were afraid that their privacy could be invaded. The project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masiero|first=Silvia|date=2018-09-24|title=Explaining Trust in Large Biometric Infrastructures: A Critical Realist Case Study of India's Aadhaar Project|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/isd2.12053|journal=The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|language=en|pages=e12053|doi=10.1002/isd2.12053|issn=1681-4835}}&lt;/ref&gt; To tackle the fear amongst the people, India’s supreme court put a new ruling into action that stated that privacy from then on was seen as a fundamental right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gemalto.com/govt/customer-cases/aadhaar|title=Aadhaar: 7 changes transforming India in 2018 {{!}} Gemalto|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gemalto.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24th of August 2017 this new law was established.

====Italy====
In [[Italy]] the [[right to privacy]] is enshrined in Article 15 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and of every other form of communication is inviolable. Limitations may only be imposed by judicial decision stating the reasons and in accordance with the guarantees provided by the law."

====United Kingdom====
{{main |Privacy in English law}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another [[tort]] (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4482073.stm Does Beckham judgment change rules?], from [[BBC News]] (retrieved 27 April 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
There is, however, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: [[Data Protection Act 1998]]; [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]]; [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]; [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003|Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003]]. The ICO has also provided a "Personal Information Toolkit" online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf "Personal Information Toolkit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103165639/http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf |date=2009-01-03 }} prepared by the Information Commissioner’s Office, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{main |Privacy laws of the United States}}

Although the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] does not explicitly include the right to privacy, individual as well as locational privacy are implicitly granted by the Constitution under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has found that other guarantees have "penumbras" that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965). In the United States, the right of [[freedom of speech]] granted in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the US by the [[Privacy Act of 1974]], and various state laws. The Privacy Act of 1974 only applies to Federal agencies in the executive branch of the Federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://foia.state.gov/Learn/PrivacyAct.aspx|title = The Privacy Act|date = 2015-05-22|accessdate = 2015-11-19|website = Freedom of Information Act|publisher = US Department of State|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA),&lt;ref&gt;Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLB), and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).
&lt;ref&gt;[[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy Index===
The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]'s Privacy Index puts Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Africa in the higher level of privacy (around 2.2). On the bottom of the list are the United States and United Kingdom (around 1.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/by8|title=International Privacy Index |publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy on the Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}
{{see also|Right to be forgotten}}
There are many means to protect one's privacy on the internet. For example, e-mails can be encrypted (via [[S/MIME]] or [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]) and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates. Covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref name="FederalTrade"&gt;Federal Trade Commission (2010), "Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers," Preliminary FTC Staff Report (December), available at [http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third-party [[HTTP cookies]], Anthony Miyazaki, marketing professor at [[Florida International University]] and privacy scholar, warns that the "elimination of third-party cookie use by Web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the Web site's use of original domain cookies."&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, Anthony D. (2008), "Online Privacy and the Disclosure of Cookie Use: Effects on Consumer Trust and Anticipated Patronage," ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'', 23 (Spring), 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing policy regarding this issue as it relates to [[behavioral advertising]].&lt;ref name="FederalTrade" /&gt;
Another aspect of privacy on the Internet relates to online social networking. Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: "first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short".&lt;ref&gt;Hugl, Ulrike (2011), "Reviewing Person’s Value of Privacy of Online Social Networking," ''Internet Research'', 21(4), in press, http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1066-2243&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=4&amp;articleid=1926600&amp;show=abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by the research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on the wide variety of digital footprint, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805" /&gt;

===Privacy and location-based services===

Increasingly, mobile devices facilitate location tracking.  This creates user privacy problems.  A user's location and preferences constitute personal information.  Their improper use violates that user's privacy.  A recent MIT study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D. Blondel |title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Scientific Reports|date=March 25, 2013|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|accessdate=12 April 2013 |volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Mobile location data 'present anonymity risk'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21923360|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by de Montjoye et al. showed that 4 spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study
further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.

Several methods to protect user privacy in [[location-based service]]s have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Athanasios S. Voulodimos and Charalampos Z. Patrikakis, "Quantifying Privacy in Terms of Entropy for Context Aware Services", special issue of the Identity in the Information Society journal, "Identity Management in Grid and SOA", Springer, vol. 2, no 2, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Users of such services may also choose to display more generic location information (i.e. "In the City" or "Philadelphia" or "Work") to some of their more casual acquaintances while only displaying specific location information, such as their exact address, to closer contacts like spouse, relatives, and good friends.

In recent years, seen with the increasing importance of mobile devices and paired with the ''[[National Do Not Call Registry]]'', telemarketers have turned attention to mobiles.&lt;ref name = "Telemarketers and Mobiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sneaky-tactics-used-by-telemarketers-and-debt-collectors-to-get-your-cell-phone-number-2011-6 |title=Sneaky tactics used by telemarketers and debt collectors to get your cell phone number |publisher=Businessinsider.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of telemarketers to use mobile devices have been met with both ''[[Federal Trade Commission]]'' and companies like PrivacyStar. Each year, thousands of complaints are filed to the FTC database with the help of companies and consumers.

===Privacy by design===

The principle of [[privacy by design]] states that privacy and [[data protection]] are embedded throughout the entire life cycle of [[technologies]], from the early [[design]] stage to their deployment, use and ultimate disposal.

===Privacy engineering===

The practice of constructing, ostensibly, software or information systems that adhere to given privacy policies and relevant compliances is a developing area and is known as [[Privacy engineering]]

===Privacy self-synchronization===

Privacy self-synchronization is the mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program's maximum success. The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors. When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Popa, C., et. all., "Managing Personal Information: Insights on Corporate Risk and Opportunity for Privacy-Savvy Leaders", Carswell (2012), Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privacy paradox ==
The privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not.&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"&gt;Swartz, J., "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox", The Washington Post, 03 Sep 2000, H.1.&lt;/ref&gt; While this term was coined as early as 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Bedrick, B., Lerner, B., Whitehead, B."The privacy paradox: Introduction", "News Media and the Law", Washington, D.C., Volume 22, Issue 2, Spring 1998, pp. P1-P3.&lt;/ref&gt; it wasn't used in its current popular sense until the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Sweat, J. "Privacy paradox: Customers want control—and coupons", InformationWeek, Manhasset Iss, 781, April 10, 2000, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"/&gt; In his article titled "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox," John Schwartz wrote that "It's one of the more puzzling conundrums of online life. While companies that capitalize on the Internet's powerful potential to invade privacy are denounced as villains of the information age, millions of people type out highly personal data and send it off to Web sites they've barely heard of, with no strong legal protection against misuse of the information. …The paradox helps illustrate the complexity of the debate over privacy."

Susan B. Barnes similarly used the term “privacy paradox” to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, S., "A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States", 
First Monday, volume 11, number 9 (September 2006), URL: http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue11_9/barnes/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media. However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy. Susan B. Barnes gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online. However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page.

Privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings. Although several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users, the reason for the paradox still remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taddicken | first1 = M | year = 2014 | title = The 'Privacy Paradox'in the Social Web: The Impact of Privacy Concerns, Individual Characteristics, and the Perceived Social Relevance on Different Forms of Self-Disclosure | url = | journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 248–73 | doi=10.1111/jcc4.12052}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main explanation for the privacy paradox is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection.&lt;ref&gt;Acquisti, A., &amp; Gross, R. (2006, June). Imagined communities: Awareness, information sharing, and privacy on the Facebook. In ''Privacy enhancing technologies'' (pp. 36–58). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;boyd, D., &amp; Hargittai, E. (2010). Facebook

On the other hand, some researchers argue the privacy paradox comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Livingstone | first1 = S | year = 2008 | title = Taking risky opportunities in youthful content creation: teenagers' use of social networking sites for intimacy, privacy and self-expression | url = | journal = New media &amp; society | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 393–411 |
doi=10.1177/1461444808089415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy.  Psychologists particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox occurs because users must trade-off between their privacy concerns and impression management.&lt;ref&gt;Utz, S., &amp; Kramer, N. (2009). The privacy paradox on social network sites revisited: The role of individual characteristics and group norms. ''Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace,'' ''3''(2), article 1.

&lt;/ref&gt; Other individual factors such as gender, age, trust and personality, may also account for the paradox.

== The right to privacy in popular culture ==

The 1993 film ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]'', based on the [[The Pelican Brief|novel of the same name]], touches on privacy.  In one scene, a law professor discusses the Constitutional right to privacy. One of his students, played by [[Julia Roberts]], argues that the majority opinion in [[Bowers v. Hardwick|Bowers v Hardwick]] was wrongly decided.

In the TV series [[West Wing]], in the 1999 episode ''Short List'', the right to privacy arises during the appointment of a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] judge.  [[Sam Seabourne]] ventures the opinion that [[Internet]] privacy will be a major social issue in the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westwingtranscripts.com/search.php?flag=getTranscript&amp;id=9|title=Search or Browse The West Wing Transcripts -- View or Search transcripts and summaries|author=|date=|website=westwingtranscripts.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selfie culture ===
[[Selfies]] are popular today; a search for photos with the hashtag #selfie retrieves over 23 million results on Instagram and "a whopping 51 million with the hashtag #me"  However, due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance, this may pose a risk to privacy.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giroux|first=Henry A.|date=2015-05-04|title=Selfie Culture in the Age of Corporate and State Surveillance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|journal=Third Text|volume=29|issue=3|pages=155–164|doi=10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|issn=0952-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a research which takes a sample size of 3763, researchers found that for selfies, females generally have greater concerns than male social media users. Users who have greater concerns inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhir|first=Amandeep|last2=Torsheim|first2=Torbjørn|last3=Pallesen|first3=Ståle|last4=Andreassen|first4=Cecilie S.|date=2017|title=Do Online Privacy Concerns Predict Selfie Behavior among Adolescents, Young Adults and Adults?|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professional services networks''' are [[Business networking|networks]] of independent firms who come together to cost-effectively provide services to clients through an organized framework.&lt;ref&gt;Networks and Organizations, N. Nohria and R.G. Eccles, Harvard Business School Press (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; They are principally found in law and accounting. They may also be found in investment banking, insurance, real estate and architectural services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mergers.net/ M&amp;A International]&lt;/ref&gt; Any profession that operates locally, but has clients in multiple locations, are potential members of a network. This entry focuses on accounting, legal, multidisciplinary and specialty practice networks. Today members of these networks employ more than one million professionals and staff and have cumulative annual revenues that exceed $200 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/feature/1809718/international-networks-survey-chill|International Accounting Networks – The Big Chill] Accountancy Age, May 27, 2010, 11. Loxton, Liz, Accountancy Magazine, June 2011,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/plp/pages/statistics.php#sotflf/ Harvard Law School Center on the Legal Profession]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[accounting networks and associations]] developed first to meet the requirement of the SEC of public company audits. They include the well-known accounting networks like [[PwC]], [[Deloitte]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]] and [[KPMG]] (also known as the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big 4 Audit Firms]]) as well as more than 30 other accounting networks and associations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/analysis/1776670/top-accounting-networks-associations-2009 Accountancy Age – 35 Accounting Networks and Associations June 11, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; They are highly structured entities.

The [[law firm network]] developed in the late 1980s. They include [[law firm network|legal]] and [[multidisciplinary professional services networks|law firm based multidisciplinary networks]] like [[Lex Mundi]], [[World Services Group]], IR Global (IR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legal 500 |url=http://www.legal500.com/assets/pages/networks/international-referral/about.html |website=Legal 500 |publisher=Legal 500 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TerraLex, [[Meritas (law)|Meritas]], and the State Capital Group.

There are more than 175 known networks in law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chambersandpartners.com/pdfs/LegalNetworks-Global2011.pdf Chambers and Partners]&lt;/ref&gt; 40 in accounting, and 20 specialty networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hg.org/largest-law-and-accounting-networks.html" 60 Largest Legal and Accounting Networks]&lt;/ref&gt; Individual networks have revenues exceeding $20 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/IMG/627/179627/top35-networks-2011-table-1.jpg/ Accounting Age] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002150003/http://www.accountancyage.com/IMG/627/179627/top35-networks-2011-table-1.jpg |date=2013-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognizing a network – the disclaimer ==

Every network from [[accounting networks and associations|accounting networks]] like [[PwC]]&lt;ref&gt;“PricewaterhouseCoopers" and "PwC" refer to the network of member firms of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited (PwCIL). Each member firm is a separate legal entity and does not act as agent of PwCIL or any other member firm. PwCIL does not provide any services to clients. PwCIL is not responsible or liable for the acts or omissions of any of its member firms nor can it control the exercise of their professional judgment or bind them in any way. No member firm is responsible or liable for the acts or omissions of any other member firm nor can it control the exercise of another member firm's professional judgment or bind another member firm or PwCIL in any way."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[KPMG]]&lt;ref&gt;"International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), is a Swiss entity. Member firms of the KPMG network of independent firms are affiliated with KPMG International. KPMG International provides no client services. No member firm has any authority to obligate or bind KPMG International or any other member firm third parties, nor does KPMG International have any such authority to obligate or bind any member firm."&lt;/ref&gt; to [[law firm network]]s like [[Lex Mundi]]&lt;ref&gt;Lex Mundi members are not affiliated in the joint practice of law; each member firm is an independent law firm and renders professional services on an individual and separate basis.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Multilaw]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Multilaw]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}, and [[multidisciplinary professional services networks|multidisciplinary networks]] like [[World Services Group| World Services Group(WSG)]]&lt;ref&gt;WSG's members are independent firms and are not affiliated in the joint practice of professional services. Each member exercises its own individual judgments on all client matters&lt;/ref&gt; uses a “network disclaimer.” A network disclaimer states that the network members are independent firms that do not practice jointly and are not responsible for the negligence of each other. It further states that generally the network does not practice a profession or otherwise provide services to clients of the network’s members. This independence is the foundation of both network operations and governance.

== Why a network rather than a company ==

One of the major factors influencing the need for networks is the [[globalization]] of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Baskerville, Hat [https://eric-dev.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/29637 “Globalization of professional accounting: The Big 8 entering New Zealand”] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121223081205/https://eric-dev.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/29637 |date=2012-12-23 }}, (June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Supply and demand are no longer local but global. The price of commodities is affected by the weather halfway across the world or by demand in developing countries. Production takes place wherever the assets and human resources can most effectively deploy. Professional services providers must be able to reach out globally to represent their clients everywhere in the world. Networks are the practical and cost-effective method to accomplish these objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sheth, Jagdish|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/54939452/Strategic-Importance-of-Information-Technology|title= Strategic Importance of Information Technology|journal= Advances in Telecommunications Management|volume =4|pages= 3–16|year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of networks have access to other members who understand the local economic, legal and political factors.

From a theoretical point of view, networks are an effective model and a powerful system of enhancing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Perera, H.A. Rahman and S. Cahan|year= 2003 |title=Globalization and the Major Accounting Firms|journal= Australian Accounting Review |volume=13|issue=1|pages= 27–37|doi=10.1111/j.1835-2561.2003.tb00217.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members and the networks are different parts of the resource equation for providing members seamless, high quality, reliable, local and global services. There is no real limit of what can be accomplished through a network when the network and its membership work in combination with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Cyrus Freidheim, The Trillion Dollar Corporation How the Alliance Revolution Will Transform Global Business, Perseus Books (1999) {{ISBN|1841120308}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collaboration is at the heart of the network.
			
Networks do not practice a profession or provide the services that their members provide to their clients. Networks do not provide accounting or legal services.  They operate for the benefit of the members by supporting their operations. The network can combine the resources of the individual members without risking the loss of their personal identities or financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ring, P.S. and A.H. Van de Ven|title= Structuring Cooperative Relationships Between Organizations|doi=10.1002/smj.4250130702|journal= Strategic Management Journal|year= 1992|volume= 13|pages= 483–498|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A network is more than a support organization or collaborative framework in which the members can meet clients’ needs. It is an entity that has a common corporate identity or brand. The network name can represent a standard that is required of all its members. The logo and [[brand]] are owned by the network, not the members. Membership can create a global corporate identity. The objective of this identity is network participation that will translate into business for the individual independent members.

For a company to internally develop a global and local presence would take decades and billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, C. [http://works.bepress.com/carole_silver/11 “Globalization and the U.S. Legal Market in Legal Services – Shifting Identities”] 31 L &amp; Poly in Int’l bus. 1127–29 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  For a company/firms to start a network that develops the same market penetration may take a decade and cost only millions of dollars. However, these costs are allocated among the full membership so the cost per member is low. The cost for future members to gain direct and immediate access to these resources is de minimis.

== The formation of a network ==

Professional service networks are [[sui generis]], and each network is formed for a different reason. Current and potential members are attracted to networks in which they can pursue their own individual objectives. While networks clearly do have things in common, each must be viewed in the context of its uniqueness. A successful network is one that meets the expectations of all of its members.

The objective of a network is to create a framework which can allow the members to expand their services. Within the network they can operate to pursue their interests. These interests can include referrals, joint venturing, access to expertise, developing regional expertise, publishing articles for clients, branding, technical information exchange, market positioning, pro bono services, etc. The scope of these interests is defined not by the members but by the network.

Network organizations are defined by their purpose, structure and process. The purpose of a network is different from that of a company or professional firm in that it is limited to specific activities that will benefit its members and enhance its performance.  The network’s structure reflects the activities it seeks to promote and the underlying cultures of the members. [[Accounting networks and associations|Accounting]], [[law firm network|legal]], multidisciplinary and specialty networks will each be different. The process is defined by how they are governed and operated.

Networks are created around common specialized assets, joint control, and a collective purpose. The specialized assets reflect the defined activities of the network. In order to have joint control of the assets, there needs to be collaborations among members. The collaboration necessitates a commonly understood purpose or purposes. A professional services network is neither a mere extension of the members nor only a support organization for independent professional services firms, but is rather an independent organization. It is also a business, and very different from professional associations such as [[Bar association|bar]], accounting and other associations whose membership is generally open to all qualified professionals.

== Reasons for joining networks ==

When asked why they joined, members usually state that they joined for tangible reasons: to receive referrals from other members, to have reliable firms to which they can refer, to maintain independence, to meet clients’ needs, to retain existing clients by being able to provide services in other states or countries, and to obtain new clients in their market who know of the membership.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law firm network]]&lt;/ref&gt; They may also want to exchange knowledge that can reduce risks in their own firm's operations, or gain access to other resources.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, T. ''Liberation Management: Necessary Disorganization for the Nanosecond Nineties'' New York: Alfred A. Knopf (1992) {{ISBN|0394559991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network members also minimize possible losses by spreading risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Van Alstyne, M.|title=  The State of Network Organizations: A Survey of Three Frameworks|url=http://ccs.mit.edu/papers/CCSWP192/CCSWP192.html|journal= Journal of Organizational Computing |year=1997|volume= 7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is a proactive way to profit from change and at the same time to conserve resources. Membership can also enhance the prestige of the member by being associated with prestigious firms that the client is already using. Networks achieve these objectives through different corporate structures in which executives have [[command and control]].

{{Forms of government}}
The '''rule according to a higher law''' means that no law may be enforced by the government unless it conforms with certain universal principles (written or unwritten) of fairness, morality, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;West's Encyclopedia of American Law (in 13 volumes), 2nd Ed., edited by Jeffrey Lehman and Shirelle Phelps. Publisher: Thomson Gale, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7876-6367-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''the rule according to a higher law'' may serve as a practical legal criterion to qualify the instances of political or economical decision-making, when a [[government]], even though acting in conformity with clearly defined and properly enacted legal [[Law|rules]], still produces results which many observers find unfair or unjust.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers|M.N.S. Sellers]], ''Republican Legal Theory: The History, Constitution and Purposes of Law in a Free State'', Basingstoke, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The idea of a law of ultimate justice over and above the momentary law of the state—a higher law—was first introduced into post-Roman Europe by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Wormser, ''The Story of the LAW'', pg. 189&lt;/ref&gt; "Higher law" can be interpreted in this context as the [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]] or basic legal values, established in the [[international law]] – the choice depending on the viewpoint. But this is definitely a Law above the law.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Corwin, ''The “Higher Law” Background of American Constitutional Law'' (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; And it is in this capacity that it possesses the equal legal value for both the [[common law|common]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, as opposed to natural law which is largely associated with common law.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie F. Goldstein, ''Popular Sovereignty, the Origins of Judicial Review, and the Revival of Unwritten Law'', Journal of Politics 48 (1986): 51–71&lt;/ref&gt; "To recognize the necessary connection between the rule of law as an ideal and well-constructed constitutional government does not and should not be taken to imply that all states can or should maintain the same constitutional structures in practice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers]], ''An Introduction. The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, pp. 4–5. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The rule according to higher law'' is a practical approach to the implementation of the higher law theory which creates a bridge of mutual understanding (with regard to universal legal values) between the English language doctrine of the [[rule of law]], traditional for the countries of common law, and the originally German doctrine of ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'', translated into other languages of continental Europe as ''État de droit'' (Fr.), ''Estado de derecho'' (Sp.), ''Stato di diritto'' (It.), and ''Правовое государство'' (Ru.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010]. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter doctrine is the product of continental European legal thought which had adopted it from German legal philosophy. Its name can be translated into English as "state of law" —meaning the state in which the exercise of governmental power is kept in check by the higher law rather than by the changeable law established by this state.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Amartya Sen]] mentioned that the legal theorists in ancient India used term of classical Sanskrit "nyāya" in the sense of not just a matter of judging institutions and rules, but of judging the societies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen, ''Global justice'' in ''Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law'', edited by [[James J. Heckman]], Robert L. Nelson, Lee Cabating and Paul Lepore, Routledge, London and New York, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Before the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], [[African American]]s were legally denied equal rights and freedoms pursuant to formally valid codes prescribing the relations between master and slave. Although these codes were ''de jure'' fully suitable for application in legal practice, their enforcement by the then U.S. government ''de facto'' violated basic human rights of a significant part of the population. [[William H. Seward]] famously proclaimed that slavery is forbidden under "a higher law than the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]."

Generally speaking, the occurrence of such "justly enacted unjust laws" fully depends on the stance taken by the country's political leadership towards [[the rule of law]] principle.

In some countries, the political leaders assert that the rule of law is purely a procedural concept. Therefore, they argue that any government may strip its subjects of their fundamental freedoms or infringe their vital interests so long as this is done by way of a duly implemented legal mechanism. For example, at the [[Nuremberg trials]], in an attempt to justify their crimes against Jewish and Romany population of Europe during [[World War II]], some of the former leaders of [[Nazi Germany]] argued that they had broken none of the laws effective when Hitler had been in power. It was only by invoking the rule according to a higher law that the Allied prosecutors were able to overcome such defenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/ga_95-I/ga_95-I.html Introductory note by Antonio Cassese] for General Assembly resolution 95(I) of 11 December 1946 (Affirmation of the Principles of International Law recognized by the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal) on the website of the [https://www.un.org/law/avl/ UN Audiovisual Library of International Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, conversely, the political leaders assert that all written laws must be kept in line with the universal principles of morality, fairness, and justice. These leaders argue that, as a necessary corollary to the axiom that "no one is above the law," the rule of law requires the government to treat all persons equally under the law. However, the proclaimed right to equal treatment is susceptible to instantly becoming void each time the government denies a sufficient level of respect, dignity, and autonomy to a certain class of individuals or to human rights in general."&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Zimmermann, ''Constitutions Without Constitutionalism: The Failure of Constitutionalism in Brazil, The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, p.101. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the unwritten and universally self-explanatory principles of equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect are said to overrule conventional written laws enacted by the government. It is these principles that are often referred to as "natural law." They also constitute the basis of the "higher law theory".

==''Rechtsstaat''==
The ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' doctrine (legal state, state of right, constitutional state, constitutional government) was first introduced by the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in his latest works completed after the U.S. and French constitutions had been adopted in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=[[The Constitution of Liberty]]|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|date=1960|pages=196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of country’s written [[constitution]] created using principles of the Higher Law. This supremacy meant creating guarantees for the implementation of his central idea: a permanently peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness and prosperity of the citizens. Kant was basing his doctrine exclusively on the idea of constitutionalism and constitutional government.

The Russian legal system, born in the 19th century as a result of the transformations initiated by the reforms of the [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]], was (and still is) based primarily upon the German legal tradition. It was from the latter that Russia had adopted the doctrine of ''Rechtsstaat'', which literally translates as "Legal State." Its closest English analogue is "the rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, ''Defining the rules'', ''The European Lawyer'', Issue 90, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Legal state concept adopts the written constitution as the country's supreme law (the rule of constitution). It is a fundamental but undefined principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s post-Communist constitution: "The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance." Similarly, the very first dispositive provision of Ukraine’s Constitution declares that "Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state." Hence, the effort to invest meaning to the "Legal State" definition is anything but theoretical.

[[Valery Zorkin]], President of the Constitutional Court of Russia, wrote in 2003, "Becoming a legal state has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination. Such a legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and just society. Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by the society."&lt;ref&gt;''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform'', edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of Legal state has adopted many segments of [[constitutional economics]] which serves as a practical implementation of the higher law theory in economics.

Economist [[James M. Buchanan]] argues that, in the framework of constitutional government, any governmental intervention or regulation must be conditioned by the three following assumptions. First, every failure of the market economy to function smoothly and perfectly can be corrected by governmental intervention. Second, those holding political office and manning the bureaucracies are altruistic upholders of the public interest, unconcerned with their own personal economic well-being. And third, changing the government responsibilities towards more intervention and control will not profoundly and perversely affect the social and economic life.

Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the [[state (polity)|state]] as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members." This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid a one-dimensional understanding. Buchanan, together with Kant, believes that a [[constitution]] in its capacity as the Higher Law, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions, while balancing interests of the state and society against those of individuals, with their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.

Buchanan also outlines importance of protection of the moral principles underlying constitutional norms. He writes that "the ethics of constitutional citizenship is not directly comparable to ethical behavior in interaction with other persons within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime. An individual may be fully responsible, in the standard ethical sense, and yet fail to meet the ethical requirement of constitutional citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J., ''Logical Formulations of Constitutional Liberty'', Vol. 1., Indianapolis, 1999. P. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19116">The conception of the [[separation of powers]] has been applied to the United Kingdom and the nature of its [[executive (government)|executive]] ([[UK government]], [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]]), [[Judiciary|judicial]] ([[Judiciary of England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Judiciary of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]) and [[Legislature|legislative]] ([[UK Parliament]], [[Scottish Parliament]], [[National Assembly for Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]) functions. Historically, the apparent merger of the executive and the legislature, with a powerful [[Prime Minister (UK)|Prime Minister]] drawn from the largest party in parliament and usually with a safe majority, led theorists to contend that the separation of powers is not applicable to the United Kingdom. However, in recent years it does seem to have been adopted as a necessary part of the [[UK constitution]].

The [[independence of the judiciary]] has never been questioned as a principle, although application is problematic. Personnel have been increasingly isolated from the other organs of government, no longer sitting in the [[House of Lords]] or in the [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]]. The court's ability to legislate through [[precedent]], its inability to question validly enacted law through [[legislative supremacy]] and [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], and the role of the [[European integration|Europe-wide institutions]] to legislate, execute and judge on matters also define the boundaries of the UK system.

==Approach==
Although the United Kingdom recognises [[parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], writers have stressed the importance of the [[independence of the judiciary]] in establishing the [[rule of law]], among them [[Trevor Allan (legal philosopher)|Trevor Allan]].&lt;ref name="ewing81"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the [[separation of powers]] has changed with the rise of judicial involvement in the affairs of government.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; [[Albert Venn Dicey]], writing in 1915 in ''[[Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution]]'', described the separation of powers as "the offspring of a double misconception".&lt;ref&gt;Dicey (1915). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Ivor Jennings|Sir Ivor Jennings]] has argued that it is of little relevance,&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;  and, faced with the role of the executive within the legislature, some authors describe only the independence of the judiciary as evidence that the model applies to the modern United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few critics of the applicability of the separation of powers to the United Kingdom question the basic division.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;
The separation of powers has come under the stress of increasing government intervention into social issues outside its former remit dominated by administration and foreign and military policy &amp;ndash; the creation of [[big government]].&lt;ref name="drewry191"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been seen by some as having led to a weakening of the concept of [[government]], replaced with the concept of governance.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} This lends itself to a more flexible approach considering the wide variation in the sorts of things that the "executive" does.&lt;ref name="drewry192"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach is to take an approach of [[public choice theory]]. The self-interest of political actors, under this theory, bridges the separate sections of government, drawing upon the approach of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] which applies the same rules to different organs, although heir approach to judges is separate.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 11&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt; Either theory would accept that there are wider decision making processes which are not restricted to a single branch of government.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). pp. 192&amp;ndash;193.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important idea is that variations within each separate part of government are as significant as differences in approach between branches, and require similar consideration.&lt;ref name="daintith12"&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Lord Mustill]] summarised the prevailing modern viewpoint in the 1995 judgment, ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union|R. v Home Secretary ex parte Fire Brigades Union]]'':&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union'' [1995] 2 AC 513 at 567.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a feature of the peculiarly UK conception of the separation of powers that Parliament, the executive and the courts each have their distinct and largely exclusive domain. Parliament has a legally unchallengeable right to make whatever laws it thinks right. The executive carries on the administration of the country in accordance with the powers conferred on it by law. The courts interpret the laws and see that they are obeyed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Division between organs of parliament==
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] creates law through the authority of the [[Queen-in-Parliament]], securing the support of at least the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and usually the [[House of Lords]] as well &amp;ndash; although since the passing act of the [[Parliament Act 1911]] this has not been necessary.&lt;ref name="ewing82"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]], the organs of the [[European Communities]] to legislate for the United Kingdom was recognised, by virtue of that Act. The power to create [[primary legislation]] has also been devolved to [[Scottish parliament|Scottish]] and [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh parliament]]s and to government ministers and local authorities to create [[secondary legislation]].&lt;ref name="ewing82"/&gt;

The executive comprises all official and public authorities (including [[local authorities]]) that govern the UK, from initiating and implementing legislation to the running of local and national services, such as [[waste collection|rubbish collection]]s and the [[police in the United Kingdom|police]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The civil service remains non-partisan (having little in common with the Cabinet and Prime Minister in that respect).&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive also exercises a number of powers under the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]], including [[foreign relations]]; many other actions are taken in the sovereign's name, from whom executive power is derived. The [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the  [[EU Commission|Commission]] of the [[European Union]] also exercise executive power, as do [[devolved government]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; Within the executive, there is no longer a clear elected&amp;ndash;non-elected divide: decision-makers are of both sorts since the widening of the government's remit.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the Civil Service serves the government, rather than usurping it, is one character of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judicial function determines the outcome of disputes and performs minor legislative and administrative functions. It oversees both public and private law through [[Civil court|civil]] and [[criminal court]]s and a variety of [[tribunal]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] has placed a requirement that courts take into account the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt;

The introduction of a tax is a [[legislature|legislative]] function; collecting tax is an [[executive (government)|executive]] and administrative function; settling tax disputes is a judicial function, as is [[judicial review]] of executive decisions.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; However, such an approach does not in itself enlighten what each role entails: the audit of public expenditure was a judicial function in the fourteenth century; an executive one in the eighteenth; and is now a legislative function. This is not in itself a measure of efficiency or good process, or what the function actually entails.&lt;ref name="daintith12"/&gt;

The separation of powers may require, depending on interpretation, that the membership of the three powers must be separate; that one of the three powers does not control the work of another; or that one organ of government should not exercise the powers of another. Keeping all three roles separate is seen as both theoretically and practically impossible.&lt;ref name="ewing87"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislature and executive==

The legislature and executive have a close relationship in the UK constitution. This led  [[Walter Bagehot]] to declare the "nearly complete fusion" of the roles in the nineteenth century. Other writers have stressed that the harmonisation of the legislature and executive does not preclude their distinctiveness.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; By convention, [[Minister (government)|government minister]]s are drawn from one of the two houses; the weight of democratic responsibility entails that most come from the House of Commons.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt; There is, however, a limit on their number.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; Most other members of the executive are excluded from holding legislative office, including the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]], the [[British Armed Forces|armed forces]], and the police, some of whom are prevented from becoming involved in any political affairs. The crossover in personnel is effectively limited to ministers.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; The Prime Minister wields considerable power on behalf of the executive, as party leader and chief spokesperson for government policy.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

When the government has a clear majority it wields a lot of power to push through legislation. A 1978 [[Select committee (Westminster system)|Select Committee]] report suggested:&lt;ref name="bradley88"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The balance of advantage between Parliament and Government is so weighted in favour of Government that it is inimical to the proper working of our parliamentary democracy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Between 1979 and 2010, the government had a safe majority which made the scrutiny of the government more difficult, although not impossible. The government could rely on its legislation being passed, although in some cases this did not happen.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt; The [[Conservative&amp;ndash;Liberal Democrat coalition]] complicated the party structure, since the [[leader of the Liberal Democrats]], [[Nick Clegg]], served as  [[Deputy Prime Minister]] under a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="drewry192"/&gt; However, the legislature can oust a government through a [[vote of no confidence]], as happened in [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|1979]].&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; This was driven by a growth in the political party structure, enforced through party discipline, as increased suffrage meant a far wider remit of government policy platforms.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

[[Secondary legislation]] &amp;ndash; where Parliament passes limited legislative rights to the executive through an [[Act of Parliament]] &amp;ndash; is also problematic, although necessary for the efficient working of government. Legal rules should be relatable to the Acts of Parliament on which they are based, but this is not always possible. Proper scrutiny of government actions under secondary legislation is needed to prevent abuse.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt;

==Executive and judiciary==
The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] remains an independent court, despite being organisationally part of the executive. The [[Lord Chancellor]], a member of the [[UK Cabinet|Cabinet]] is no longer a judge since the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].  The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] ([[England and Wales]]) and the [[Lord Advocate]] ([[Scottish law|Scotland]]) have "quasi-judicial roles" but are part of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 88&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of control, the [[independence of the judiciary]] is confirmed through statute, constitutional convention, and weight of opinion. In England and Wales, judges in [[superior courts]] cannot be arbitrarily dismissed by the executive, instead serving whilst in "good behaviour".&lt;ref name="ewing89"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in lower courts have similar protection from dismissal without due cause. Most members of tribunals cannot be dismissed by members of the government department of which they form part. This is important in cases of [[judicial review]] and other judicial methods of preventing government abuse of power.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt;

The judiciary undertake minor legislative functions in the form of court procedure, which, whilst the performance of a conflicting power, strengthens their independence. Tribunals are tied, but remain independent from, the executive. Government departments adjudicate on many decisions, and are required to take principles such as fairness and transparency into account in return.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; The courts provide only one method of dispute resolution, albeit one that is important where the government is one party and independence is necessary. The picture of which decision-making processes should be assigned to which body is complicated.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; There remain problems with the scope of role of the [[UK Home Secretary|Home Secretary]] in the [[penal system]] and judicial decisions with regard to sentencing.&lt;ref name="ewing90"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan LJ, in ''[[M v Home Office]]'', noted that:&lt;ref&gt;M v Home Office [1992] QB 270 at 314.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The proper constitutional relationship of the executive with the courts is that the courts will respect all acts of the executive within its lawful province, and that the executive will respect all decisions of the courts as to what its lawful province is.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In matters such as Extradition of British nationals, courts must first consent and the [[Home Secretary]] must agree and sign an Extradition Order or the individual cannot be extradited. A recent example of this is autistic computer-hacker [[Gary McKinnon]] being extradited to the United States. The courts decreed that he could be extradited and that it would not harm him. However the [[Home Secretary]] announced that she refused to sign the order as she believed it would harm his life rights and could lead to him committing suicide.

==Judiciary and legislature==
The judges of the [[UK Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] do not sit in the House of Lords. Until 2009, the judges appointed as [[Law Lords]] formed part of the House of Lords in Parliament. The creation of the Supreme Court ended confusion in name of both capacities. No [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] may hold a full-time position in the judiciary.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt;

The departure of the judiciary from the [[House of Lords]] has led to greater tension between the government, Parliament and the courts, as the senior judges are no longer able to amend and speak on Bills and Peers are no longer able to question the judges and thereby hold them to account.

The legislature retains the right to impeach members of the judiciary by agreement of both houses, but this has only happened once in three hundred years. There are restrictions on the criticism of judges in parliament.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; Courts are bound to interpret Acts of Parliament, even retrospectively, and [[legislative supremacy]] dictates that they cannot declare properly enacted law invalid. They are not bound by other resolutions of either house.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; The European Communities Act 1972 places a legislature-imposed requirement on the judiciary to follow European case law in relevant matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 90&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] allows the courts to make a [[declaration of incompatibility]], they cannot disapply legislation.&lt;ref name="ewing91"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each House of Parliament retains the right to punish offenders within its walls (including [[exclusive cognisance]]), with the potential to cause conflict.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt; However, ''[[R v Chaytor]]'' confirmed that right was limited in scope, and that it was the court that decided what that scope was.&lt;ref name="chaytor"&gt;''R v Chaytor''. [2010] [[UK Supreme Court|UKSC]] 52.&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered very unlikely that parliament would seek to protect those guilty of a crime unrelated to parliamentary business in this way.&lt;ref name="chaytor"/&gt; The courts have also exercised a quasi-legislative power through [[precedent]] &amp;ndash; for example, ending the [[marital rape]] exemption in ''[[R v R (Rape: marital exemption)]]''.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v R (Rape: marital exemption)'' [1992] 1 AC 599.&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular scope for the identification and application of personal liberties, and some cases have shaped the judiciary&amp;ndash;legislature relationship.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;

'''Sexualization''' (or '''sexualisation''') is to make something [[Human sexuality|sexual]] in character or quality, or to become aware of sexuality,&lt;ref name="Sexualization"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualization (definition) | publisher= ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''| accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sexualization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexualize"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualize | publisher = ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' | accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/sexualize}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in relation to men and women. Sexualization is linked to [[sexual objectification]]. According to the [[American Psychological Association]], sexualization occurs when "individuals are regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sexiness."&lt;ref name=Dewar&gt;{{cite web | last = Dewar | first = Gwen | title = The sexualization of girls: Is the popular culture harming our kids? | url = http://www.parentingscience.com/sexualization-of-girls.html | website = parentingscience.com | publisher = Parenting Science | date = October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "In study after study, findings have indicated that women more often than men are portrayed in a sexual manner (e.g., dressed in revealing clothing, with bodily postures or facial expressions that imply sexual readiness) and are objectified (e.g., used as a decorative object, or as body parts rather than a whole person). In addition, a narrow (and unrealistic) standard of physical beauty is heavily emphasized. These are the models of femininity presented for young girls to study and emulate."&lt;ref name=Exec&gt;{{citation | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | contribution = Executive Summary | editor-last = APA Task Force | editor-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who embrace their sexual desires are considered to be sexy and attractive to men who want nothing more than to have a woman as a sex toy. In the eyes of men, women that practice this behavior serve the pure purpose of providing satisfaction and showcasing their human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peter | first1 = Jochen | last2 = Valkenburg | first2 = Patti M. | title = Adolescents' exposure to a sexualized media environment and their notions of women as sex objects | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 383–384 | date = March 2007 | doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9176-y | ref = harv }} [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11199-006-9176-y.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Media Education Foundation's, ''[[Killing Us Softly|Killing Us Softly 4: Advertising's Image of Women]]'', the sexualization of girls in media and the ways women are portrayed in the dominant culture are detrimental to the development of young girls as they are developing their identities and understanding themselves as sexual beings.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne &gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Jean Kilbourne]] (writer/presenter), [[Sut Jhally]] (director) and David Rabinovitz | date= 2010 | accessdate= 30 December 2015 | title= Killing Us Softly 4: Advertising's Image of Women | medium= Video | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2507550/ | publisher= [[Media Education Foundation]] | location = Northampton, Massachusetts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports have found that sexualization of younger children is becoming increasingly more common in advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Donohue | first1 = William | last2 = Gold | first2 = Steven R. | last3 = McKay | first3 = J.

Medical and social science researchers generally deployed "sexualization" to refer to a liminal zone between sexual abuse and normal family life, in which the child's relationship with their parents was characterized by an "excessive", improper sexuality, though without recognizable forms of abuse having occurred.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite book | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 | oclc = 123130352 }} [http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; American Psychological Association also argues that the sexualization of young girls contributes to sexist attitudes within society, and a societal tolerance of sexual violence.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

From 2003 to 2005, "sexualization" began to ascend to the status of an issue in the public eye. The cause of this rise was that it became positioned by a number of discursive actors as a feminist issue. This is not to say that a single "feminist perspective on sexualization" emerged in this period; among discursive actors mobilizing feminist discourses, or identifying themselves explicitly with feminism, there were a host of different views. Yet a particular, relatively cohesive position emerged after 2003 among a number of media discourses: these discourses tended to emphasize that, in the context of a commercialized and sexist culture, young women are unable to exercise meaningful choice even when they experience themselves as doing so. These media actors, in their problematization of sexualization, positioned themselves as the true heirs to the feminist tradition and its critical insights, in contrast to contemporary youth.

[[Consumerism]] and [[globalization]] has led to sexualization of girls occurring across all [[advanced economies]], in media and advertisements, to clothing and toys marketed for young girls.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "sexualization" itself only emerged in Anglophone discourse in recent decades. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, the term was infrequently drawn upon by English writers to refer the assignation of a gendered frame to a particular object, such as the gendering of nouns (e.g., de Quincey [1839]1909, 195).&lt;ref name="de Quincey"&gt;{{citation | author-last = de Quincey | author-first = Thomas | author-link = Thomas De Quincey | contribution = Style and language | editor-last1 = de Quincey | editor-first1 = Thomas | editor-last2 = Darbishire | editor-first2 = Helen | editor-link1 = Thomas De Quincey | editor-link2 = Helen Darbishire | title = De Quincey's literary criticism | pages = 181&amp;ndash;196 | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Digital Library | location = New York, NY | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781411457836 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term "asexualization" saw greater use, as a synonym for sterilization in eugenics discourse from around the turn of the twentieth century (e.g., Lydston 1904).&lt;ref name="Lydston"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lydston | first = G.

== Effects on children ==

In 2006, an Australian report called ''Corporate paedophilia: sexualisation of children in Australia''&lt;ref name=Australia /&gt; was published. The Australian report summarises its conclusion as follows:

:Images of sexualised children are becoming increasingly common in advertising and marketing material. Children who appear aged 12 years and under are dressed, posed and made up in the same way as sexy adult models. Children that appear on magazines are seen older than they really are because of the sexualised clothes they are given to pose in.  "Corporate paedophilia" is a metaphor used to describe advertising and marketing that sexualises children in these ways.

In 2007, the [[American Psychological Association]] published a report titled ''Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls'', discussed below.

In 2010, the [[American Psychological Association]] published an additional report titled " Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls", which performed a study where college students were asked to try on and evaluate either a swimsuit or a sweater. While they waited for 10 minutes wearing the garment, they completed a math test. The results revealed that young women in swimsuits performed significantly worse on the math problems than did those wearing sweaters.The hypothesis is that individuals about to try on the sweaters had less pressure to look beautiful because they were not wearing revealing clothing therefore they performed better.

In 2012, an American study found that self-sexualization was common among 6–9-year old girls. Girls overwhelmingly chose the sexualized doll over the non-sexualized doll for their ideal self and as popular. However other factors, such as how often mothers talked to their children about what is going on in TV shows and maternal religiosity, reduced those odds. Surprisingly, the mere quantity of girls' [[media consumption]] (TV and movies) was unrelated to their self-sexualization for the most part; rather, maternal self-objectification and maternal religiosity moderated its effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = Christine | last2 = Ferguson | first2 = Gail | title = Sexy dolls, sexy grade-schoolers? Media &amp; maternal influences on young girls' self-sexualization | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 67 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 463–476 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-012-0183-x | date = October 2012 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232686658 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2010 the [[Scottish Executive]] released a report titled ''External research on sexualised goods aimed at children''.&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; The report considers the drawbacks of the United States and Australian reviews, concluding:

{{Quote|[T]here is no indication [in the APA report] that the media might contain any positive images about human relationships, or that children might critically evaluate what they see.}}

The Scottish review also notes that:

{{Quote|[s]uch accounts often present the sexualisation of children as a relatively recent development, but it is by no means a new issue …  While the public visibility of the issue, and the terms in which it is defined, may have changed, sexualised representations of children cannot be seen merely as a consequence of contemporary consumerism.}}

It also notes that previous coverage "rests on moral assumptions … that are not adequately explained or justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mayo | first1 = Ed | last2 = Nairn | first2 = Agnes | author-link1 = Ed Mayo | title = Consumer kids: how big business is grooming our children for profit | publisher = Constable | location = London | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781845298807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letting Children be Children: Report of an Independent Review of the Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood (UK)'''
The report 'Letting Children Be Children',&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; also known as the Bailey Report, is a report commissioned by the UK government on the subject of the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood. The report was published in June 2011 and was commissioned as a result of concerns raised as to whether children's lives are negatively affected by the effects of commercialisation and sexualisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=NSPCC | author-link1 =NSPCC |title= Premature sexualisation: understanding the risks: outcomes of the NSPCC's expert seminar series |date= 2011 | publisher= NSPCC | location= London }} [https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/information-service/seminars-premature-sexualisation-understanding-risks.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailey Report is so-called as it was researched and compiled by Reg Bailey, the Chief Executive of the Mothers' Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.mothersunion.org/ | website = mothersunion.org | publisher = Mothers' Union | accessdate = 6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "charity supporting parents and children in 83 countries in the world".&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; The report asked for contributions from parents; children; organisations; businesses and the general public in order to consider their views and inform their recommendations and identified four themes that were of particular concern to parents and the wider public. These themes were:
*1) the "wallpaper" of children's lives
*2) clothing, products and services for children
*3) children as consumers
*4) making parents' voices heard

The report returned recommendations based on the research from interested parties, on each of the key themes, in the form of "what we would like to see". On the theme of "the wallpaper of children's lives" it said that it would like to see that sexualised images used in public places should be more in line with what parents find acceptable, to ensure that images in public spaces becomes more child friendly. On theme two "clothing, products and services for children" the Bailey report said that it would like to see retailers no longer selling or marketing inappropriate clothing, products or services for children. What they would like to see on theme three "children as consumers" is comprehensive regulation protecting children from excessive commercial pressures across all media in-line with parental expectations; that marketers are ethical and do not attempt to exploit gaps in the market to influence children into becoming consumers and to ensure that parents and children have an awareness of marketing techniques and regulations. Finally in terms of "making parents voices heard" it would like to see parents finding it easier to voice their concerns to, and be listened to by, businesses and regulators.&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt;

There is a motion for a [[European Parliament]] resolution going through which gives the following definition of sexualization: {{Quotation|[S]exualization consists of an instrumental approach to a person by perceiving that person as an object for sexual use disregarding the person's dignity and personality traits, with the person's worth being measured in terms of the level of sexual attractiveness; sexualization also involves the imposition of the sexuality of adult persons on girls, who are emotionally, psychologically and physically unprepared for this at their particular stage of development; sexualization&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As opposed to its meaning in relation to [[human sexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt;  not being the normal, healthy, biological development of the sexuality of a person, conditioned by the individual process of development and taking place at the appropriate time for each particular individual.&lt;ref name=draft&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skrzydlewska|first=Joanna|authorlink=Joanna Skrzydlewska|title=Draft report on the sexualization of girls (2012/2047 (INI)) | journal = European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.

== Effects on women of color ==
The sexualization of women of color is different than the sexualization of white women.  The media plays a significant role in this sexualization.

=== Black women ===
In an NPR interview with Professor Herbert Samuels at LaGuardia Community College in New York and Mireille Miller-Young a professor at UC Santa Barbara they talk about sexual stereotypes of black bodies in America and how even in sex work, already a dangerous job, black women are treated much worse than their counterparts due to the effects of their oversexualization and objectification in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= [[Farai Chideya]] (host/producer), Herbert Samuels (guest) and Mireille Miller-Young (guest) |date= 7 May 2007 |title= Sex stereotypes of African Americans have long history |medium= Radio program |series= [[NPR|NPR news]] |language= English |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 |access-date= 9 December 2015 |publisher= [[NPR]] }} [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 Transcript.]&lt;/ref&gt; Black women's bodies are either invisible or hypervisible. In the 1800s, a South African woman named [[Sarah Baartman]] was known as "Hottentot Venus" and her body was paraded around in London and Paris where they looked at her exotic features such as large breasts and behind. Her features were deemed lesser and oversexual. There is also the ''Jezebel'' stereotype that portrays black women as "hypersexual, manipulative, animalistic and promiscuous females who cannot be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mowatt | first1 = Rasul A. | title = Black/female/body hypervisibility and invisibility: a Black feminist augmentation of feminist leisure research | journal = Journal of Leisure Research, Special Issue: Feminist Leisure Research in the Contemporary Era | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 644–660 | doi = 10.18666/JLR-2013-V45-I5-4367 | date = 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominican Women ===
In the Dominican Republic, women are frequently stereotyped as sultry and sexual as the reputation of Dominican sex workers grows.&lt;ref name="Race_class"&gt;Brennan, Denise (2004), "[https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/brennan_selling-sex-for-visas.pdf Selling sex for visas: sex tourism as a stepping-stone to international migration]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Pauline | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 243&amp;ndash;248 | publisher = Wadsworth/Thomson Learning | location = Belmont, California | edition = 9th | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780534609030 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many poor women have resorted to sex work because the demand is high and the hours and pay are often dictated by the workers themselves.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; White European and American men "exoticize dark-skinned 'native' bodies" because "they can buy sex for cut-rate prices".&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; This overgeneralizing of the sexuality of Dominican women can also carries back to the women's homes.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; Even "women who...worked in Europe have become suspect..." even if they had a legal job.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; They have become "exports" instead of people because of their sexualization.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt;

=== Asian women ===
The image of Asian women in Hollywood cinema is directly linked to sexuality as essential to any imagining about the roles they play as well as her actual appearance in popular culture. Asian female fatale's hypersexualized subjection is derived from her sexual behaviour that is considered as natural to her particular race and culture. Two types of Asian stereotypes that are commonly found in media are the Lotus Flower and the Dragon Lady. The Lotus Flower archetype is the "self-sacrificing, servile, and suicidal Asian women." The dragon lady archetype is the opposite of the lotus flower, a "self-abnegating Asian woman…[who] uses her 'Oriental' femininity, associated with seduction and danger to trap white men on behalf of conniving Asian males." According to film-maker and film scholar, Celine Shimizu, "The figure of the Asian American femme fatale signifies a particular deathly seduction. She attracts with her soft, unthreatening, and servile femininity while concealing her hard, dangerous, and domineering nature."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Native American women ===
Starting from the time of white colonization of Native American land, some Native American women have been referred to as "squaw," an Algonquin word for vagina. "The 'squaw' [stereotype] is the dirty, subservient, and abused tribal female who is also haggard, violent, and eager to torture tribal captives."  Another stereotype is the beautiful Indian princess who leaves her tribe and culture behind to marry a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mihesuah | first = Devon Abbott | contribution = Finding a modern American indigenous female identity | editor-last = Mihesuah | editor-first = Devon Abbott | title = Indigenous American women: decolonization, empowerment, activism | page = 102 | publisher = [[University of Nebraska Press]] | location = Lincoln, Nebraska and London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780803282865 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the hot Latina stereotype lies three categories of representation: the Cantina Girl, the Faithful, self-sacrificing señorita, and the vamp. The Cantina Girl markers are "'great sexual allure,' teasing, dancing, and 'behaving in an alluring fashion.'" The faithful, self-sacrificing Señorita starts out as a good girl and turns bad by the end. The Señorita, in an attempt to save her Anglo love interest, utilizes her body to protect him from violence. The Vamp representation "uses her intellectual and devious sexual wiles to get what she wants." The media represents Latinas "as either [a] hot-blooded spitfire" or "[a] dutiful mother".&lt;ref name="Vargas 1993"&gt;{{citation | last = Vargas | first = Deborah R. | contribution = Representations of Latina/o sexuality in popular culture | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Patricia | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 188&amp;ndash;192 | publisher = Cengage Learning | location = Boston, Massachusetts | edition = 9th | year = 2016 | origyear = 1993 | isbn = 9781305093614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual implications of the "hot-blooded" Latina has become an overgeneralized representation of Latin people.

Some believe it to be wrong simply because the interpretation of this culture seems to go against white, Western culture.&lt;ref name="Vargas 1993" /&gt; Culturally, the Latina is expected to dress "as a proper señorita" in order to be respected as a woman which conflicts with the Western ideals that a girl is sexual if she dresses "too 'mature' for [her] age".&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993"&gt;{{citation | last = Cofer | first = Judith O. | contribution = The myth of the Latin woman: ''I Just Met a Girl Named Maria'' | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Patricia | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 188&amp;ndash;192 | publisher = Cengage Learning | location = Boston, Massachusetts | edition = 9th | year = 2016 | origyear = 1993 | isbn = 9781305093614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the business world this stereotype continues; "tight skirts and jingling bracelets [are misinterpreted] as a come-on". This sexualization can also be linked to certain stereotypical jobs. The image of the Latina woman often is not in the business world but in the domestic.&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993" /&gt; The sexualization of Latina women sexualizes the positions that they are expected to occupy. Domestic servants, maids, and waitresses are the typical "media-engendered" roles that make it difficult for Latinas to gain "upward mobility" despite the fact that many hold PhDs.&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993" /&gt;

== American Psychological Association view ==

=== Definition ===
The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in its 2007 Report looked at the cognitive and emotional consequences of sexualization and the consequences for mental and physical health, and impact on development of a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt; The report considers that a person is sexualized in the following situations:
*a person's value comes only from his or her [[Sexual attraction|sexual appeal]] or [[Human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], to the exclusion of other characteristics;
*a person is held to a standard that equates [[physical attractiveness]] (narrowly defined) with being sexy;
*a person is [[sexual objectification|sexually objectified]]—that is, made into a thing for others' sexual use, rather than seen as a person with the capacity for independent action and decision making; and/or
*sexuality is inappropriately imposed upon a person.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

=== Children ===
Some [[cultural critic]]s have postulated that over recent decades children have evidenced a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behaviour inappropriate for their age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaeser | first = Fred | title = Towards a better understanding of children's sexual behavior | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/74965/towardsabetterunderstandingofchildrenssexualbehavior.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = NYU Child Study Center | date = 30 October 2001 | quote = We know that exposure to sexualized messages, particularly those that are incomprehensible, can have several effects on children. }} ''Fred Kaeser Ed.D. is the Director of Health Services for Community School District Two, NYC.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of this premature sexualization that have been cited include portrayals in the media of sex and related issues, especially in media aimed at children; the marketing of products with sexual connotations to children, including clothing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chambers | first = Suzanna | title = Outrage as Argos sells G-strings for children | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=109621&amp;in_page_id=1770) | work = [[The Mail on Sunday|Mail on Sunday]] | publisher = [[DMG Media]] | date = 14 April 2002 | accessdate = 22 February 2007 | quote = High Street chain Argos has been branded irresponsible for promoting a range of sexually provocative lingerie designed for primary schoolgirls. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of parental oversight and [[discipline]]; access to adult culture via the internet; and the lack of comprehensive school [[sex education]] programs.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb_Therapy&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Sharon | author-link1 = Sharon Lamb | title = Sex, therapy, and kids: addressing their concerns through talk and play | publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Co | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780393704792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For girls and young women in particular, the APA reports that studies have found that sexualization has a negative impact on their "[[self-image]] and healthy development".&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

The APA cites the following as advertising techniques that contribute to the sexualization of girls:&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;
*Including girls in ads with sexualized women wearing matching clothing or posed seductively.
*Dressing girls up to look like adult women.
*Dressing women down to look like young girls.
*The employment of youthful celebrity adolescents in highly sexual ways to promote or endorse products.
The APA additionally further references the teen magazine market by citing a study by [[Donald F. Roberts|Roberts]] ''et al'' that found that "47% of 8- to 18-year-old [girls] reported having read at least 5 minutes of a magazine the previous day."&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1= Roberts |first1= Donald F. |last2= Foehr |first2= Ulla G. |last3= Rideout |first3= Victoria | author-link1 = Donald F.

==== Cognitive and emotional consequences ====
Studies have found that thinking about the body and comparing it to sexualized cultural ideals may disrupt a girl's mental concentration, and a girl's sexualization or objectification may undermine her confidence in and comfort with her own body, leading to emotional and self-image problems, such as shame and anxiety.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research has linked sexualization with three of the most common mental health problems diagnosed in girls and women: eating disorders, low self-esteem, and depression or depressed mood.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research suggests that the sexualization of girls has negative consequences on girls' ability to develop a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

A result of the sexualization of girls in the media is that young girls are "learning how to view themselves as sex objects".&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; When girls fail to meet the [[thin ideal]] and dominant culture's standard of beauty they can develop anxieties.&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; Sexualization is problematic for young children who are developing their sexual identity as they may think that turning themselves into sex objects is empowering and related to having sexual agency.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

== Products for children ==

Some commercial products seen as promoting the sexualization of children have drawn considerable media attention:
* ''[[Bratz]] Baby'' Dolls marketed at 6-year-old girls that feature sexualized clothing, like fishnet stockings, feather boas, and miniskirts&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt;   
* Highly sexualized and gendered Halloween costumes marketed at young girls, such as the "sexy firefighter", a costume that consists of a tight fitted mini dress and high heeled boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Delisle | first = Riana | title = Halloween costumes are sexualizing our youngest trick-or-treaters | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/raina-delisle/halloween-costumes-sexy-inappropriate_b_6006922.html | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | publisher = [[AOL]] | location = Canada | date = 18 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Clothing such T-shirts being marketed for young children in preschool and elementary school with printed slogans like "So Many Boys So Little Time"&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; 
* Padded bras on bikinis aimed at seven-year-old girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barr | first = Robert (in London) | title = Outrage at girls' padded bikinis | url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/outrage-at-girls-padded-bikinis-20100415-shjf.html | work = [[The Age]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people regard [[training bra]]s similarly. However, there is also evidence that with the mean age of puberty declining in Western cultures, functional brassieres are required by a higher percentage of preteen girls than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aksglaede | first1 = Lise | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = Kaspar | last3 = Petersen | first3 = Jørgen H. | last4 = Skakkebæk | first4 = Niels E. | last5 = Juul | first5 = Anders | title = Recent decline in age at breast development: the Copenhagen Puberty Study | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 123 | issue = 5 | pages = e932–e939 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2008-2491 | pmid = 19403485 | date = May 2009| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Executive]] report&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; surveyed 32 High street UK retailers and found that many of the larger chains, including [[Tesco]], Debenhams, JJ Sports, and [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] did not offer sexualized goods aimed at children. The report noted that overall prevalence was limited but this was based on a very narrow research brief. Whilst this shows that not all High street retailers were aiming products deemed sexualized by the researchers, the research cannot be taken out of context and used to say that there is not an issue of sexualization.{{original research inline|date=September 2015}}

== Culture and media ==
{{For2|more on the mainstreaming of sex in media and culture|[[pornographication]]}}
Sexualization has also been a subject of debate for academics who work in media and [[cultural studies]].

The terms "[[pornographication|pornification]]" and "[[pornographication]]" have also been used to describe the way that aesthetics that were previously associated with pornography have become part of popular culture, and that mainstream media texts and other cultural practices "citing pornographic styles, gestures and aesthetics" have become more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paasonen | first1 = Susanna | last2 = Nikunen | first2 = Kaarina |last3 = Saarenmaa | first3 = Laura | authorlink1 = Susanna Paasonen | title = Pornification: sex and sexuality in media culture | publisher = Berg | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781845207045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which Brian McNair has described as a "pornographication of the mainstream".&lt;ref name=McNair&gt;{{cite book | last = McNair | first = Brian | title = Striptease culture sex, media and the democratization of desire | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415237345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed alongside an expansion of the cultural realm of pornography or "pornosphere" which itself has become more accessible to a much wider variety of audiences. According to McNair, both developments can be set in the context of a wider shift towards a "striptease culture" which has disrupted the boundaries between public and private discourse in late modern Western culture, and which is evident more generally in cultural trends which privilege lifestyle, reality, interactivity, self-revelation and public intimacy.&lt;ref name=McNair /&gt;

Children and adolescents spend more time engaging with media than any other age group. This is a time in their life that they are more susceptible to information that they receive. Children are getting sex education from the media, little kids are exposed to sexualized images and more information than ever before in human history but are not able to process the information, they are not developmentally ready to process it, and this impacts their development and behavior.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

Sexualization of young girls in the media and infantilization of women creates an environment where it becomes more acceptable to view children as "seductive and sexy".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; It makes having healthy sexual relationships more difficult for people and creates sexist attitudes. Sexualization also contributes to sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse "where 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys are sexually abused during childhood".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

The Australian writers, [[Catharine Lumby]] and Kath Albury (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lumby | first1 = Catharine | last2 = Albury | first2 = Kath | title = Introduction: children, young people, sexuality and the media | journal = Media International Australia | volume = 135 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–60 | doi = 10.1177/1329878X1013500108 | date = May 2010 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that sexualization is "a debate that has been simmering for almost a decade" and concerns about sex and the media are far from new. Much of the recent writing on sexualization has been the subject of criticism that because of the way that it draws on "one-sided, selective, overly simplifying, generalizing, and negatively toned" evidence&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Vanwesenbeeck | first = Ine | title = The risks and rights of sexualization: an appreciative commentary on Lerum and Dworkin's "''Bad Girls Rule''" | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 268–270 | doi = 10.1080/00224490903082694 | pmid = 19657946 | date = July 2009 | ref = harv }}

The sexualization of women being influenced by society is a problem that should be avoided due to its impact on how women value and present themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11570">The '''state of defence''' (in German: '''Verteidigungsfall''' or '''V-Fall''') is the constitutional [[state of emergency]] in Germany if the country is "under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115a Article 115a GG]&lt;/ref&gt; Established by a [[German Emergency Acts|constitutional amendment]] in 1968 during the [[Cold War]], this state of emergency gives the [[Politics of Germany|federal government]] extraordinary powers in wartime. It is laid down in the articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G13 115a to 115l] (title Xa) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]]. As of October 2018, Germany has never been in the state of defence.

==Declaration==
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115a 115a] of the German Constitution, the State of Defence shall be declared if "the federal territory [of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]] is under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack".

The normal procedure is that, upon request of the [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Government]], the [[Bundestag]] determines that the conditions of the State of Defence exist. That means that the Bundestag does not actually declare the State of Defence; instead, it just decides whether it exists or not. (If, for example, a foreign army invaded Germany, the Bundestag would determine that the action is an "attack by armed force", as described in article 115a, and so Germany is in the State of Defence.) The determination requires at least two thirds of the votes of the Bundestag present at that time (at least half of the members being the [[quorum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/btgo_1980/__45.html section 45 of the Rules of Procedure of the German Bundestag] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;). It also has to be approved by the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] with more than half of its members, which, according to general Bundesrat protocol, is given in bundled form by each Land.

If the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or not able to reach a quorum, the ''[[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss|Joint Committee]]'' decides on their behalf.

If Germany is under attack by armed force and the Bundestag, the Bundesrat and the Joint Committee are not able to determine the State of Defence immediately, "the determination shall be deemed to have been made and promulgated at the time the attack began". If, for example, an invasion started on January 4 at 4:17&amp;nbsp;a.m., Germany would be in the State of Defence from that time, and the government could react immediately.)

==Consequences==
===Commander-in-chief===
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115b 115b] [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|GG]], the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Federal Chancellor]] becomes [[Commander-in-chief#Germany|Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Bundeswehr|armed forces]]. (Normally, the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]] holds that post.)

===Extension of federal legislative powers===
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115c 115c] GG, the federal government has extended legislative powers:

*The federal government may pass laws with respect to any matter even if it would normally be under exclusive legislative power of the [[Länder]].
*Temporary provisions concerning the compensation for [[expropriations]] may differ from [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P14 those] laid down in the constitution.
*A law may rule that people arrested by police may be held in custody for four days before being brought before a judge (instead of "no later than the day following his arrest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P104 article 104 GG]&lt;/ref&gt;) However, that applies only if no judge has been able to act in the normal time limit.
*Laws concerning financial matters may differ from the requirements laid down in the titles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G9 VIII], ''(The Execution of Federal Laws and the Federal Administration)'' [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G10 VIIIa] ''(Joint Tasks)'' and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G12 X] ''(Finance)'' of the constitution.

==Legislative procedure==
The normal legislative procedure is replaced by a faster one:
*According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115d 115d] GG, bills are discussed "without delay" and adopted by the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, in a single joint session.

===Joint Committee===
The ''[[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss|Joint Committee]]'' (Gemeinsamer Ausschuss) consists of members of the [[Bundestag]] and members of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Two thirds of the committee members are provided by the Bundestag, one third provided by the Bundesrat. The committee members of the Bundestag are designated by the Bundestag "in proportion to the relative strength of the various parliamentary groups". Every Land is represented by a Bundesrat member. The committee members of the Bundestag must not be members of the Cabinet, and the committee members of the Bundesrat are exceptionally "not bound by instructions". There are thus 16 members of the Bundesrat (one for each Land), and 32 members of the Bundestag (twice the number of Bundesrat members), giving it a total number of 48 members. The members of the Joint Committee and their deputies are already designated during peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/plenum/gemeinsamer_ausschuss/mitglieder.html current members of the Joint Committee] (January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee takes over the tasks of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat if, during the State of Defence, it determines, with a two-thirds majority of its vote, that either the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or reach a [[quorum]]. That majority must include at least a majority of all committee members (at least 25 members). For example, if only 30 committee members could be reached, 20 votes would be a two-thirds majority, but at least 25 votes would be required for the determination. If the Joint Committee is not able to reach full strength (48 members), the Bundestag (in case of missing or dead Bundestag committee members) and/or the state governments (in case of missing or dead Bundesrat committee members) designate new committee members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gemausgo/__1.html section 1 of the Rules of Procedure of the Joint Committee] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee takes over any task normally dealt by the Bundestag and/or the Bundesrat. All decisions which would normally be made by the either the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat, or both of them, is made by the entire Joint Committee. However, there are some limitations to the power of the Joint Committee (when compared to Bundestag and Bundesrat):
*It may not amend, abrogate or suspend the constitution, in whole or in part.
*It may not enact laws pursuant to Articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P23 23] ''(European Union - Protection of basic rights - Principle of subsidiarity)'', [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P24 24] ''(Transfer of sovereign powers - System of collective security)'', or [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P29 29] ''(New delimitation of the federal territory)'' of the constitution.
*A [[constructive vote of no confidence]] by the Joint Committee requires a two-thirds majority (instead of just the majority of the votes needed for a vote of no confidence by the Bundestag).
*Laws enacted by the Joint Committee may be repealed at any time by the Bundestag, with the consent of the Bundesrat.

The Joint Committee is based on Articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0249 53a] ''(Composition - Rules of procedure)'' and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0694 115e] ''(Joint Committee)'' of the constitution, as well as on own [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gemausgo/BJNR111020969.html rules of procedure].

===Use of Federal Border Guard===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115f 115f], paragraph (1), clause 1 GG, the Federal Government may employ the [[Bundesgrenzschutz|Federal Border Guard]] throughout the federal territory, everywhere in Germany. By law a [[Compulsory Border Guard Service]] is still in force, but will only be executed in the state of defence or if there are not enough volunteers joining the federal police.

When the Emergency Acts were passed, the Federal Border Guard was a [[paramilitary]] police force responsible only for the protection of [[West Germany]]'s external land and sea borders. Over the decades, however, the role of the Federal Border Guard and even its name have changed to [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]]. The Federal Police is also responsible for the security of the [[rail transport in Germany|railway network]], [[airport security]] and the protection of federal buildings. However, as the entire title [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G13 Xa] has not been changed after it had been passed in 1968, the term ''Federal Border Guard'' is still used in the constitution.

===Extended powers of instruction===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115f 115f], paragraph (1), clause 2 GG, the federal government may issue instructions to state governments and state authorities. (Normally, state governments act on their own, and Land authorities receive their orders only from the Land government.)

===Extended electoral terms===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115h 115h] GG, electoral terms that would expire during the State of Defence are extended:
*The electoral term of the [[Bundestag]] or a [[Landtag#Modern legislatures|state parliament]] ends six months after the end of the State of Defence.
*The term of office of the [[President of Germany|President]] ends nine months after the end of the State of Defence.

===Conscription===
In 2011, the German Conscription Act was changed to abolish peacetime conscription. From July 1, conscripts may not be drafted except during a State of Tension or a State of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wehrpflg/__2.html section 2 of the Conscription Act] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115l 115l] GG, the State of Defence ends when it is ended by the Bundestag "if the conditions for determining it no longer exist", such as after a [[peace treaty]] is signed.

'''''The Abbreviacion of Statutis''''' (1519), of which fifteen editions appeared before 1625, is a book by [[John Rastell]].

'''''The Sri Lanka Gazette''''', officially '''''The Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka''', ''({{lang-si|ශ්‍රී ලංකා ප්‍රජාතාන්ත්‍රික සමාජවාදී ජනරජයේ ගැසට් පත්‍රය|translit=Shrī Laṁkā Prajātāntrika Samājavādī Janarajayē Gæsaṭ Patraya|}}; {{lang-ta|இலங்கை ஜனநாயக சோசலிச குடியரசின் வர்த்தமானி|translit=Ilaṅkai Jaṉanāyaka Cōcalica Kuṭiyaraciṉ Varttamāṉi}}) is a [[public journal]] of the Government of [[Sri Lanka]]. It prints certain statutory notices from the government. Modeled after the ''[[London Gazette|Oxford Gazette]]'', the ''Sri Lanka Gazette'' is the oldest surviving newspaper in Sri Lanka, having been published continuously since 1802.&lt;ref name="priu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca200203/20020315sri_lanka_gazette.htm | title=Sri Lanka Gazette celebrates 200 years today | publisher=[[Presidential Secretariat|Presidential Secretariat of Sri Lanka]] | date=15 March 2002 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.natlib.lk/mow/ | title=Sri Lanka Memory of the World National Committee&amp;nbsp;– Introduction | publisher=Sri Lanka Memory of the World National Committee. | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lake"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lakehouse.lk/main/about-us/History.htm | title=Inception of Lake House | publisher=[[Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited]] | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pressreference.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pressreference.com/Sa-Sw/Sri-Lanka.html | title=Sri Lanka | publisher=pressreference.com | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Ceylon Government Gazette front page.jpg|thumb|upright|Front page of ''The Ceylon Government Gazette'' first issue on 15 March 1802.]]
The British captured some of the coastal areas of Sri Lanka in 1796.&lt;ref name="kmds"&gt;{{Cite book| last = De Silva | first = K.  M. | title = A history of Sri Lanka| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dByI_qil26YC | publisher = [[University of California Press]] | year = 1981 | pages = 234–235 | isbn = 978-0-520-04320-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1802, they launched ''The Ceylon Government Gazette'' to publish British government notices in the areas under their control. This was one of the series of papers launched by the British in their crown colonies, including ''Calcutta Gazette'' (1784), ''St. Lucia Gazette'' (1780), ''Cape Town Gazette'' and ''African Advertiser'' (1800) etc.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{cite book | title=Europe and the World, 1650–1830 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sCUqI_vPX0gC | publisher=[[Routledge]] | author=Black, Jeremy | authorlink=Jeremy Black (historian) | year=2002 | location=[[United Kingdom]] | page=98 | isbn=978-041-5255-69-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first issue of the ''Ceylon Gazette'' appeared on 15 March 1802.&lt;ref name="sundt1"/&gt;
It was printed by Frans de Bruin at the renovated press built in 1737 by the Dutch, who controlled the [[Dutch Ceylon|coastal areas of the island]] until 1796.&lt;ref name="sundat3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sundaytimes.lk/060312/funday/3.html | title=It happened in March: Weekly news in the Government Gazette | publisher=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]] | date=12 March 2006 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sundat2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sundaytimes.lk/020310/plusm.html | title=Rolling out the words | publisher=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]] | date=10 March 2002 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Tamil language|Tamil]] version of the ''Gazette'' was started in 1806, and a [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] version in 1814.&lt;ref name="priu"/&gt;

In 1972  the Sri Lankan government of [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] adopted a new Sri Lankan constitution and repudiated [[Dominion of Ceylon|Dominion status]].
The paper ceased publication that year after issue 15,011. Publication started again after adoption of the 1978 constitution by the [[Junius Richard Jayewardene|J. R. Jayewardene]] government.&lt;ref name="priu"/&gt; In 2011, the Sri Lankan government announced that it would revoke a ''Gazette'' notification by the British government dating back to 1818, which named and shamed the key conspirators of the [[Great Rebellion of 1817–1818]], the first struggle by Ceylonese to gain [[Sri Lankan independence movement|independence from Britain]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2011/03/110312_brownrigg.shtml | title=Colonial gazette notification to be revoked | work=[[BBC]] | date=12 March 2011 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The ''Gazette'' is published in Sinhalese, Tamil, and English which are three official languages of Sri Lanka. It publishes [[promulgation|promulgated]] bills, [[President of Sri Lanka|presidential]] decrees, governmental ordinances, major legal acts as well as vacancies, government exams, [[Request for tender|requests for tender]], changes of names, company registrations and deregistrations, land restitution notices, liquor licence applications, transport permits and auctions announced by various government departments.
