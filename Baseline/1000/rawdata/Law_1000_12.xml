'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]]''' ('''FOI''') refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Access to public information builds on the principle that in a democratic system people should be in the condition of accessing a wide range of information in order to effectively participate in public life as well as on matters affecting them.

The right of access to public information is a component of the fundamental right of [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] set forth by Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) which states that the fundamental right of freedom of expression encompasses the freedom "to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers". Access to public information and freedom of information are recognised as human rights in the three main regional systems of human rights, namely within the Americas, Europe and Africa, as well as in major international instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, The Public's Right to Know. Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access information places two obligations on public bodies. First, the proactive duty  to make public key information on the activities of authorities and governments; second, the reactive obligation to respond to  people's requests for information, either by releasing public original documents or copies of the documents held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), LegalLeaks - Toolkit.

Over the past 10 years, the right to information and access to public information has been recognised in an increasing number of countries and several [[Freedom of information laws by country|FOI laws]] have been adopted all over the world, including in the developing countries. If in 1990 only 13 countries had a national freedom of information law, today there are 100 such laws across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information/ UNESCO.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, Statement by European RTI Community on the world's First Official Access to Information Day, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 The [[UNESCO]] General Conference voted to designate Sept. 28 as "International Day for the Universal Access to Information" or, as it is more commonly known, [[Access to Information Day]]. The date had previously been celebrated as "Right to Know Day" since 2002.  The UNESCO resolution recommends approval by the [[UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/11/unesco-names-sept-28-access-to-information-day/|title=UNESCO Names Sept. 28 Access to Information Day|last=|first=|date=17 November 2015|publisher=freedominfo.org|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{See also|Freedom of information}}
{{See also|Freedom of information laws by country}}

The right to access information builds on the principle that the public has a right to know how power is exercised and public money is spent, given that public bodies are elected by people and sustained by taxpayers. The access to public information is a precondition  for governments' and public officials' accountability and it enables the adoption of informed decisions by citizens, hence representing a fundamental element for the proper functioning of democratic systems. International standards and evolving jurisprudence have confirmed that information held by public bodies belong to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/what-is-the-right-to-know Access-Info Europe, What is the right to know?{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents]] (2009) states that "all official documents are in principle public and can be withheld subject only to the protection of other rights and legitimate interests".&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680084826 Council of Europe, Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents. Council of Europe Treaty Series - No. 205, 2009.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 100 countries around the world have now adopted national [[Freedom of information laws by country|access to information laws]] to make the right to know effective. The first law on access to public information was adopted in [[Sweden]] in 1766, but after that one should wait almost one century to have the second law approved in [[Finland]] in 1951 and in the [[United States]] in 1966. During the 1970s and 1980s there has been a small but constant growth in FOI's laws, with a real expansion after 1989 due to the activism of civil society groups in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] during the post-Communist transitions to democracy. Indeed, the big push forward in the field of access to information leading to the broadening of the definition and of the scope of the right of access to information came together with a coordinated civil society reaction to contrast the control over the information exercised by Communist regimes in the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]]. It was this movement which gave a sound contribution to the development of access to information as a right in the sense of a human right. A 1992 decision of the Hungary's Constitutional Court established that access to information is a "fundamental right" essential for citizen oversight on the lawfulness and efficiency of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, "Ten Challenges for the Right to Information in the Era of Mega-Leaks"] in Tarlach McGonagle and Yvonne Donders (edited by), The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information. Critical perspectives, June 2015, {{ISBN|9781107083868}} {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, environmentalist groups and consumer associations also contributed to the affirmation of the right to know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/sites/default/files/companies_and_the_right_to_access_public_information.pdf Associación por los Derechos Civiles; Instituto del Banco Mundial; Inter-American Investment Corporation, 2007, Companies and the right to access public information. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-24}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

All the eight former communists countries which joined the [[Enlargement of the European Union|European Union in 2004]] had a freedom of information law; also [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] had their own law when joined the EU in 2007 and [[Croatia]] had already had an access to information law in force for ten years when it joined the EU in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, June 2015. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, in the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] region 48 of the 56 member states have specific access to information laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access information places two obligations on governments and public bodies. First, the duty to make public key information on the activities implemented by public bodies; second, the obligation to respond to people's requests of accessing documents, either by making available the original documents or by sharing copies of documents and information held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to information is a right which comprises two parts. The first is a proactive component, namely the positive obligation of public bodies to provide, make public and disseminate information about their activities, budgets and policies so that citizens can understand what public bodies are doing, can participate in public life and can monitor the behaviour of public authorities. The second component is a reactive one, entailing the right of all persons to requests information and documents to public bodies, along with the right to receive an answer. In principle, all the main information held by public bodies should be available, while exceptions to disclosure should be grounded on the protection of other values, such as privacy, national security or commercial interests.

On the occasion of the first officially recognised [[Access to Information Day]] celebrated on 28 September 2016, European civil society groups working to enhance the right of access to public information raised some concerns as, despite significant progress, there are still far-reaching shortcomings especially with regard to transparency of decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt; According to such organisations, among the main obstacles to government openness there is the inadequate record keeping of public bodies’ information: minutes of public officials’ meetings are not recorded, exchange with lobbyists are not available, public decisions are adopted without proper justification or documented evidence available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/decision-making-transparency Access-Info Europe, Opening up decision-making. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt; An additional problem concerns the over-application of exceptions with particular regard to the use of the privacy reasons, applied to not disclose the activities of public officials when performing public functions. Moreover, European civil society organisations are particularly concerned for the lack of transparency around the decision-making process at both national and EU level, as in the case of the refusal by the EU to disclose documents on the [[EU-Turkey refugee deal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to information as a human right==

A big push forward the advancement of the right to access information as a fundamental right was due to the activism of civil society movements which contrasted the regimes' control over information in the Communist countries in the Soviet bloc. A fundamental document in this sense is a 1992's decision of the Hungarian Constitutional Court which established that access to information is a "fundamental right" essential for citizen oversight on the lawfulness and efficiency of the government.&lt;ref&gt;See Decision 32/1992 (V.29) AB, 183-84 (as translated by the Office of the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information)&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressively, several national and international courts decisions have been treating access to information as a basic human right, thus providing a strong legal case for citizens resorting to courts to defend any refusals by authorities to provide access to public information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such decisions are grounded on a series of international declarations, human rights covenants and conventions at international, regional and EU levels. In the first place, the right to access public information is recognised as a fundamental right and as a component of the right of freedom of expression in the Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; in the Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights]]; and in the Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]. At regional level, all the three main regional systems of human rights, namely within the Americas, Europe and Africa, have recognised freedom of information as a universal human right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] confirmed that the right to freedom of expression enshrined in Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] includes the right of access public information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the European Union level, Article 42 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|European Charter of Fundamental Rights]] establishes the right of access to EU institutions documents, as recognised also by Article 15 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|Treaty on the Functioning of the EU]] ("Treaty of Lisbon"). In 2009, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on the basis of Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which is the article on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], acknowledged the fundamental right of access to information held by public bodies. Specifically, the Court established that the right to information is protected in particular in case of "[[information monopoly]]", namely when the public bodies are the only ones owning the requested information, and when the information is needed by media or civil society organisations for public accountability purposes. The decision of the European Court embraced a 2006 decision by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] which endorsed Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights|American Human Rights convention]] stating that individuals have the right to request information to public authorities and public authorities have the positive obligation to provide such information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, many countries across the world recognise the right to information or access to documents in their [[Constitution]]s, either within the frame of the right to freedom of expression or separately and specifically as the right of access to information or documents. At least 50 countries all over the world, including 29 [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] countries, have Constitutions including such provisions .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal benefits of access to public information: accountability, participation, efficiency==
[[Transparency (behavior)|Transparency]] enhanced through the right to access public information entails a series of core benefits for democratic societies, in particular [[accountability]], [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] and efficiency. First, access to public information enhances public accountability as it contributes to make governments and public officials more accountable for their actions and decisions. Second, the right to know boost people participation as it makes available information that can help citizens to make more effective decisions on matters that directly affect their lives and to participate with informed opinions in public debates and in the decision-making process. Third, access to public  information contributes to the efficiency of decision-making as disclosure encourages public institutions to better manage and organise information and may help to improve communication between public bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, access to information serve some other social goals. For instance, access to medical records can help individuals to improve personal decision-making and make better decisions about medical treatment, financial planning and the like. Finally, access to information can facilitate effective business practices as some of the information held by public bodies related to economic issues can be very useful for enterprises and can therefore contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the business sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, International 7standards: Right to information. 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/sites/default/files/companies_and_the_right_to_access_public_information.pdf Associación por los Derechos Civiles; Instituto del Banco Mundial; Inter-American Investment Corporation, 2007. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-24}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International standards and laws==
At national level access to public information is regulated by [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]]. In addition to national legislation, principles and standards for access to public information are set forth into several international declarations and treaties that have authoritatively recognised the fundamental and legal nature of the right to freedom of information along with the need for effective legislations that should guarantee the respect of that right in practice.&lt;ref&gt;.[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such international laws and standards include:

* '''Civil society standards and declarations''': these include the Ten Principles on the Right to Know by the Justice Initiative (2005); the Public's Right to Know - Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation by Article 19 (1999); the Atlanta Declaration and Plan of Action for the Advancement of the Right of Access to Information (2008); the Budapest Declaration on Right of Access to Information (2008); the Transparency Charter for International Financial Institutions: Claiming our Right to Know by the Global Transparency Initiative (2006); the Declaration on Parliamentary Openness (2012);
* '''International treaties''': these include the [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Documents]] (2009) and the [[Aarhus Convention]] on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (1999);
* '''Inter-governmental Principles and Recommendations''': these include the Principles on the Right of Access to Information by the [[Organization of American States|Organisation of American States]] (2000); the [[Council of Europe]] Recommendation 2002(2) on access to official documents (2002); the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa by the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights]] (2002); the [[UNESCO]]'s Maputo Declaration on Fostering Freedom of Expression, Access to Information and Empowerment of People (2008); the [[UNESCO]]'s Brisbane Declaration on Freedom of Information; the Dakar Declaration on Media and Good Governance (2005);
* '''Annual reports of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression''': the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]] has addressed the issue of freedom of information in its annual reports since 1997. After that, the Commission on Human Rights endorsed the commentaries of the Special Rapporteur and asked him to elaborate further on the right to seek and receive information. As a consequence, the UN Special Rapporteur expanded significantly his commentary on freedom of information in his 2000 annual Reports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, International standards: Right to information. 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information: guiding principles==
The non-governmental organisation [[Article 19|ARTICLE 19]] has published a set of principles called "The Public's Right To Know: Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation" which describes the best practices and standards on freedom of information legislation based on international and regional laws as well as on evolving national practices and legislations. Such principles, which are designed mainly for national laws, are also applicable to inter-governmental bodies such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, The Public's Right to Know. Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 1: Maximum disclosure===
The principle of maximum disclosure sets a presumption that all information held by public bodies should be covered by the scope of access to information laws. This presumption accepts only limited circumstances for exceptions. This principle incorporates the very basic rationale underpinning the concept of freedom of information. It entails that public authorities seeking to deny access to public information have the obligation to justifying their refusal. The principle of maximum disclosure provides for a broad definition of "public bodies" which are subject to the duty of releasing information. Such a broad interpretation includes all branches of government, e.g. local governments, elected bodies, nationalised industries and public corporations, judicial bodies and also private bodies carrying out public functions. Principle 1 requires the law to establish minimum standards regarding the maintenance and preservation of documents by public bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 2: Obligation to publish===
This principle implies the obligation for public bodies to respond to access to information requests and to publish and disseminate documents of public interest. Few reasonable limits based, for instance, on resources and capacity can be accepted. As a minimum, public authorities should make public the following types of information:
* operational information on the functioning of public bodies, including objectives, results and costs;
* information on any requests or complaints that people may take in relation of a given public body;
* information on how members of the public may provide their contribution to the policy-making process;
* the types and formats of information held by public bodies;
* information on decisions and policies affecting the public, along with background information on those decisions and the evidence that led to their formulation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 3: Promotion of open government===
This principle calls governments to actively promote a culture of openness in order to enhance the respect of the right to know. This is important as experiences in different countries have shown that recalcitrant public authorities can undermine the application of even the most progressive legislations. National laws should therefore allocate adequate resources to the promotion of an [[open government]] culture and the goals of FOI laws, including by means of internal codes on access and openness, educational programmes, media coverage and communications campaigns. Such activities should also be aimed at contrasting the culture of official secrecy within government for example through trainings for public officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; An important step in this direction has been adopted in 2011 with the establishment of a new global alliance of democratic countries committed to the promotion of transparency, accountability and participation under the label [[Open Government Partnership]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, June 2015. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 4: Limited scope of exceptions===
Exceptions to disclosure should be grounded on clearly and narrowly defined exceptions. Public authorities should show that a refusal to provide the required information has passed a test through which to assess if the disclosure of a given information threaten to cause substantial harm to a legitimate aim and if the harm is greater than the public interest in having the information. Non-disclosure decisions should be taken on a case-by-case basis. National laws should provide an exhaustive list of the legitimate reasons that may justify non-disclosure. Such a list should be narrowly defined and include only highly relevant interests to be protected, such as [[law enforcement]], [[privacy]], [[national security]], commercial and other confidentiality, public or individual safety and the integrity of the decision-making process. However, even if can be demonstrated that disclosure would cause substantial harm to a legitimate interest, the information should be released when the benefits of disclosure prevail over the harm. In other words, the harm to the legitimate interest must be weighed against the public interest in having a given information publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 5: Processes to facilitate access===
According to this principle requests for public information should be processed quickly and fairly and an independent review of any refusals should be made available to the applicant. Also, public bodies are called to set up open, accessible systems for implementing freedom of information laws and thus ensuring the public's right to receive the required information. Furthermore, the law should establish an individual right to [[appeal]] to an independent body for any refusal by a public body to release information. All members of the public should be in the condition of accessing to appeal procedures without incurring in undue costs and complicated procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 6: Costs===
This principle states that costs for accessing public information should not be so high as to deter applicants from making the request. Around the world there are different cost regimes, including, for instance, flat fees systems for each request and graduated fees depending on the actual cost of retrieving and reproducing the information and / or the documents requested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 7: Open meetings===
Freedom of information comprises the public's right to know how the government behaves on behalf of people and to participate to decision-making. Freedom of information law should thus incorporates the presumption that all relevant meetings of governing bodies, i.e. those involved in decision-making, should be open to the public. Meetings may be closed, but only when sound reasons for closure exist. Such reasons have to be clearly explained and closure have to comply to established procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 8: Disclosure takes precedence===
Other laws dealing with publicly held information should be consistent with the principle of maximum disclosure and the other principles underpinning freedom of information. In particular, the regime of exceptions  should be clearly defined in the freedom of information legislation; extensions of the exceptions regime should not be allowed by other laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 9: Protection for whistleblowers===
[[Whistleblower]]s, i.e. individuals who make publicly available information on government's wrongdoings - including for instance corruption, dishonesty, maladministration, serious threat to health, safety or the environment, etc. - should be protected from any legal, administrative or other kind of sanctions. In this context the public interest refers to situations where the benefit of disclosure prevails over the harm, no matter how the disclosure has been conducted. This applies in particular when there are exceptionally serious reasons for releasing a certain information, such as a serious threat to public health or safety, or when there is a strong evidence that wrongdoing will be concealed or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information: main features==

===Universal access===
Being a fundamental and universal right, in principle access to information is a right to everyone: almost all national [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]] recognise this by establishing that "anyone" may make a request to access public information. One noteworthy exception among the world's democracies is [[Canada]] where only citizens and residents are entitled to submit access to information requests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, a major practical obstacle to the universal exercise of the right to access information is due to the obligation to submit the requests in the official language of the country which may hamper the exercise of the right to know for people that does not have a command of a country's official language.

In the EU, according to the treaties the right to access documents and the right to appeal to the [[European Ombudsman]] applies only to EU citizens, residents and companies registered inside the EU. While in general anyone whose right has been violated can appeal to the [[European Court of Justice]], in the case of the right to access information the Court is obliged to accept cases made by EU citizens, residents and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kind of information and documents to be made available under access to information laws===
In principle, all information held by public bodies can be accessed upon a FOI's request, unless some exceptions can be applied (e.g. on the ground of protecting state interests; private interests or human rights, or to ensure effective governments). Some national laws refer to "access to information" while others to "access to documents": even if these definitions actually overlap, it can be useful for the applicant to be aware of the exact phrasing used by the law in order to formulate properly the access to information request, and thus, having more chance of success. Usually "documents" and "information" should be made available whatever its medium, e.g. written on paper or in electronic format, or as a sound, visual or audiovisual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The EU Regulation 1049/2001 specifies that documents subject to access to information are those concerning "policies, activities and decisions falling within the institutions’ sphere of responsibility" and this applies to all documents held by the EU institutions "in all areas of activity of the European Union".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/register/pdf/r1049_en.pdf REGULATION (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public bodies concerned by access to information===
In general in Europe the right of access to information applies to all administrative bodies, at any level of government, from central government to local authorities. Some rare exceptions to this can be found, as in the case of [[Ireland]] where police forces are exempted. In addition to administrative bodies, in national legislations which have been progressively approved the obligation to disclose information has been extended also to legislative and judicial bodies. Moreover, in many countries also some private bodies performing public functions or receiving public funds are obliged to respond to access to information requests. For instance, in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] which adopted an access to information law in 2006, the right to access applies to local and national governments, legislative bodies and judicial authorities, and encompasses also private bodies with public functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inter-governmental organisations====
Many inter-governmental bodies hold information about policies and decisions affecting people's lives. While the EU has defined a set of rules regulating access to information held by EU institutions, the debate is still open about whether the right of access information applies to inter-governmental organisations which are outside the scope of national laws and have not signed international human rights conventions. Campaigning organisations have worked for the adoption of internal rules - called "disclosure policies" or "access to information policies" - so that inter-governmental organisations could apply rules similar to national access to information laws. The [[World Bank]] adopted its Access to Information Policy in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard exceptions to the right to information==
Although in  principles the right of access to information applies to all information held by public bodies, it is not an absolute right as there can be some exceptions not allowing the disclosure of certain kind of information. If released this information can violate some "legitimate interests", disturb public life or undermine other societal values. To justify the withhold of public information, authorities have the burden of the proof, thus have to demonstrate that disclosure would cause harm to a legitimate interest as specified by the law.

International laws and standards in the field of access to public information provide for three categories of standard exceptions. Specifically,

'''Exceptions to protect state interests or international relations''', such as:
* National security and defence of the state;
* International relations;
* Public safety or public order;
* Economic, monetary and exchange rate policies of the state;

'''Exceptions aimed at ensuring effective government''':
* Protection of internal public bodies’ deliberations prior to decision-making (known as "space to think" exception);
* Protection of criminal enquiries;

'''Exceptions to protect private interests and human rights''', such as:
* Privacy and other legitimate private interests;
* Commercial and other economic interests like, for instance, trade secrets;
* The environment;
* Guaranteeing the effective administration of justice and equality of parties before the courts.

However, even if the requested information or documents are sensitive and exceptions apply, some part of it could be released by public bodies on the ground of two factors. The first is the right of partial access according to which authorities have the duty of removing sensitive information and release the rest of the document. The second "exception to exceptions" applies when transparency overrides secrecy, thus even if the information is sensitive the public interest in knowing it is stronger. In this particular case public officials have to apply the so-called "public interest test", meaning that they have to scrutinize and ponder both the exceptions for not releasing information and the reasons of public interest in knowing the information required. Many national access to information laws foresees this kind of test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right to appeal==
Applicant have the [[Appeal|right to appeal]] in case of "[[administrative silence]]" (i.e. the request is not answered), when public authorities reject the disclosure request or when their reply is not satisfying and does not meaningfully answer the question. Rules regulating the right to appeal depends on national legislations and vary from country to country. Generally, there are four main appeals mechanisms:

* '''Internal or Administrative Appeal''': internal review is addressed to the same authority that issued the denial or made a non-satisfying disclosure or to the administrative body which is immediately superior;
* '''Administrative or Higher Court Appeal''': appeal to administrative court is usually the step following internal review. This is regulated by administrative law and the competent authority entitled to examine the appeal are regional or national administrative courts. A further appeal to a higher court, including the [[European Court of Human Rights]], is also possible.
* '''Information Commission/er Appeal''': in this case the appeal is scrutinised by a dedicated body whose specific role is to protect the right to access information. Such bodies can issue binding decisions as well as non-binding recommendations, depending on national laws. The decisions of the [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]] can always go to appeal. In the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] region, Information Commissions exist in 16 countries.
* '''Ombudsman Appeal''': in some countries, the [[Ombudsman]] - which is the institution whose role is to protect the rights of citizens vis à vis public authorities - has also the function to examine complains related to access to information. In many cases the Ombudsman's decision is only a recommendation, i.e. a non-binding measure, although usually his/her opinion is taken in due consideration by public authorities. At the EU level, the [[European Ombudsman]] is responsible for processing complaints concerning access to documents.

==Access to public information in practice==

===Request's contents===
Requests for accessing public information to the public authorities covered by the scope of national laws should be as clear and specific as possible about the information or documents required. A well-formulated request will facilitate the work of public officials and will more likely result in a positive answer or at least reducing the reasons for rejecting the request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the name and address of the person filing the request have to be provided. Giving also the e-mail address as well as a phone number might facilitate the exchange with public officials. In some countries requests made by resorting to pseudonyms or anonymously are permitted.

===Procedure===
In general, the procedure for requesting public information under national laws is simple and does not foresees many formalities. Usually requests can be filed in writing, either by post or hand-delivered to the concerned public authority. In most countries, submission is allowed also by e-mail. Moreover, some access to information laws permit oral requests, made, for instance, by phone or in person. However, in some cases, such as in [[Slovenia]], oral request are not considered to be a formal basis for going to appeal. In some countries, such as in [[Armenia]] or [[Romania]], rules and timeframes for written requests and oral requests are different.

===Fees===
Filing a request for accessing public information should always be free of charge, as confirmed by the [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents]] which allows only costs for copying and delivering the documents, such as photocopying, postage costs, or costs of reproduction into other formats or materials in case of DVDs or CDs. As a rule, electronic delivery is free of charge. The majority of countries in the [[Council of Europe]] region comply with this rule, even if there are notable exceptions, such as [[Ireland]] and [[Germany]] where, however, the required fees can be significantly reduced on the ground of public interest.

===Modalities of getting the information===
In reply of a formal request of accessing public information, the examination of the required information can be allowed in different ways, including the inspection of original documents; photocopies sent by post or e-mails; copies in DVDs or CDs.

===Timeframes for getting a reply===
There is a great variability across Europe on the timeframes for public authorities to answer requests as well as for notifying the extension of the timeframe for justified reasons or for issuing a refusal. However, the average time is about 15 working days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the countries with the shortest timeframe for response are [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] (1–3 days). On the contrary, the Albanian and Austrian access to information laws give the authorities a period of respectively 40 and 60 days to respond to people's requests. Most national laws allow the extension of the timeframe in case of requests which are particularly complex. In all cases such extension should be notified to the applicant, along with an explanation of the reasons that led to it. At the EU level, the Regulation 1049/2001 establishes 15 working days for issuing a response; an extension of up 15 additional working days may be applied in exceptional cases, for instance when the request relates to long documents or a large number of documents.

'''Advice and consent''' is an English phrase frequently used in [[List of enacting formulae|enacting formulae]] of [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s and in other legal or constitutional contexts. It may describe two situations, either where a weak [[executive branch]] of a government [[enactment of a bill|enacts]] something previously approved of by the [[legislative branch]] or where the legislative branch concurs and approves something previously enacted by a strong executive branch.

==General==
The concept serves to moderate the power of one branch of government by requiring the concurrence of another branch for selected actions. The expression is frequently used in weak executive systems where the [[head of state]] has little practical power, and in practice the important part of the passage of a law is in its adoption by the [[legislature]].

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], a [[constitutional monarchy]], bills are headed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;BE IT ENACTED by the [[Queen of the United Kingdom|Queen]]'s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the [[House of Lords|Lord]]s [[Lords Spiritual|Spiritual]] and [[Lords Temporal|Temporal]], and [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]], in this present [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This [[enacting formula]] emphasizes that, although legally the bill is being enacted by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]] (specifically, by the [[Queen-in-Parliament]]), it is not through her initiative but through that of Parliament that legislation is created.

==United States==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Wesley Clark]] --&gt;
{{United States Senate}}
{{Further|List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation}}

In the [[United States]], "advice and consent" is a power of the [[United States Senate]] to be consulted on and approve treaties signed and [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|appointments]] made by the [[President of the United States]] to public positions, including Cabinet secretaries, [[federal judge]]s, [[United States Attorney]]s, and ambassadors. This power is also held by several [[state Senate]]s, which are consulted on and approve various appointments made by the state's chief executive, such as some statewide officials, state departmental heads in the Governor's cabinet, and state judges (in some states).

=== Constitutional provision ===
{{Main|Appointments Clause}}

The term "advice and consent" first appears in the [[United States Constitution]] in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, referring to the senate's role in the signing and ratification of treaties. This term is then used again, to describe the Senate's role in the appointment of public officials, immediately after describing the president's duty to nominate officials. Article II, Section 2, paragraph 2 of the [[United States Constitution]] states:

{{quote|[The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]], and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.}}

This language was written at the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] as part of a delicate compromise concerning the balance of power in the federal government. Many delegates preferred to develop a strong executive control vested in the president, while others, worried about authoritarian control, preferred to strengthen the Congress. Requiring the president to gain the advice and consent of the Senate achieved both goals without hindering the business of government.

Under the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]], appointments to the office of Vice President are confirmed by a majority vote in both Houses of Congress, instead of just the Senate.

=== Historical development of power ===
While several framers of the U.S. Constitution, such as the Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, believed that the required role of the Senate is to advise the President ''after'' the nomination has been made by the President,&lt;ref&gt;Currie, David.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=nC4KbZVBeYgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA25 ''The Constitution in Congress: The Federalist Period, 1789–1801''], page 25 (University of Chicago Press 1997) via Google Books: "Madison, Jefferson, and Jay all advised Washington not to consult the Senate before making nominations."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander. [http://www.votesmart.org/reference/fedlist/fed76.htm ''Federalist No. 76''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023075214/http://www.votesmart.org/reference/fedlist/fed76.htm |date=October 23, 2008 }} (1788): “In the act of nomination, his judgment alone will be exercised.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Sherman]] believed that advice ''before'' nomination could still be helpful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a2_2_2-3s46.html Letter from Roger Sherman to John Adams] (July 1789) in ''The Founders Constitution'': "their advice may enable him to make such judicious appointments."&lt;/ref&gt; President [[George Washington]] took the position that pre-nomination advice was allowable but not mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Nominations.htm U.S. Senate history on the power to advise and consent]: "In selecting nominees, Washington turned to his closest advisers and to members of Congress, but the president resolutely insisted that he alone would be responsible for the final selection. He shared a common view that the Senate's constitutionally mandated 'advice' was to come after the nomination was made."&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion that pre-nomination advice is optional has developed into the unification of the "advice" portion of the power with the "consent" portion, although several Presidents have consulted informally with Senators over nominations and treaties.

=== Use today ===
Typically, a [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearing]] is held to question an appointee prior to a committee vote. If the nominee is approved by the relevant committee, the nomination is sent to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. The actual motion adopted by the Senate when exercising the power is "to advise and consent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXXX U.S. Senate Rule 30]: "On the final question to advise and consent to the ratification in the form agreed to, the concurrence of two-thirds of the Senators present shall be necessary to determine it in the affirmative."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXXXI U.S. Senate Rule 31]: "the final question on every nomination shall be, 'Will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?'"&lt;/ref&gt; For appointments, a majority of Senators present are needed to pass a motion "to advise and consent". A filibuster requiring a three-fifths vote to override, as well as other similar delaying tactics, have been used to require higher vote tallies in the past. 

On November 21, 2013, the Democratic Party, led by then-Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]], overrode the filibuster of a nomination with a simple [[majority vote]] to [[nuclear option|change the rules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/21/the-senate-just-got-rid-of-part-of-the-filibuster/ |title=It's official: The Senate just got rid of part of the filibuster |first=Brad |last=Plumer |date=November 21, 2013 |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, for instance, judicial nominees to federal courts and a president's executive-branch nominations can be freed up for a confirmation vote by a simple majority vote of the Senate. However, he left the filibuster in place for Supreme Court nominees.

In April 2017, the Republican Party, led by Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]], did the same for [[Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominations]], allowing [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court|Associate Justice]] [[Neil Gorsuch]] on the bench, despite what might have otherwise been a successful Democratic filibuster.

An '''assignment'''&lt;ref&gt;Latin ''cessio''&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal term used in the context of the law of [[contract]] and of [[property (law)|property]]. In both instances, assignment is the process whereby a person, the ''assignor'', transfers rights or benefits to another, the ''assignee''.&lt;ref&gt;For the assignment of claim see [http://www.trans-lex.org/917000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; An assignment may not transfer a duty, burden or detriment without the express agreement of the assignee. The right or benefit being assigned may be a gift (such as a [[waiver]]) or it may be paid for with a contractual [[consideration]] such as money. 

The rights may be vested or contingent,&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation|HCA|21|1963|parallelcite=(1963) 109 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 9 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and may include an [[equitable interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Law Dictionary|publisher=oxford university press|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mortgages and loans are relatively straightforward and amenable to assignment. An assignor may assign rights, such as a [[mortgage note]] issued by a third party borrower, and this would require the latter to make repayments to the assignee.

A related concept of assignment is [[novation]] wherein, by agreement with all parties, one contracting party is replaced by a new party. While novation requires the consent of all parties, assignment needs no consent from other non-assigning parties. However, in the case of assignment, the consent of the non-assigning party may be required by a contractual provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdnf.tlcollect.com/f1/cl/610/8172/TMT%20Newsletter%20August%202010%20v1d.pdf#page=3 |title=Tips and traps in contracting: novation versus assignment |last1=Kallenbach |first1=Paul |last2=Reid |first2=Nicole |publisher=[[MinterEllison]] |date=August 2010 |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The assignment does not necessarily have to be in writing; however, the assignment agreement must show an intent to transfer rights. The effect of a valid assignment is to extinguish [[privity]] (in other words, contractual relationship, including right to sue) between the assignor and the third-party [[obligor]] and create privity between the obligor and the assignee.

==Liabilities and duties==
Unless the contractual agreement states otherwise, the assignee typically does not receive more rights than the assignor, and the assignor may remain liable to the original counterparty for the performance of the contract. The assignor often delegates duties in addition to rights to the assignee, but the assignor may remain ultimately responsible.

However, in the United States, there are various laws that limit the liability of the assignee, often to facilitate credit, as assignees are typically lenders.&lt;ref name=AssigneeLiability&gt;[http://arnstein.com/attorneypublications/Ropiquet/Assignee.Liability.-.Through.the.Minefield.pdf Assignee Liability: Through the Minefield]. Arnstein &amp; Lehr LLP.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples include a provision in the [[Truth in Lending Act]]&lt;ref&gt;See 15 U.S.C. 1641(a).&lt;/ref&gt; and provisions in the [[Consumer Leasing Act]] and the [[Home Ownership Equity Protection Act]].&lt;ref name=AssigneeLiability/&gt;

In other cases, the contract may be a [[negotiable instrument]] in which the person receiving the instrument may become a [[holder in due course]], which is similar to an assignee except that issues, such as lack of performance, by the assignor may not be a valid defense for the obligor.&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC&gt;[http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm Commercial Paper: Holder in Due Course &amp; Defenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128024402/http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm |date=2012-11-28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] promulgated Rule 433, formally known as the "Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses", which "effectively abolished the [holder in due course] doctrine in consumer credit transactions".&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC/&gt; In 2012, the commission reaffirmed the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftc.gov/opa/2012/05/holderrule.shtm FTC Opinion Letter Affirms Consumers' Rights under the Holder Rule]. FTC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assignment of contract rights==
{{Contract law}}

After the assignment of contractual rights, the assignee will receive all benefits that had accrued to the assignor. For example, if A contracts to sell his car for $100 to B, A may assign the benefits (the right to be paid $100) to C.&lt;ref&gt;In this scenario, Party A is the '''obligee/assignor''', Party B is an '''obligor''', and Party C is the '''assignee'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, Party C is ''not'' a ''[[third party beneficiary]]'', because the contract was not made for C's benefit. Assignment takes place after the contract was formed; they may not precede them.{{cn|date=April 2018}}
===When assignment will be permitted===
The [[common law]] favors the freedom of assignment, so an assignment will generally be permitted unless there is an express prohibition against assignment in the contract. Where assignment is thus permitted, the assignor need not consult the other party to the contract. An assignment cannot have any effect on the duties of the other party to the contract, nor can it reduce the possibility of the other party receiving full performance of the same quality. Certain kinds of performance, therefore, ''cannot'' be assigned, because they create a unique relationship between the parties to the contract. For example, the assignment of a legal malpractice claim is void since an assignee would be a stranger to the attorney-client relationship, who was owed no duty by the attorney and would imperil the sanctity of the highly confidential and fiduciary relationship existing between attorney and client.

Torts are not assignable as [[public policy]], and various statutes may prohibit assignment in certain instances.&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt; In addition, the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] lists prohibitions in §317(2)(a) based upon the effect to the nonassigning party (obligor),&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt; with similar prohibitions in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] §2-210.&lt;ref name=LexisNexisStudy&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/contracts/contracts18.htm Chapter 18: Assignment and Delegation]. LexisNexis study outline.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, UCC §2-210 states the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-210 Uniform Commercial Code § 2-210. Delegation of Performance; Assignment of Rights].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreementotherwise [sic].}}

===Requirements for an effective assignment===
For assignment to be effective, it must occur in the present. No specific language is required to make such an assignment, but the assignor must make some clear statement of intent to assign clearly identified contractual rights to the assignee. A promise to assign in the future has no legal effect. Although this prevents a party from assigning the benefits of a contract that has not yet been made, a [[court of equity]] may enforce such an assignment where an established economic relationship between the assignor and the assignee raised an expectation that the assignee would indeed form the appropriate contract in the future.

A contract may contain a [[non-assignment clause]], which prohibits the assignment of specific rights and some various rights, or of the entire contract, to another. However, such a clause does not necessarily destroy the power of either party to make an assignment. Instead, it merely gives the other party the ability to sue for breach of contract if such an assignment is made. However, an assignment of a contract containing such a clause will be ineffective if the assignee ''knows'' of the non-assignment clause, or if the non-assignment clause specifies that "all assignments are void".

Two other techniques to prevent the assignment of contracts are ''[[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] clauses'' or clauses creating a ''[[condition subsequent]]''. The former would give the other party to the contract the power to rescind the contract if an assignment is made; the latter would rescind the contract automatically in such circumstances.

====Requirement of a writing====
There are certain situations in which the assignment must be in writing.
#Assignment of [[wages]]; additionally, statutes may prohibit this assignment&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt;
#Assignment of any interest in [[real property]]
#Assignment of [[Chose (English law)|choses in action]] worth over $5,000

===Delegation===
A parallel concept to assignment is ''[[delegation (law)|delegation]]'', which occurs when one party transfers his ''duties or liabilities'' under a contract to another. A delegation and an assignment can be accomplished at the same time, although a non-assignment clause may also bar delegation.

== Remedies ==
[[Legal remedy|Legal remedies]] may be available if the nonassigning party's rights are affected by the assignment.

===Revocability===
Assignments made for consideration are irrevocable, meaning that the assignor permanently gives up the legal right to take back the assignment once it has been made. Donative assignments, on the other hand, are generally revocable, either by the assignor giving notice to the assignee, taking performance directly from the obligor, or making a subsequent assignment of the same right to another. There are some exceptions to the revocability of a donative assignment:
#The assignment can not be revoked if the obligor has already performed
#The assignment can not be revoked if the assignee has received a ''token chose'' (''chose'' being derived from the [[French language|French]] word for "thing", as in a chose of action) - a physical object that signifies a right to collect, such as a stock certificate or the passbook to a savings account.
#The assignment can not be revoked if the assignor has set forth in writing the assignment of a ''simple chose'' - a contract right embodied in any form of token.
#[[Estoppel]] can prevent the revocation of a donative assignment if the assignee changed their position in reliance on the assignment.

===Breach and defenses===
A cause of action for [[breach of contract|breach]] on the part of the obligor lies with the assignee, who will hold the exclusive right to commence a cause of action for any failure to perform or defective performance. At this stage, because the assignee "stands in the shoes" of the assignor, the obligor can raise any defense to the contract that the obligor could have raised against the assignor. Furthermore, the obligor can raise against the assignee counterclaims and setoffs that the obligor had against the assignor. For example, suppose that A makes a contract to paint B's house in exchange for $500. A then assigns the right to receive the $500 to C, to pay off a debt owed to C. However, A does such a careless job painting the house that B has to pay another painter $400 to correct A's work. If C sues B to collect the debt, B can raise his counterclaim for the expenses caused by the poor paint job, and can reduce the amount owed to C by that $400, leaving only $100 to be collected.

When the assignor makes the assignment, he makes with it an [[implied warranty]] that the right to assign was not subject to defenses. If the contract had a provision that made the assignment ineffective, the assignee could sue the assignor for breach of this implied warranty. Similarly, the assignee could also sue under this theory if the assignor wrongfully revoked the assignment.

===Successive assignments===
Occasionally, an unscrupulous assignor will asof the assignment, and on the timing of the assignments relative to certain other actions.

In a quirk left over from the common law, if the assignment was donative, the ''last assignee'' is the true owner of the rights. However, if the assignment was for consideration, the ''first assignee'' to actually ''collect against the assigned contract'' is the true owner of the rights. Under the modern ''American rule'', now followed in most U.S. jurisdictions, the first assignor with equity (i.e. the first to have paid for the assignment) will have the strongest claim, while remaining assignees may have other remedies.  In some countries, the rights of the respective assignees are determined by the old common law [[rule in Dearle v Hall|rule in ''Dearle v Hall'']].

# Earlier donative assignees for whom the assignment was revocable (because it had not been made irrevocable by any of the means listed above) have no cause of action whatsoever.
# Earlier donative assignees for whom the assignment was made irrevocable can bring an action for the [[tort]] of [[conversion (law)|conversion]], because the assignment was technically their property when it was given to a later assignee.
# Later assignees for consideration have a cause of action for breaches of the implied warranty discussed above.

See [[interpleader]].

==Special rules for assignment of certain rights==

===Property rights===
{{Property law}}
{{See also|Rule in Dumpor's Case|Privity of estate}}
[[Real property]] rights can be assigned just as any other contractual right. However, special duties and liabilities attach to transfers of the right to possess property. With an assignment, the assignor transfers the complete remainder of the interest to the assignee. The assignor must not retain any sort of reversionary interest in the right to possess. The assignee's interest must abut the interest of the next person to have the right to possession. If any time or interest is reserved by a tenant assignor then the act is not an assignment, but is instead a sublease.

The liability of the assignee depends upon the contract formed when the assignment takes place. However, in general, the assignee has privity of estate with a lessor. With privity of estate comes the duty on the part of the assignee to perform certain obligations under covenant, e.g. pay rent. Similarly, the lessor retains the obligations to perform on covenants to maintain or repair the land.

If the assignor agrees to continue paying rent to the lessor and subsequently defaults, the lessor can sue both the assignor under the original contract signed with the lessor as well as the assignee because by taking possession of the property interest, the assignee has obliged himself to perform duties under covenant such as the payment of rent.

Unlike a Novation where consent of both the lessor and lesse is required for the third party to assume all obligations and liabilities of the original lessee, an assignment does not always need the consent of all parties. If the contract terms state specifically that the lessor's consent is not needed to assign the contract, then the lesee can assign the contract to whomever the lesee wants to.

Absent language to the contrary, a tenant may assign their rights to an assignee without the landlord's consent. In the majority of jurisdictions, when there is a clause that the landlord may withhold consent to an assignment, the general rule is that the landlord may not withhold consent unreasonably unless there is a provision that states specifically that the Landlord may withhold consent at Landlord's sole discretion.

===Partnership rights===
A person can also assign their rights to receive the benefits owed to a partner in a [[partnership]]. However, the assignee can ''not'' thereby gain any of the assignor's rights with respect to the operation of the partnership. The assignee may not vote on partnership matters, inspect the partnership books, or take possession of partnership property; rather, the assignee can only be given the right is to collect distributions of income, unless the remaining partners consent to the assignment of a new general partner with operational, management, and financial interests. If the partnership is dissolved, the assignee can also claim the assignor's share of any distribution accompanying the dissolution.

===Intellectual property rights===
{{See also|transfer (patent)}}

Ownership of intellectual property, including [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, and [[trademark]]s, may be assigned, but special conditions attach to the assignment of patents and trademarks. In the [[United States]], assignment of a patent is governed by [[statute]], {{USCode|35|261}}.  Patent rights are assignable by an "instrument in writing."  Title in a patent can also be transferred as a result of other financial transactions, such as a [[merger]] or a [[takeover]], or as a result of operation of law, such as in an [[inheritance]] process, or in a [[bankruptcy]].  An assignment of a patent can be recorded with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].  Although such recording is not required, if an assignment is not recorded at the USPTO within three (3) months or prior to a subsequent assignment, the assignment will be void against a subsequent assignee without notice of the earlier, unrecorded assignment.

With respect to a trademark, the owner of the mark may not transfer ownership of the mark without transferring the [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] associated with the mark.

Companies sometimes request from employees that they assign all intellectual property they create while under the employment of the company.  This is typically done within an Employment Agreement, but is sometimes done through a specific agreement called Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement (PIIA).

===Personal injury torts===

The standard rule is that [[personal injury]] [[tort]] causes of action are nonassignable as a matter of [[Public policy (law)|public policy]].&lt;ref name=Stark2003&gt;Stark T. (2003). ''Negotiating and Drafting Contract Boilerplate'', [http://www.starklegaled.com/downloads/sample-nadcp-3.2.pdf Ch. 3: Assignment and Delegation]. ALM Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pony v. County of Los Angeles'', 433 F.3d 1138 (9th Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  These should be distinguished from final settlements or judgments resulting from lawsuits brought on such causes of action, which may be assignable.

===Legal malpractice===

In the majority of jurisdictions, assignments involving fraud or [[legal malpractice]] causes of action are void as against public policy.&lt;ref&gt;''Cowan Liebowitz &amp; Latman, PC v. Kaplan'', 902 So. 2d 755, 759-760 (Fla. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equitable assignment==
An '''equitable assignment''' is an assignment, or transfer of rights, in [[Equity (law)|equity]].

===General principles===

There are numerous requirements that exist for an equitable assignment of property, outside the 'standard' ''clear and unconditional intention to assign''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|39|2007|litigants=Westbourne Grammar School v Sanget Pty |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements are fundamental characteristics of a statutory assignment: Absolute assignment (an unconditional transfer: conditions precedent or part of a debt are not absolute) and the assignment must be made in writing and signed by the assignor, and in particular, this applies to real property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca1919141|Conveyancing Act 1919|23C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assigning future property in equity cannot be gratuitous. The assignor must receive consideration for the agreement, otherwise the assignment will be ineffective.&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"/&gt; However, an absolute assignment does not require consideration to be given. Secondly, between the period of agreement between assignor and assignee and acquisition by the assignor, the assignees rights are not [[contractual]], but rather a [[property|proprietary right]] to the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|39|1978|litigants=Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Everett |parallelcite=(1978) 21 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 625 at p. 643 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]] (Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the assignee has an interest in this future property, in the same manner any owner has over property.

In equity, these principles operate to protect both the assignor and the assignee. In ''Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation'',&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"/&gt;  a taxpayer attempted to assign by [[deed]], to his wife certain moneys which he was eventually going to receive. This included dividends and [[interest]] due on [[loan]]s. The court held the interest and the [[dividend]]s were expectancies or possibilities which could not be assigned without consideration. The court's worry was that assignments without consideration might be used as instruments of fraud, to avoid creditors and tax collection.

===Mere expectancies===

Courts will not enforce a contract to assign an expectancy unless there is a valuable consideration. For example, under a settlement of property the respondent "the son" would have been entitled to an equal portion of properties along with his other siblings which was gained in a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] by his mother. This portion was only his when allocated to him at his mothers discretion. Prior to this allocation being made, the respondent allotted his benefit to [[trustee]]s for a voluntary settlement. He was assigning or purporting to assign something which he might become entitled to in the future, not a [[contingent interest]]. The judgment held it ineffective and elaborated on previous points to state the respondent cannot be compelled to allow the trustees to retain the appointed sum.&lt;ref&gt;Northumberland (Duke) v Inland Revenue Comrs&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''break/fix''' refers to the fee-for-service method of providing [[information technology]] (IT) services to businesses.  Using this method an IT solution provider performs services as needed and bills the customer only for the work done.  The service may include repairs, upgrades or installation of systems, components, peripheral equipment, networking or software.

The alternative to break/fix is '''managed services''', which is a [[service plan]], where the customer pays a fixed amount for services covered in the plan and pays additional amounts for repairs or other work which is not covered in the plan. 

The equivalent practice in the consumer market is that of out-of-warranty appliances, where the customer can pay for repairs as needed (break/fix) or they can buy an [[extended warranty]] (managed services).

'''Advantages:'''

Possible lower cost (at first).

'''Disadvantages:'''

Since problems are only addressed when they arise, maintenance is reactive rather than proactive.  Small problems left unaddressed due to shortsightedness because of cost can balloon to major failures.

Unscrupulous providers are incentivized to use inefficient or malicious means to increase break/fix work and thus increase their revenue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2548">A '''certificate of public convenience and necessity''' or '''certificate of public convenience''' is a type of [[regulatory compliance]] certification for [[public service]] industries.

A  '''city attorney''' can be an [[election|elected]] or [[wikt:appointment|appointed]] position in [[local government in the United States|city and municipal government]] in the [[United States]]. The city attorney is the [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] representing the city or municipality.

In some small towns, the city attorney is usually a [[lawyer]] in [[Practice of law|private practice]] and handles only governmental matters. In other towns or cities, he or she also prosecutes minor crimes.

A city attorney generally handles all legal matters for the city, from [[traffic ticket]]s to civil [[lawsuit]]s to acting as a [[general counsel]], giving [[legal advice]] for city [[Government agency|departments]].

Areas of focus may include:
*[[Civil law (common law)|Civil]] [[Claim (legal)|claims]] against the city (such as claims against the city [[Law enforcement agency|police department]])
*[[Criminal law|Criminal]] - Prosecute [[misdemeanor]]s and violations ([[Felony|felonies]] are usually prosecuted by a [[district attorney]], [[State's Attorney]] or [[Commonwealth's Attorney]]) 
*[[Real estate]] - Drug/alcohol nuisances, substandard housing or [[code enforcement]]

'''Commodity form theory''' is a theory of [[jurisprudence]] advanced by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] legal theorist [[Evgeny Pashukanis]]. The theory argues that the legal form is the parallel of the commodity form under [[capitalism|capitalist]] society.

All law is concerned with the process of the exchanging of commodities between subjects who act as the "guardians" of commodities and are created by law in order to enable the commodity production form of society to function. The theory can be explained as based on two premises, logical and historical.

==The logical premise==
"Every legal relation" proclaims Pashukanis, "is a relation between subjects". Pashukanis' conceptual account of law begins with the idea of a responsible agent - what he calls "the legal subject".

[[Property]], says Pashukanis, is the basis of the legal form, but only capitalist property that can be disposed of in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. The subject in law is the expression of the freedom of property, that is, the freedom of alienate property.

Thus the key to understanding law is the contradiction between commodities and subjects.

Commodities according to [[Karl Marx]] relate to each other as values, that is exchange takes place on the basis of equivalent amounts of labour-time embodied in commodities passing between buyers and sellers.

Contract is both logically the central legal premise on which all other aspects of law are based, and also the highest form of expression of the commodity owning subject. This is because it is the relations of contract that are crucial for commodity production society since the contract is the necessary legal expression of commodity owners' ability to use their commodities in the market. For Pashukanis, all other forms of legal relations in capitalism flow from this.

==The historical premise==
The commodity form of exchange historically precedes the legal system which emerges from it. But it is not merely that the commodity form produces the legal form; it is that the commodity form exists prior to the legal form and that only with the full development of the commodity form is there the possibility of a fully developed abstract legal form at all.

==Fetishism==
Commodity form theory is related to Marx's theory of [[commodity fetishism]]. Marx argued that the commodity was a fetishized form because the formal equality that the commodity form postulated was only an apparent equality. The legal form is blind to substantive human differences, just as the commodity form is blind to substantive differences in use value. Ultimately, the legal form, just as the commodity form, exists independently of the will of the individual. The illusion is produced that the law&amp;nbsp;– as the universal political equivalent&amp;nbsp;– has a life of its own.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">'''Compurgation''', also called '''wager of law''' and '''oath-helping''', was a defence used primarily in medieval law.  A defendant could establish his innocence or nonliability by taking an [[oath]] and by getting a required number of persons, typically twelve, to swear they believed the defendant's oath. From Latin, ''com'' = with, ''purgare'' = make clean, cleanse, excuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.myetymology.com/english/compurgation.html |title=English etymology of compurgation |publisher=myEtymology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Latin ''com'' is also an intensifier&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-last = Delbridge |editor-first = A ||display-editors=etal |title = Macquarie Australia's National Dictionary |publisher = The Macquarie Library Pty |year = 1997 |page = 388}}&lt;/ref&gt; and turns a word into the superlative form, so compurgation, by etymology, means 'to thoroughly clean or excuse'.

The wager of law was essentially a character reference, initially by kin and later by neighbours (from the same region as the defendant), often 11 or 12 men, and it was a way to give credibility to the oath of a defendant at a time when a person's oath had more credibility than a written record.  It can be compared to [[legal wager]], which is the provision of surety at the beginning of legal action to minimize frivolous litigation.

Compurgation was found in [[early Germanic law]], in early French law (''très ancienne coutume de Bretagne''), in [[Welsh law]], and in the English [[ecclesiastical courts]] until the seventeenth century. In [[common law]] it was substantially abolished as a defence in [[felonies]] by the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] in 1164. The defence was still permitted in [[civil action]]s for debt and vestiges of it survived until its statutory repeal at various times in common law countries: in England in 1833,&lt;ref name="Friedman" /&gt; and [[Queensland]] at some point before the Queensland Common Practice Act of 1867&lt;ref name="QCLPA"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/REPEALED/C/CommLawPracA1867_01_.pdf |format = PDF |title=Common Law Practice Act 1867 |publisher=Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel |date=24 June 1994 |quote = Wager of law abolished – 3. No wager of law shall be allowed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes direct reference to the abolition of wager of law.

"Wager of Law, obsolete for centuries" was "a living fossil... a dead letter statute" and was repealed in England in 1833.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{citation |last=Friedman |first=Lawrence Meir

==Origins==
The procedure in a wager of law is traced by [[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Blackstone]] to the Mosaic law, Ex. xxii. 10; but it seems historically to have been derived from the system of compurgation, introduced into England from Normandy, a system which is now thought to have had an appreciable effect on the development of the English jury. It also has some points of resemblance, perhaps some historical connexion, with the sponsao and the decisory oath of Roman law, and the reference to oath of [[Scottish law]].&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2|wstitle=Wager |volume=28 |page=229 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri28chis#page/229/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
[Compurgation] had originated in Anglo-Saxon England in the ties of kinship that bound people together in the period before the year 1000, a time when each man was responsible for the acts of his blood relatives. Later, kinship gave way to a more tribal affiliation and a loyalty to the place of one's birth. When disputes more often than not led to violence, it seemed natural that neighbors would band together. They aligned themselves with a neighbour who was accused in court and swore that in good conscience they believed he was telling the truth. The number of oath-helpers required depended on the defendant's rank and the character of the lawsuit. Eventually it became standard practice to bring eleven neighbours into court to swear for the defendant. The oath-helpers were called compurgators, and the wager of law was called compurgation.&lt;ref name="legal-dictionary"&gt;{{citation |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Wager+of+law |title=Wager of law legal definition of Wager of law |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Wager of law, wager of battle and trial by ordeal==
The wager of law, also called compurgation, is an old legal practice, dating back to Saxon and feudal times, which was [[Contemporary history|contemporaneous]] to the appeal to God to prove fact by [[trial by battle]] (wager of battle, [[trial by combat]], or judicial duel), and of [[trial by ordeal]].&lt;ref name=hamowy&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj23n2/cj23n2-7.pdf |format=PDF |title=F. A. Hayek and the Common Law |first=Ronald |last=Hamowy
|journal=Cato Journal |volume=23 |issue=2 |date=Fall 2003 |publisher=Cato Institute |accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the oath instead of the real or feigned combat — [[Trial by combat#Great Britain and Ireland|real in English law]], feigned in Roman law — no doubt represents an advance in legal development. The technical term sacramentum is the bond of union between the two stages of law. In the wager of law the defendant, with eleven compurgators, appeared in court, and the defendant swore that he did not owe the debt, or (in detinue) that he did not detain the plaintiff's chattel; while the compurgators swore that they believed that he spoke the truth.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

==Surety==
A variation was for the defendant to give gage, or sureties, in an action of debt, and "that at a certain day assigned he would take a law, or oath, in open court, that he did not owe the debt, and at the same time bring with him eleven neighbors (called compurgators), who should avow upon their oaths that they believed in their consciences that he spoke the truth" (see the [[Tractatus of Glanvill|''Tractatus'' of Glanvill]], ca. 1188).

==Determining fact==
Wager of law was replaced by jury, from early times, to determine fact, at a time that judges managed legal procedure and did not determine fact. Trial "by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land (legus terrae)" Cap. 29 of the [[Magna Carta]] 1215 to 1297.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/translation.html |title=Featured Document: The Magna Carta |publisher=Archives.gov |date=|accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wager of law was practised in England (and English  American colonies) until the 16th century, in criminal matters, and the 19th century, in civil matters.

==Supporting defendant's oath==
A defendant who elected to "make his law" was permitted to make a statement before the court, swear an oath that it was true, and present one or more individuals, often 12, who swore that they believed he had told the truth under oath. The predominant form of defense in the feudal courts, it persisted for a time in the common-law courts. The individuals "did not testify about the fact itself and, indeed, might have no personal knowledge concerning it. The value of a man’s oath might vary with his status; sometimes it was necessary for a defendant to meet a charge by assembling oaths of a prescribed monetary value. Because oath making often had religious implications for those who served as oath helpers and because there was also a possibility of legal sanctions (penalties), individuals might refuse to give oaths for persons with bad reputations. One reason for the long survival of the practice was that 'wagers in law' were often considered better evidence than account books in cases of debt."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/130405/compurgation |title=compurgation |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Welsh law]] allowed for a form of compurgation called [[assach]], which required not 12 but 300 compurgators.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/LFBooks/Maitland0161/CollectedPapers/Vol1/HTMLs/0242-01_Pt03_Essays1.html|title=The Laws of Wales|work=The Collected Papers of Frederic William Maitland|author=Fisher, H.A.L.|authorlink = H. A. L. Fisher| accessdate=2006-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition of wager of law==
{{quote|As the kings consolidated their power, suppressing violence and increasing the authority of the courts, the wager of law lost some of its ancient power and became a nuisance to litigants, who suspected that it frequently opened the door to false swearing. Different forms of action developed that did not permit the wager of law as a defense, and plaintiffs used them as much as possible. The procedure of wager of law had long since been obsolete when it was abolished during the reign of Henry IV (1399–1413).&lt;ref name="legal-dictionary"/&gt;}}

The taking of oaths was an eminently unsatisfactory way of arriving at the merits of a claim, and it is therefore not surprising to find that the policy of the law was in favour of its restriction rather than of its extension. Thus it was not permitted where the defendant was not a person of good character, where the king sued, where the defendant was the executor or administrator of the person alleged to have owed the debt, or in any form of action other than those named, even though the cause of action were the same.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

Trial by ordeal was abolished by order of the Lateran Council of 1215. Trial by battle was abolished in 1819 and wager of law was abolished in 1833, although both had fallen into disuse before their formal abolition.&lt;ref name=hamowy/&gt;

Wager of law was used as late as 1829, when the Rev. Fearon Jenkinson of Gnosall, Staffordshire used it against a Stafford ironmonger who claimed he was owed money by him. Jenkinson and his compurgators did not appear on the date.&lt;ref&gt;Chester Chronicle, 5 June 1829.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wager of law survived to recent centuries and in many jurisdictions it has been abolished by statute. It was abolished in New South Wales in 1841 by the Advancement of Justice Act 1841 (both Victoria and Queensland were still part of New South Wales at this time). This was re-enacted after separation of Queensland from New South Wales in the Queensland Common Law Practice Act 1867, but was strictly unnecessary, given its earlier abolition in 1841 &lt;ref name="QCLPA" /&gt; which makes direct reference to the abolition of wager of law.

No wager of law was allowed in [[assumpsit]], even though the cause of action were a simple debt. This led to the general adoption of assumpsit — proceeding originally upon a fictitious averment of a promise by the defendant — as a means of recovering debts. Where a penalty was created by statute, it became a common form to insert a proviso that no wager of law was to be allowed in an action for the penalty. Wager of law was finally abolished in 1833 (3 &amp; 4 William IV. c. 42).&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Related}}

'''Constitutionalism''' is "a complex of ideas, attitudes, and patterns of behavior elaborating the principle that the authority of government derives from and is limited by [[Constitutional law|a body of fundamental law]]".&lt;ref&gt;Don E. Fehrenbacher, ''Constitutions and Constitutionalism in the Slaveholding South'' (University of Georgia Press, 1989). p. 1. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-1119-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political organizations are constitutional to the extent that they "contain [[institution]]alized mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and [[Liberty|liberties]] of the [[citizenry]], including those that may be in the [[Minority group|minority]]".&lt;ref name="Gordon1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=Scott |title=Controlling the State: Constitutionalism from Ancient Athens to Today |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1999 |page=4 |isbn=0-674-16987-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described by political scientist and constitutional scholar [[David Fellman]]:
{{quote|Constitutionalism is descriptive of a complicated concept, deeply embedded in historical experience, which subjects the officials who exercise governmental powers to the limitations of a higher law. Constitutionalism proclaims the desirability of the rule of law as opposed to rule by the arbitrary judgment or mere fiat of public officials&amp;nbsp;...  Throughout the literature dealing with modern public law and the foundations of statecraft the central element of the concept of constitutionalism is that in political society government officials are not free to do anything they please in any manner they choose; they are bound to observe both the limitations on power and the procedures which are set out in the supreme, constitutional law of the community. It may therefore be said that the touchstone of constitutionalism is the concept of limited government under a higher law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 Philip P. Wiener, ed., "Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623044421/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 |date=2006-06-23 }}, (David Fellman, "Constitutionalism"), vol 1, pp. 485, 491–92 (1973–74) ("Whatever particular form of government a constitution delineates, however, it serves as the keystone of the arch of constitutionalism, except in those countries whose written constitutions are mere sham. Constitutionalism as a theory and in practice stands for the principle that there are—in a properly governed state—limitations upon those who exercise the powers of government, and that these limitations are spelled out in a body of higher law which is enforceable in a variety of ways, political and judicial. This is by no means a modern idea, for the concept of a higher law which spells out the basic norms of a political society is as old as Western civilization. That there are standards of rightness which transcend and control public officials, even current popular majorities, represents a critically significant element of man's endless quest for the good life.")&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Usage ==
Constitutionalism has prescriptive and descriptive uses. Law professor [[Gerhard Casper]] captured this aspect of the term in noting, "Constitutionalism has both descriptive and prescriptive connotations.  Used descriptively, it refers chiefly to the historical struggle for constitutional recognition of the people's right to 'consent' and certain other rights, freedoms, and privileges. Used prescriptively, its meaning incorporates those features of government seen as the essential elements of the... Constitution".&lt;ref name="Leonard Levy p. 473, 473"&gt;Leonard Levy, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the American Constitution'', (Gerhard Casper, "Constitutionalism"), vol 2, p. 473 (1986) {{ISBN|978-0-02-864880-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive===
One example of constitutionalism's descriptive use is law professor Bernard Schwartz's five volume compilation of sources seeking to trace the origins of the U.S. Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Schwartz, ''The Roots of the Bill of Rights'' (5 vols., Chelsea House Publisher, 1980) {{ISBN|978-0877542070}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with English antecedents going back to [[Magna Carta]] (1215), Schwartz explores the presence and development of ideas of individual freedoms and privileges through colonial charters and legal understandings. Then in carrying the story forward, he identifies revolutionary declarations and [[constitution]]s, documents and judicial decisions of the Confederation period and the formation of the federal Constitution. Finally, he turns to the debates over the federal Constitution's ratification that ultimately provided mounting pressure for a federal bill of rights. While hardly presenting a straight line, the account illustrates the historical struggle to recognize and enshrine constitutional rights and principles in a constitutional order.

===Prescriptive===
In contrast to describing what constitutions are, a prescriptive approach addresses what a constitution should be. As presented by the Canadian philosopher [[Wil Waluchow]], constitutionalism embodies
{{quote|the idea&amp;nbsp;... that government can and should be legally limited in its powers, and that its authority depends on its observing these limitations. This idea brings with it a host of vexing questions of interest not only to legal scholars, but to anyone keen to explore the legal and philosophical foundations of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constitutionalism ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''], Wil Waluchow "Constitutionalism" (Intro Jan. 2001 (revised Feb. 20, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
One example of this prescriptive approach was the project of the National Municipal League&lt;ref&gt;Frank Mann Stewart, ''A Half Century of Municipal Reform: A History of the National Municipal League'' Ch.2 (Univ. of California Press, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; to develop a model state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/txp_media/html/cons/features/0301_02/modelcons.pdf|title=''Model State Constitution''|author=|date=|website=utexas.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226004540/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/txp_media/html/cons/features/0301_02/modelcons.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authority of government===
Whether reflecting a descriptive or prescriptive focus, treatments of the concept of constitutionalism all deal with the legitimacy of government. One recent assessment of American constitutionalism, for example, notes that the idea of constitutionalism serves to define what it is that "grants and guides the legitimate exercise of government authority".&lt;ref&gt;Christian G. Fritz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpKCvUacmSwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA168 ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 1.] {{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, historian Gordon S. Wood described this American constitutionalism as "advanced thinking" on the nature of constitutions in which the constitution was conceived to be a "''sett of fundamental rules'' by which even the supreme power of the state shall be governed."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood, ''The Creation of the American Republic, 1770–1787'' (Norton &amp; Co. 1969). p. 268. {{ISBN|0-393-31040-X}} (quoting Demophilus, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2066&amp;chapter=155889&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 ''Genuine Principles''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511123036/http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2066&amp;chapter=155889&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |date=2011-05-11 }}. p. 4&gt; (Demophilus [George Bryan?]: ''the Genuine Principles of the Ancient Saxon, Or English [,] Constitution'').&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, American constitutionalism came to rest on the collective sovereignty of the people, the source that legitimized American governments.

===Fundamental law empowering and limiting government===
One of the most salient features of constitutionalism is that it describes and prescribes both the source and the limits of government power. William H. Hamilton has captured this dual aspect by noting that constitutionalism "is the name given to the trust which men repose in the power of words engrossed on parchment to keep a government in order."&lt;ref&gt;Walton H. Hamilton, "Constitutionalism". in Edwin R.A. Seligman, et al. (eds) ''Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (New York: Macmillan 1931). p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutionalism and constitutional questions ==
The study of constitutions is not necessarily synonymous with the study of constitutionalism.  Although frequently conflated, there are crucial differences. A discussion of this difference appears in legal historian Christian G. Fritz's ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'',&lt;ref&gt;(Cambridge University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; a study of the early history of American constitutionalism. Fritz notes that an analyst could approach the study of historic events focusing on issues that entailed "constitutional questions" and that this differs from a focus that involves "questions of constitutionalism."&lt;ref name="Fritz"&gt;Christian G. Fritz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpKCvUacmSwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA168 ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 6] {{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Constitutional questions involve the analyst in examining how the constitution was interpreted and applied to distribute power and authority as the new nation struggled with problems of war and peace, taxation and representation. However,

{{quote|These political and constitutional controversies also posed questions of constitutionalism—how to identify the collective sovereign, what powers the sovereign possessed, and how one recognized when that sovereign acted. Unlike constitutional questions, questions of constitutionalism could not be answered by reference to given constitutional text or even judicial opinions. Rather, they were open-ended questions drawing upon competing views Americans developed after Independence about the sovereignty of the people and the ongoing role of the people to monitor the constitutional order that rested on their sovereign authority.&lt;ref name="Fritz" /&gt;}}

A similar distinction was drawn by British constitutional scholar [[A.V. Dicey]] in assessing Britain's unwritten constitution. Dicey noted a difference between the "conventions of the constitution" and the "law of the constitution". The "essential distinction" between the two concepts was that the law of the constitution was made up of "rules enforced or recognised by the Courts", making up "a body of 'laws' in the proper sense of that term." In contrast, the conventions of the constitution consisted "of customs, practices, maxims, or precepts which are not enforced or recognised by the Courts" but "make up a body not of laws, but of constitutional or [[political ethics]]".&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, A. V., [http://www.constitution.org/cmt/avd/law_con.htm ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408171308/http://www.constitution.org/cmt/avd/law_con.htm |date=2004-04-08 }}, 8th ed.

Constitutionalism has been the subject of criticism for its previous ignorance of economic issues but this criticism is now taken into account by the development of [[constitutional economics]].

Constitutional economics is a field of [[economics]] and constitutionalism and describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and the structure and functioning of the [[economy]]. The term “constitutional economics” was used by American economist [[James M. Buchanan]] as a name for a new academic sub-discipline. Buchanan received in 1986 the [[Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences]] for his "development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan.html|title=James M. Buchanan Jr. - Facts|author=|date=|website=nobelprize.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531002802/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan.html|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the state as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members". This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics.

A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid an unidimensional understanding. Buchanan believes that a constitution, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions and to balance interests of the [[state (polity)|state]] and [[society]] against those of individuals and their constitutional rights to [[personal freedom]] and private [[happiness]]. Constitutional economics draws substantial inspiration from the reformist attitude which is characteristic of [[Adam Smith]]'s vision, and that Buchanan’s concept can be considered the modern-day counterpart to what Smith called "the science of [[legislation]]".

Concurrently with the rise of academic research in the field of constitutional economics in the U.S. in the 1980s, the [[Supreme Court of India]] for almost a decade had been encouraging [[public interest litigation]] on behalf of the poor and oppressed by using a very broad interpretation of several articles of the [[Indian Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Cooper, "Poverty and Constitutional Justice", in ''Philosophy of Law: Classic and Contemporary Readings'', edited by Larry May and Jeff Brown. Wiley-Blackwell, UK, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This is a vivid example of a ''de facto'' practical application of the methodology of constitutional economics.

The Russian school of constitutional economics was created in the early 21st century with the idea that constitutional economics allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis in the legislative (especially budgetary) process, thus helping to overcome arbitrariness in the economic and financial decision-making: for instance, when military expenses (and the like) dwarf the budget spending on education and culture. In the [[English language]], the word "constitution" possesses a whole number of meanings, encompassing not only national constitutions as such, but also charters of public organizations, unwritten rules of various clubs, informal groups, etc. The Russian model of constitutional economics, originally intended for transitional and [[developing countries]], focuses entirely on the concept of the state constitution. In 2006, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] officially recognized constitutional economics as a separate academic sub-discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. [http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf "The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia" in ''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032342/http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen. Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Since many countries with transitional political and economic systems continue to treat their constitutions as abstract legal documents disengaged from the economic policy of the state, the practice of constitutional economics becomes there a decisive prerequisite for democratic development of the state and society.

== Examples ==

===Descriptive===
Used descriptively, the concept of constitutionalism can refer chiefly to the historical struggle for constitutional recognition of the people's right to "consent" and certain other rights, freedoms, and privileges.&lt;ref name="Leonard Levy p. 473, 473"/&gt;

====United States====
American constitutionalism has been defined as a complex of ideas, attitudes and patterns elaborating the principle that the authority of government derives from the people, and is limited by a body of fundamental law. These ideas, attitudes and patterns, according to one analyst, derive from "a dynamic political and historical process rather than from a static body of thought laid down in the eighteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;docId=103280003 Stephen M. Griffin, "American Constitutionalism: From Theory to Politics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812002649/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;docId=103280003 |date=2011-08-12 }} (Princeton University Press, 1996). p. 5. {{ISBN|978-0-691-03404-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. history, constitutionalism, in both its descriptive and prescriptive sense, has traditionally focused on the federal constitution. Indeed, a routine assumption of many scholars has been that understanding "American constitutionalism" necessarily entails the thought that went into the drafting of the federal constitution and the American experience with that constitution since its ratification in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;For the assumptions by historians, political scientists and lawyers that have contributed to a view of constitutionalism essentially connected and confined to the US Constitution, see Christian G. Fritz, [http://works.bepress.com/christian_fritz/1/ "Fallacies of American Constitutionalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511124225/http://works.bepress.com/christian_fritz/1/ |date=2011-05-11 }} ," 35 ''Rutgers Law Journal'' (2004), 1327–69. See also Christian G. Fritz, ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 284 ("Invariably, the state constitutional tradition is deemed less authentic because of its departure from the federal model. This has led to the assumption that one need only study the federal Constitution to discover what American constitutionalism was then and is today.") {{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a rich tradition of state constitutionalism that offers broader insight into constitutionalism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;G. Alan Tarr, ''Understanding State Constitutions'' (Princeton Univ. Press, 1998) and John J. Dinan, T''he American State Constitutional Tradition'' (Univ. Press of Kansas, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; While state constitutions and the federal constitution operate differently as a function of federalism from the coexistence and interplay of governments at both a national and state level, they all rest on a shared assumption that their legitimacy comes from the sovereign authority of the people or [[popular sovereignty]]. This underlying premise, embraced by the American revolutionaries with the [[Declaration of Independence]] unites American constitutional tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Paul K. Conkin, ''Self-Evident Truths: Being a Discourse on the Origins &amp; Development of the First Principles of American Government – Popular Sovereignty, Natural Rights, and Balance &amp; Separation of Powers'' (Indiana Univ. Press, 1974), p. 52 (describing "the almost unanimous acceptance of popular sovereignty at the level of abstract principle"); Edmund S. Morgan, "The Problem of Popular Sovereignty," in ''Aspects of American Liberty: Philosophical, Historical and Political'' (The American Philosophical Society, 1977), p. 101 (concluding the American Revolution "confirmed and completed the subordination of government to the will of the people"); Willi Paul Adams, ''The First American Constitutions: Republican Ideology and the Making of the State Constitutions in the Revolutionary Era'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1980), p. 137 (asserting that statements of the "principle" of the people's sovereignty "expressed the very heart of the consensus among the victors of 1776").&lt;/ref&gt;

Both experience with state constitutions before and after the federal constitution as well as the emergence and operation of the latter reflect an ongoing struggle over the idea that all governments in America rested on the sovereignty of the people for their legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Christian G. Fritz, ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 284 (Observing that from the Revolutionary era to the period before the Civil War "Americans continued to wrestle with what it meant that their national as well as state governments rested on the sovereignty of the people") {{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
The United Kingdom is perhaps the best instance of constitutionalism in a country that has an [[uncodified constitution]]. A variety of developments in 17th century England, including "the protracted struggle for power between [[King of the United Kingdom|King]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was accompanied by an efflorescence of political ideas in which the concept of countervailing powers was clearly defined,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====Japan====
The recent move of the Japanese government for revisions of its 1947 constitution under [[Shinzō Abe]]'s administration is criticized as anticonstitutionalist in the sense that the new constitution would impose obligations on citizens rather than protect their human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
From the mid-sixteenth to the late eighteenth century, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] utilized the ''[[liberum veto]]'', a form of [[unanimity|unanimity voting rule]], in its parliamentary deliberations. The "principle of ''liberum veto'' played an important role in [the] emergence of the unique Polish form of constitutionalism." This constraint on the powers of the monarch were significant in making the "[r]ule of law, religious tolerance and limited constitutional government... the norm in Poland in times when the rest of Europe was being devastated by religious hatred and despotism."&lt;ref name="Rohac2008"&gt;{{cite journal

===Prescriptive===
The prescriptive approach to constitutionalism addresses what a constitution should be.  Two observations might be offered about its prescriptive use.
* There is often confusion in equating the presence of a written constitution with the conclusion that a state or polity is one based upon constitutionalism. As noted by [[David Fellman]], constitutionalism "should not be taken to mean that if a state has a constitution, it is necessarily committed to the idea of constitutionalism. In a very real sense... every state may be said to have a constitution, since every state has institutions which are at the very least expected to be permanent, and every state has established ways of doing things". But even with a "formal written document labelled 'constitution' which includes the provisions customarily found in such a document, it does not follow that it is committed to constitutionalism...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 Philip P. Wiener, ed., "Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas", (David Fellman, "Constitutionalism")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623044421/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 |date=2006-06-23 }}, vol 1, p. 485 (1973–74).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Often the word "constitutionalism" is used in a  rhetorical sense, as a political argument that equates the views of the speaker or writer with a preferred view of the constitution. For instance, University of Maryland Constitutional History Professor Herman Belz's critical assessment of expansive constitutional construction notes that "constitutionalism... ought to be recognized as a distinctive ideology and approach to political life.... Constitutionalism not only establishes the institutional and intellectual framework, but it also supplies much of the rhetorical currency with which political transactions are carried on."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/cmt/belz/lcfl_07.txt Herman Belz, "A Living Constitution or Fundamental Law? American Constitutionalism in Historical Perspective"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202001956/http://www.constitution.org/cmt/belz/lcfl_07.txt |date=2008-12-02 }} (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. 1998) at pp. 148–49 (Belz further argues: "Constitutionalism shapes political life in a variety of ways. Constitutional principles can become matters of commitment and belief possessing intrinsic value that motivate political action.... When citizens and governing officials internalize constitutional values, acting out of fidelity to law rather than expediency, constitutionalism gives direction to political life. Constitutionalism has a configurative effect also in providing the forms, rhetoric, and symbols by which politics is carried on. Political groups and individuals ordinarily try to choose courses of action that are consistent with or required by the Constitution. They do so not because they are in each instance committed to the constitutional principle or value at issue... [but] because they know that the public takes the Constitution seriously, believing that it embodies fundamental values and formal procedures that are the touchstone of political legitimacy. In American politics the Constitution is a justifying concept, and groups that invoke constitutional arguments do so, from their own perspective perhaps and in an immediate sense, instrumentally. Considered from an external and long-range view in relation to the polity as a whole, however, reliance on constitutional principles and rules is normative and noninstrumental. In this way constitutionalism shapes political events") {{ISBN|978-0-8476-8643-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Georgetown University Law Center Professor [[Louis Michael Seidman]] noted as well the confluence of political rhetoric with arguments supposedly rooted in constitutionalism. In assessing the "meaning that critical scholars attributed to constitutional law in the late twentieth century," Professor Seidman notes a "new order... characterized most prominently by extremely aggressive use of legal argument and rhetoric" and as a result "powerful legal actors are willing to advance arguments previously thought out-of-bounds.  They have, in short, used legal reasoning to do exactly what crits claim legal reasoning always does—put the lipstick of disinterested constitutionalism on the pig of raw politics."&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.fordham.edu/publications/articles/500flspub9546.pdf Louis Michael Seidman, "Critical Constitutionalism Now"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120855/http://law.fordham.edu/publications/articles/500flspub9546.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}, 75 Fordham Law Review pp. 575, 586 (Nov. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{main|Constitutionalism in the United States}}
Starting with the proposition that "'Constitutionalism' refers to the position or practice that [[government]] be limited by a [[constitution]], usually written," analysts take a variety of positions on what the constitution means. For instance, they describe the document as a document that may specify its relation to statutes, treaties, executive and judicial actions, and the constitutions or laws of regional jurisdictions. This prescriptive use of Constitutionalism is also concerned with the [[Constitution#Principles of constitutional design|principles of constitutional design]], which includes the principle that the field of public action be partitioned between [[Delegation|delegated powers]] to the [[government]] and the [[rights]] of individuals, each of which is a restriction of the other, and that no powers be delegated that are beyond the competence of government.&lt;ref&gt;James Madison, in his remarks introducing the Bill of Rights, 8 June 1789, ''Annals'' 1:424–50. [http://www.constitution.org/ac/001/r01-1/bill_of_rights_hr1789.htm Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504011004/http://www.constitution.org/ac/001/r01-1/bill_of_rights_hr1789.htm |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]], which historian [[Norman Davies]] calls "the first constitution of its kind in Europe",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA699 |first=Norman |last=Davies |title=Europe: A History |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=699 |isbn=0-19-820171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in effect for only a year. It was designed to redress longstanding political defects of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its traditional system of "Golden Liberty". The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility (''szlachta'') and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

====United Kingdom====
{{see also|Constitution of the United Kingdom}}
[[Constitutionalist (UK)|Constitutionalist]] was also a label used by some independent candidates in [[UK general election]]s in the early 1920s. Most of the candidates were former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] members, and many of them joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] soon after being elected. The best known Constitutionalist candidate was [[Winston Churchill]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|1924 UK general election]].&lt;ref&gt;British parliamentary election results 1918–1949, Craig, F.W.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dominican Republic====
After the democratically elected government of president [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] in the Dominican Republic was deposed, the Constitutionalist movement was born in the country. As opposed to said movement, the Anticonstitutionalist movement was also born. Bosch had to depart to [[Puerto Rico]] after he was deposed. His first leader was Colonel Rafael Tomás Fernández Domínguez, and he wanted Bosch to come back to power once again. Colonel Fernández Domínguez was exiled to Puerto Rico where Bosch was. The Constitutionalists had a new leader: [[Francisco Caamaño|Colonel Francisco Alberto Caamaño Deñó]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

== Criticisms ==
Legal scholar [[Jeremy Waldron]] contends that constitutionalism is often undemocratic:
{{quote|Constitutions are not just about retraining and limiting power; they are about the empowerment of ordinary people in a democracy and allowing them to control the sources of law and harness the apparatus of government to their aspirations. That is the democratic view of constitutions, but it is not the constitutionalist view.... Of course, it is always possible to present an alternative to constitutionalism as an alternative form of constitutionalism: scholars talk of "popular constitutionalism" or "democratic constitutionalism."... But I think it is worth setting out a stark version of the antipathy between constitutionalism and democratic or popular self-government, if only because that will help us to measure more clearly the extent to which a new and mature theory of constitutional law takes proper account of the constitutional burden of ensuring that the people are not disenfranchised by the very document that is supposed to give them their power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Contemporary Debates in Political Philosophy|year=2009|editor=Christiano, Thomas |editor2=Christman, John|page=279|chapter=Constitutionalism – A Skeptical View}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Constitutionalism has also been the subject of criticism by [[Murray Rothbard]], who attacked constitutionalism as incapable of restraining governments and does not protect the rights of citizens from their governments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[i]t is true that, in the [[United States]], at least, we have a constitution that imposes strict limits on some powers of government. But, as we have discovered in the past century, no constitution can interpret or enforce itself; it must be interpreted by ''men''. And if the ultimate power to interpret a constitution is given to the government's own Supreme Court, then the inevitable tendency is for the Court to continue to place its imprimatur on ever-broader powers for its own government. Furthermore, the highly touted "checks and balances" and "separation of powers" in the American government are flimsy indeed, since in the final analysis all of these divisions are part of the same government and are governed by the same set of rulers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp Murray N. Rothbard, ''For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto''] (1978), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Islamic constitutionalism ==
The scope and limits of constitutionalism in Muslim countries have attracted growing interest in recent years. Authors such as Ann E. Mayer define Islamic constitutionalism as "constitutionalism that is in some form based on Islamic principles, as opposed to constitutionalism that has developed in countries that happen to be Muslim but that has not been informed by distinctively Islamic principles".&lt;ref&gt;Ann E. Mayer, Conundrums in Constitutionalism: Islamic Monarchies in an Era of Transition, 1 UCLA J. Islamic &amp; Near E.L. 183 (Spring / Summer, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concrete meaning of the notion remains contested among Muslim as well as Western scholars. Influential thinkers like [[Mohammad Hashim Kamali]]&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Hashim Kamali, Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: A Contemporary Perspective of Islamic Law, in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann Röder (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Khaled Abou El Fadl]],&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Abou El Fadl, Shariah and Constitutionalism in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann Röder (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but also younger ones like [[Asifa Quraishi]]&lt;ref&gt;Asifa Quraishi, The Separation of Powers in the Tradition of Muslim Governments, in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann Röder (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nadirsyah Hosen]]&lt;ref&gt;Nadirsyah Hosen, "In search of Islamic Constitutionalism", ''American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences'', Volume 21, No. 2, 2004, 23 foll.&lt;/ref&gt; combine classic Islamic law with modern constitutionalism. The constitutional changes initiated by the Arab spring movement have already brought into reality many new hybrid models of Islamic constitutionalism.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. the monitoring project "Constitutional Reform in Arab Countries", http://www.mpil.de/red/crac{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a '''conveyancer''' is a specialist [[lawyer]] who specialises in the [[legal]] aspects of [[buying]] and [[selling]] [[real property]], or [[conveyancing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/bouv/bouvier_c.htm | title=Bouvier's Law Dictionary | publisher=Constitution Society | date=1856 | accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conveyancer can also be (but need not be) a [[solicitor]], [[licensed conveyancer]], or a [[fellow]] of the [[Institute of Legal Executives]].

In the United Kingdom, conveyancers are regulated by an official body known as the Council for Licensed Conveyancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conveyancer.org.uk/|title=CLC – The Specialist Property Law Regulator|website=www.conveyancer.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main purpose is to set entry standards and regulate the profession of licensed conveyancers effectively in order to secure adequate consumer protection, promote effective competition in the legal services market and provide choice for consumers. 

Services offered by conveyancers vary from Residential Conveyancing, [[Probate]] and [[Will (law)|Wills]]. Strong regulation is imposed to curb unfair practices which include among others false representation, exaction for hidden charges and double dealing. 

In Kenya, a conveyancer can only be an admitted advocate holding a valid current practising certificate. The consequences of not holding such a certificate is fatal to any transaction he undertakes on behalf of his client, and will be void. The client is therefore under obligation to do his due diligence by ensuring that his conveyancer has a current valid practising certificate by confirming this with the law society of Kenya.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4172">The '''counter-majoritarian difficulty''' (sometimes '''''counter-majoritarian dilemma''''') is a perceived problem with [[judicial review]] of [[legislative]] (or popularly created) laws. As the term suggests, some oppose or see a problem with the [[judicial]] branch's ability to invalidate, overrule or countermand laws that reflect the will of the majority.

The counter-majoritarian difficulty is often raised in discussions of [[United States constitutional law]]; particularly in discussing the powers of the three branches of the [[Federal government of the United States]].

==Origins==
[[Alexander Bickel]], a law professor at [[Yale Law School]], coined the term ''counter-majoritarian difficulty'' in his 1962 book, ''[[The Least Dangerous Branch]]''.  He used the term to describe the argument that [[judicial review]] is illegitimate because it allows unelected judges to overrule the lawmaking of elected representatives, thus undermining the will of the majority.  The problem stems from the understanding that a democracy's legitimacy arises from the fact that it implements the will of the majority ([[majoritarianism]]).

==Responses==
[[Majoritarianism]] is based on the view that a democracy can be defined by only its procedural aspects.  However, the definition of democracy is contentious.  The argument is often made that substantive rights must be protected in a democracy to truly have a democracy, even when those undermine the majoritarian nature of the democracy.  Under this view, when judges enforce such substantive rights, such as those agreed upon in a [[constitution]], the judges are actually engaged in furthering democracy. 

Political theorists have also argued that in some cases, elected representatives pass laws that do not reflect the will of the people, and in those cases, judicial review is a valid means by which to correct the democratic process.

On the other hand, in 2008, Judge [[John E. Jones III]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] serving on the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]], stated that [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] "is counter-majoritarian," adding: "The judicial branch protects against the [[tyranny of the majority]]. We are a bulwark against public opinion. And that was very much done with a purpose, and I think that it really has withstood the test of time. The judiciary is a check against the unconstitutional abuse and extension of power by the other branches of government."  Judge Jones is the author of the landmark decision [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], which found [[intelligent design]] to be a form of [[creationism]] that may not be taught in public school science classes under the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]] and [[separation of church and state]] established by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Judge John E. Jones III, Inexorably toward Trial: Reflections on the Dover Case and the “Least Dangerous Branch,” The Humanist, January/February 2009. {{cite web |url=http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/09_jan_feb/Jones.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613225327/http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/09_jan_feb/Jones.html |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1025">{{no sources|date=October 2018}}In [[landlord–tenant law]], a '''notice to cure or quit''' is issued by a [[landlord]] when a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] performs actions in violation of a [[lease]].  The notice gives a tenant the option of either fixing the offending problem or vacating the rental property.  If the tenant continues performing the action(s) and does not move out, they can be [[eviction|evicted]].

The term is sometimes also used in the [[debt collection|debt-collection]] business to indicate to an account in arrears that action may be taken against the account holder if the debt is not rectified.  The account holder may be sent a "Notice to cure or quit" to let them know the status of the account.

Depending on the jurisdiction, such a notice may be legally required before further action may take place, such as (in the case of landlord vs. tenant) being able to file an eviction suit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">A '''death in office''' is the death of a person who was [[incumbent]] of an office-position until the time of death. Such deaths have been usually due to natural causes, but they are also caused by [[accident]]s and murders.

The death of most [[monarch]]s and [[pope]]s have been deaths in office, since they have usually held their papacy/reign for the rest of their lives. Otherwise as most office positions require that the person is constantly competent in performing the associated duties, deaths in office are usually premature deaths.

==Consequences==
{{see also|Order of succession|Casual vacancy}}
Systems differ in how they deal with the death of an office holder. In some death results in a [[casual vacancy]], whereby the office is unfilled for a time. The office may subsequently be filled by a [[by-election]] or by appointment. A person may temporarily take the powers and responsibilities of the deceased in an "acting" capacity before a permanent replacement is made. In other systems there may be a legally defined [[order of succession]]. For example, in [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchies]] reigns are typically expected to end with death and the transition of power to an heir. Many presidential systems have offices of [[Vice president#In government|vice president]], whose principle responsibility is to immediately assume the presidency if the president dies or otherwise leaves the office.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3164">A '''deficiency judgment''' is an unsecured money judgment against a [[borrower]] whose [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] [[foreclosure]] sale did not produce sufficient funds to pay the underlying [[promissory note]], or loan, in full. &lt;ref&gt;See also Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  The availability of a deficiency judgment depends on whether the lender has a [[Recourse loan|recourse]] or [[nonrecourse loan]], which is largely a matter of state law. In some jurisdictions, the original loan(s) obtained to purchase property is/are non-recourse, but subsequent refinancing of a first mortgage and/or acquisition of a 2nd (3rd, etc.) are recourse loans.

In short, many jurisdictions hold that the loans obtained at the acquisition of a property ("purchase-money") are non-recourse, and most, if not all, subsequent loans are recourse.

States that follow the title (trust-deed) theory of mortgages typically allow non-judicial foreclosure procedures, which are fast, but do not allow deficiency judgments. States that follow the lien theory of mortgages require judiciary foreclosure procedures, but allow deficiency judgments against the debtor, although some states have narrowed the time periods to seek a deficiency judgment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tampaflforeclosure.com/foreclosure-defense/motion-for-deficiency-representation|title = Post Judgment Deficiency Motions in Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that there is a difference between a deficiency and a deficiency judgment. A "deficiency" is the difference between the amount owed on a loan and the total amount received/collected at the closing of a loan. A deficiency judgment is a court judgment that is a public record of the amount owed and by whom. In many states, items included in calculating the amount of a deficiency judgment include: the loan principal, accrued interest and attorney fees, less the amount the lender bid at the foreclosure sale.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Supreme Court of Missouri Upholds Lenders' Rights to Obtain Full Deficiency Judgment  |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/supreme-court-missouri-upholds-lenders-rights-to-obtain-full-deficiency-judgment |publisher= Armstrong Teasdale
|work=The National Law Review|date=2012-04-23|accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Geoff Walsh, a staff attorney with the U.S. [[National Consumer Law Center]], said on [[National Public Radio|NPR]] that the United States is "seeing an uptick" in the pursuit of deficiency claims, because technological developments have enabled large debt-buying institutions and mortgage insurers to more easily pursue former borrowers, who often don't know their legal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/406253|title = Bound by Debt: The Relentless Grip of the Foreclosure Crisis Continues|last = |first = |date = 15 October 2014|work = The Takeaway, NPR|accessdate = 15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|dignity as a matter of philosophy, religion, human rights, law and medicine}}

'''Dignity''' is the [[Rights|right]] of a person to be valued and respected for their own sake, and to be treated ethically. It is of significance in [[morality]], [[ethics]], [[law]] and [[politics]] as an extension of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era concepts of [[Inalienable right#Debate|inherent, inalienable rights]]. The term may also be used to describe personal conduct, as in "behaving with dignity".

== Etymology ==
The English word "dignity", attested from the early 13th century, comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''dignitas'' (worthiness)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
by way of [[French language|French]] ''dignité''.&lt;ref name = "DIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dignity|title=Dignity - Define Dignity at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use ==
English-speakers often use the word "dignity" in proscriptive and cautionary ways: for example, in politics it can be used to critique the treatment of oppressed and [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] groups and peoples, but it has also been applied to cultures and sub-cultures, to religious beliefs and ideals, and even to animals used for food or research.

"Dignity" also has descriptive meanings pertaining to the ''worth'' of human beings. In general, the term has various functions and meanings depending on how the term is used and on the context.&lt;ref name="Shultziner, D. Human Dignity - Functions and Meanings. Global Jurist"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shultziner|first1=Doron|title=Human Dignity - Functions and Meanings|journal=Global Jurist|date=2003|volume=3|issue=3|pages=1–21|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doron_Shultziner/publication/241002874_Human_Dignity_Functions_and_Meanings/links/00b7d522ad17e53070000000.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ordinary modern usage, the word denotes "respect" and "status", and it is often used to suggest that someone is not receiving a proper degree of respect, or even that they are failing to treat themselves with proper self-respect. There is also a long history of special [[philosophical]] use of this term. However, it is rarely defined outright in political, legal, and scientific discussions.  International proclamations have thus far left dignity undefined,&lt;ref&gt;
"Those provisions concerning human dignity have not been authoritatively interpreted or applied by any of the competent, independent, international institutions." Bartha Maria Knoppers, ''Human Dignity and Genetic Heritage: Study Paper'' (Law Reform Commission of Canada, 1991), note, at 23. None of the international proclamations make dignity the rare quality that some commentators say it should be.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Myres S. McDougal, Harold D. Lasswell, and Lung-chu Chen, ''Human Rights and World Public Order: The Basic Policies of an International Law of Human Dignity'' (New Haven: Yale UP, 1980), note, at 376.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and scientific commentators, such as those arguing against genetic research and [[algeny]], cite dignity as a reason but are ambiguous about its application.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Comment added 29 March 2011: I searched through several major libraries including Harvard and the US Library of Congress, and did not find this title&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Aldergrove says dignity means ''the set of attributes that distinguish an intelligent, solemn, sober, healthy, independent, adult homo sapiens (the model adult) from someone else, especially a young child or a lunatic''. J. R. Aldergrove, ''Why We Are Not Obsolete Yet: Genetics, Algeny, and the Future'' (Stentorian: Burnaby, 2000) at 71.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- hiding ref for the moment&lt;ref&gt; Thurber says dignity "has gleamed only now and then and here and there, in lonely splendor, throughout the ages, a hope of the better men, never an achievement of the majority." James Thurber, 'Thinking Ourselves Into Trouble,' pt. 3, ''Collecting Himself: James Thurber on Writing and Writers, Humor and Himself'', Michael J. Rosen ed. (Harper &amp; Row, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

== Violations ==

=== Categories ===
Human dignity can be violated in multiple ways.  The main categories of violations are:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | title=Humiliation, Degradation, Dehumanization: Human Dignity Violated | isbn=9789048196616 | editors=Paulus Kaufmann, Hannes Kuch, Christian Neuhäuser, and Elaine Webster | publisher=Springer }} &lt;!-- Entire book, but especially pages 51–52, 151, 168 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Humiliation]]
Violations of human dignity in terms of humiliation refer to acts that humiliate or diminish the self-worth of a person or a group. Acts of humiliation are context dependent but we normally have an intuitive understanding where such a violation occurs. As Schachter noted, “it has been generally assumed that a violation of human dignity can be recognized even if the abstract term cannot be defined. ‘I know it when I see it even if I cannot tell you what it is’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=Oskar|title=Human dignity as a normative concept|journal=American Journal of International Law|date=1983|volume=77|issue=4|page=849|doi=10.2307/2202536|jstor=2202536}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, etymology of the word “humiliation” has a universal characteristic in the sense that in all languages the word involves “downward spatial orientation” in which “something or someone is pushed down and forcefully held there”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linder|first1=Evelin|title=Making enemies: Humiliation and international conflict|date=2006|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is common in judicial decisions where judges refer to violations of human dignity as injuries to people's self-worth or their self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shultziner|first1=Doron|last2=Rabinovici|first2=Itai|title=Human Dignity, Self-Worth and Humiliation: A Comparative Legal–Psychological Approach|journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=105|doi=10.1037/a0024585}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Instrumentalization or [[objectification]]
This aspect refers to treating a person as an instrument or as means to achieve some other goal. This approach builds on [[Immanuel Kant]]'s moral imperative stipulating that we should treat people as ends or goals in themselves, namely as having ultimate moral worth which should not be instrumentalized.  
* Degradation
Violations of human dignity as degradation refer to acts that degrade the value of human beings. These are acts that, even if done by consent, convey a message that diminishes the importance or value of all human beings. They consist of practices that human beings should not be subjected to, regardless of whether subjective humiliation is involved, such as selling oneself to slavery, or when a state authority deliberately puts prisoners in inhuman living conditions. 
* [[Dehumanization]]
These are acts that strip a person or a group of their human characteristics. It may involve describing or treating them as animals or as a lower type of human beings. This has occurred in genocides such as the Holocaust and in Rwanda where the minority were compared to insects.

Some of the practices that violate human dignity include [[torture]], [[rape]], [[social exclusion]], [[labor exploitation]], [[bonded labor]], and [[slavery]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  &lt;!-- If you add something to this list, please also add a source for it. --&gt;

Both absolute and relative poverty are violations of human dignity, although they also have other significant dimensions, such as social injustice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[Absolute poverty]] is associated with overt exploitation and connected to humiliation (for example, being forced to eat food from other people's garbage), but being dependent upon others to stay alive is a violation of dignity even in the absence of more direct violations. [[Relative poverty]], on the other hand, is a violation because the cumulative experience of not being able to afford the same clothes, entertainment, social events, education, or other features of typical life in that society results in subtle humiliation; social rejection; marginalization; and consequently, a diminished self-respect.

Another example of violation of human dignity, especially for women in developing countries, is lack of [[sanitation]]. Having no access to [[toilet]]s leaves currently about 1 billion people of the world with no choice other than to [[open defecation|defecation in the open]], which has been declared by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations as an affront to personal dignity.&lt;ref&gt;JMP (2014). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2036 Progress on drinking water and sanitation, 2014 Update]. WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP), {{ISBN|978 92 4 150724 0}}, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Human dignity is also violated by the practice of employing people in India for "[[manual scavenging]]" of [[human excreta]] from unsanitary toilets{{snd}}usually by people of a lower [[caste]], and more often by women than men.&lt;ref name="HRW2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/india0814_ForUpload_0.pdf|title=Cleaning Human Waste: "manual scavenging", Caste and Discrimination in India|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further example of violation of human dignity, affecting women mainly in developing countries, is [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).

The movie ''[[The Magic Christian (film)|The Magic Christian]]'' depicts a wealthy man ([[Peter Sellers]]) and his son ([[Ringo Starr]]) who test the limits of dignity by forcing people to perform self-degrading acts for money.  The ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer vs. Dignity]]" has a similar plot.

===Pico della Mirandola===
A philosopher of the Renaissance, [[Mirandola, Giovanni Francesco Pico della|Pico della Mirandola]], granted dignity to ideas and to beings. In his "[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]", he told hostile clerics about the dignity of the liberal arts and about the dignity and the glory of [[angel]]s. His comments implied the dignity of philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Mirandola/|title=Redirection|work=umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This oration is commonly seen as one of the central texts of the [[Renaissance]], intimately tied with the growth of humanist philosophies.&lt;ref name="CrossLamm1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Neal Miller|author2=Robert Carson Lamm|author3=Rudy H.

===Kant===
A philosopher of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (18th century), [[Immanuel Kant]] held that there were things that should not be discussed in terms of value, and that these things could be said to have dignity.  '[[Value (ethics)|Value]]' is necessarily relative, because the value of something depends on a particular observer's judgment of that thing. Things that are ''not'' relative{{snd}}that are ''"ends in themselves"'', in Kant's terminology{{snd}}are by extension beyond all value, and a thing is an ''end in itself'' only if it has a moral dimension; if it represents a choice between right and wrong. In Kant's words: "[[Morality]], and [[human nature|humanity]] as capable of it, is that which alone has dignity."&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals'', trans. by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott (Second Section: Transition From Popular Moral Philosophy To The Metaphysic Of Morals).&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically with respect to human dignity, which his writings brought from relative obscurity in Western philosophy into a focal point for philosophers, Kant held that "free will" is essential; human dignity is related to human agency, the ability of humans to choose their own actions.&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=Phillip Anthony|title=Encyclopedia of political economy|chapter=Human dignity|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-18717-6|page=471}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 June 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortimer Adler and Alan Gewirth===
Philosophers of the late 20th century who have written significant works on the subject of dignity include [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Alan Gewirth]].&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"/&gt; Gewirth's views on human dignity are typically compared and contrasted with Kant's, for like Kant he theorizes that human dignity arises from agency.&lt;ref name="Peil2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Mark D.|chapter=Dignity|editor=Jan Peil|title=Handbook of Economics and Ethics|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-936-2|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeyleveldBrownsword2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beyleveld|first1=Deryck|author2=Roger Brownsword|title=Human dignity in bioethics and biolaw|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-826826-0|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; But while sharing Kant's view that rights arise from dignity, Gewirth focused far more than Kant on the positive obligations that dignity imposed on humans, the moral requirement not only to avoid harming but to actively assist one another in achieving and maintaining a state of "well being".&lt;ref name="Peil2009"/&gt;

Among other topics, including the dignity of labor,&lt;ref name="AdlerWeismann2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adler|first1=Mortimer Jerome|author2=Max Weismann|title=How to think about the great ideas: from the great books of western civilization|date=1 March 2000|publisher=Open Court Publishing|isbn=978-0-8126-9412-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adler extensively explored the question of human equality and equal right to dignity.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|last=Adler |first=Mortimer |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/adler-mortimer_dignity-of-man.html |title=The Dignity of Man and the 21st century |date=1952-10-10 |accessdate=2010-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620172623/http://cooperativeindividualism.org/adler-mortimer_dignity-of-man.html |archivedate=2010-06-20 |df= }}; {{cite book|author=Mortimer Jerome Adler|title=The Difference of Man and the Difference It Makes|year=1993|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8232-1535-5}}, {{cite book|author=Mortimer Jerome Adler|title=Six Great Ideas|date=1 December 1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-82681-3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 June 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adler, the question of whether humans have equal right to dignity is intrinsically bound in the question of whether human beings are truly equal, which itself is bound in the question of whether human beings are a distinct class from all things, including animals, or vary from other things only by degree. Adler wrote that the only sense in which it is true that all human beings are equal is that they are equally distinct from animals.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1997), 165-166.&lt;/ref&gt; "The dignity of man," he said, "is the dignity of the human being as a person—a dignity that is not possessed by things."&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1993), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; To Adler, failure to recognize the distinction challenged the right of humans to equal dignity and equal treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1993), 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1997), 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Dan Egonsson, followed by Roger Wertheimer, argued that while it is conventional for people to equate dignity with 'being human' (Egonsson's 'Standard Attitude', Wertheimer's 'Standard Belief'), people generally also import something other than mere humanness to their idea of dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Egonsson, ''Dimensions of Dignity: The Moral Importance of Being Human'' (Dordrecht, Sweden: Kluwer Academic, 1998) 132,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Wertheimer, "Philosophy on Humanity," in ''Abortion: Pro and Con'', R. L. Perkins ed. (Cambridge, Mass.: Schenkman, 1974) 107-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Egonsson suggested that an entity must be both human and ''alive'' to merit an ascription of dignity, while Wertheimer states "it is not a definitional truth that human beings have human status."

According to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], dignity is opinion of others about our worth and subjective definition of dignity is our fear from this opinion of others.&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer. Essays and Aphorisms&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Philippe-André Rodriguez has argued that human dignity is best understood as an essentially contested concept. As he argues, "it seems that it is this very nature of the concept that has allowed, on the one hand, human rights to receive such international acceptance as a theoretical enterprise and, on the other hand, has led the concept to be constantly challenged by different cultures worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Philippe-André|title=Human dignity as an essentially contested concept|journal=Cambridge Review of International Affairs|date=2015|volume=28|issue=2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Human dignity is a central consideration of [[Christian philosophy]]&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Gal|3:28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|25:35-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] insists the "dignity of the human person is rooted in his or her creation in the image and [[Image of God|likeness]] of [[God]]." "All human beings," says the Church, "in as much as they are created in the image of God, have the dignity of a person." The catechism says, "The right to the exercise of freedom belongs to everyone because it is inseparable from his or her dignity as a human person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/index.htm|title=Vatican|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church's view of human dignity is like Kant's insofar as it springs from human agency and free will,&lt;ref name="Peil2009"/&gt; with the further understanding that free will in turn springs from human creation in the image of God.&lt;ref name="ccc1705"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect1.shtml|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|work=usccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human dignity, or ''kevod ha-beriyot'', is also a central consideration of [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name="WaxmanGinor1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waxman|first1=Mordecai|authorlink1=Mordecai Waxman|author2=Tseviyah Ben-Yosef Ginor|author3=Zvia Ginor|title=Yakar le'Mordecai|date=November 1998|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-632-1|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Talmud]]'' cautions against giving charity publicly rather than in private to avoid offending the dignity of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Sicker2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Sicker|title=The political culture of Judaism|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97257-8|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] in his codification of ''[[Halakha]]'' cautioned judges to preserve the self-respect of people who came before them: "Let not human dignity be light in his eyes; for the respect due to man supersedes a negative rabbinical command".&lt;ref name="Sicker2001"/&gt;

An [[Islam]]ic view of dignity is crystallized in the Quran through the selected biographies of Noah, Abraham, Joseph, David, Moses, Mary, Jesus and others (differing from the narratives in the Bible, which the Quran claims were corrupted). Individuals such as these are presented as role-models of dignity because they did not abandon their self-respect by bowing to social pressures. When faced with the fear of disapproval, poverty, hunger, death etc. these individuals held firm in their sense of right and wrong, which was in-line with Divine ordinances. ''"The right course is that on which one keeps his attitudes, ambitions and requirements subjected to the Divine Laws; and in this way leads a balanced and graceful life. Such a person has grasped the most trustworthy support which will never fail him"'' (Quran 31:22)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_031.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405162608/http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_031.htm |archivedate=2013-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals are given the title of Muhsineen, who faced immense pressures but held firm in their positive actions. God awarded these individuals with authority and status in the land, and this reward is open to anyone who proves themselves worthy: ''"We bestow such honour and position on all those who lead their lives according to Our Laws."'' (Quran 37:80)&lt;ref name="tolueislam.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_037.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405163507/http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_037.htm |archivedate=2013-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who fall into this category are also afforded Divine protection from their mistakes: ''"Therefore We have saved you and your son from this.  We have done so because We keep those who lead their lives according to Divine guidance safe from such mishaps."'' (37:104-105)&lt;ref name="tolueislam.org"/&gt; The Quranic State that Muhammad began in Medinah sought to protect human dignity, since in a Quranic Welfare State individuals are free to work and live without the pressures faced by the threat of poverty, and thus can obey God's Laws as free individuals, contributing as part of a unified brotherhood working towards achieving humanity's full potential. Elaborations on dignity have been made by many scholars of Islam, such as [[Mohammad-Ali Taskhiri]], head of the Islamic Culture and Communications Organization in [[Iran]], in 1994. According to Taskhiri, dignity is a state to which all humans have equal ''potential'', but which can only be actualized by living a life pleasing to the eyes of God.&lt;ref name="HafezKenny2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hafez|first1=Kai|author2=Mary Ann Kenny|title=The Islamic world and the West: an introduction to political cultures and international relations|year=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11651-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in keeping with the 1990 [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]], which states that "True faith is the guarantee for enhancing such [basic human] dignity along the path to human perfection".&lt;ref name="MAYER2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Ann Elizabeth|title=Islam and Human Rights: Tradition and Politics|date=30 August 2006|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-4335-8|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human dignity is considered as Buddhahood in Mahayana Buddhism in which it is rooted in the idea that we are able to choose the path of self-perfection as a human being.&lt;ref name="Buddhism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.org/buddhism/buddhist-concepts/buddhism-and-human-dignity.html|title=Buddhism and Human Dignity|work=sgi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
In the 20th century, dignity became an issue for physicians and medical researchers. It has been invoked in questions of the [[bioethics]] of [[human genetic engineering]], [[human cloning]], and [[end-of-life care]] (particularly in such situations as the [[Terri Schiavo case]], a controversial situation in which life support was withdrawn from a woman diagnosed in a [[persistent vegetative state]]).&lt;ref name="Bernan2008"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Irreducably Religious Character of Human Dignity|last = Gelernter | first= David | editor = Bernan|title=Human Dignity and Bioethics: Essays Commissioned by the President's Council on Bioethics|date=April 2008|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-080071-9|pages=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International bodies===
In June 1964, the [[World Medical Association]] issued the ''[[Declaration of Helsinki]]''. The Declaration says at article 11, "It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, [[integrity]], right to [[autonomy|self-determination]], [[privacy]], and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm Declaration of Helsinki by World Medical Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220183350/http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe]] invoked dignity in its effort to govern the progress of biology and medicine. On 4 April 1997, the Council, at Oviedo, approved the ''[[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine]]''. The convention's preamble contains these statements, among others:
{{quote|Conscious of the accelerating developments in biology and medicine;

Convinced of the need to respect the human being both as an individual and as a member of the human species and recognising the importance of ensuring the dignity of the human being;

Conscious that the misuse of biology and medicine may lead to acts endangering human dignity;

Resolving to take such measures as are necessary to safeguard human dignity and the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual with regard to the application of biology and medicine.}}
The Convention states, "Parties to this Convention shall protect the dignity and identity of all human beings and guarantee everyone, without discrimination, respect for their integrity and other rights and fundamental freedoms with regard to the application of biology and medicine."

In 1998, the United Nations mentioned dignity in the ''UNESCO Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights''. At Article 2, the declaration states, "Everyone has a right to respect for their dignity." At Article 24, the declaration warns that treating a person to remove a genetic defect "could be contrary to human dignity." The ''Commentary'' that accompanies the declaration says that, as a consequence of the possibility of germ-line treatment, "it is the very dignity of the human race which is at stake."

===Canada===
In 1996, the Government of Canada issued a report entitled ''New Reproductive and Genetic Technologies''. The report used "the principles of respect for human life and dignity" as its reason for recommending that various activities associated with genetic research and human reproduction be prohibited. The report said the prohibited activities were "contrary to Canadian values of equality and respect for human life and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2329538&amp;Language=e&amp;Mode=1&amp;File=28|title=House Government Bill - C-47, Second Reading (35-2)|work=parl.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
The Ministry of Health enacted the ''Danish Council Act 1988'', which established the Danish Council of Ethics. The Council advises the Ministry on matters of medicine and genetic research on humans. In 2001, the Council condemned "reproductive cloning because it would violate human dignity, because it could have adverse consequences for the cloned person and because permitting research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos."&lt;ref&gt;Gratton, Brigitte.

===France===
In 1984, France set up the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences (CCNE) to advise the government about the regulation of medical practices and research. In 1986, the CCNE said, "Respect for human dignity must guide both the development of knowledge and the limits or
rules to be observed by research." The CCNE said that research on human embryos must be subject to "the rule of reason" and must have regard for "undefined dignity in its practical consequences."&lt;ref name=avis008&gt;[http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis008.pdf CCNE Opinion no. 8.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113231959/http://ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis008.pdf |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCNE insisted that, in research on human embryos, the ethical principles that should apply are "respecting human dignity" and respecting "the dignity of science."&lt;ref name=avis008/&gt;

===Portugal===
The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its ''Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning'' in 1997. The opinion states, "the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;Gratton, Brigitte. [http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw293.asp ''Survey on the National Regulations in the European Union regarding Research on Human Embryos'' (July 2002), 53.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Sweden's ''The Genetic Integrity Act'' (2006:351), ''The Biobanks in Medical Care Act'' (2002:297), ''Health and Medical Services (Professional Activities) Act'' (1998:531), and ''The Health and Medical Services Act'' (1982:763) all express concern for "the integrity of the individual" or "human dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smer.se/Bazment/266.aspx Swedish statutes.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818061730/http://www.smer.se/Bazment/266.aspx |date=2010-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2008, [[The President's Council on Bioethics]] tried to arrive at a consensus about what dignity meant but failed. Edmund D. Pellegrino, M.D., the Council's Chairman, says in the Letter of Transmittal to the President of The United States, "… there is no universal agreement on the meaning of the term, human dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioethics.gov|title=Home Page - Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues|work=bioethics.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916023939/http://www.bioethics.gov/|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen studied dignity as a basis for international law.&lt;ref&gt;Myres S. McDougal, Harold D. Lasswell, and Lung-chu Chen, ''Human Rights and World Public Order: The Basic Policies of an International Law of Human Dignity'' (New Haven: Yale UP, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; They said that using dignity as the basis for laws was a "[[natural law]] approach."&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The natural law approach, they said, depends upon "exercises of faith."&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 69.&lt;/ref&gt; McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen observed:&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The abiding difficulty with the natural law approach is that its assumptions, intellectual procedures, and modalities of justification can be employed equally by the proponents of human dignity and the proponents of human indignity in support of diametrically opposed empirical specifications of rights . . . .}}

===Canada===
In 2004, Canada enacted the ''[[Assisted Human Reproduction Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/A-13.4///en|title=Page not Found - Page non trouvé|date=5 June 2011|website=archive.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063723/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/A-13.4///en|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2(b) of the Act states, "the benefits of assisted human reproductive technologies and related research for individuals, for families and for society in general can be most effectively secured by taking appropriate measures for the protection and promotion of human health, safety, dignity and rights in the use of these technologies and in related research." The Act prescribes a fine not exceeding $500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both, if someone undertakes a proscribed activity such as the creation of a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]].

=== European Union ===

Article 1 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms the inviolability of human dignity.

===France===
In 1997, the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences, as well as other observers, noted that France's dignity-based laws on bio-medical research were paradoxical. The law prohibited the willful destruction of human embryos but directed that human embryos could be destroyed if they were more than five years old.&lt;ref name=avis053&gt;[http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis053.pdf CCNE Opinion no. 053.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113231600/http://ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis053.pdf |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibited research on human embryos created in France but permitted research on human embryos brought to France.&lt;ref name=avis053/&gt; The law prohibited researchers from creating embryos for research but allowed researchers to experiment with embryos that were superfluous after ''in vitro'' fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Cazeau, Bernard. {{fr icon}} [http://www.senat.fr/senfic/cazeau_bernard98029w.html Senat.fr] Retrieved 2009-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Human dignity is the fundamental principle of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]. Article 1, paragraph 1 reads: ''"Human dignity is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." ''Human dignity is thus mentioned even before the [[right to life]]. This has a significant impact on German law-making and jurisdiction in both serious and trivial items:

*Human dignity is the basis of § 131 [[StGB]], which prohibits the depiction of cruelty against humans in an approving way. § 131 has been used to confiscate [[horror movies]] and to ban [[video game]]s like ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' and the ''[[Mortal Kombat (series)|Mortal Kombat]]'' series.

Today, a prisoner serving a life term can be granted parole on good behavior as early as 15 years after being incarcerated, provided that his release is held to constitute little danger to the public. Note that persons deemed still dangerous can be incarcerated indefinitely on a life term, if this judgment is regularly reaffirmed.

===Iran===
The need to respect human dignity has been written in the Iranian constitution law. Article 2 of the Iranian Constitution Law mentions six principles and infrastructures as basic to the governing system which in Article 1 is called the Islamic Republic of Iran. The sixth principle of this Article concerns human dignity and stipulates that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is a system founded on faith in ….6) Human dignity and high value and his/her freedom as well as his responsibility before God”[3]. Besides, in the prelude to the Constitution, human dignity is referred to concerning the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Salehi, Hamid Reza. Human Dignity From the Viewpoint of Iranian Law, Journal of Bioethical Inquiry, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2013, 135-136. DOI:10.1007/s11673-013-9437-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The [[Constitution of South Africa]] lists ''"human dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms"'' as one of the founding values of the South African state, and the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]] is described as affirming the ''"democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom"''. Section 10 of the Constitution explicitly states that ''"Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected."'' In jurisprudence, the right to dignity is often seen as underlying more specific rights, such as equality, security of the person or privacy, but it has been directly applied in a number of cases relating to [[criminal punishment]], the law of [[defamation]], and the right to marriage and family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Iain |last1=Currie |first2=Johan |last2=de Waal |title=The Bill of Rights Handbook |edition=5th |year=2005 |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta |isbn=978-0-7021-5923-7 |chapter=Chapter Ten: Human dignity |pages=272–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
The [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] provides in article 7 that "Human dignity must be respected and protected."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/101/a7.html Official translation] of art. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides, in art. 120, that the state must "take account of the dignity of living beings as well as the safety of human beings, animals and the environment" when legislating on the use of reproductive and genetic material;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/101/a120.html Official translation] of art. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; consequently the Federal Ethics Commission on Non-Human Biotechnology (ECNH) issued, in 2008, a publication entitled "The dignity of living beings with regard to plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekah.admin.ch/fileadmin/ekah-dateien/dokumentation/publikationen/e-Broschure-Wurde-Pflanze-2008.pdf|title=English language publication|website=admin.ch|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EqualJusticeUnderLaw.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The front of the Supreme Court Building, including the West Pediment.]]
'''Equal justice under law''' is a phrase engraved on the front of the [[United States Supreme Court building]] in [[Washington D.C.]]  It is also a societal ideal that has influenced [[Law of the United States|the American legal system]].

The phrase was proposed by the building's architects, and then approved by judges of the Court in 1932.  It is based upon [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] jurisprudence, and has historical antecedents dating back to [[ancient Greece]].

==Proposed by architects and approved by justices==
[[File:Van Devanter and Hughes.jpg|thumb|right|Justice Van Devanter (left) and Chief Justice Hughes]]This phrase was suggested in 1932 by the architectural firm that designed the building.&lt;ref&gt;Pusey, Merlo.  ''Charles Evans Hughes'', Volume 2,  p. 689 (Columbia University Press 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and Justice [[Willis Van Devanter]] subsequently approved this inscription, as did the United States Supreme Court Building Commission which Hughes chaired (and on which Van Devanter served).&lt;ref&gt;[{{SCOTUS URL|about/westpediment.pdf}}  West Pediment Information Sheet] via U.S. Supreme Court web site.  At that time, the other members of the Commission were Senator [[Henry W. Keyes]], Senator [[James A. Reed]], Representative [[Richard N. Elliott]], Representative [[Fritz G. Lanham]], and Architect of the Capitol [[David Lynn (architect)|David Lynn]].  See Liu, Honxia.  "[http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr40_3and4/CR40-3Liu.pdf Court Gazing: Features of Diversity in the Supreme Court Building]", ''Court Review'' (Winter 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt;

The architectural firm that proposed the phrase was headed by [[Cass Gilbert]], though Gilbert himself was much more interested in design and arrangement, than in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, Priscilla.  "A Closer Look at the Bronze Courtroom Gates", ''Supreme Court Quarterly'', Vol. 9, p. 8 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, according to [[David Lynn (architect)|David Lynn]] who at that time held the position of [[Architect of the Capitol]], the two people at Gilbert's firm who were responsible for the slogan "equal justice under law" were Gilbert's son (Cass Gilbert, Jr.) and Gilbert's partner, John R. Rockart.&lt;ref name=slogan&gt;McGurn, Barrett.  "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130226111758/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/wp-content/themes/supremecourthistory/inc/schs_publications-1982.pdf Slogans to Fit the Occasion]", pp. 170-174, ''United States Supreme Court Yearbook'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the journalist [[Herbert Bayard Swope]] objected to Chief Justice Hughes about this inscription, urging that the word "equal" be removed because such a "qualification" renders the phrase too narrow; the equality principle would still be implied without that word, Swope said.  Hughes refused, writing that it was appropriate to "place a strong emphasis upon impartiality".&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt;

This legal soundbite atop the Court is perceived differently by different people, sometimes as ostentatious, often as profound, and occasionally as vacuous.&lt;ref name=Chen /&gt; According to law professor [[Jim Chen]], it is common for people to "suggest that disagreement with some contestable legal proposition or another would be tantamount to chiseling or sandblasting 'Equal Justice Under Law' from the Supreme Court's portico."&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;Chen, Jim.  "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=773025 Come Back to the Nickel and Five: Tracing the Warren Court's Pursuit of Equal Justice Under Law]", ''Washington and Lee Law Review'', Vol. 59, pp. 1305-1306 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase may be perceived in a variety of ways, but it very distinctly does not say "equal law under justice", which would have meant that the judiciary can prioritize justice over law.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Milner. ''Lying Down Together: Law, Metaphor and Theology'', p. 23 (Univ. of Wisconsin Press 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Based upon Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence==
The words "equal justice under law" paraphrase an earlier expression coined in 1891 by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Cabraser&gt;Cabraser, Elizabeth.  "The Essentials of Democratic Mass Litigation", ''Columbia Journal of Law &amp; Social Problems'', Vol. 45, p. 499, 500 (Summer 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peccarelli, Anthony.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203153539/http://www.dcba.org/brief/marissue/2000/art10300.htm "The Meaning of Justice"], ''DuPage County Bar Association Brief'' (March 2000), via Archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of ''Caldwell v. Texas'', Chief Justice [[Melville Fuller]] wrote on behalf of a unanimous Court as follows, regarding the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]: "the powers of the States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited, but no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law."&lt;ref&gt;''Caldwell v. Texas'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/137/692/case.html 137 U.S. 692] (1891).&lt;/ref&gt;  The last seven words are summarized by the inscription on the U.S. Supreme Court building.&lt;ref name=Cabraser /&gt;

[[File:The Fuller Court.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Chief Justice Fuller (front center) wrote for a unanimous Court in ''Caldwell''.  In this 1899 photo, Justice Harlan is seated to his right, and Justice Peckham is standing to Harlan's right.]]Later in 1891, Fuller's opinion for the Court in ''Leeper v. Texas'' again referred to "equal...justice under...law".&lt;ref name=Leeper&gt;''Leeper v. Texas'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=9HoYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;ots=bAWQjPsX_q&amp;dq=%22borders+are+not+limited,+except+that+no+State+can+deprive+particular+%22&amp;output=html 139 U.S. 462] (1891).  Fuller's opinion in ''Leeper'' stated: "It must be regarded as settled that....by the Fourteenth Amendment the powers of States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited, except that no State can deprive particular persons, or classes of persons, of equal and impartial justice under the law; that law in its regular course of administration through courts of justice is due process, and when secured by the law of the State the constitutional requirement is satisfied; and that due process is so secured by laws operating on all alike, and not subjecting the individual to the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government unrestrained by the established principles of private right and distributive justice."&lt;/ref&gt;  Like ''Caldwell'', the ''Leeper'' opinion was unanimous, in contrast to the Fuller Court's major disagreements about equality issues in other cases such as ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aside from Fuller, the members of the Court in 1891 were as follows: [[Joseph P. Bradley]], [[Stephen Johnson Field]], [[John Marshall Harlan]], [[Horace Gray]], [[Samuel Blatchford]], [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II|Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar]], [[David Josiah Brewer]], and [[Henry Billings Brown]].   The Fuller Court most famously disagreed about equality issues in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', 163 U.S. 537 (1896).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In both ''Caldwell'' and ''Leeper'', murder [[indictment]]s were challenged because they allegedly gave inadequate notice of the crimes being charged.  The Court upheld the indictments because they followed the form required by Texas law.&lt;Ref&gt;Stuntz, William.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nEHgwemq0nYC&amp;pg=PA124 The Collapse of American Criminal Justice]'', p. 124 (Harvard U. Press 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In a case nine years later (''[[Maxwell v. Dow]]''), the Court quoted the "equal...justice under...law" phrase that it had used in ''Caldwell'' and ''Leeper'', to make the point that Utah could devise its own criminal procedure, as long as defendants are "proceeded against by the same kind of procedure and ... have the same kind of trial, and the equal protection of the laws is secured to them."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Maxwell v. Dow]]'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/176/581/case.html 176 U.S. 581] (1900); Justice Peckham wrote the Court's opinion, and Justice Harlan was the sole dissenter.  Harlan argued that a person cannot be tried for an infamous crime by a jury of less than twelve persons, instead of the eight jurors allowed in Utah.  Many years later, in ''[[Williams v. Florida]]'', 399 U.S. 78 (1970), the Court held that six jurors are enough.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1908 case of ''Ughbanks v. Armstrong'', the Fuller Court yet again discussed the Fourteenth Amendment in similar terms, but this time mentioning punishments:  "The last-named Amendment was not intended to, and does not, limit the powers of a State in dealing with crime committed within its own borders or with the punishment thereof, although no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law."&lt;ref&gt;''Ughbanks v. Armstrong'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/208/481/case.html 208 U.S. 481] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Ughbanks''  was a [[burglary]] case, and the opinion was written for the Court by Justice [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham|Rufus Peckham]], while Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] was the sole dissenter.  The Court would later reject the idea that the Fourteenth Amendment does not limit punishments (see the 1962 case of ''[[Robinson v. California]]'').  

In the years since moving into their present building, the Supreme Court has often connected the words "equal justice under law" with the Fourteenth Amendment.  For example, in the 1958 case of ''[[Cooper v. Aaron]]'', the Court said: "The Constitution created a government dedicated to equal justice under law. The Fourteenth Amendment embodied and emphasized that ideal."&lt;ref&gt;''Cooper v. Aaron'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/358/1/case.html 358 U.S. 1] (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Raneta and Kelly, Michael.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vsTP_KhsulsC&amp;pg=PT36 Equal Justice in the Balance: America's Legal Responses to the Emerging Terrorist Threat]'', p. 16 (U. Mich. Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  

The words "equal justice under law" are not in [[United States Constitution|the Constitution]], which instead says that no state shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gq-pOED4TSUC&amp;pg=PT145 Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR's Great Supreme Court Justices]'', p. 145 (Hachette Digital  2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  From an architectural perspective, the main advantage of the former over the latter was brevity — the [[Equal Protection Clause]] was not short enough to fit on the [[pediment]] given the size of the letters to be used.

==Following ancient tradition==
[[Image:Pericles3.JPG|thumb|right|Pericles, Greek statesman and general]]In [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|the funeral oration]] that he delivered in 431 BC, the [[Athens|Athenian]] leader [[Pericles]] encouraged belief in what we now call equal justice under law.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, George.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cC06AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA171 Law for the Public Speaker: Legal Aspects of Public Address]'', p. 171 (Christopher Pub. House, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, when  Chief Justice Fuller wrote his opinion in ''Caldwell v. Texas'', he was by no means the first to discuss this concept.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/case.html 118 U.S. 356] (1886):  "Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution."&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several different English translations of the relevant passage in Pericles' funeral oration.  

Here is Pericles discussing "equal justice" according to the English translation by Richard Crawley in 1874:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/plpwr10.txt The History of the Peloponnesian War]'', Written 431 B.C.E, Translated by Richard Crawley (1874), retrieved via Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The English translation by [[Benjamin Jowett]] in 1881 likewise had Pericles saying: "the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes".&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, Benjamin. ''[http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/thucydides/jthucbk2rv2.htm Thucydides, translated into English, to which is prefixed an essay on inscriptions and a note on the geography of Thucydides,]'' Second edition, Oxford, Clarendon Press (1900): "Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. We do not copy our neighbours, but are an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But while the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognised; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit. Neither is poverty a bar, but a man may benefit his country whatever be the obscurity of his condition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  And, the English translation by [[Rex Warner]] in 1954 had Pericles saying: "there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes".&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Pericles's Funeral Oration|Pericles's Funeral Oration]]'', translated by Rex Warner (1954), via wikisource: "Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. Our government does not copy our neighbors', but is an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But while there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognized; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit. Neither is poverty an obstacle, but a man may benefit his country whatever the obscurity of his condition."&lt;/ref&gt;  The funeral oration by Pericles was published in [[Thucydides]]’ ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', of which there are [[History of the Peloponnesian War#Translations|several other English translations]].  

As quoted above, Pericles said that a person's wealth or prominence should not influence his eligibility for public employment or affect the justice he receives.  Similarly, Chief Justice Hughes defended the inscription "equal justice under law" by referring to the judicial [[oath of office]], which requires judges to "administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich".&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt; Decades later, Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] made a similar point: "The principles which would have governed with $10,000 at stake should also govern when thousands have become billions. That is the essence of equal justice under law."&lt;ref&gt;''Pennzoil v. Texaco'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/481/1/case.html 481 U.S. 1] (1987)(Thurgood Marshall, concurring in the judgment).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-04-11/news/8701270894_1_texas-courts-texaco-federal-court How To Handle A Texas-sized Lawsuit]", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' (April 11, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freemen-on-the-land''' (also '''freemen-of-the-land''', the '''freemen movement''' or simply '''freemen''') are a loose group of individuals who believe that they are bound by [[statute law]]s only if they consent to those laws. They believe that they can therefore declare themselves independent of the government and the [[rule of law]], holding that the only "true" law is their own interpretation of "[[common law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Freemen movement captures Canadian police attention |last=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/freemen-movement-captures-canadian-police-attention-1.1262159 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date= 29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief has been described as a [[conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Freemen of the dangerous nonsense|url = http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2011/11/15/freemen-of-the-dangerous-nonsense/|website = UK Human Rights Blog|accessdate = 9 December 2015|first = Adam|last = Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freemen are active in [[English-speaking countries]]: the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, the United States, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Stocked, [http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/the-seriously-weird-beliefs-of-freemen-on-the-land/news-story/cd91441f8f406a48457d5450b0a264f9 The seriously weird beliefs of Freemen on the land], ''[[news.com.au]]'', 9 July 2016.

In the Canadian court case ''Meads v. Meads'', [[Alberta Court of Queen's Bench]] Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke used the phrase "Organised Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA) to describe the techniques and arguments used by freemen in court, describing them as frivolous and [[vexatious litigation|vexatious]].&lt;ref name="Wittmeier"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|title=Edmonton divorce case prompts justice to dissect "pseudolegal" arguments|last=Wittmeier|first=B|date=27 September 2012|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003034131/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|archivedate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ablawg.ca/2012/10/30/the-organized-pseudolegal-commercial-argument-opca-litigant-case/ University of Calgary Faculty of Law]&lt;br&gt;- [http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/O/OrganizedPseudolegalCommercialArgumentLitigant.aspx Duhaime]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meads-canlii /&gt; There is no recorded instance of freeman tactics being upheld in a court of law.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt |title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems |last1=Bizzle |first1=Legal |date=18 November 2011 |website=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; In refuting each of the arguments used by Meads, Rooke concluded that "a decade of reported cases, many of which he refers to in his ruling, have failed to prove a single concept advanced by OPCA litigants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/4463/The-scourge-of-unrepresented-litigants.html ''Canadian Lawyer'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Freemen believe that statute law is a contract, and that individuals can therefore opt out of statute law, choosing instead to live under what they call "common" (case) and "natural" laws. They believe natural laws require only that individuals do not harm others, do not damage the property of others, and do not use "fraud or mischief" in contracts. They say that all people have two parts to their existence: their body and their legal "person". The latter is represented by the individual's birth certificate; some freemen claim that it is entirely limited to the birth certificate. Under this theory, a "[[Strawman theory|strawman]]" is created when a birth certificate is issued, and this "strawman" is the entity who is subject to statutory law. The physical self is referred to by a slightly different name, such as "John of the family Smith" instead of "John Smith".&lt;ref name="Benchmark"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131216185721/http://judiciary.sut1.co.uk/docs/benchmark/benchmark_feb2012.pdf "Nonsense or loophole?"], ''Benchmark'', Issue 57, February 2012, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Many freemen beliefs are based on idiosyncratic interpretations of [[Admiralty law|admiralty or maritime law]], which the freemen claim govern the commercial world. These beliefs stem from fringe interpretations of various nautical-sounding words, such as ownership, citizenship, dock, or birth (berth) certificate. Freemen refer to the court as a "ship", the court's occupants as "passengers" and may claim that those leaving are "men overboard".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will try to claim common law (as opposed to admiralty law) jurisdiction by asking "Do you have a claim against me?" This, they contend, removes their consent to be governed by admiralty law and turns the court into a common law court, so that proceedings would have to go forward according to their version of common law. This procedure has never been successfully used.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will often not accept legal representation, believing that to do so would mean contracting with the state. They believe that the United Kingdom and Canada are now operating in bankruptcy and are therefore under admiralty law. They believe that since the abolition of the gold standard, UK currency is backed not by gold but by the people (or the "legal fiction of their persons"). They describe persons as creditors of the UK corporation. Therefore, a court is a place of business, and a summons is an invitation to discuss the matter at hand, with no powers to require attendance or compliance.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; They may believe that the government controls secret bank accounts in their name as part of this theory, which may be accessed to pay off debts.

None of the beliefs held by freemen have ever been supported by any judgments or verdicts in any criminal or civil court cases anywhere.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; An [[England and Wales|English]] solicitor, writing anonymously, commented:

{{quote|[This] strategy might give lenders pause, of course, because litigating against awkward characters isn't much fun. But given how flimsy the freeman legal arguments are, the pause needn't be long. I've seen a transcript of a hearing in which a debtor tried to rely on the freeman defence. It was over as soon as the judge asked (I can imagine the withering tone), ''"Are you planning to persist in this defence, Mr Jones?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anonymous|title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 June 2015}} Note: Author name withheld by request; a solicitor of England and Wales; wrote with permission pseudonymously as "Legal Bizzle"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Contracts ==
Freemen believe that since they exist in a common law [[jurisdiction]] where equality is paramount and mandatory, the people in the government and courts are not above the law, and that government and court personnel therefore must obtain the [[consent of the governed]]. Freemen believe that government employees who do not obtain consent of the governed have abandoned the rule of law. They believe this consent is routinely secured by way of people submitting applications and through acts of registration. They believe the public servants have deceived the population into abandoning their status as freemen in exchange for the status of a "child of the province" or "ward of the state", allowing those children to collect benefits such as welfare, unemployment insurance, and pension plans or old age security.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Freemen believe that the government has to establish "joinder" to link oneself and one's legal person. If one is asked whether one is "John Smith" and one says that is so, one has established joinder and connected the physical and human persons. The next step is to obtain consent. Statutes are merely invitations to enter a contract, and are only legally enforceable if one enters into the contract consensually. Otherwise, statute laws are not applicable. Freemen believe that the government is constantly trying to trick people into entering into a contract with them, so they often return bills, notices, summons and so on with the message "No contract—return to sender".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

A "notice of understanding and intent and claim of right" is a document used by freemen to declare their sovereignty. The signed document, often [[notarised]], is sent to the Queen and possibly other authorities such as the Prime Minister and police chiefs. It usually begins with the words "Whereas it is my understanding" and goes on to state their understanding of the law and their lack of consent to it.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen's beliefs are based on misunderstandings and wishful thinking and have not been successful in any courts anywhere.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

== Court cases ==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Meads v. Meads]] --&gt;
*Dennis Larry Meads of [[Edmonton]], Alberta, stormed out of a hearing in the [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta]] on 8 June 2012, related to his divorce and matrimonial property case. In response, Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke wrote a lengthy and comprehensive 185-page judgment rejecting various freemen claims, grouping them with other pseudolegal arguments as "Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA), specifically, in this case, Meads' freeman on the land claims, arguments and documents, saying that:&lt;ref name="Wittmeier" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The bluntly idiotic substance of Mr. Mead's argument explains the unnecessarily complicated manner in which it was presented. OPCA arguments are never sold to their customers as simple ideas, but instead are byzantine schemes which more closely resemble the plot of a dark fantasy novel than anything else. Latin maxims and powerful sounding language are often used. Documents are often ornamented with many strange markings and seals. Litigants engage in peculiar, ritual‑like in court conduct. All these features appear necessary for gurus to market OPCA schemes to their often desperate, ill‑informed, mentally disturbed, or legally abusive customers. This is crucial to understand the non-substance of any OPCA concept or strategy. The story and process of a OPCA scheme is not intended to impress or convince the Courts, ''but rather to impress the guru's customer''.&lt;ref name="meads-canlii"&gt;''[http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html Meads v. Meads, 2012 ABQB 571]''(CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 18 September 2012, para. 77&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;[emphasis in original]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:In a subsequent ruling on another OPCA case, ''Gauthier v. Starr 2016 ABQB 213'', Justice Rooke noted that, following the ruling, Meads had abandoned OPCA strategies and concluded the litigation in an orderly fashion.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.is/20160419203650/http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2016/2016abqb213/2016abqb213.html Gauthier v Starr, 2016 ABQB 213]''  (CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 14 April 2016, para. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* Elizabeth Watson came to public attention in 2011 as a self-styled legal adviser for Victoria Haigh in a (child) custody case; she was given a nine-month [[prison sentence]] for [[contempt of court]] (later suspended). She had defaced court documents by writing the words "no contract" and otherwise refused to accept or acknowledge the authority of a court of law, by amongst other things refusing to respond to the written legal notices or other correspondences from the court, and styled and addressed herself and Haigh in the irregular fashion as "Elizabeth of the Watson family" and "Victoria of the Haigh family" respectively, instead of their names in the normal and usual mode of rendering.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2011/B15.html# Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council and Elizabeth Watson and Victoria Haigh]'', Royal Courts of Justice, 22 August 2011, [2011] 3 FCR 422, [2011] Fam Law 1194, [2011] EWHC B15 (Fam)&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/local/investigator_jailed_for_report_as_court_contempt_compromised_well_being_of_child_1_3706219# "‘Investigator’ jailed for report as court contempt compromised well-being of child"], ''The Star'' (Sheffield), 24 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mark Bond of [[Norfolk]], England, was arrested in 2010 for non-payment of tax, despite handing police a "notice of intent" stating that he was no longer a UK citizen. He told police that the notice had already been delivered to the Queen and the prime minister. He told the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', "Today I asked the judge to walk into the court under common law and not commercial law. If I had entered under commercial law it would prove that I accepted its law. I was denied my rights to go in there." He was sentenced to three months custody, suspended on condition that he pay off the debt at £20 a week.&lt;ref&gt;David Bale, [http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/news/norfolk_tax_dodger_arrested_after_writing_to_queen_1_745681 "Norfolk tax dodger arrested... after writing to Queen"], ''Norwich Evening News'', 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bobby Sludds appeared in court in [[County Wexford]] in Ireland, charged with various motoring offences including two counts of no insurance. Before the police began to give evidence, the accused handed in a letter stating he was not Mr. Sludds but Bobby of the family Sludds and questioning the use of the word 'person' in the charge. He was given two suspended sentences and a fine of €670. (He had 24 previous convictions for motoring offences.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wexfordpeople.ie/news/bobby-of-the-family-sludds-may-be-jailed-2878029.html "'Bobby of the family Sludds' may be jailed"], ''Wexford People'', 14 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wilfred Keith Thompson and two others were arrested by police in [[Guelph]], Ontario, Canada, charged with breaking, entering and theft as well as firearms offences. Thompson had previously made headlines for informing City Hall, local police, Guelph MP [[Frank Valeriote]], Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and other officials he is "an autonomous being not controlled by others". One of his co-defendants, Trevor "Red" De Block, refused to identify himself to the court, though it was said that his criminal mug shot, computer records, tattoos and other information confirmed his identity. "I object," De Block said, adding that he was not the "rightful owner" of his name, but refusing to clarify or participate in legal proceedings. "I don't bow down to bail .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to false gods," he said, and rejected assistance from the appointed lawyer. Thompson and De Block were denied bail.&lt;ref&gt;Vik Kirsch, [https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/2778969-security-tight-as-suspects-in-guelph-break-in-case-appear-in-bail-court/ "Security tight as suspects in Guelph break-in case appear in bail court"], ''Guelph Mercury'', 5 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dean Marshall of [[Preston, East Riding of Yorkshire|Preston]], [[Holderness]], near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Yorkshire]], England, was taken to court after he was found to be growing 26 [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] plants in his garden shed. Claiming he was a freeman on the land and therefore not guilty, he then attempted to call up [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and (the prime minister) [[David Cameron]] as his witnesses, although he was told that neither was available to attend. A jury at Hull [[Crown Court]] dismissed his claims and convicted him of conspiracy to produce cannabis for which he was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended upon entering into a good behaviour bond for two years, and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html "Cannabis-grower tried to call Queen and Prime Minister as witnesses in 'bizarre' trial"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817235748/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html |date=17 August 2012 }}, ''Hull Daily Mail'', 16 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doug Jones of [[Pembroke Dock]], Pembrokeshire, Wales, spent 22 days in prison after refusing to take a breath test. Jones questioned the authority and jurisdiction of the court, asking to see the judge's 'Oath of Office' which resulted in a sentence of fourteen days for [[contempt of court]]. He was sentenced to a further seven days after failing to attend a second hearing, but pleaded guilty to the original charges, receiving [[List of UK driving licence endorsements|an endorsement on his driving licence]]. His interest in the freemen on the land movement started after watching documentaries on conspiracy theories surrounding the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]].  His solicitor, Phillipa Ashworth, stated "On this occasion, in hindsight he appreciates it was not the time to test out philosophical theories behind this approach to life, and in hindsight it isn't something he would do again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/9918044.Jail_for_man_who_refused__to_be_governed_/?ref=rss "Magna Carta beliefs lead to 22 days jail for Pembrokeshire businessman who refused 'to be governed'"], ''Western Telegraph'', 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gavin Kaylhem of [[Grimsby]], [[North East Lincolnshire]], England, wilfully refused to pay his [[council tax]] debts of £1,268.54 accrued between 2001 and 2008 and was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. He had claimed that he was a "freeman" and thus had no contractual duty under common law to pay. He refused to co-operate with [[Magistrates of England and Wales|magistrates]]' questions.&lt;ref&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council, [http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ "Council tax evader jailed for 30 days"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211022928/http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ |date=11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mandeep Sandhu of [[Tividale]], [[Sandwell]], West Midlands, was stopped by police while driving a car that was insured to a woman. He refused to give his details to the officers, saying that to do so would mean "entering into a contract he could not afford to fulfil". He refused to co-operate at the police station and when brought before Sandwell Magistrates' Court, in October 2015, Sandhu was convicted of driving without insurance and obstructing police and was also found in contempt of court. He was sentenced to 14 days in prison for the contempt, and ordered to pay £330 in fines for the insurance charge with court costs and had 6 points added to his licence. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/freeman-land-driver-jailed-contempt-10253089|title='Freeman-of-the-Land' driver jailed for contempt of court|work=The Birmingham Mail|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;- {{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2015/10/13/freeman-driver-who-refused-to-talk-to-police-jailed/|title='Freeman' driver who refused to talk to police jailed|work=Express &amp; Star|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole process meant that a simple matter of driving without insurance took up hours of police time – and ultimately a stint behind bars after being convicted of contempt of court while defending himself. We hope this case acts as a warning that to obstruct the police and the courts is not a wise move.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Errol Denton, a [[live blood analysis]] practitioner, was charged with offences under the [[Cancer Act 1939]]. At Westminster Magistrates' Court, he used a freeman defence. Since both the prosecution and the defence were rare, it was reported in the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/freeman-on-the-land-causes-chaos-in-court-1-3715573 "‘Freeman on the land’ causes chaos in court"], ''Edinburgh Evening News'', 11 March 2015&lt;br /&gt;- [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10510345/Harley-Street-practitioner-claimed-he-could-cure-cancer-and-HIV-with-lifestyle-changes-and-herbs-court-hears.html "Harley Street practitioner claimed he could cure cancer and HIV with lifestyle changes and herbs, court hears"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 11 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2014 he was convicted on all nine counts and fined £9,000 plus around £10,000 in costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/10732023/Duped-by-the-blood-analyst-who-says-he-can-cure-cancer.html |title=Duped by the 'blood analyst' who says he can cure cancer |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 March 2014 |first=Robert |last=Mendick |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402094151/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/10732023/Duped-by-the-blood-analyst-who-says-he-can-cure-cancer.html |archivedate=2 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;br&gt;- [https://web.archive.org/web/20140321025146/http://www.edp24.co.uk/mobile/news/crime/woodford_green_harley_street_worker_handed_19k_court_bill_after_claiming_he_could_cure_cancer_and_hiv_with_lifestyle_changes_1_3459178 "Woodford Green Harley Street worker handed 19k court bill after claiming he could cure cancer and HIV with lifestyle change"], ''Eastern Daily Press'', 20 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyers and notaries in [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]], Canada, have been warned by their professional bodies about dealing with freemen as clients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calgarysun.com/2013/09/28/law-society-of-alberta-issues-warning-to-lawyers-after-bizarre-calgary-freeman-on-the-land-case-resolved/ "Law Society of Alberta issues warning to lawyers after bizarre Calgary 'Freeman on the Land" case resolved"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417062013/http://www.calgarysun.com/2013/09/28/law-society-of-alberta-issues-warning-to-lawyers-after-bizarre-calgary-freeman-on-the-land-case-resolved/ |date=17 April 2015 }}, ''Calgary Sun'', 28 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, lawyers have been advised to be careful not to stamp or notarise the pseudo-legal documents that freemen typically use, so as not to create a perception of authority for such documents.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Society of British Columbia: [http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=2627 ''Practice Tips: The Freeman-on-the-Land movement''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417061546/http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=2627 |date=17 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. police, both speaking personally and as official guidance, have provided advice to law enforcement on dealing with the similar [[sovereign citizen movement]]. These have noted the need for caution after a case in which two policemen were murdered by a "sovereign citizen" during a traffic stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finch &amp; Flowers|title=Sovereign Citizens: A Clear and Present Danger|url=http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2012/09/sovereign-citizens-a-clear-and-present-danger.aspx|website=Police Magazine|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Moe|title=10 tips and tactics for investigating Sovereign Citizens|url=http://www.policeone.com/investigations/articles/6176998-10-tips-and-tactics-for-investigating-Sovereign-Citizens/|website=PoliceOne|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judicial interpretation}}
The '''golden rule''' in [[English law]] is one of the rules of [[statutory interpretation|statutory construction]] traditionally applied by English courts. The rule can be used to avoid the consequences of a [[plain meaning rule|literal interpretation]] of the wording of a statute when such an interpretation would lead to a manifest absurdity or to a result that is obnoxious to principles of [[public policy]]. The rule can be applied in two different ways, named respectively the ''narrower approach'' and the ''wider approach''.

==History==

In ''Becke v Smith'' (1836) [[James Parke, 1st Baron Wensleydale|Justice Parke]] (later Lord Wensleydale) stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a very useful rule in the construction of a [[statute]] to adhere to the ordinary meaning of the words used, and to the grammatical construction, unless that is at variance with the intention of the [[legislature]] to be collected from the statute itself, or leads to any manifest absurdity or repugnance, in which case the language may be varied or modified so as to avoid such inconvenience but no further.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Twenty years later, Lord Wensleydale restated the rule in different words in ''Grey v. Pearson'' (1857):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]n construing statutes, and all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as to avoid that absurdity or inconsistency, but not farther.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Narrower approach== 

The rule may be applied in the narrower sense where there is some ambiguity or absurdity in the words themselves.&lt;ref name="LawMentor"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lawmentor.co.uk/glossary/G/golden-rule/ |title= 
 Golden rule  |website=LawMentor |access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the leading case of ''R v Allen ''(1872) the defendant was charged with [[bigamy]] under Section 57 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] which made it an offence to marry whilst one's spouse is still alive and not divorced.  The court held that the word 'marry' could not in that context mean 
'become legally married' since that could never apply to someone who is already married to someone else. To make sense of the provision, the word should be interpreted as meaning to 'go through a second ceremony of marriage'.&lt;ref name="LawMentor"/&gt;

==Wider approach==   
In its wider sense the rule may be used to avoid a result that is obnoxious to principles of [[public policy]], even where words may prima facie carry only one meaning. 

The rule was applied in this sense in ''In re Sigsworth''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=ICLR Case Reports: High Court Chancery Division. 1935 Vol. 1|publisher=The Incorporated Council for Law Reporting for England and Wales|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1935) in the context of the [[Administration of Estates Act 1925]].  A man had murdered his mother and then committed suicide. Under the plain terms of section 46, as the woman had died [[intestacy|intestate]] her son stood to inherit substantially her entire estate, which would then have passed to his descendants. This was challenged by other members of the woman's family. The court used the golden rule to find in favour of the family, preventing the son's descendants as a matter of public policy from profiting from his crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ox.libguides.com/content.php?pid=141334&amp;sid=1205598|publisher=Oxford University - UK Law guide|title=Unlocking UK case citations|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sharon Hanson|title=Legal Method, Skills and Reasoning|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-45851-1|year=2009|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule as applied in that particular case has subsequently been put onto a statutory footing in the [[Forfeiture Act 1982]] and the [[Estates of Deceased Persons (Forfeiture Rule and Law of Succession) Act 2011]].

The leading case on the wider approach is ''Adler v George'' (1964) in which the defendant was charged with obstructing a military guard in the execution of his duty. In order to succeed, the prosecution had to show that the act took place ‘in the vicinity of’ a military establishment. The defendant argued that ‘in the vicinity’ meant 'outside or in the proximity or area' of the establishment, whereas he was in fact inside. The court decided that such an interpretation would lead to an absurd result, and interpreted ‘in the vicinity of’ to cover a person already on the premises.&lt;ref name="LawMentor"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
'''''Homo sacer''''' (Latin for "the sacred man" or "the accursed man") is a figure of [[Roman law]]: a person who is [[ban (law)|banned]] and may be killed by anybody, but may not be [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] in a religious ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Agamben, Giorgio. Heller-Roazen, trans. ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The meaning of the term ''sacer'' in [[Ancient Roman religion]] is not fully congruent with the meaning it took after Christianization, and which was adopted into English as ''sacred''. In early Roman religion ''sacer'', much like the Hebrew [[:wikt:קדש|{{Hebrew|קָדוֹש}}]] ''qadoš'', denotes anything "set apart" from common society and encompasses both the sense of "hallowed" and that of "cursed". This concept of the sacred is more in line with the Islamic notion of ''[[haram]]''. The ''homo sacer'' could thus also simply mean a person expunged from society and deprived of all [[rights]] and all functions in [[civil religion]]. ''Homo sacer'' is defined in legal terms as someone who can be killed without the killer being regarded as a murderer; and a person who cannot be sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Agamben - Homo Sacer, 1995 (Valdisholm publishing company, Norwegian translation), 2. part (Homo Sacer) 1.1.  citing [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sacred human may thus be understood as someone outside the law, or beyond it. With respect to certain monarchs, in certain western legal traditions, the concepts of the sovereign and of the Homo Sacer have been conflated.&lt;ref&gt;§ 5 Constitution of Norway -&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sacred man'' could also have been used because the condemned could only rely on protection of gods.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.pl/books?id=3tTfzsdmbl4C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=prescription+homo+sacer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3c-aTIegvb&amp;sig=v2CFrKQJ7oGUQfEZe_ysaSHyU80&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIhZiL8YTcAhUmLsAKHTvHByYQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=prescription%20homo%20sacer&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of ''homo sacer'' could fall upon one as a consequence of oath-breaking. An [[oath]] in antiquity was essentially a conditional self-cursing, i.e. invoking one or several deities and asking for their punishment in the event of breaking the oath. An oathbreaker was consequently considered the property of the gods whom he had invoked and then deceived. If the oathbreaker was killed, this was understood as the revenge of the gods into whose power he had given himself. Since the oathbreaker was already the property of the oath deity, he could no longer belong to human society, or be consecrated to another deity.

A direct reference to this status is found in the [[Twelve Tables]] (8.21), laws of the early Roman Republic written in the 5th century BC. The paragraph states that a [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]] who deceives his clients is to be regarded as ''sacer''.

The idea of the status of an [[outlaw]], a criminal who is declared as unprotected by the law and can consequently be killed by anyone with impunity, persists throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. Medieval perception condemned the entire human intrinsic moral worth of the outlaw, dehumanizing the outlaw literally as a "wolf" or "wolf's-head" (in an era where hunting of wolves existed strongly, including a commercial element)&lt;ref&gt;Mary R. Gerstein, Berkeley, Ca., 1974, "Germanic Warg: The Outlaw as Werwolf", in G.J. Larson, ed., ''Myth in Indo-European Antiquity'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and is first revoked only by the English ''[[Habeas Corpus]]'' act of 1679 which declares that any criminal must be judged by a tribunal before being punished.

Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] takes the concept as the starting point of his main work ''[[Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life]]'' (1998).

      <comment>On the sections regarding the Second and Third Island Chains, both of them use capitals for the word 'Island', the section on the First Island Chain does not do this, reflecting a break in the English scheme in the majority of cases in this article.</comment>

The '''Island Chain Strategy''' is a strategy first mentioned by American foreign policy commentator [[John Foster Dulles]] in 1951 during the [[Korean War]]. It suggests surrounding the [[Soviet Union]] and [[PRC|China]] by sea.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroyuki Umetsu,  "Communist China’s entry into the Korean hostilities and a US proposal for a collective security arrangement in the Pacific offshore island chain." ''Journal of Northeast Asian Studies'' (1996) 15#2 pp: 98–118.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The island chain concept did not become a major theme in American policy, however it has become a major fixation of Chinese analysts to this day. The concept heightens Chinese fears that they will be encircled by American forces, and emphasizes the geographical and strategic importance of [[Taiwan]]. It helps shape Chinese naval options and strategies, as well as playing a role in economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Toshi Yoshihara, "China's Vision of Its Seascape: The First Island Chain and Chinese Seapower." ''Asian Politics &amp; Policy'' (2012) 4#3 pp. 293–314. DOI: 10.1111/j.1943-0787.2012.01349.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Chinese writings the Island Chain Strategy is divided into 3 parts, namely [[First island chain|First Island Chain]], the [[Second Island Chain]] and the [[Third Island Chain]].

== First Island Chain ==
{{Main|First island chain}}

The First Island Chain begins at the [[Kuril Islands]], and finishes towards [[Borneo]] and the northern portion of the [[Philippines]]. It is the first chain to block [[socialism|socialist]] countries aligned with the USSR, and after Soviet Russia is dealt with the chain would then turn its focus on China. The key part of the first chain would be [[Taiwan]].

Because the island chain is built up of a series of landmasses, it is also called the "[[unsinkable aircraft carrier]]", especially in reference to Taiwan.

== Second Island Chain ==
The Second Island Chain can refer to two different interpretations, but the version most commonly used refers to the island chain which is formed by the [[Ogasawara Islands]] and [[Volcano Islands]] of Japan, in addition to [[Mariana Islands]] which is United States territory.

As it is located within the middle portion of the Pacific Ocean, it acts as a second strategic defense line for the United States.

==Third Island Chain ==
The Third Island Chain is the final part of the strategy. Its island chain begins at the [[Aleutian Islands]], and finishes up in [[Oceania]]. The key part of the Third Island Chain would be the [[Hawaii]]an Islands of the United States.

== Target and events ==
The primary target of the doctrine was the USSR; however, additional targets also included the People's Republic of China and Vietnam. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR collapsed]] in 1991, China soon became the major target of the doctrine.

'''Jurimetrics''' is the application of quantitative methods, and often especially [[statistics]], to [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Zabala, F.J., Silveira, F.F., "Jurimetria: Estatística Aplicada ao Direito". ''Revista Direito e Liberdade'', Natal, v. 16, n. 1, pp. 73-86, Jan./Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="garner"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|page=488|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0195142365|chapter=jurimetrics|isbn=0195142365|first=Bryan A. |last=Garner|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject has gained considerable currency in both the United States and Brazil. In the United States, the journal ''[[Jurimetrics (journal)|Jurimetrics]]'' is published by the [[American Bar Association]] and [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/jurimetrics|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=2015-02-06|title=Jurimetrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Brazil, the field is the focus of a dedicated scholarly organization, the Brazilian Jurimetrics Association, which describes itself as "a nonprofit organization gathering researchers in Law and Mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abjur.org.br/en/|publisher=Brazilian Jurimetrics Association|title=Check out our activities|accessdate=2015-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207082908/http://www.abjur.org.br/en/|archivedate=2015-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 1949 by [[Lee Loevinger]] in his article "Jurimetrics: The Next Step Forward".&lt;ref name="garner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loevinger, L. "Jurimetrics: The Next Step Forward". Heidi Online, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Showing the influence of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], Loevinger quoted&lt;ref&gt;Loevinger, L. "Jurimetrics: Science and prediction in the field of law". ''[[Minnesota Law Review]]'', vol. 46, HeinOnline, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes' celebrated phrase that "the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics.".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, ''The Path of the Law'', 10 ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' (1897) 457.&lt;/ref&gt; The first work on this topic is attributed to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli]] in his doctoral dissertation ''De Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure'', written in 1709.

The possibilities for applying jurimetrics are diverse, from analyses of the frequency of proceedings to the development of models to support decisionmaking.  Jurimetrics can be considered from different perspectives depending on one's focus.

== Jurimetrics and the Law and Economics school ==

The basic difference between jurimetrics and [[Law and Economics]] is simply the fact that jurimetrics simultaneously encompasses [[statistics]] and [[law]], while [[Law and Economics]] deals with [[econometrics]] ([[economics]] and [[statistics]]). When [[statistics]], [[law]] and [[economics]] all coincide, either a jurimetric or an econometric approach may be considered.

'''Law practice management''' ('''LPM''') is the [[management]] of a [[law practice]]. In the [[United States]], [[law firm]]s may be composed of a single [[lawyer|attorney]], of several attorneys, or of many attorneys, plus support staff such as [[paralegal|paralegals/legal assistants]], [[Secretary|secretaries]] (including [[legal secretary|legal secretaries]]), and other personnel.

Debate over law as a [[profession]] versus a [[business]] has occurred for over a century; a number of observers believe that it is both.&lt;ref&gt;Champ S. Andrews, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/784941 The Law: A Business or a Profession?] (June 1908), ''Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 107, No. 7, pp. 602-610.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy M. Miller, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=929749 Is Law a Business or a Profession-And Does it Really Matter?] (1994), ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'' Vol. 107, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lippe, [http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/law_is_both_a_profession_and_a_business--forget_that_at_your_own_peril/ Law Is Both a Profession and a Business—Forget That at Your Own Peril] (January 27, 2011). Legal Rebels, ABA Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law practice management is the study and practice of [[business administration]] in the legal context, including such topics as [[workload]] and [[staff management]]; [[Managerial finance|financial management]]; [[office management]]; and [[marketing]], including [[legal advertising]].

Many lawyers have commented on the difficulty of balancing the management functions of a law firm with client matters.&lt;ref&gt;Anita J. Cicero, as told to Elizabeth Olson. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/jobs/04pre.html Preoccupations: The Tightrope of Managing a Law Office] (January 3, 2009). ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lawyers started practicing centuries ago. Law firms as an institution date back to the 19th century, and in the United States began appearing in the period before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. and Angelo Dondi, ''Legal Ethics: A Comparative Study'' (2004). Stanford University Press, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; predating the development of modern [[management theory]].

Today, the [[George Washington University]] College of Professional Studies (CPS) offers a [[Master of Professional Studies]] and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nearyou.gwu.edu/lawfirm/index1.html Master of Professional Studies and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management], George Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ABA Law Practice Division==
The leading organization focused on law practice management is the Law Practice Division of the [[American Bar Association]] which traces its history back to the creation of the ABA Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice by the ABA Board of Governors on July 30, 1957.  In August 1957, when Charles S. Rhyne became President of the ABA, he made one of his major objectives the institution of a “comprehensive program to aid members of the ABA in the field of economics of law practice”.  He appointed the first Committee which consisted of five members and was increased in May of the following year to seven by action of the Board.  The first Chair of the Special Committee was John C. Satterfield of Yazoo City, Mississippi.

The Committee was charged with the duty of laying the groundwork for the development of practical suggestions to lawyers, designed to improve their economic status.  Combined with this, there was to be an increase in coordination of assistance to lawyers in the business phase of the practice of law, achieved by ABA through its staff, committees and sections and by the state and local bar associations.

An early publication from the Committee was ''The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar''. Satterfield was elected President of the [[American Bar Association]] in 1961 during which ''The Lawyers Handbook'' was first published and distributed to all attorneys who joined the ABA that year.

By action of the Board of Governors at the ABA Annual Meeting in August 1961, the Special Committee was made a standing committee of the Association and [[Lewis F. Powell]] of Richmond, Virginia, was appointed as the first Chair of the ABA Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice.  Shortly after the completion of his term as Chair in 1962, he was elected President of the American Bar Association and subsequently became an Associate Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1972.

The Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice published a bimonthly newsletter, Legal Economics News, and more than 30 books and pamphlets, three educational films, and an audio cassette program.  The Committee continued to publish The Lawyer’s Handbook.  The Committee’s staff answered over one hundred inquiries a month from attorneys regarding the application of sound management principles to the law office operation.  In addition, a small group of attorneys led by J. Harris Morgan of Greenville, Texas, Kline Strong of Salt Lake City, Utah, Lee Turner of Great Bend, Kansas and Jimmy Brill of Houston, Texas, traveled throughout the US, presenting programs on law firm management. Their efforts created the need for the Section.

Commencing in 1965 when John D. Connor served as Chair, the Committee presented the first of six National Conferences of Law Office Economics and Management in Chicago, which attracted approximately 500 lawyers throughout the country and several foreign countries.

As activities expanded and lawyer interest in law office management increased, it became apparent that the committee structure could not meet the demonstrated need of American lawyers for assistance in law practice issues and limited the participation and contribution of interested and informed lawyers in the vital economics and efficiency programs of the Association.  Accordingly, two members of the Committee, Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle, Washington, the former Chair of the Young Lawyers Section, and Richard A. Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas were joined by William J. Fuchs of Haverford, Pennsylvania; John “Buddy” Thomason of Memphis, Tennessee; and  Robert P. Wilkins of Columbia, South Carolina, and commenced efforts to form a section to address the subject of law office economics and management.

Proponents for a new Section originally proposed that the Board of Governors recommend to the House the creation of a Section of Law Office Practice and Efficiency, but after deliberation it was determined that the new Section should be called by the Standing Committee name.  At the ABA Midyear Meeting in Houston, Texas in February 1974, the House of Delegates approved establishing the Section of Economics of Law Practice.  This action culminated a two-year effort to expand the Committee’s work to a much wider lawyer population.

The organizational meeting of the Section was held in April 1974 at the close of the Sixth National Conference of Law Office Economics and Management.  Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle Washington, who had served as the Chair of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice was elected the new Section chair with 1074 charter members. Those chosen to serve on the initial Section Council were selected from the members of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice and the Committee on Legal Assistants, other ABA contacts, speakers from the National Conferences and attorneys active at the state level.

The current chair of the American Bar Association Law Practice Division is Tom Bolt, a St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands lawyer with BoltNagi PC.

==Other Organizations and Consultants==
The Association of Legal Administrators (ALA) [[professional association]], which was founded in 1971 is another organization that is concerned with law practice management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of law practice [[consulting firm]]s also exist. Many [[bar association]]s have a law practice section or division which they allow non-attorney members due to the technical, non-legal basis of law office management.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://www.michbar.org/lawpractice/ Law Practice Management and Legal Administrators Section] of the [[State Bar of Michigan]]; the [http://www.massbar.org/member-groups/sections/law-practice-management Law Practice Management Section] of the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]]; and the [http://lpmt.calbar.ca.gov/ Law Practice Management and Technology Section] of the [[State Bar of California]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of law-practice management==
Law practice management includes management of people (clients, staff, vendors), workplace facilities and equipment, internal processes and policies, and financial matters such as collection, [[budgeting]], [[Internal control|financial controls]], [[payroll]], and client [[trust account]]s.

===Software and legal research===
{{Main|Law practice management software}}

Software applications have become increasingly important in modern law practice. Picking the best software for a law office depends on many variables.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Calloway, [http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf Picking the "Best" Law Office Software] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229015452/http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}. Oklahoma Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Law practice management software|Practice management software]], a form of [[customer relationship management]] software, is among the most important, and features and functions of such management software often include case management ([[database]]s, [[conflict of interest]] checking, [[statute of limitations]] checking), time tracking (for billing), [[document assembly]], [[contact management]], and calendaring and [[Docket (court)|docket]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/charts_fyis/casemanagementcomparison.html Practice and Case Management Software: Comparison Chart]. American Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Other software used includes [[password]] security, [[disk encryption]], [[mindmapping]], desktop notes, [[word processing]], and [[email management]]. Some firms use modified versions of [[Open-source software|open source]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Steph Kimbro, [http://lawyerist.com/open-source-virtual-law-firm/ Open Source and the Virtual Law Firm] (May 3, 2011). Laywerist.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Lambert, [http://www.geeklawblog.com/2009/07/open-source-in-law-firms-unimaginable.html Open Source in Law Firms - Unimaginable or Brilliant?] (July 8, 2009), ''3 Geeks and a Law Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most law firms also subscribe to a [[computer-assisted legal research]] database for [[legal research]]. Such databases provide [[case law]] from [[Law report|case reporters]], and often other legal resources. The two largest legal databases are [[Westlaw]] (part of [[West (publisher)|West]], which is owned by [[Thomson Reuters]]) and [[LexisNexis]], but other databases also exist, such the free [[Google Scholar]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Carton, [http://legalblogwatch.typepad.com/legal_blog_watch/2011/01/improved-google-scholar-becomes-more-useful-to-lawyers.html Improved Google Scholar More Useful to Lawyers] (January 18, 2011). ''Law.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geri L. Dreiling, [http://lawyertechreview.com/2011/how-to-use-google-scholar-for-legal-research/ How to Use Google Scholar for Legal Research] (May 11, 2011). ''Lawyer Tech Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtney Minick and David Tsai, [http://www.sfbar.org/articles/google_scholar.aspx Google Scholar:  A New Way to Search for Cases and Related Legal Publications]. [[Bar Association of San Francisco]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the newer [[Bloomberg Law]], as well as [[Loislaw]] (operated by [[Wolters Kluwer]]) and several smaller databases.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Schachner Chanen, [http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/exclusive_inside_the_new_westlaw_lexis_bloomberg_platforms/ Exclusive: Inside the New Westlaw, Lexis &amp; Bloomberg Platforms] (January 24, 2010). ''ABA Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alyssa Altshuler, [http://www.vsb.org/publications/valawyer/oct01/altshuler.pdf An Overview of Five Internet Legal Research Alternatives to Westlaw and LexisNexis] (October 2011). ''Virginia Lawyer''. Virginia State Bar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tami Kamin-Meyer, ''Westlaw Versus Lexis: The Debate Rages On'' (2008). ''Plaintiff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Document automation has also become a crucial part of legal practice management, with companies like Thomson Reuters,  HotDocs (acquired by AbacusNext)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/sites/legaltechnews/2017/11/13/abacusnext-acquires-document-automation-company-hotdocs/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=35e92ab8-ab46-45b4-86d7-ce963c2f8ec8&lt;/ref&gt; and HelpSelf Legal (web-based platform)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.helpselflegal.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/helpself-uses-simple-ai-to-help-those-in-legal-trouble/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt; providing document automation services that allow lawyers to customize their own interview workflows to merge into legal documents.  These and other sites are incorporating artificial intelligence into their document automation software.&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt;.  

These document automation tools allow any lawyer to create their own workflows, in the same way that companies like LegalZoom and RocketLawyer offer standardized automated document production for individuals and small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-buy-legal-documents-online-without-reading-this-story-2015-11-23 Article:Don’t buy legal documents online without reading this story]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Some [[bar association]]s and lawyers' organizations have their own software; for example, the American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys' CounselPro program is designed for [[estate planning]] lawyers and assists in producing [[Will (law)|wills]], [[Trust law|trusts]], and other [[legal document]]s, as well as other documents such as thank-you letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx/ American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018125101/http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx |date=2009-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firm personnel===
[[Human resource management]] (managing personnel) is an important aspect of law practice management, and many books and other resources offer advice to firms on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v35_is7_pg34.html Resources for Managing Law Firm Personnel - Shape Up! Practice Management Tips for 2010] (November/December 2009). ''Law Practice'' Vol. 35, No. 7, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law firms often employ a number of non-legal personnel or support staff; according to one figure, the average attorney to non-attorney ratio is 1 to 1.3.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm? (2005). Freedman Consulting, Inc. (version of article originally appearing in the ''Pennsylvania Lawyer'' (March/April 2001 issue).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many firms and other organizations employ a professional non-attorney legal administrator, or law firm administrator, to manage non-attorney personnel and the administrative aspects of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rose, [http://nysbar.com/blogs/Tipoftheweek/2010/02/role_of_law_firm_administrator.html Role of Law Firm Administrator] (February 18, 2010). ''Law Practice Management Tip of the Week''. [[New York State Bar Association]], Committee on Law Practice Management.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[professional association]] for legal administrators is the Association of Legal Administrators (ALA), founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past two decades, the role of legal administrator has changes as duties have expanded and become more complex, and as more firms hired administrators; the ALA grew from less than a thousand members in 1976 to over 8,000 in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weilandco.com/new/article.html Deciding When And How To Effectively Use A Legal Administrator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110031330/http://weilandco.com/new/article.html |date=2012-01-10 }}, John P. Weil &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ALA, in 2007 some 76 percent of legal administrators were women in their 40s and 50s. The main duties of legal administrators are the financial, operation, and human resource management of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ott Mayer, [http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2007/04/30/focus3.html Role of legal administrators changing as duties expand, become more complex] (April 29, 2007). ''Memphis Business Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Denney, [http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v34_is3_pg35.html Evolution of the Professional Administrator] (April/May 2008). ''Law Practice'' Vol. 34, No. 3, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Smith and Ashby Jones, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303630404577388180888033106 Practicing Business: Professional Managers Gain Wider Presence at Law Firms] (May 6, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal administrator is similar to an [[office manager]] or [[executive director]], but often with some expanded duties. Depending on the size, needs, and type of law firm, the firm may employ a separate [[database manager]], [[network administrator]], [[marketing director]], [[computer systems]] or [[Information technology management|information technology manager]], [[bookkeeper]], [[accounts payable]] and [[accounts receivable]] clerk, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm?

==Impact on the legal industry==

In the 2016 report, [[Deloitte]] estimated that more than 110,000 law jobs in just the United Kingdom alone could be gone within the next twenty years because of automation. That could result in the creation of more highly skilled jobs and reduction of paralegal and temp positions. Deloitte's report asserts that "there is significant potential for high-skilled roles that involve repetitive processes to be automated by smart and self-learning algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;"Developing legal talent: Stepping into the future law firm." Deloitte. N.p., Feb. 2016. Web. 17 June 2017. &lt;https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/audit/articles/developing-legal-talent.html#&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to law and justice==

It has been widely estimated for at least the last generation that all the programs and resources devoted to ensuring access to justice address only 20% of the civil legal needs of low-income people in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Services Corporation, Documenting the Justice Gap in America: The Current Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low Income Americans, 2009, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on this experience, in late 2011, the U.S. government-funded [[Legal Services Corporation]] decided to convene a summit of leaders to explore how best to use technology in the access-to-justice community. The group adopted a mission for The Summit on the Use of Technology to Expand Access to Justice (Summit) consistent with the magnitude of the challenge: "to explore the potential of technology to move the United States toward providing some form of effective assistance to 100% of persons otherwise unable to afford an attorney for dealing with essential civil legal needs".&lt;ref&gt;Legal Services Corporation, Report of The Summit on the Use of Technology to Expand Access to Justice, p. 1; December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, joined by [[Microsoft]] and [[Pro Bono Net]], the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) announced a pilot program to develop online, statewide legal portals to direct individuals with civil legal needs to the most appropriate forms of assistance. These portals will use cutting-edge, user-centered technology to help ensure that all people with civil legal needs can navigate their options and more easily access solutions and services available from legal aid, the courts, the private bar, and community partners.&lt;ref&gt;"Press Release: The Legal Services Corporation Announces Pilot States for Innovative Program to Increase Access to Justice."

'''Lawmaking''' is the process of crafting legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lawmaking|title=Lawmaking definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its purest sense, it is the basis of [[governance]].  
This form of law making is also applied in India. It is a process which works in India on the basis of Indian Constitution.
Lawmaking in modern [[democracy|democracies]] is the work of [[legislature]]s, which exist at the local, regional, and national levels and make such laws as are appropriate to their level, and binding over those under their jurisdictions.  These bodies are influenced by [[lobbyist]]s, [[pressure group]]s, sometimes partisan considerations, but ultimately by the voters who elected them and to which they are responsible, if the system is working as intended.  Even the expenditure of governmental funds is an aspect of lawmaking, as in most jurisdictions the [[budget]] is a matter of law.

In [[dictator|dictatorships]] and absolute [[monarchy|monarchies]] the leader can make law essentially by the stroke of a pen, one of the main objections to such an arrangement.  However, a seemingly-analogous event can occur even in a democracy where the [[executive (government)|executive]] can make [[executive order]]s which have the force of law.  In some instance, even regulations issued by executive departments can have the force of law.  [[Libertarian]]s, in particular, are known for denouncing such actions as being anti-democratic, but they have become such a salient feature of modern governance that it is hard to picture a system in which they no longer exist, because it is hard to picture the time involved in every regulation being debated prior to becoming law.  That, say libertarians, is precisely the point: if such executive orders and regulations do not stand up to legislative scrutiny, they should never be implemented.  In response to this, limits on regulatory authority have been made legislatively, and libertarians still contend for, if not the abolition of executive orders altogether, then their automatic [[sunset]] after a fixed period if not legislatively reviewed and confirmed; this policy has been adopted in some jurisdictions.

Since first coming to wide notice in the late 1990s, the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book series by [[J. K. Rowling]] has engendered a number of legal disputes. Rowling, her various publishers and [[Time Warner]], the owner of the rights to the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyrights, and also have fielded accusations of copyright theft themselves.&lt;ref name="Potter author zaps court rival"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/UK/09/19/rowling.court/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Potter author zaps court rival|date=19 July 2002|accessdate=11 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629165519/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/UK/09/19/rowling.court/index.html|archivedate=29 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide popularity of the ''Harry Potter'' series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them.&lt;ref name=yemets&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2846105.stm|title=Rowling seeks 'Grotter' ban|publisher=BBC News|date=13 March 2003|accessdate=31 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these legal proceedings have countered a number of cases of outright piracy,&lt;ref name=walkup&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2092661.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Fake Harry Potter novel hits China|date=4 July 2002|accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; other attempts have targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised.&lt;ref name=Claire&gt;{{cite web|title=Warner Brothers bullying ruins Field family Xmas|author=Kieren McCarthy|publisher=The Register|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/12/21/warner_brothers_bullying_ruins_field/ |date=21 December 2000|accessdate=3 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from distributing or reading her books before their official release dates. The sweeping powers of these injunctions have occasionally drawn fire from civil liberties and free speech campaigners and sparked debates over the "right to read".&lt;ref name="Don't Buy Harry Potter Books"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stallman.org/harry-potter.html|title=Don't Buy Harry Potter Books|year=2005|author=Richard Stallman|publisher=stallman.org|accessdate=13 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geist&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter and the Right to Read|author=Michael Geist|publisher=michaelgeist.ca|url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=896|date=17 July 2005|accessdate=12 October 2007}}{{cite news|work=The [[Toronto Star]]|date=18 July 2005|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/868524161.html?dids=868524161:868524161&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+18%2C+2005&amp;author=Michael+Geist&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C.03&amp;desc=Harry+Potter+and+the+amazing+injunction|title=Appeared in|accessdate=26 September 2008 | first=Michael | last=Geist}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these injunctions was used in an unrelated trespassing case as precedent supporting the issuance of an injunction against a [[John Doe]].&lt;ref name=injunction&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire Waste Services Ltd v.

Outside these controversies, a number of particular incidents related to ''Harry Potter'' have also led, or almost led, to legal action. In 2005, a man was sentenced to four years in prison after firing a replica gun at a journalist during a staged deal for stolen copies of an unreleased ''Harry Potter'' novel, and attempting to blackmail the publisher with threats of releasing secrets from the book.&lt;ref name=corby&gt;{{cite news|title=Man jailed for Potter theft|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jan/19/pressandpublishing.ukcrime|date=19 January 2006|work=The Guardian  |location=London|accessdate=23 May 2007 | first=Mark | last=Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2007 [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] contemplated legal action against the supermarket chain [[Asda]] for libel after the company accused them of overpricing the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Asda barred from selling seventh Harry Potter|author=Nigel Reynolds|work=The Telegraph|date=17 July 2007|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1557690/Asda-barred-from-selling-seventh-Harry-Potter.html|accessdate=1 August 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of intellectual property and speech lawsuits involving ''Harry Potter'', [http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2015/07/harry-potter-lawsuits-and-where-to-find-them/ Harry Potter Lawsuits and Where to Find Them],  was compiled by attorney [http://www.foleyhoag.com/people/kluft-david David Kluft] in 2015 for the [http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/ Trademark and Copyright Law Blog].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2015/07/harry-potter-lawsuits-and-where-to-find-them/|title=Harry Potter Lawsuits and Where to Find Them {{!}} Trademark and Copyright Law|website=www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations of copyright and trademark infringement against Rowling ==
{{See also|Harry Potter influences and analogues}}

=== Nancy Stouffer ===
In 1999, American author Nancy Kathleen Stouffer alleged [[copyright infringement|copyright]] and [[trademark infringement]] by Rowling of her 1984 works ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'' ({{ISBN|1-58989-400-6}}) and ''Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly''.&lt;ref name="Potter author zaps court rival" /&gt; The primary basis for Stouffer's case rested in her own purported invention of the word "[[Muggle]]s", the name of a race of [[mutant]] [[humanoids]] in ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'', and Larry Potter, the title character of a series of activity booklets for children. Larry Potter, like Harry Potter, is a bespectacled boy with dark hair,&lt;ref name="Muggle Versus Wizard" /&gt; though he is not a character in ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Harry Potter' Prevails In Court|author=Hillel Italie|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/19/print/main522563.shtml|publisher=CBS News|date=19 September 2002|accessdate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stouffer also drew a number of other comparisons, such as a castle on a lake, a receiving room and wooden doors.&lt;ref name="Muggle Versus Wizard"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://discuss.washingtonpost.com/zforum/01/author_stouffer032801.htm|work=The Washington Post|title=Muggle Versus Wizard|date=28 March 2001|accessdate=11 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518113345/http://discuss.washingtonpost.com/zforum/01/author_stouffer032801.htm|archivedate=18 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of ''Rah'' were originally published in booklet form in 1986 by Ande Publishing Company, a company founded by Stouffer together with a group of friends and family.&lt;ref name="opinion"&gt;Scholastic, Inc. v. Stouffer
221 F. Supp. 2d 425 ([[Southern District of New York|S.D.N.Y.]] 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Ande Publishing filed for bankruptcy in September 1987 without selling any of its booklets in the United States or elsewhere.&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt; Rowling has stated that she first visited the United States in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Things Considered: Harry Potter|date=3 December 1998|publisher=NPR Radio
|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1032154|accessdate=3 September 2008}} (Rowling interview)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling, along with [[Scholastic Press]] (her American publisher) and [[Warner Bros.]] (holders of the series' film rights), pre-empted Stouffer in 2002 with a suit of their own seeking a [[declaratory judgment]] that they had not infringed on any of Stouffer's works. The court found in Rowling's favour, granting summary judgment and holding that "no reasonable juror could find a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the two parties' works".&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt; During the course of the trial, it was held that Rowling proved "by clear and convincing evidence, that Stouffer has perpetrated a fraud on the Court through her submission of fraudulent documents as well as through her untruthful testimony",&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt; including changing pages years after the fact to retroactively insert the word "muggle".&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt; Her case was dismissed with prejudice and she was fined $50,000 for her "pattern of intentional bad faith conduct" in relation to her employment of fraudulent submissions, along with being ordered to pay a portion of the plaintiffs' legal fees.&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt; Stouffer appealed the decision in 2004, but in 2005 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;''Scholastic Inc. v. Stouffer'', 81 F. App'x 396 (2d Cir. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 she stated on her website that she was planning to republish her books and was entertaining the possibility of another lawsuit against Warner Bros., J. K. Rowling and Scholastic Press.&lt;ref name="unauth" /&gt;

''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'' is currently out of print. In early 2001, it was published by Thurman House, LLC, a Maryland publishing company.&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt; Thurman House, formed by [[Ottenheimer Publishers]] to republish the works of Nancy Stouffer, was closed when Ottenheimer ceased operations in 2002 after filing for bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20020617/22500-ottenheimer-closing-down-.html|title=Ottenheimer Closing Down|work=Publishers Weekly|date=17 June 2002|accessdate=19 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715131909/http://new.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20020617/22500-ottenheimer-closing-down-.html#|archive-date=15 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stouffer later asserted that any copies of the book published by Thurman House are unauthorized because the publisher failed to honour its contractual obligations to her.&lt;ref name="unauth"&gt;{{cite web|title=realmuggles.com|author=Nancy Stouffer|url=http://www.realmuggles.com/action.html#notice1|accessdate=18 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028093257/http://www.realmuggles.com/action.html#notice1#notice1|archive-date=28 October 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Wyrd Sisters ===
In 2005, Warner Bros. offered CAD$5,000 (later CAD$50,000) to the Canadian folk band the [[Wyrd Sisters (band)|Wyrd Sisters]] for the rights to use their name in the film version of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.&lt;ref name=chart&gt;{{cite web|title=Winnipeg's Wyrd Sisters Still Fighting Harry Potter |url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/41504/winnipegs-wyrd-sisters-still-fighting-harry-potter |date=7 April 2006 |publisher=[[Chart (magazine)|''Chart'' magazine]] |accessdate=23 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405020832/http://www.chartattack.com/news/41504/winnipegs-wyrd-sisters-still-fighting-harry-potter |archivedate=5 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling had written a scene in the novel in which a band called the [[The Weird Sisters (Harry Potter)|Weird Sisters]] appeared at a school dance, and the group owned the rights to the name in Canada. However, the offer was declined, and instead the band undertook a legal action against Warner Bros., as well as [[Jarvis Cocker]] of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] and [[Jonny Greenwood]] and [[Phil Selway]] of [[Radiohead]], who were to play the band in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/11/04/wyrdlawsuit_051104.html |title='Wyrd Sisters' cannot stop Harry Potter |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=4 September 2005 |accessdate=3 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527023912/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/11/04/wyrdlawsuit_051104.html |archivedate=27 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All plans to use the name in the movie were later abandoned. Despite that decision, the Canadian band filed a CAD$40-million ($39&amp;nbsp;million) lawsuit against Warner in Ontario court. In connection with the lawsuit, the band brought an [[interlocutory]] [[injunction]] hoping to prevent the release of the film. The injunction application was dismissed.&lt;ref name=wyrd /&gt; The entire suit was dismissed in November 2005. In June 2006, an Ontario judge decreed that the band pay Warner Bros. CAD$140,000 in legal costs, describing their lawsuit as "highly intrusive".&lt;ref name=wyrd /&gt;&lt;ref name=sisters /&gt; The group claimed they planned to appeal the decision.&lt;ref name=wyrd&gt;{{cite news|title=Wyrd Sisters continue Harry Potter battle with studio |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/07/03/wyrd-potter-court.html |publisher=The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=3 July 2006 |accessdate=23 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507075524/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/07/03/wyrd-potter-court.html |archivedate=7 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarvis Cocker initially wished to release an album of "Weird Sisters"-themed music with collaborators including [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] and [[Iggy Pop]], but the project was dropped as a result of the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=sisters&gt;{{cite web|title=Winnipeg folk band that took on Harry Potter ordered to pay $140,000 court costs |date=1 July 2006 |author=Adrian Humphreys |work=The [[National Post]] |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=bc5b3049-56dc-493b-9ccc-5d4bd0389392 |accessdate=3 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016153617/http://canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=bc5b3049-56dc-493b-9ccc-5d4bd0389392 |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wyrd Sisters reported [[death threats]] from irate ''Harry Potter'' fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wyrd Sisters keep fighting the good fight, fan mail or not|author=Leah Collins|work=The [[Vancouver Sun]]|date=4 August 2007|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/arts/story.html?id=ece18f65-1eb9-4829-9e2b-1d50a0dca298|accessdate=26 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929144426/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/arts/story.html?id=ece18f65-1eb9-4829-9e2b-1d50a0dca298|archivedate=29 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2010, the lawsuit has been settled out of court, the details sealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Lambert |title=Wyrd five-year court battle over Harry Potter movie ends with secret settlement |url=http://www.news919.com/news/national/article/39866--wyrd-five-year-court-battle-over-harry-potter-movie-ends-with-secret-settlement |publisher=Canadian Press |location=Winnipeg |year=2010 |accessdate=28 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714174133/http://www.news919.com/news/national/article/39866--wyrd-five-year-court-battle-over-harry-potter-movie-ends-with-secret-settlement# |archive-date=14 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adrian Jacobs ===
In June 2009, the estate of Adrian Jacobs, a children's author who died in 1997, sued Rowling's publishers, Bloomsbury, for £500&amp;nbsp;million, accusing her of having plagiarised "substantial parts" of his work in writing the novel ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JK Rowling sued for £500m in plagiarism lawsuit by family of late ''Willy The Wizard'' author|work=Daily Mail  |location=UK |author=Ryan Kisiel|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1193283/JK-Rowling-sued-500m-plagiarism-lawsuit-family-late-Willy-The-Wizard-author.html|accessdate=16 June 2009 | date=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=straits&gt;{{cite web|title=Rowling didn't plagiarise |publisher=Reuters |year=2009 |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Lifestyle/Story/STIStory_390898.html |accessdate=16 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619205429/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Lifestyle/Story/STIStory_390898.html |archivedate=19 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, Jacobs's family claimed that a scene in ''Goblet of Fire'' was substantially similar to Jacobs's book ''The Adventures of Willy the Wizard: Livid Land:'' "'Both Willy and Harry are required to work out the exact nature of the main task of the contest which they both achieve in a bathroom assisted by clues from helpers, in order to discover how to rescue human hostages imprisoned by a community of half-human, half-animal fantasy creatures."&lt;ref name=straits /&gt; They also launched a joint suit against Rowling and her publishers. Bloomsbury countered with a statement of its own, saying that "This claim is without merit and will be defended vigorously," and that Rowling "had never heard of Adrian Jacobs nor seen, read or heard of his book ''Willy the Wizard'' until this claim was first made in 2004, almost seven years after the publication of the first ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book."&lt;ref name=straits /&gt; The Jacobs estate, driven by [[Jon Jacobs (actor)|his son]] and grandson, have published a website with details and excerpts from the book, according to the ''[[Toronto Star]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=J.K.

On 6 January 2011, the US lawsuit against Scholastic was dismissed. The judge in the case stated that there was not enough similarity between the two books to make a case for plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Potter plagiarism case dismissed|publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12134288|date=7 January 2011|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK courts, on 21 March 2011, Paul Allen, a trustee of the Jacobs estate, was ordered to pay as security to the court 65% of the costs faced by Bloomsbury and Rowling, amounting to over £1.5million, to avoid the claim being struck out. It was reported in ''The Bookseller''&lt;ref&gt;''The Bookseller'' Trustee of Willy the Wizard Makes Appeal over Court Costs (29 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; that Paul Allen has appealed against paying this sum. As a condition of the appeal, he paid £50,000 to the court in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/willy-wizard-appeal-go-ahead-july.html?quicktabs_1=0 The Bookseller], 24 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was formally struck out in July 2011 after the deadline for Allen's initial payment was missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/18/harry-potter-plagiarism-struck-out|title=Harry Potter plagiarism claim struck out|date=18 July 2011|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, an unauthorised Chinese-language sequel titled ''Harry Potter and Bao Zoulong'' (Chinese: Simplified: 哈利波特与豹走龙, Traditional: 哈利波特與豹走龍, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''Hālì Bōtè yǔ Bào Zǒulóng'') appeared for sale in the People's Republic of China. (In English-language media this was mistranslated as ''Harry Potter and Leopard-Walk-Up-to-Dragon''.)
According to translated excerpts, the book principally consists of the text of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'', but with most names changed to those of ''Harry Potter'' characters.&lt;ref name="i"&gt;{{cite news

Also in 2003, courts in the Netherlands prevented the distribution of a Dutch translation of ''[[Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass]]'', the first of [[Dmitri Yemets]]' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate [[copyright]] law.

In August 2008, Warner Bros. filed a lawsuit against production company [[Mirchi Movies]] due to the similarity of the title of their [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Hari Puttar: A Comedy of Terrors]]'' to the ''Harry Potter'' film series. Mirchi Movies CEO Munish Purii claimed there is very little similarity between Hari Puttar and any elements in the ''Harry Potter'' franchise, and explained that Hari is a popular Indian name, while "puttar" means "son" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], although Indian versions of ''Harry Potter'' also translate Harry's name to Hari Puttar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India's "Hari Puttar" caught in Harry Potter spell|work=NewsDaily|date=27 August 2008|url=http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/sp236913-india-potter/|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was delayed until late September.

In 2000, in the lead-up to the release of the first ''Harry Potter'' film, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''; Warner Bros., the film's distributor, sent a series of letters to owners of ''Harry Potter'' fansites, demanding that, to protect their copyright, they hand over their domain names.&lt;ref name=Claire /&gt; The action resulted in negative publicity for the company when Claire Field, the then 15-year-old webmaster of the British fansite harrypotterguide.co.uk, was reduced to tears by what were described by her father as unnecessary bully tactics.

In their May 2004 issue, the [[US Army]] publication ''[[PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly|The Preventive Maintenance Monthly]]'', which instructs soldiers on how to maintain their equipment, featured a spoof comic based on ''Harry Potter'', featuring a character named Topper who resided at Mogmarts School under Professor Rumbledore.&lt;ref name=beeb /&gt; The publication received notice from Rowling's lawyers that the comics breached copyright, though the magazine's editor, Ken Crunk, claimed that no violation had taken place, as "[t]he drawings do not look like any of the characters from ''Harry Potter''".&lt;ref name=beeb&gt;{{cite news|title=Army mag draws Potter comparisons|date=7 February 2005|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4243145.stm|accessdate=8 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a discussion with Rowling's representatives, the magazine agreed not to use the characters again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arts, Briefly; Harry Potter Crosses Wands With the U.S. Army |author=Lizette Alvarez|work=The New York Times |date=9 February 2005|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E3DE163AF93AA35751C0A9639C8B63|accessdate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Rowling and Time Warner launched legal actions against bazee.com, now the Indian branch of the online auction site [[eBay]].

== Legal injunctions ==
[[File:Harry Potter VI boxes.jpg|thumb|300 px|Boxes of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' awaiting delivery]]
Rowling and her publishers have brought a series of legal [[injunction]]s to ensure the books' secrecy before their launch. These injunctions have drawn criticism from [[civil liberties]] campaigners over their potentially sweeping powers over individual freedoms.

In 2003, in an attempt to maintain secrecy over the impending release of the fifth ''Harry Potter'' book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Rowling and her publishers sought and received a groundbreaking injunction against "the person or persons who has or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any part thereof without the consent of the Claimants".&lt;ref name=injunction /&gt; The ruling obtained, for the first time in British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals. Lawyers Winterbothams noted that, "The new ''Harry Potter'' style injunction could be used if you expected a demonstration or trespass to take place, but which had not yet begun, so long as you could find a description for the people expected which the Court was satisfied identified 'those who are included and those who are not'".&lt;ref name=injunction /&gt; The "Potter injunction" was later used against a camp of [[Romani people|Roma]] travellers.&lt;ref name=injunction /&gt; In 2006, pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]] employed the injunction against anonymous animal rights campaigners who had sent threatening letters to their investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Animal extremists can no longer hide behind a web of secrecy |author=Dan Tench |work=The Times | location=London |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article722258.ece |date= 23 May 2006 |accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series garnered more controversy in 2005 with the release of the sixth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', when a [[Real Canadian Superstore]] grocery store accidentally sold several copies before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, [[Raincoast Books]], obtained an injunction from the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] prohibiting the purchasers from reading the books in their possession. A comment by a media lawyer that "there is no human right to read" led to a debate in the public sphere about whether free access to information was a human right. [[Michael Geist]], the [[Canada Research Chair]] of Internet and E-commerce Law at the [[University of Ottawa]], said in response, "The copyright law claim was particularly puzzling. While copyright law does provide copyright owners with a basket of exclusive rights, the right to prohibit reading is not among them. In fact, copyright law has very little to say about what people can do with a book once they have purchased it."&lt;ref name=geist /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reading ban on leaked Harry Potter |author=Jack Malvern |work=The Times | location=London|date= 13 July 2005|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article543318.ece|accessdate=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free-speech activist [[Richard Stallman]] posted a statement on his blog calling for a boycott until the publisher issued an apology.&lt;ref name="Don't Buy Harry Potter Books" /&gt; Solicitors Fraser Milner and Casgrain, who represented Raincoast and formulated the legal argument for the embargo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Important Notice: Raincoast Books |publisher=Raincoast Books |url=http://www.raincoast.com/harrypotter/injunction-commentary.html |date= 25 August 2005|accessdate=27 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018031618/http://www.raincoast.com/harrypotter/injunction-commentary.html |archivedate = 18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; have rebutted this, saying that the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] applies only to the government, not to private litigation, and does not offer any protection of the right to read in any case, and the innocent purchasers of the ''Harry Potter'' book had no more right to read it than if they had come into possession of someone's secret diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Harry Potter Injunction: Protecting Copyright and Confidential Information |author=Barbara Grossman, Aaron Milrad and Annie Na |publisher=Fraser Milner and Casgrain |url=http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/20052006/655380_HarryPotterInjunction_October21_2005.pdf |format=PDF|year=2005 |accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Scholastic Corporation]] threatened legal action against two booksellers, Levy Home Entertainment and DeepDiscount.com, for selling copies of the final novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', before its release date of 21 July. In an official statement, Scholastic appealed "to the ''Harry Potter'' fans who bought their books from DeepDiscount.com and may receive copies early requesting that they keep the packages hidden until midnight on 21 July."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scholastic will take action against Harry Potter distributors |publisher=Reuters |date=18 July 2007 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSWEN939320070718 |accessdate=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers who agreed not to read the book received a special ''Harry Potter'' t-shirt and a $50 coupon for Scholastic's online store.

In June 2005, Aaron Lambert, a security guard at a book distribution centre in [[Corby]], Northamptonshire, England, stole a number of pages from ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' six weeks before its intended publication date. He was arrested a day later after negotiations to sell them to John Askill, a journalist from ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', turned violent. Lambert reportedly fired a shot from his imitation [[Walther PPK]] pistol, but Askill was unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guard admits to Harry Potter theft|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/4327346.stm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124150123/http://www.jrrobertssecurity.com/security-news/security-crime-news0082.htm|archivedate=24 January 2008|date=13 October 2005|accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his trial the following October, Lambert pleaded guilty to threatening Askill and to attempting to blackmail ''Harry Potter'''s publishers, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Potter book thief admits threats|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/4546164.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=20 December 2005|accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, Lambert was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.&lt;ref name=corby /&gt; In November 2011, in her testimony before the [[Leveson Inquiry]], Rowling said that the ''Sun'' had attempted to "blackmail" her into a photo-op in return for returning the stolen manuscript.&lt;ref name=cnn1&gt;{{cite web|title=J.K.

== Accusation of libel ==
In July 2007, a dispute arose between ''Harry Potter'''s British publisher, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], and [[Asda]], a British supermarket chain owned by the US corporation [[Wal-Mart]]. On 15 July, a week before the release of the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Asda issued a press release accusing Bloomsbury of unfairly fixing their prices. Asda spokesman Peter Pritchard claimed that Bloomsbury was "holding children to ransom" and that, "[i]t seems like Bloomsbury need to do a [[Quidditch|quid-ditch]] as they have sent their prices up north on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. By setting the [[Suggested retail price|recommended retail price]] at this level can only be seen {{sic}} as blatant profiteering on their part." Pritchard went on to say that Asda was acting to "champion the right of young readers", and that the recommended retail price was "twice the average child's pocket money and £5 more than the average children's bestseller".&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; Asda had planned to sell the book as a [[loss leader]] at £8.87 ($16.30), or half Bloomsbury's [[recommended retail price]] of £17.99 ($33.00) and below the wholesale price of £9.89 ($18.00).

Two days later, Bloomsbury responded that the claims were "potentially libellous" and that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Asda's latest attempt to draw attention to themselves involves trying to leap on the ''Harry Potter'' bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and have nothing to do with Bloomsbury Publishing or ''Harry Potter'' and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bloomsbury stated that the price hike of £1 from the previous ''Harry Potter'' novel was due to it having been printed on recycled paper. "There is a price to be paid by the consumer for environmental best practice", a Bloomsbury spokeswoman said.&lt;ref name=makepeace&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloomsbury: Asda must make peace|author=Katherine Rushton|publisher=thebookseller.com|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42122-bloomsbury-asda-must-make-peace.html|date=17 July 2007|accessdate=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomsbury CEO Nigel Newton said, "[They have] unleashed a very disingenuous, self-interested attack on us. This is complete nonsense and all they're doing is grandstanding as they've done on the price of aspirin and bread. They try to turn it into a big deal as though it's a moral crusade for them, but it's nothing of the kind."&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt;

That same day, Bloomsbury cancelled all Asda's orders of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', or roughly 500,000 copies, citing unpaid bills from the company totalling £38,000 ($70,000) for unauthorised returns of the sixth ''Harry Potter'' book.&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt; "The two matters are completely unrelated", said a Bloomsbury spokeswoman, "We decided today that we couldn't risk having arrears with anybody."&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; The dispute had been "going on a while – going on for weeks actually."&lt;ref name=lifestyle&gt;{{cite web|title=Asda Apologises following Potter Book Row|publisher=UK News Lifestyle Extra|url=http://www.lifestyleextra.com/ShowStory.asp?story=BZ1739815T&amp;news_headline=asda_apologises_following_potter_book_row__|date=17 July 2007|accessdate=1 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713204528/http://www.lifestyleextra.com/ShowStory.asp?story=BZ1739815T&amp;news_headline=asda_apologises_following_potter_book_row__#|archive-date=13 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asda responded that Bloomsbury owed them £122,000 ($224,000) ("for pulping and for other book trade issues and work we have done for them"&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt;) and that, as one company spokesman claimed, "It just seems funny that after we expose the potty Potter price hike, Bloomsbury are trying everything they can to stop kids getting hold of ''Harry Potter'' at a price they can afford."

Asda paid the bill within hours, and claimed that Bloomsbury would be in breach of contract if it did not allow the store to sell its books. However, Bloomsbury claimed that the block on Asda's orders was still in place as, "Unfortunately, we've now had to initiate a significant libel claim against them. That matter will have to be dealt with. If they want their 500,000 books, they'll have to come and make peace with us&amp;nbsp;... It could be good news for all their disappointed customers, because they don't have to go to a soulless Asda shed to buy their book and they can share the magic of ''Harry Potter'' at an independent or specialist bookstore instead."&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt;

Upon receipt of Bloomsbury's legal letter, Asda responded that, "There is nothing defamatory in our press release. Everything there is factual. It is a commentary on how we see things."&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt; Said another Asda spokesperson, "If they don't supply us with the books, it will have a massive implication and [be] a breach of contract – but I don't think they will do that."&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt;

Later that day, however, Asda released a statement retracting its original comment: "We apologise unreservedly to Bloomsbury for [our] press release dated 15 July and withdraw our statement. We look forward to a good relationship with Bloomsbury going forward, including selling the latest ''Harry Potter'' book from 00:01&amp;nbsp;am BST on Saturday 21 July and many other Bloomsbury books in the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asda apologises to Bloomsbury|author=Philip Jones |publisher=thebookseller.com|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42186-asda-apologises-to-bloomsbury.html|date=17 July 2007|accessdate=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Bloomsbury lifted the block and Asda was allowed to sell its books. The original press release was then expunged.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Potter and the Asda Apology|author=Graeme Warden|work=The Guardian  |location=London|date=17 July 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/17/harrypotter.supermarkets|accessdate=1 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale behind Asda's initial press release remains uncertain.  Neill Denny, commentator for thebookseller.com, opined that "the whole episode has the whiff of a badly-conceived PR stunt by ill-briefed senior executives at Asda out of touch with the subtleties of the book world."&lt;ref name=Denny&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion: Asda's climbdown|author=Neill Denny|publisher=thebookseller.com|date=17 July 2007|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42197-opinion-asdas-climbdown.html|accessdate=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph Baxter of Publishing News concurred: "For Asda&amp;nbsp;... it may be seen as mission accomplished, a high-risk strategy to maximise publicity for its ''Harry Potter'' offer rewarded with television, radio, Internet and newspaper coverage. And the association of Asda with low prices has no doubt been entrenched in a few more minds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Stand-Off|author=Ralph Baxter|work=Publishing News Online|url=http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno-news-display.asp?K=e2007071912471094&amp;TAG=&amp;CID=&amp;PGE=&amp;sg9t=... |year=2007|accessdate=1 August 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071113192945/http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno-news-display.asp?K=e2007071912471094&amp;TAG=&amp;CID=&amp;PGE=&amp;sg9t=... |archivedate = 13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3441">The term '''legal transplant''' was coined in the 1970s by the Scottish-American legal scholar [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|W.A.J. 'Alan' Watson]] to indicate the moving of a rule or a [[system of law]] from one country to another (A. Watson, ''Legal Transplants: An Approach to [[Comparative Law]]'', [[Edinburgh]], 1974). The notion of legal transplantation is [[diffusionism]]-based and according to this concept most changes in most legal systems occur as the result of borrowing. As maintained by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Watson]], transplantation is the most fertile source of legal development.

Laws are commonly inspired by foreign policies and experiences. Regardless of the academic discourses on whether legal transplants are sustainable as a notion in the [[law|legal theory]], they are common practice. Nevertheless, the degree to which new laws are inspired by foreign examples can vary. A frequent and often justified criticism is that imported laws are not suited for a certain local context.

German jurist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] and his [[German Historical School|historical school of jurisprudence]], which was inspired by the 19th-century [[Romanticism]], have notably promoted the origins of the [[German people]] and their distinctive [[ethos]], or [[Volksgeist]] (“the spirit of a people”). Savigny’s school of legal thought expressed the need of legal change to respect the continuity of the Volksgeist offering a pre-Darwinian concept of juristic evolution. However, this concept of juristic evolution did not leave much space for notions such as legal transplants and the diffusion of law. More recently, Pierre Legrand is one of the strongest opponents of legal transplants.

Today, legal transplants are often mentioned in the broader process of '''diffusion of law''' or '''legal [[acculturation]]'''. J.W. Powell is credited with coining the word “acculturation”, first using it in an 1880 report by the US Bureau of American [[Ethnography]]. He explained that this term refers to the [[psychology|psychological]] changes induced by [[cross-cultural]] [[imitation]]. In a broader context, such notion is by many contemporary scholars applied to legal thought. The diffusion of law is a process of legal change in today’s age of [[globalization]]. Studies on diffusion of law are notably a new area of research in the 21st century.

{{Primary sources|date=February 2007}}

'''Legalism''' (or nomism), in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], is the act of putting the [[Law of Moses]] above the gospel, which is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, by establishing requirements for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] beyond [[Sola fide|faith]] (trust) in [[Jesus Christ]], specifically, trust in His finished work - the shedding of His blood for our sins, and reducing the broad, inclusive, and general precepts of the [[Bible]] to narrow and rigid [[Morality|moral]] codes.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel G. Reid et al., Dictionary of Christianity in America (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; It is an over-emphasis of discipline of conduct, or legal ideas, usually implying an allegation of misguided rigour, pride, [[superficiality]], the neglect of mercy, and ignorance of the [[divine grace|grace of God]] or [[Letter and spirit of the law|emphasizing the letter of law at the expense of the spirit]]. Legalism is alleged against any view that obedience to law, not [[Faith in Christianity|faith in God's grace]], is the pre-eminent principle of [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]. On the viewpoint that redemption is not earned by works, but that obedient faith is required to enter and remain in the redeemed state, see [[covenantal nomism]].

==In the New Testament==
The words 'legalism' or 'legalist' do not occur in the Old or New Testaments.  Legalism's root word, "law" (Greek ''nomos''), occurs frequently in the [[New Testament]], and sometimes is interpreted as legalism.  In 1921, Ernest De Witt Burton stated that in {{bibleverse||Gal.|2:16}}, "''nomou'' is here evidently used ... in its legalistic sense, denoting [[divine law]] viewed as a purely legalistic system made up of statutes, on the basis of obedience or disobedience to which individuals are approved or condemned as a matter of debt without grace. This is divine law as the legalist defined it."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Ernest De Witt, ''The International Critical Commentary, Galatians'', 1921, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] day lacked any term corresponding to the distinct position of "legalism", "legalist", or "legalistic", leading [[C.E.B. Cranfield]] to commend "the possibility that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Pauline statements which at first sight seem to disparage the law]], were really directed not against the law itself but against that misunderstanding and misuse of it for which we now have a convenient terminology" (legalism).&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, C.E.B., ''The International Critical Commentary, Romans'', 1979, p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Messianic Jew]]ish Bible translator [[David H. Stern]] cited these two scholars to support the translation framework that often "&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''nomos''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; means 'legalism' and not God's ''[[Torah]]''", especially in Paul's constructs ''erga nomou'' (literally [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|"works of law"]], rendered by Stern "legalistic observance of ''Torah'' commands") and ''upo nomon'' (literally "under law", rendered by Stern by 13 words, "in subjection to the system which results from perverting the ''Torah'' into legalism").&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David H., ''Jewish New Testament Commentary'', 1992, pp. 535–8, 552–3, on Gal. 2:16b, 3:23b.&lt;/ref&gt;

One concept of legalism, the belief that salvation can be earned by obedience to laws, is referred to in various New Testament books, including Galatians. In this case, some [[Jewish Christians|Jews who had become Christians]] believed that in order to obtain salvation, both faith in Christ (as [[Messiah]]), and obedience to the Mosiac laws were required, such as the cases of the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision controversy]] and the [[Incident at Antioch]]. Generally, however, these cases are referred to as the [[Judaizer]] controversy, rather than a legalism controversy, but the two are related.

Legalism refers to any doctrine which states salvation comes strictly from adherence to the law.  It can be thought of as a works-based religion.  Groups in the New Testament said to be falling into this category include the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Scribes]], [[Judaizers]], and [[Nicolaitans]].  They are legalists because they emphasized obeying the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]], in the case of the Pharisees and Scribes, to the letter without understanding the concept of grace.  Jesus condemned their legalism in [[Woes of the Pharisees|Matthew 23]].  The Pharisees love of the praises of men for their strict adherence is said to be a prime example of legalism.

Legalism is sometimes confused with obedience.  New Testament books such as Romans, speak of grace and obedience together. An example is found in Romans 1:5 (New American Standard Version) speaking of Christ 'through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, for His name's sake...' The goal of receiving the grace was to bring about obedience of faith. Here grace, faith and obedience are tied together. Other references are in Acts 5:29, 32; Romans 16:19; 2 Corinthians 7:15; Hebrews 5:9.

Legalism is also confused with discipline, which is often spoken of in a positive light.  See 1 Corinthians 9:17; 1 Timothy 4:7; 2 Timothy 1:7 and Hebrews 12:5–11.

A third common misunderstanding of legalism is the word law.  Law in many places in the Bible refers to the Law of Moses, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].  In Galatians the Judaizers were trying to insist that salvation required that a person be circumcised prior to obeying the [[Law of Christ]].  Galatians 2:16 says,  "Knowing that a man is not justified by the [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|works of the law]], but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified" (King James Version).  The faith here is the [[Law of Christ]] and the law here is the Law of Moses.  The legalism of the Judaizers was that obedience to  the law of Moses was necessary to be saved.

Legalism in the New Testament is believed by some as being revealed by the life of Saul prior to his [[Conversion of Paul|conversion]].  Some believe that Saul sought to redeem himself by his works of persecution of the church and its ultimate destruction.  Acts 26:9–11 reveals, "I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to [[blaspheme]]; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities" (King James Version). Galatians 1:13–14 states, "For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly [[Zealots#Paul the Apostle|zealous]] of the traditions of my fathers" (King James Version).  These two texts emphasize the nature of Saul's religion, works.

However, in this passage the obedience is not tied to the obeying of specific Old Testament laws, such as keeping [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] or circumcision.

[[Image:Saint James the Just.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Icon of [[James the Just]], whose judgment was adopted in the [[Apostolic Decree]] of {{bibleverse||Acts|15:19–29}}, c. AD 50.]]

At the [[Council of Jerusalem]], c. 50, [[James the Just]] decreed the ''Apostolic Decree'':
: "Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the [[Gentiles]] are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain from [[idolatry|pollutions of idols]], and [from] [[fornication]], and [from] things strangled, and [from] [[Taboo food#Blood|blood]].{{ref|4}} For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the [[synagogues]] every [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] day" ({{bibleref|Acts|15:19–21|KJV}}).

Though the ''Apostolic Decree'' is no longer observed by many [[Christian denominations]] today, it is still observed in full by the [[Greek Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws."&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a very effective philosophy during that time.

== In intra-Christian relations ==

===Roman Catholic Church===
In [[Roman Catholicism]], [[good works]] are done in service to God and one's neighbour, by faith working through love.  In contrast, a severity in the imposition of, or overly scrupulous conformity to any rule of piety, may be charged with legalism.

In an attempt to resolve the dispute over legalism, the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] was a document issued in 1999 by Lutheran-Catholic clerical representatives, declaring a common belief in ''[[Sola gratia]]'', that grace alone can save the faithful, and that there is a ''progressive infusion'' of grace in the spirit of the believer.

===Eastern Orthodox Churches===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], for another example, rejects the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction theory of the atonement]] as ''legalistic''.  The satisfaction theory states that mankind's [[Original Sin]] violated God's law, resulting in all men being born guilty: an idea prevalent in the writings of [[Tertullian]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] of the [[Western Church]].  [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] formally developed the theory that the legal problem of guilt before the Law, required the legal solution of retribution, in order to achieve a just salvation. The solution was for God's son Jesus to willingly die on the [[Cross]] in place of humanity, thus allowing the legal penalty to be fully carried out, satisfying the justice of God, and thus clearing the way for mercy to be shown to sinners.  The Eastern Orthodox charge that this theory is too dependent upon Roman legal concepts of retribution and justice. [citation needed]

===Protestant Churches===
In [[Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], [[Christian]] [[theology]], especially in popular versions of the same, the charge of legalism is an accusation of overzealous adherence to the word of the Bible (as law) in all things said, established or accomplished in a believer's life (cf. [[bibliolatry]]). In that context, to apply the criticism of legalism to a theological position or religious attitude implies that the accused has overturned the Gospel of [[salvation]] through [[faith]] and new life in Jesus Christ and has instead substituted some principle of personal works of strict adherence to the word, through action, thought, or speech for the unearned [[divine grace|grace]] of God.

===In history===

Throughout the [[history of Christianity]], certain beliefs and practices have tended to draw charges of legalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the article/interview [http://www.puntoacroce.altervista.org/_Den/T1-Legalismo_Sh.htm "Il legalismo? Parliamone (Legalism? Let's talk about it)"], with the participation of Nicola Martella, Alessandro Ceralli, Silvano Creaco, ''et al.'' {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

* [[Asceticism]], such as [[fasting]] and other forms of self-denial.
* The keeping of [[Christian Sabbath]], especially regarding prohibitions of various otherwise innocent activities on the day of worship.
* Various extra-biblical [[religious law|ordinances]] and customs that become associated not just with wisdom but with holiness, in the contemporary situation, such as prohibitions against [[theater]], [[movies]], [[dance|dancing]], [[rock music]], [[playing card]]s, [[interracial marriage]] or [[mixed bathing]].
* Total abstinence from alcohol (See also [[Christianity and alcohol]].)
* [[Ritualism]], a superficial or superstitious use of customary [[prayer]]s and [[liturgy]].
* Similarly, certain exclusive [[ritual]] practices, such as rigorous insistence on the [[tetragrammaton]] as the only name by which God is honored, dietary laws, [[Saturday Sabbath]], or [[Passover (Christian holiday)]], especially when practicing these rituals is held necessary for salvation.
* [[Sacrament]]s, especially when the underlying theology allegedly views them as communicating God's grace automatically (compare [[ex opere operato]]).
* Various rigorous and restrictive beliefs, such as that, [[King-James-Only Movement|only the King James Version]] of the Bible constitutes God's word.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', [https://books.google.com/books/about/One_Bible_Only.html?id=uQWTxDdIO6IC&amp;redir_esc=y Beacham, Roy E.; Kevin T. Bauder, ''One Bible Only? Examining Exclusive Claims for the King James Bible'', Kregel Publications, 2001].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The belief that Christian families should [[homeschooling|homeschool]].
* The belief that women should never wear pants or shorts.
* [[Iconoclasm]]
* [[Tithing]]
* [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Circumcision]]
* [[Puritan]]ism
* [[Judaizing]]
* [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationism]]
* [[Christian Reconstructionism]], which is based on the belief that Christians should still obey and enforce the full Mosaic law.

Several underlying dynamics appear in these controversies.  The permitted scope of [[veneration]] of material objects versus claims that such veneration is [[idolatry]], affects the perceived sanctity of ritual spaces and objects, and therefore of the rituals and customs themselves. Teachings about the authority of the church, the sources of legitimacy of that authority, and the role of [[clergy]] versus the [[priesthood of all believers]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "The Protestant Heritage" ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2007), [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109446 ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', 20/09/2007]: "Protestantism originated in the 16th-century Reformation, and its basic doctrines, in addition to those of the ancient Christian creeds, are justification by grace alone through faith, the priesthood of all believers, and the supremacy of Holy Scripture in matters of faith and order."&lt;/ref&gt; also affect these debates.

'''Legalswipe''' is a free [[mobile app|app]] that offers general [[legal advice]] and protection to people randomly stopped and questioned by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/06/29/new-smartphone-app-offers_n_7690380.html |publisher=[[Huffington Post Canada]] |title= Legalswipe, New App, Offers Legal Advice For Random Cop Encounters |date= June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christien Levien, a [[Law of Canada|Canadian lawyer]], conceived Legalswipe to educate civilians about their [[Natural and legal rights|legal rights]] during their interaction with police. The idea of the app was born from Levien's encounter with police and his difficulty in navigating the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/ontariotoday/2015/08/25/is-carding-inherently-racist |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |title= Is carding inherently racist? |date= August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/smartphone-app-offers-legal-advice-for-police-encounters-1.2446034 |publisher=CTV News |title= Smartphone app offers legal advice for police encounters |date= June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawtimesnews.com/201602155222/focus-on/focus-apps-can-unchain-lawyers-from-desk-developer |publisher=Law Times News |title= Focus: Apps can unchain lawyers from desk: developer |date= February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commonlaw.uottawa.ca/en/news/alumnus-christien-levien-14-creates-legal-advice-app-legalswipe |publisher= University of Ottava |title= Alumnus Christien Levien (’14) Creates Legal Advice App, Legalswipe |date= July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The free app, available for Apple and Android devices, informs its users about their rights and provides several key features through a series of simple contextual menus and cues:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cp24.com/lifestyle/technology/new-app-offers-legal-advice-for-random-police-encounters-1.2446020 |publisher=[[CP24]] |title= New app offers legal advice for random police encounters |date= June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2082234/new-smartphone-app-offers-legal-advice-for-random-police-encounters |publisher= [[Global News]] |title= New smartphone app offers legal advice for random police encounters |date= June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A user-friendly navigation system (interface) provides contextual, situation-based cues to provide information related to a situation.
*  A personalized message of updates about [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic location]] is sent to [[In Case of Emergency|emergency contacts]].
* Exact words to use and applicable rights are provided.
* Audio, photo, and video recordings are saved and uploaded to [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], Google Drive, OneDrive, or Box.

[[File:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|thumb|Legal systems of the world]]
The contemporary '''legal systems of the world''' are generally based on one of four basic [[systems]]: [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[common law]], [[statutory law]], [[religious law]] or combinations of these. However, the legal system of each country is shaped by its unique history and so incorporates individual variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://saint-claire.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Legal-Systems-of-the-World.pdf|title=Legal Systems of the World|last=|first=|date= |website= |access-date=|publisher = Saint: Security Sector Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The science that studies Law at the level of legal systems is called [[Comparative Law]].

Both ''civil'' (also known as ''Roman'') and ''common'' law systems can be considered the most widespread in the world: civil law because it is the most widespread by landmass, and common law because it is employed by the greatest number of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Principles of International Insolvency''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;lpg=PT454&amp;ots=D-khdgPbR4&amp;dq=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;pg=PT454#v=onepage&amp;q=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;f=false|date=2007|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Maps of World Financial Law:Law and practice of international finance series''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Maps_of_World_Financial_Law.html?id=Z5vKGAAACAAJ|date=2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''English Common Law is the most widespread legal system in the world''|url=https://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/061108.pdf|date=November 2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}
[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Shamash]] (the [[Babylonia]]n sun god) hands King [[Hammurabi]] a [[Code of Hammurabi|code of law]]]]

The central source of law that is recognized as authoritative is [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in a constitution or [[statute]] passed by [[legislature]], to amend a code.
While the concept of codification dates back to the [[Code of Hammurabi]] in [[Babylon]] ca. 1790 BC, civil law systems derive from the [[Roman Empire]] and, more particularly, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' issued by the Emperor [[Justinian]] ca. AD 529. This was an extensive reform of the law in the [[Byzantine Empire]], bringing it together into codified documents. Civil law was also partly influenced by [[religious law]]s such as [[Canon law]] and [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Badr&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 [Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977]|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi /&gt; Civil law today, in theory, is interpreted rather than developed or made by judges. Only [[legislature|legislative]] enactments (rather than legal [[precedent]]s, as in common law) are considered legally binding.

Scholars of [[comparative law]] and economists promoting the [[legal origins theory]] usually subdivide civil law into four distinct groups:
* '''French civil law''': in France, the [[Benelux]] countries, Italy, Romania, Spain and former colonies of those countries;
* '''[[Law of Germany#Civil law|German civil law]]''': in Germany, Austria, Russia, Switzerland, Estonia, Latvia,  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo*, Macedonia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, [[Portugal]] and [[Portuguese Empire|its former colonies]], Turkey, and East Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (Republic of China);
* '''[[Scandinavian law|Scandinavian civil law]]''': in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. As historically integrated in the Scandinavian cultural sphere, Finland and Iceland also inherited the system.
* '''[[Chinese law]]''': a mixture of civil law and [[socialist law]] in use in the People's Republic of China.

However, some of these legal systems are often and more correctly said to be of hybrid nature:
*'''Napoleonic to Germanistic influence ([[Italian law|Italian civil law]]) '''
The [[Italy|Italian]] civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865, introducing germanistic elements due to the geopolitical alliances of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.teoriaestoriadeldirittoprivato.com/index.php?com=statics&amp;option=index&amp;cID=132 |title = Towards a Civil Code: The Italian Experience|last = Triggiano|first = Annalisa|website = Teoria e Storia del Diritto Privato}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian approach has been imitated by other countries including the [[Netherlands]] (1992), [[Argentina]] (2014), [[Brazil]] (2002) and [[Portugal]] (1966). Most of them have innovations introduced  by the Italian legislation, including the unification of the [[civil code|civil]] and [[Commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol16/iss2/8/ |title = On the Legal Method of the Uniform Commercial Code|journal = Law and Contemporary Problems|volume = 16|number = 2|first= Mitchell|last= Franklin|date = Spring 1951|pages = 330-343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Germanistic to Napoleonic influence ([[Swiss law|Swiss civil law]])'''
The [[Swiss civil code]] is considered mainly influenced by the German civil code and partly influenced by the French civil code.  The civil code of the [[Republic of Turkey]] is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s presidency as part of the government's progressive reforms and secularization.

A comprehensive list of countries that base their legal system on a [[Codification (law)|codified]] civil law follows:

|The Spanish legal tradition had a great influence on the [[Civil Code of Argentina]], basically a work of the Argentine [[jurist]] [[Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield]], who dedicated five years of his life on this task. The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1871. Beyond the influence of the Spanish legal tradition, the Argentinian Civil Code was also inspired by the Draft of the Brazilian Civil Code, the [[wikt:Draft|Draft]] of the Spanish Civil Code of 1851, the [[Napoleonic code]] and the [[Civil Code (Chile)|Chilean Civil Code]]. The sources of this Civil Code also include various theoretical legal works, mainly of the great French jurists of the 19th century. It was the first Civil Law that consciously adopted as its cornerstone the distinction between i. rights from obligations and ii. real property rights, thus distancing itself from the French model.

The Argentinian Civil Code was also in effect in Paraguay, as per a [[Paraguayan]] law of 1880, until the new Civil Code went in force in 1987.

In Argentina, this 1871 Civil Code remained in force until August 2015, when it was replaced by the new ''Código Civil y Comercial de la Nación''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm |title=Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas Públicas - Argentina |publisher=InfoLEG |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial |title=Comienza a regir el nuevo Código Civil y Comercial |publisher=Jornadaonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{flagicon|Chile}} [[Law of Chile|Chile]]
|Based on the Chilean Civil Law inspired by the Napoleonic Civil Law. The Spanish legal tradition exercised an especially great influence on the civil code of Chile. On its turn, the Chilean civil code influenced to a large degree the drafting of the civil codes of other [[Latin-American]] states. For instance, the codes of Ecuador (1861) and Colombia (1873) constituted faithful reproductions of the Chilean code, but for very few exceptions. The compiler of the [[Civil Code of Chile]], Venezuelan [[Andrés Bello]], worked for its completion for almost 30 years, using elements, of the Spanish law on the one hand, and of other [[Western law]]s, especially of the French one, on the other. Indeed, it is noted that he consulted and used all of the codes that had been issued till then, starting from the era of [[Justinian]].

The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1857. The influence of the [[Napoleonic code]] and the Law of Castile of the Spanish colonial period (especially the ''[[Siete Partidas]]''), is great; it is observed however that ''e.g.'' in many provisions of [[property law|property]] or [[contract law]], the solutions of the French ''code civil'' were put aside in favor of pure [[Roman law]] or Castilian law.

The present Civil Code went into effect 1 January 1888, and was influenced by the [[Napoleonic Code]] and the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 (from its 1851 draft version).
|-
|{{flagicon|Croatia}} [[Law of Croatia|Croatia]]
|Based on the Germanic Civil Law. Croatian Law system is largely influenced by German and  Austrian law systems. It is significantly influenced by the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Civil Code of the Austrian Empire]] from 1811, known in Croatia as ''"General Civil Law"'' ''("Opći građanski zakon")''. OGZ was in force from 1853&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=45220 |title=Opći građanski zakonik &amp;#124; Hrvatska enciklopedija |publisher=Enciklopedija.hr |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1946. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-controlled [[puppet state]] that was established in 1941 during [[World War II]], used the OGZ as a basis for the 1943 ''"Base of the Civil Code for the Independent State of Croatia"'' ''("Osnova građanskoga zakona za Nezavisnu Državu Hrvatsku")''. After the War, Croatia become a member of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Federation]] which enacted in 1946 the ''"Law on immediate voiding of regulations passed before April 6, 1941 and during the enemy occupation"'' ''("Zakon o nevaženju pravnih propisa donesenih prije 6. travnja 1941. i za vrijeme neprijateljske okupacije")''. By this law OGZ was declared invalid as a whole, but implementation of some of its legal rules was approved. During the post-War era, the Croatian legal system become influenced by elements of the [[socialist law]]. Croatian civil law was pushed aside, and it took norms of public law and legal regulation of the [[Socialization (economics)|social ownership]]. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on June 25, 1991, the previous legal system was used as a base for writing new laws.  ''"The Law on Obligations"'' ''("Zakon o obveznim odnosima")'' was enacted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Croatian legal history in the European context, Dalibor Čepulo, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Croatia as a [[European union]] member state implements elements of the [[Acquis communautaire|EU acquis]] into its legal system.

|-
|{{flagicon|Guatemala}} [[Law of Guatemala|Guatemala]]
|Based on Napoleonic civil law. Guatemala has had three Civil Codes: the first one from 1877, a new one introduced in 1933, and the one currently in force, which was passed in 1963. This Civil Code has suffered some reforms throughout the years, as well as a few derogations relating to areas which have subsequently been regulated by newer laws, such as the Code of Commerce and the Law of the National Registry of Persons. In general, it follows the tradition of the Roman-French system of civil codification.

Regarding the theory of 'sources of law' in the Guatemalan legal system, the 'Ley del Organismo Judicial' recognizes 'the law' as the main legal source (in the sense of legislative texts), although it also establishes 'jurisprudence' as a complementary source. Although jurisprudence technically refers to judicial decisions in general, in practice it tends to be confused and identified with the concept of 'legal doctrine', which is a qualified series of identical resolutions in similar cases pronounced by higher courts (the Constitutional Court acting as a 'Tribunal de [[Amparo (law)|Amparo]]', and the Supreme Court acting as a 'Tribunal de Casación') whose theses become binding for lower courts.

==Common law==
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King John of England signs [[Magna Carta]]]]
Common law and [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]] (legal concept) are systems of law whose sources are the decisions in cases by judges. In addition, every system will have a legislature that passes new laws and statutes. The relationships between statutes and judicial decisions can be complex. In some jurisdictions, such statutes may overrule judicial decisions or codify the topic covered by several contradictory or ambiguous decisions. In some jurisdictions, judicial decisions may decide whether the jurisdiction's constitution allowed a particular statute or statutory provision to be made or what meaning is contained within the statutory provisions. Statutes were allowed to be made by the government. Common law developed in England, influenced by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] law and to a much lesser extent by the [[Norman conquest of England]], which introduced legal concepts from [[Norman law]], which, in turn, had its origins in [[Salic law]]. Common law was later inherited by the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and almost every former colony of the [[British Empire]] has adopted it ([[Malta]] being an exception). The doctrine of ''stare decisis'', also known as ''case law'' or ''[[precedent]] by courts'', is the major difference to codified civil law systems.

Common law is currently in practice in [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], most of the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] ([[English law|England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]]), [[Law of Australia|Australia]], [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[Law of India|India]] (excluding [[Goa civil code|Goa]]),{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed because the Supreme Court of India's decisions override many lower courts|date=June 2014}} [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Law of Canada|Canada]] (excluding [[Quebec law|Quebec]]), [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], the [[Law of the United States|United States]] (on a state level excluding [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]]), and many other places. In addition to these countries, several others have adapted the common law system into a mixed system. For example, Nigeria operates largely on a common law system, but incorporates religious law.

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] takes an approach mixing civil law (based on the treaties) with an attachment to the importance of case law. One of the most fundamental documents to shape common law is the English [[Magna Carta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html|accessdate=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which placed limits on the power of the English Kings. It served as a kind of medieval bill of rights for the aristocracy and the judiciary who developed the law.

==Religious law==
{{main|Religious law}}

Religious law refers to the notion of a religious system or document being used as a legal source, though the methodology used varies. For example, the use of Jewish and [[Halakha]] for public law has a static and unalterable quality, precluding amendment through legislative acts of government or development through judicial precedent; Christian [[Canon law]] is more similar to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in its use of [[code (law)|codes]]; and Islamic [[Sharia]] law (and [[Fiqh]] jurisprudence) is based on legal [[precedent]] and reasoning by [[analogy]] (''[[Qiyas]]''), and is thus considered similar to [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Finance: Law, Economics, and Practice|first=Mahmoud A.|last=El-Gamal|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-86414-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main kinds of religious law are [[Sharia]] in Islam, [[Halakha]] in Judaism, and [[canon law]] in some Christian groups. In some cases these are intended purely as individual moral guidance, whereas in other cases they are intended and may be used as the basis for a country's legal system. The latter was particularly common during the [[Middle Ages]].

[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Aleppo Codex: 10th century Hebrew Bible with Masoretic pointing]]
The Halakha is followed by [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|conservative]] Jews in both ecclesiastical and civil relations. No country is fully governed by Halakha, but two Jewish people may decide, because of personal belief, to have a dispute heard by a Jewish court, and be bound by its rulings.

The Islamic legal system of [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) and [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) is the most widely used [[religious law]], and one of the three most common legal systems in the world alongside common law and civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on both [[divine law]], derived from the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]], and the rulings of [[Ulema]] (jurists), who used the methods of ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus), ''[[Qiyas]]'' (analogical deduction), ''[[Ijtihad]]'' (research) and ''[[Urf]]'' (common practice) to derive ''[[Fatwā]]'' (legal opinions). An Ulema was required to qualify for an ''[[Ijazah]]'' ([[Law degree|legal]] [[doctorate]]) at a ''[[Madrasa]]'' ([[law school]]/[[college]]) before they could issue ''Fatwā''.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [175–77]|doi=10.2307/604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], classical Islamic law may have had an [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|influence]] on the development of common law&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=John A.|title=The Islamic Origins of the Common Law|journal=[[North Carolina Law Review]]|date=June 1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1635–1739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several civil law institutions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharia law governs a number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, though most countries use Sharia law only as a supplement to national law. It can relate to all aspects of civil law, including property rights, contracts or public law.

==Pluralistic systems==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Common law]] --&gt;

===Civil law and canon law===
{{main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
[[Canon law]] is not divine law, properly speaking, because it is not found in revelation. Instead, it is seen as human law inspired by the word of God and applying the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the church. [[Canon law]] regulates the internal ordering of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]]. Canon law is amended and adapted by the legislative authority of the church, such as [[episcopal conference|councils of bishops]], individual bishops for their respective sees, the [[Pope]] for the entire Catholic Church, and the British Parliament for the [[Church of England]].

'''Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999''' ('''MCOCA''') is a law enacted by [[Maharashtra]] state in [[India]] in 1999 to combat organised crime and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/jan/10spec.htm |title=Special: Lawyer Shrikant Bhat Control of Organised Crime Act |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preamble to MCOCA says that "the existing legal framework, i.e. the penal and procedural laws and the adjudicatory system, are found to be rather inadequate to curb or control the menace of organised crime. Government has, therefore, decided to enact a special law with stringent and deterrent provisions including in certain circumstances power to intercept wire, electronic or oral communication to control the menace of organised crime." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/maharashtra1999.htm |title=Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 |publisher=Satp.org |date=1999-02-24 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike normal law the [[Confession (law)|confessions]] before senior police officers are admissible, not only against the accused giving the confession but also against the other accused in the same case. There is no provision for granting [[anticipatory bail]] for 6 months  to the accused.&lt;ref name="MCOCA extended to Delhi"&gt;{{cite news|title=MCOCA extended to Delhi|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2002/01/08/stories/2002010803220300.htm|accessdate=28 July 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=Jan 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 in order to curb the increasing crimes of the organised gangs this law was extended to the National Capital Territory of [[Delhi]] by the Union Home Ministry.&lt;ref name="MCOCA extended to Delhi"/&gt; Ajai Raj Sharma the then Commissioner of [[Delhi Police]] told a press conference, "Organised gangs had been trying to gain a foothold in the national capital but their designs had been foiled so far. MCOCA will help in dealing with it more effectively.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/mcoca-extended-to-delhi_30724.html MCOCA extended to Delhi] zeenews.india.com | January 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

As different parts of China have very different [[standard of living|standards of living]], China does not set one [[minimum wage]] for the entire nation. Instead, the task of setting minimum wages is delegated to the local governments. Each [[Provinces of China|province, municipality, or region]] sets its own minimum wage in accordance with its own local conditions. According to the country's Employment Promotion Plan, minimum wages are supposed to increase in accordance with local living standards by at least 13 percent through 2015 and be no less than 40 percent of the average local wages. Minimum wages under such policies increased by an average 12.6 percent rate between 2008-2012. However, the growth rate of minimum wage levels decreased in 2016,  reflecting the Chinese government’s effort to reduce pressure on enterprises resulting from the uneven growth between labor costs and production rates.&lt;ref name=Zito/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2015/05/26/complete-guide-2015-minimum-wage-levels-across-china.html|title=A Complete Guide to 2015 Minimum Wage Levels Across China|last=Rainy Yao and Edoardo Rosettani|first=|date=|website=May 26, 2015|publisher=China Briefing|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=China promises rise in minimum wage to close income gap|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-21347819|accessdate=11 August 2014|publisher=BBC|date=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall trends for the change of minimum wage levels diverge across provinces, with much smaller increases in developed regions and more rapid growth in less developed regions. From June 2015 and June 2016, 22 regions made changes to their minimum wage levels. In 2016, the average growth rate dropped to 14.5 percent from 17 percent in 2015. It is noteworthy that the Guangdong provincial government announced that it would maintain 2015 minimum wage levels in 2016 and 2017, and the minimum wage growth rate in Shanghai has decreased from 12.3 in 2015 to 8.4 percent in 2016. Guizhou province stands out as the region carrying the most significant hike of minimum wage levels in 2016, 55 percent.

== Minimum wage levels by jurisdiction ==

The table below lists monthly and hourly minimum wages by province and wage districts. Provinces are divided into different wage districts: [[Guizhou]], for instance, is divided up into Class A, B, and C, which each have their own minimum monthly and hourly wage. Note: these figures do not take into account deductions, such as pensions or social insurance.&lt;ref name=Zito/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[philosophy]], the '''natural order''' is the [[morality|moral]] source from which [[natural law]] seeks to derive its [[authority]].  Natural order encompasses the natural relations of beings to one another in the absence of [[law]], which natural law attempts to reinforce. This is related to [[Dharma]].

In contrast, [[divine law]] seeks authority from [[God]], and [[Jurisprudence|positive law]] seeks authority from [[government]].

The term is used by [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] in his book, ''[[Democracy: The God That Failed|Democracy: The God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order]]'', to defend [[anarcho-capitalism]].

The term is used by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his writings.

The term '''postfeminism''' (alternatively rendered as '''post-feminism''') is used to describe reactions against contradictions and absences in [[feminism]], especially [[second-wave feminism]] and [[third-wave feminism]]. The term ''postfeminism'' is sometimes confused with subsequent feminisms such as [[Fourth-wave feminism|4th wave-feminism]], and "women of color feminism" (e.g. hooks, 1996; Spivak, 1999).

The ideology of postfeminism is recognized by its contrast with prevailing or preceding feminism. Postfeminism strives towards the next stage in gender-related progress, and as such is often conceived as in favor of a society that is no longer defined by [[gender binary]] and [[gender role]]s. A postfeminist is a person who believes in, promotes, or embodies any of various ideologies springing from the feminism of the 1970s, whether supportive of or antagonistic towards classical feminism.

Postfeminism can be considered a critical way of understanding the changed relations between feminism, [[popular culture]] and [[femininity]]. Postfeminism may also present a critique of second-wave feminism or third-wave feminism by questioning their binary thinking and essentialism, their vision of sexuality, and their perception of relationships between femininity and feminism. It may also complicate or even deny entirely the notion that absolute gender equality is necessary, desirable or realistically achievable.

Second-wave feminism is often critiqued for being too "white", too "straight", and too "liberal", thus resulting in the needs of women from marginalized groups and cultures being ignored. However, since [[intersectionality]] is a product of third-wave feminism, the references to such as postfeminist are open to challenge and may be more properly considered feminist.

==History of the term==
While ''postfeminism'' was first used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, it is now used as a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.  It may also be used to invoke the view that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gender.cawater-info.net/knowledge_base/rubricator/feminism_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the meaning of postfeminism has broadened in scope, encompassing many different meanings, as is the case with feminism. Within feminist literature, definitions tend to fall into two main categories: 1) “death of feminism”, “anti-feminism”, “feminism is irrelevant now” and 2) the next stage in feminism, or feminism that intersects with other “post-” philosophies/theories, such as [[postmodernism]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postcolonialism]].

In 1919, a journal was launched in which "female literary radicals" stated "'we're interested in people now—not in men and women'", that "moral, social, economic, and political standards 'should not have anything to do with sex'", that it would "be 'pro-woman without being anti-man'", and that "their stance [is called] 'post-feminist'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy F. Cott|Cott, Nancy F.]], ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, [2d printing?] pbk 1987 ({{ISBN|0-300-04228-0}})) (cloth {{ISBN|0-300-03892-5}}), p. 282 (author prof. American studies &amp; history, Yale Univ.) (book is largely on U.S. feminism in 1910s–1920s) (n. 23 (at end) omitted) (n. 23 (in full): "23. ''Judy'' 1:1 (Jun. 1919); 2:3 (1919), n.p., SL." ("SL" in small capitals &amp; abbreviating "The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts", per ''id.'', p. 285 (Abbreviations Used in Notes (Libraries)))).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against [[second-wave feminism]]. Postfeminism is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;Wright, Elizabeth, ''Lacan and Postfeminism'' (Icon Books, 2000), {{ISBN|978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;Modleski, Tania. Feminism without Women: Culture and Criticism in a "Postfeminist" Age. New York: Routledge, 1991, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and were overly generalizing in their criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Amelia. "Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art," New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action, Eds. Joana Frueh, Cassandra L. Langer and Arlene Raven. New York: HarperCollins, 1994. 16–41, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw the popularization of this term, in both the academic world as well as the media world. It was seen as a term of both commendation and scorn. [[Toril Moi]], a professor at Duke University, originally coined the term in 1985 in Sexual/Textual politics to advocate a feminism that would deconstruct the binary between equality based on "liberal" feminism and difference-based or "radical" feminism. There is confusion surrounding the intended meaning of "post" in the context of "postfeminism". This confusion has plagued the very meaning of "postfeminism" since the 1990s. While the term has seemed on the one hand to announce the end of feminism, on the other hand it has itself become a site of feminist politics.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4149214|title = Feminism, Ethics, and History, or What is the "Post" in Postfeminism?|journal = Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 29–44|last1 = Kavka|first1 = Misha|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, feminist history is characterized by the struggle to find out the present situation—often articulated as a concern about whether there is still such a thing called "feminism"—by writing in the past. It is here that the meaning of "post" as a historical break is troubling, for "post" offers to situate feminism in history by proclaiming the end of this history. It then confirms feminist history as a thing of the past. However, some claim that it is impossible that feminism could be aligned with "post" when it is unthinkable, as it would be the same as calling the current world a post racist, post-classist, and post-sexist society.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==Characteristics==

The early part of the 1980s was when the media began labeling teenage women and women in their twenties the "postfeminist generation". After twenty years, the term postfeminist is still used to refer to young women, "who are thought to benefit from the women's movement through expanded access to employment and education and new family arrangements but at the same time do not push for further political change", Pamela Aronson, Professor of Sociology, asserts. Postfeminism is a highly debated topic since it implies that feminism is "dead" and "because the equality it assumes is largely a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Feminists or "Postfeminists"?: Young Women's Attitudes toward Feminism and Gender Relations | journal = Gender and Society | year = 2003 | first = Pamela | last = Aronson | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 903–22 | doi=10.1177/0891243203257145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Diane Davis|Prof. D. Diane Davis]], postfeminism is just a continuation of what first- and second-wave feminisms want.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Debra Diane, ''Breaking Up [at] Totality: A Rhetoric of Laughter'' (Carbondale: Southern Ill. Univ. Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|0-8093-2228-5}})), p. 141 n. 8 (brackets in title so in original) (author asst. prof. rhetoric, Univ. of Iowa).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted at Kent State University narrowed postfeminism to four main claims: support for feminism declined; women began hating feminism and feminists; society had already attained social equality, thus making feminism outdated; and the label "feminist" was disliked due to negative stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Elaine J.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Marnie Salupo|date=2003|title=The Myth of Postfeminism|jstor=3594675|journal=Gender and Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=878–902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PPp7dfrNTroC&amp;pg=PP1#v=snippet&amp;q=rodriguez&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives|last=Abbott|first=Pamela|last2=Tyler|first2=Melissa|last3=Wallace|first3=Claire|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781134382453|location=|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of postfeminist work==

In her 1994 book ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] considers much of modern academic [[feminist theory]] and the feminist movement to be [[gynocentrism|gynocentric]]. She labels this "[[gender feminism]]" and proposes "[[equity feminism]]"—an ideology that aims for full civil and legal equality. She argues that while the feminists she designates as gender feminists advocate preferential treatment and portray women as victims, equity feminism provides a viable alternative form of feminism.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;Hoff Sommers, Christina, Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions and her other work have caused Hoff Sommers to be described as an antifeminist by some other feminists.&lt;ref name=Flood&gt;Flood, Michael (7 July 2004). "Backlash: Angry men's movements", in Stacey Elin Rossi, ed.: The Battle and Backlash Rage On. N.p.: XLibris, 273. {{ISBN|1-4134-5934-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Uncovering the Right—Female Anti-Feminism for Fame and Profit |url=http://organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html |accessdate=2007-12-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215141226/http://www.organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary feminists, such as [[Katha Pollitt]] or [[Nadine Strossen]], consider feminism to hold simply that "women are people." Views that separate the sexes rather than unite them are considered by these writers to be ''sexist'' rather than ''feminist''.&lt;ref name=Pollitt&gt;Pollitt, Katha, ''Reasonable Creatures: Essays on Women and Feminism '' (Vintage, 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-679-76278-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strossen&gt;Strossen, Nadine, ''Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women's Rights'' (Prentice Hall &amp; IBD, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-684-19749-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amelia Jones]] has authored post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s/1990s and portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and criticized it using generalizations.

One of the earliest modern uses of the term was in Susan Bolotin's 1982 article "Voices of the Post-Feminist Generation", published in ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''. This article was based on a number of interviews with women who largely agreed with the goals of feminism, but did not identify as feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Ruth. The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America. New York: Viking, 2000, 275, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Faludi]], in her 1991 book ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', argued that a backlash against second wave feminism in the 1980s had successfully re-defined feminism through its terms. She argued that it constructed the [[women's liberation movement]] as the source of many of the problems alleged to be plaguing women in the late 1980s. She also argued that many of these problems were illusory, constructed by the media without reliable evidence. According to her, this type of backlash is a historical trend, recurring when it appeared that women had made substantial gains in their efforts to obtain equal rights.&lt;ref name=Faludi_Backlash&gt;Faludi, Susan, ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women'' (Three Rivers Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angela McRobbie]] argued that adding the prefix ''post-'' to ''feminism'' undermined the strides that feminism made in achieving equality for everyone, including women. In McRobbie's opinion, postfeminism gave the impression that equality has been achieved and feminists could now focus on something else entirely. McRobbie believed that postfeminism was most clearly seen on so-called feminist media products, such as ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]], [[Sex and the City]]'', and ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Female characters like Bridget Jones and [[Carrie Bradshaw]] claimed to be liberated and clearly enjoy their sexuality, but what they were constantly searching for was the one man who would make everything worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = McRobbie | first = Angela | author-link = Angela McRobbie | title = Post‐feminism and popular culture | journal = [[Feminist Media Studies]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 255&amp;ndash;264 | doi = 10.1080/1468077042000309937 | date = 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations of post feminism can be found in pop culture. Postfeminism has been seen in media as a form of feminism that accepts popular culture instead of rejecting it, as was typical with second wave feminists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feasey|first=Rebecca|date=7 August 2010|title=Charmed: Why Teen Television Appeals to Women|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|volume=34:1|pages=2–9|doi=10.3200/JPFT.34.1.2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many popular shows from the 90s and early 2000s are considered to be postfeminist works because they tend to focus on women who are empowered by popular cultural representations of other women. Because of this, postfeminists claimed that such media was more accessible and inclusive than past representations of women in the media; however, some feminists believe that postfeminist works focus too much on white, middle-class women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such shows and movies include ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]], [[Xena: Warrior Princess]], [[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]],'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].'' Another example is ''Sex and the City''. Carrie Bradshaw from ''Sex and the City'' is an example of a character living a post feminist life. While her character attempts to live a sexually liberated lifestyle, Bradshaw is stuck endlessly pursuing the love and validation of a man. The balance between Bradshaw's independent life as a successful columnist and desire to find a husband exemplifies the tension of post feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerhard|first=Jane|date=August 2006|title=Sex and the City, Feminist Media Studies|url=|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=5|pages=37–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these works also involve women monitoring their appearance as a form of self-management, be it in the form of dieting, exercise, or—most popularly—makeover scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politicsandculture.org/2009/11/09/post-feminism-in-popular-culture-a-potential-for-critical-resistance/|title=Post feminism in popular culture: A potential for critical resistance?|date=2009-11-09|work=Politics and Culture|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist literature—also known as [[Chick lit|chicklit]]—has been criticized by feminists for similar themes and notions. However, the genre is also praised for being confident, witty, and complicated, bringing in feminist themes, revolving around women, and reinventing standards of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/writingpostfeminism/gutsy|title=What is chick-lit? {{!}} Electronic Book Review|website=www.electronicbookreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples can also be found in ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]''. The novels explore the complexity of girlhood in a society that assumes gender equality, which is in line with postfeminism. The constant surveillance and self policing of the series' protagonists depicts the performance of heterosexuality, hyperfemininity, and critical gaze forced upon girls. The materialism and performance from the girls in ''Pretty Little Liars'' critiques the notion that society has full gender equality, and thus offers a critique of postfeminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitney|first1=Sarah|title=Kisses, Bitches: Pretty Little Liars Frames Postfeminism's Adolescent Girl|journal=Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|date=11 November 2017|volume=36|issue=2|pages=353–377|doi=10.1353/tsw.2017.0026|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/677146|language=en|issn=1936-1645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on print jewelry advertisements in Singapore, Michelle Lazar analyses how the construction of 'postfeminist' femininity has given rise to a [[neo-liberal]] hybrid "pronounced sense of self or 'I-dentity'". She states that the increasing number of female wage earners has led to advertisers updating their image of women but that "through this hybrid postfeminist I-dentity, advertisers have found a way to reinstall a new normativity that coexists with the status quo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lazar | first = Michelle | title = Recuperating feminism, reclaiming femininity: Hybrid postfeminist I-dentity in consumer advertisements | journal = [[Gender and Language]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–224 | doi = 10.1558/genl.v8i2.205 | year = 2014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist ads and fashion have been criticized for using femininity as a commodity veiled as liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanaejournal.hu/vol7no2/kulcsar|title=AMERICANA: "A Critique of Post-feminism" by Zsófia Kulcsár|website=americanaejournal.hu|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''posthumous trial''' or '''post-mortem trial''' is a [[trial]] held after the [[defendant]]'s death. Posthumous trials can be held for a variety of reasons, including the legal declaration that the defendant was the one who committed the crime, to provide justice for society of family members of the victims, or to exonerate a wrongfully convicted person after their death. Due to the heavy cost, they are usually held only under extraordinary circumstances.

==Notable posthumous trials==
* [[Cadaver Synod]] of [[Pope Formosus]]
* [[Pope Boniface VIII]]
* [[Francesco Maria Carafa]], resulting in exoneration
* [[Retrial of Joan of Arc]], overturned her earlier heresy conviction 
* [[Sergei Magnitsky]]
* [[Henry Plummer]], resulting in a mistrial.

In its most general sense, the '''practice of law''' involves giving [[legal advice]] to clients, drafting legal documents for clients, and representing clients in legal [[negotiation]]s and [[court]] proceedings such as [[lawsuit]]s, and is applied to the professional services of a [[lawyer]] or attorney at law, [[barrister]], [[solicitor]], or [[civil law notary]]. However, there is a substantial amount of overlap between the practice of law and various other professions where clients are represented by  [[Agency (law)|agents]]. These professions include [[real estate]], [[banking]], [[accounting]], and [[insurance]]. Moreover, a growing number of [[legal document assistant]]s (LDAs) are offering services which have traditionally been offered only by lawyers and their employee paralegals. Many documents may now be created by [[computer]]-assisted drafting libraries, where the clients are asked a series of questions that are posed by the [[software]] in order to construct the [[Legal instrument|legal documents]].

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the practice of law is conditioned upon [[Admission to practice law|admission to practice of law]], and specifically [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] of a particular [[U.S. state|state]] or other territorial [[jurisdiction]]. The [[American Bar Association]] and the [[American Law Institute]] are among the organizations that are concerned with the interests of lawyers as a profession and the promulgation of uniform standards of professionalism and ethics, but regulation of the practice of law is left to the individual states, and their definitions vary.&lt;ref name="ABA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf |title=State Definitions of the Practice of Law |format=PDF |publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |accessdate=April 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114222449/https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf|archivedate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unauthorized practice of law===

"Unauthorized practice of law" (UPL) is an act sometimes prohibited by [[statute]], [[regulation]], or court rules.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;

====Definition====
The definition of "unauthorized practice of law" is variable, and is often conclusory and [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]],&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Garner, Bryan A. ed. |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition=7th |place=St. Paul MN |publisher=West |pages=1191–1192 |authorlink=Bryan A. Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''i.e.'', it is the doing of a lawyer's or [[counsel]]or's work by a non-lawyer for money.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;  There is some agreement that appearing in a legally constituted court in a legal proceeding to represent clients (particularly for a fee) is considered to be unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; But other variations are subject to interpretation and conflicting regulation, particularly as to the scope and breadth of the prohibition.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;  ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines unauthorized practice of law as "The practice of law by a person, typically a nonlawyer, who has not been licensed or admitted to practice law in a given jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;

The [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement]] (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The definitions and tests employed by courts to delineate unauthorized practice by non-lawyers have been vague or conclusory, while jurisdictions have differed significantly in describing what constitutes unauthorized practice in particular areas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain activities, such as the representation of another person in litigation, are generally proscribed.  Even in that area, many jurisdictions recognize exceptions for such matters as small-claims and landlord-tenant tribunals and certain proceedings in administrative agencies.  Moreover, many jurisdictions have authorized law students and others not locally admitted to represent indigent persons or others as part of clinical legal education programs. . . .&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restatement"&gt;{{cite book |title=Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers |publisher = American Law Institute|year=1998 |edition=4 cmt c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is more controversial is out-of-court activities, particularly drafting of documents and giving advice, and whether that is considered to be unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restatement"/&gt; Some states have defined the "practice of law" to include those who appear as a representative in arbitration or act as arbitrators in disputes.&lt;ref name="Spector"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.schiffhardin.com/binary/spector-arbitration.pdf |format=PDF |title=Arbitration and The Unauthorized Practice of Law |journal=[[ARIAS Quarterly U.S.]] |publisher=AIDA Reinsurance &amp; Insurance Arbitration Society |date=First Quarter 2006 |volume=13 |pages=16–19 |first1=David M. |last1=Spector |first2=Jessica |last2=Romero |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725085329/http://www.schiffhardin.com/binary/spector-arbitration.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there is a growing conflict between the multijurisdictional practice of law in arbitration proceedings in the financial service industry and state regulation of lawyers.&lt;ref name="BNA"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uslawwatch.com/2010/08/16/finance/bna-insights-state-regulation-unauthorized-practice-law-arbitration-mediation-trend-permitting-multijurisdictional-practice-alternative-dispute-resolution/  |title=BNA INSIGHTS: State Regulation of Unauthorized Practice of Law in Arbitration and Mediation: The Trend Toward Permitting Multijurisdictional Practice in Alternative Dispute Resolution |date=August 16, 2010 |work=Securities Regulation &amp; Law Report |publisher=[[Bureau of National Affairs]] |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a few exceptions, the general rule is that an appearance at an arbitration does not constitute the practice of law.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfRtIxtVG48C&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=arbitration%20as%20unauthorized%20practice%20of%20law&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q=arbitration%20as%20unauthorized%20practice%20of%20law&amp;f=false |title=Arbitration: essential concepts |first1=Steven C. |last1=Bennett |pages= 175–178 |place=New York |date=May 2002 |publisher=Incisive Media, LLC |isbn= 978-0-9705970-8-3}} {{ISBN|0-9705970-8-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Texas]] law generally prohibits a person who is not an attorney from representing a client in a personal injury or property damage matter, and punishes a violation as a misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/PE/content/htm/pe.008.00.000038.00.htm Tex. Gov’t Code sec. 38.123.  Chapter 38 of the penal code, containing 38.122 and 38.123] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501190606/http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/PE/content/htm/pe.008.00.000038.00.htm |date=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states also criminalize the separate behavior of falsely claiming to be lawyer (in Texas, for example, this is a felony).&lt;ref&gt;Tex. Gov’t Code sec. 38.122&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enforcement====
Criminal laws and enforcement of "Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)" statutes is the organized bar's preferred method. In Florida, the unauthorized practice of law is a third degree felony,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0400-0499/0454/Sections/0454.23.html §454.23 Fla. Stat.] (2016)("Any person not licensed or otherwise authorized to practice law in this state who practices law in this state or holds himself or herself out to the public as qualified to practice law in this state ... commits a felony of the third degree."&lt;/ref&gt; which is punishable by up to six months in prison&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.082.html §775.082(3)(e) Fla. Stat.](2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and $5000 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.083.html §775.083(1)(c) Fla. Stat.] (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Jersey]] has a law which makes it a “[[Disorderly conduct|disorderly person]]s offense” to knowingly to engage in the unauthorized practice of law, and a “crime in the fourth degree” to commit UPL if one (a) creates a false impression that one is a lawyer; (b) derives a benefit from UPL, or (c) causes an injury by UPL.&lt;ref name="Federalist"/&gt;{{Cite NJSA|title=2C|chapter=21|section=22|citeonly=true}} In a 2015 survey by the American Bar Association, Florida had the largest budget—$1.8 million—nationwide for prosecuting the unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Draper|first1=Lindsay|title=2015 Survey of Unlicensed Practice of Law Committees|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/2015_upl_report_final.authcheckdam.pdf|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=17 December 2016|date=September 2015|quote=The Florida Bar continues to lead the country in funding UPL enforcement, spending approximately $1.8 million annually.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the state's interest in protecting the public and so-called "learned professions" from having unschooled persons practising them, and the state's insistence on enforcing a [[monopoly]], the existence of laws governing (or defining) "unauthorized practice of Law" does not, ''ipso facto'' mean that they will be enforced.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Unauthorized+Practice |title=Unauthorized practice |publisher=Free Dictionary |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History and future====
The American Bar Association proposed model rules regarding the unauthorized practice of law, which Judge [[Richard Posner]] characterized as an attempt to perpetuate a monopoly to the disadvantage of consumers.&lt;ref name="Federalist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fed-soc.org/publications/detail/the-abas-attack-on-unauthorized-practice-of-law-and-consumer-choice |title=The ABA's Attack on "Unauthorized" Practice of Law and Consumer Choice |date=May 1, 2003 |first1=George W.C. |last1=McCarter |publisher=[[The Federalist Society|The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies]] |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge observed that the legal profession is “a cartel of providers of services relating to society’s laws” which cartel's focus is to restrict entry. "Modern economists call it '[[Rent-seeking|rent seeking]]', but throughout recorded history, skilled crafts and professions have tried to raise their members’ incomes by using the power of the state to limit entry."&lt;ref name="Federalist"/&gt;

The practice of law was not formally regulated in [[Arizona]] for a time. However, the Arizona Supreme Court found independent inherent authority to regulate the practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Creasy'', 198 Ariz. 539 (2000). See generally Jonathan Rose, "Unauthorized Practice of Law in Arizona: A Legal and Political Problem That Won't Go Away", 34 Ariz. St. L.J. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona's statute criminalizing unauthorized practice of law was allowed to lapse from a [[Sunset provision|sunset law]] in 1985. Rose suggests that legislative proposals to recriminalize the unauthorized practice of law have heretofore failed because of anti-lawyer sentiment in Arizona politics.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 593.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Rose asserts that resentment lingers from an unpopular interpretation of the old statute in ''State Bar v. Arizona Land Title &amp; Trust Co.'', 90 Ariz. 76 (1961). This ruling imposed sanctions on a title and realty company engaged in drafting contracts. Rose says, "Throughout the country, various jurisdictions have developed numerous tests for defining the practice of law. But none is broader nor more all-encompassing than that articulated in ''Arizona Title''."&lt;ref&gt;Rose at 588.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attorney participation====
In the United States, the rules of professional conduct generally prohibit an attorney from assisting a non-attorney from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. An attorney therefore may not partner with or split fees with a non-attorney in the performance of any sort of legal work. Furthermore, an attorney may not employ a disbarred or suspended attorney in a legal practice where former clients of the disbarred or suspended attorney will be represented. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7880">'''Prohibitionism''' is a [[legal philosophy]] and [[political theory]] often used in [[lobbying]] which holds that citizens will abstain from actions if the actions are typed as unlawful (i.e. prohibited) and the prohibitions are enforced by law enforcement.&lt;ref name=cantystrategies&gt;C Canty, A Sutton. ''Strategies for community-based drug law enforcement: From prohibition to harm reduction''; in T Stockwell, PJ Gruenewald, JW Toumbourou, WLoxley W, eds. ''Preventing Harmful Substance Use: The Evidence Base for Policy and Practice.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2005. pp. 225-236.&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy has been the basis for many acts of [[statutory law]] throughout history, most notably when a large group of a given population disapproves of and/or feels threatened by an activity in which a smaller group of that population engages, and seeks to render that activity legally prohibited.&lt;ref name=cantystrategies/&gt;

== Examples ==
Acts of prohibition have included [[sumptuary law|prohibitions on types of clothing]] (and [[Public nudity|prohibitions on lack of clothing]]), prohibitions on [[gambling]] and [[striptease|exotic dancing]], the [[prohibition of drugs]] (for example, [[prohibition of alcohol|alcohol prohibition]] and [[cannabis prohibition]]), [[smoking ban|prohibitions on tobacco smoking]], and [[gun prohibition]]. Indeed, the period of [[Prohibition in the United States]] between 1920 and 1933 due to the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]] often is referred to simply as "[[Prohibition]]", as is the "[[War on Drugs]]" that succeeded it. &lt;br /&gt;
An additional example, called ''nettle war'': Since 2002 in [[France]] the sale of nettle liquid manure was prohibited, and since 2006, unauthorized plant protection products (such as nettle liquid manure) to sell, own and operate.  Even [[advertising]] and recommendations for these products were not allowed. Only since 2011, it was legalized again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000023912654 Decree 2011: Nettles were legalized again (fr)] Retrieved 16 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The film by [[Arte]] about it was completed in 2010 (''Nettle-war, mysterious plants - Nettle'', 42:04 minutes)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eraclito450.blogspot.de/2013/09/brennessel-krieg-geheimnisvolle.html nettle-war in France] Retrieved 16 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
The success of a measure of prohibitionism has been criticized as often depending too much upon effective enforcement of the relevant legislation. Some people{{Who|date=July 2011}} have argued this is because the majority of the targets of prohibitionism are in the category of [[victimless crime]], where they claim the harm that comes from the crime is non-existent, questionable, or only to the person who performs the act and even then the magnitude of the harm being relatively small.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Under this interpretation enforcement becomes a conflict between violation of statue and violation of free will.{{Why?|date=July 2011}} Since the acts prohibited often are enjoyable, enforcement is often the most harmful choice to the individual. This sometimes results in laws which rarely are enforced by anybody who does not have a financial or personal motivation to do so.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The difficulty of enforcing prohibitionist laws also criticized as resulting in selective enforcement, wherein the enforcers select the people they wish to prosecute based on other criteria, resulting in [[discrimination]] based on races, culture, nationality, or financial status. For example, [[United States|American]] philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] has criticized drug prohibition as being a technique of [[social control]] of the "so-called dangerous classes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20020208.htm Noam Chomsky, "On the War on Drugs", ''Week Online'', DRCNet, February 8, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prohibitionism based laws have the added problem of calling attention to the behavior that they are attempting to prohibit.  This can make the behavior interesting and exciting, and cause its popularity to increase. This is essentially in relation with the [[Streisand effect]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7545">The '''right of reply''' generally means the right to defend oneself against public criticism in the same venue where it was published. In some countries, such as Brazil, it is a legal or even constitutional right. In other countries, it is not a legal right as such, but a right which certain media outlets and publications choose to grant to people who have been severely criticised by them, as a matter of editorial policy.

==By Law==

===Brazil===
The [[Brazilian Constitution]] guarantees the right of reply (''direito de resposta'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituicao.htm] (article 5, V) Retrieved November 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====European Union====
In Europe, there have been proposals for a legally enforceable right of reply that applies to all [[mass media|media]], including [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], and other print media, along with [[radio]], [[television]], and the [[internet]]. In 1974, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe already voted a resolution granting a right of reply to all individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016805048e1 |title=Resolution of the Committee of Ministers on the Right of Reply|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of a 2004 [[Council of Europe]] recommendation defined a right of reply as: ''offering a possibility to react to any information in the media presenting inaccurate facts &amp;hellip; which affect &amp;hellip; personal rights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805db3b6 |title=Draft Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the Right of Reply in the New Media Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediawise.org.uk/display_page.php?id=823 |title=MediaWise submission to DCMS consultation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116213940/http://www.mediawise.org.uk/display_page.php?id=823 |archivedate=2006-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual countries====
In the federal system of [[Germany]], the individual federal states are responsible for education, cultural affairs, and also the press and electronic media. All press laws of the 16 federal states guarantee the right to a counter presentation of factual statements which are deemed to be wrong by the individuals and organisations concerned. This is based on article 11 the national press law of 1874, and is found in all 16 laws as §11 or §10 in slightly modified versions.

[[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] have similar laws on the book. In Austria this is in article 9 of the national media law, in Switzerland in article 28g of the civil code.

In [[France]], the right to a corrective reply goes back to the [[:fr:loi sur la liberté de la presse du 29 juillet 1881|article 13 of the ''Law on the freedom of the press'' of July 29, 1881]] and is renewed and extended to broadcast and digital media via various laws and decrees.

The [[Belgium|Belgian]] law on the right to reply emerged in 1831 as article 13 of the 1831 decree on the press. This was replaced 130 years later by the law on the ''droit de réponse'' or «loi du 23 juin 1961». Originally referring only to the printed press, this law was amended in 1977 by the law of  «4 mars 1977 relative au droit de réponse dans l’audiovisuel» i.e. audiovisual media, published in the ''Moniteur Belge'' of March 15, 1977.&lt;ref name="RDTI_2007-27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obs_Avis-No5"/&gt; Since the federalisation of the Belgian state in 1980, the language communities are responsible for the media, and so the Flemish community has passed in 2005 a decrée dated March 4, 2005, which regulates the right to reply in articles 177 to 199, and the German language community has passed the decree of 27 June 2005, which simply refers to the law of 1961 as amended in 1977.&lt;ref name="RDTI_2007-27"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===United Nations===

The United Nations recognises the "International Right of Correction" through the "Convention on the International Right of Correction", which entered into force on August 24, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/u1circ.htm Convention on the International Right of Correction, 435 U.N.T.S. 191, entered into force August 24, 1962.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
A Florida right of reply law (referring to print media) was overturned by ''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'', [[Case citation|418 U.S. 241]] (1974), while a FCC policy (referring to broadcast media) was affirmed in ''[[Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC]]'',  [[Case citation|395 U.S. 367]]  (1969).

==By editorial policy==

===BBC===
A right of reply can also be part of the editorial policy of a news publication or an academic journal. The [[BBC]]'s Editorial Guidelines state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/page/guidelines-fairness-right-of-reply/ |title=BBC - Editorial Guidelines - Guidelines - Section 6: Fairness, Contributors and Consent - Right of Reply |author= |date= |work= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="font-style:italic;"&gt;When our output makes allegations of wrongdoing, iniquity or incompetence or lays out a strong and damaging critique of an individual or institution the presumption is that those criticised should be given a "right of reply", that is, given a fair opportunity to respond to the allegations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Australasian Journal of Philosophy''===
The ''[[Australasian Journal of Philosophy]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s editorial policy says:&lt;ref&gt;AJP: [http://www.ajp.aap.org.au/editorial-policy.html Editorial Policy] Retrieved August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="font-style:italic;"&gt;[A]uthors of the materials being commented on [in Discussion Notes] may be given a right of reply (subject to the usual refereeing), on the understanding that timely publication of the Note will take priority over the desirability of including both Note and Reply in the same issue of the Journal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase is the [[List of U.S. state mottos|state motto]] of [[Missouri]],  accepted, like many other states, as an element of its [[Seal of Missouri|state seal]]. It also appears on many [[coats of arms]], sometimes in variant forms such as {{lang|la|'''Salus populi suprema lex'''}}, or {{lang|la|'''Salus populi suprema est'''}}. These coats of arms include the [[City of Salford]], the [[London Borough of Lewisham]], [[Eastleigh]], [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]], [[Lytham St. Anne's]], [[Tipton]], [[Mid Sussex]], [[West Lancashire]], [[Swinton and Pendlebury]], [[Urmston]] and [[Willenhall]];&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Mottoes_in_Latin Mottoes in Latin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manassas Park, Virginia]], the [[Duquesne University School of Law]], and is used as the motto of the [[Vlaams Belang|Vlaams Belang political group]] in the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives]]{{fact|date=May 2015}}. The phrase is also used by the [http://portal.minv.sk/wps/wcm/connect/sk/site/top/uvod Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic] as an element on [https://www.google.sk/search?q=min+v+sk&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi75aOQ27rRAhWoE5oKHVkOBtkQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643#tbm=isch&amp;q=ministerstvo+vutra+sr&amp;imgrc=cLMtxLR0qPhA-M%3A its coat of arms]. It is present in a shortened form in an engraving of Oliver Cromwell by William Faithorne.

[[John Locke]] uses it as the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] in the form {{lang|la|Salus populi suprema lex}} in his ''[[Second Treatise on Government]]'' and refers to it as a fundamental rule for government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Locke |first=John |year=1689 |title=An Essay Concerning the True Original, Extent and End of Civil Government |at=Chapter XIII, section 158 |url=http://www.johnlocke.net/two-treatises-of-government-book-ii/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the inscription on the cornet of [[Roundhead]] and [[Leveller]] [[William Rainsborowe]] during the [[English Civil War]]. This motto was also endorsed by Hobbes at the beginning of Chapter 30 of ''Leviathan'' and by Spinoza in Chapter 19 of his ''Theological-Political Treatise.'' It was frequently quoted as {{lang|la|'''Salus populi est suprema lex'''}}} since at least 1737.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Salus+populi+est+suprema+lex%22&amp;tbs=cdr:1,cd_max:1850,sbd:1&amp;tbm=bks Google Books search] of books published before 1850&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioned Officers Association of the U.S. Public Health Service has adopted the phrase as its motto.

The [[Italian Army]] uses a similar motto, {{lang|la|'''Salus Rei Publicae Suprema Lex Esto'''}} ("The safeguard of the republic shall be the supreme law").

== International level ==
{{See also|List of LGBT-related cases before international courts and quasi-judicial bodies}}
Several attempts have been made to establish a right to same-sex marriage at the international level through strategic litigation, at the [[Human Rights Committee]] of the United Nations and at the [[European Court of Human Rights]], both of which currently have not yet recognized an equal right to marry for same-sex couples. The Human Rights Committee case was in 1999, with two same-sex couples as the plaintiffs/petitioners and the government of New Zealand as the defender/respondent. The ECHR case, ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'', was in 2010, with a same-sex couple as the plaintiffs/petitioners and the government of Austria as the respondents. Although both New Zealand and Austria then responded against the petitions then in each case, both countries now legally recognize same-sex unions, New Zealand in the form of same-sex marriage and Austria in the form of a registered partnership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19116">The conception of the [[separation of powers]] has been applied to the United Kingdom and the nature of its [[executive (government)|executive]] ([[UK government]], [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]]), [[Judiciary|judicial]] ([[Judiciary of England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Judiciary of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]) and [[Legislature|legislative]] ([[UK Parliament]], [[Scottish Parliament]], [[National Assembly for Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]) functions. Historically, the apparent merger of the executive and the legislature, with a powerful [[Prime Minister (UK)|Prime Minister]] drawn from the largest party in parliament and usually with a safe majority, led theorists to contend that the separation of powers is not applicable to the United Kingdom. However, in recent years it does seem to have been adopted as a necessary part of the [[UK constitution]].

The [[independence of the judiciary]] has never been questioned as a principle, although application is problematic. Personnel have been increasingly isolated from the other organs of government, no longer sitting in the [[House of Lords]] or in the [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]]. The court's ability to legislate through [[precedent]], its inability to question validly enacted law through [[legislative supremacy]] and [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], and the role of the [[European integration|Europe-wide institutions]] to legislate, execute and judge on matters also define the boundaries of the UK system.

==Approach==
Although the United Kingdom recognises [[parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], writers have stressed the importance of the [[independence of the judiciary]] in establishing the [[rule of law]], among them [[Trevor Allan (legal philosopher)|Trevor Allan]].&lt;ref name="ewing81"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the [[separation of powers]] has changed with the rise of judicial involvement in the affairs of government.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; [[Albert Venn Dicey]], writing in 1915 in ''[[Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution]]'', described the separation of powers as "the offspring of a double misconception".&lt;ref&gt;Dicey (1915). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Ivor Jennings|Sir Ivor Jennings]] has argued that it is of little relevance,&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;  and, faced with the role of the executive within the legislature, some authors describe only the independence of the judiciary as evidence that the model applies to the modern United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few critics of the applicability of the separation of powers to the United Kingdom question the basic division.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;
The separation of powers has come under the stress of increasing government intervention into social issues outside its former remit dominated by administration and foreign and military policy &amp;ndash; the creation of [[big government]].&lt;ref name="drewry191"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been seen by some as having led to a weakening of the concept of [[government]], replaced with the concept of governance.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} This lends itself to a more flexible approach considering the wide variation in the sorts of things that the "executive" does.&lt;ref name="drewry192"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach is to take an approach of [[public choice theory]]. The self-interest of political actors, under this theory, bridges the separate sections of government, drawing upon the approach of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] which applies the same rules to different organs, although heir approach to judges is separate.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 11&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt; Either theory would accept that there are wider decision making processes which are not restricted to a single branch of government.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). pp. 192&amp;ndash;193.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important idea is that variations within each separate part of government are as significant as differences in approach between branches, and require similar consideration.&lt;ref name="daintith12"&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Lord Mustill]] summarised the prevailing modern viewpoint in the 1995 judgment, ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union|R. v Home Secretary ex parte Fire Brigades Union]]'':&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union'' [1995] 2 AC 513 at 567.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a feature of the peculiarly UK conception of the separation of powers that Parliament, the executive and the courts each have their distinct and largely exclusive domain. Parliament has a legally unchallengeable right to make whatever laws it thinks right. The executive carries on the administration of the country in accordance with the powers conferred on it by law. The courts interpret the laws and see that they are obeyed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Division between organs of parliament==
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] creates law through the authority of the [[Queen-in-Parliament]], securing the support of at least the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and usually the [[House of Lords]] as well &amp;ndash; although since the passing act of the [[Parliament Act 1911]] this has not been necessary.&lt;ref name="ewing82"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]], the organs of the [[European Communities]] to legislate for the United Kingdom was recognised, by virtue of that Act. The power to create [[primary legislation]] has also been devolved to [[Scottish parliament|Scottish]] and [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh parliament]]s and to government ministers and local authorities to create [[secondary legislation]].&lt;ref name="ewing82"/&gt;

The executive comprises all official and public authorities (including [[local authorities]]) that govern the UK, from initiating and implementing legislation to the running of local and national services, such as [[waste collection|rubbish collection]]s and the [[police in the United Kingdom|police]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The civil service remains non-partisan (having little in common with the Cabinet and Prime Minister in that respect).&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive also exercises a number of powers under the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]], including [[foreign relations]]; many other actions are taken in the sovereign's name, from whom executive power is derived. The [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the  [[EU Commission|Commission]] of the [[European Union]] also exercise executive power, as do [[devolved government]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; Within the executive, there is no longer a clear elected&amp;ndash;non-elected divide: decision-makers are of both sorts since the widening of the government's remit.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the Civil Service serves the government, rather than usurping it, is one character of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judicial function determines the outcome of disputes and performs minor legislative and administrative functions. It oversees both public and private law through [[Civil court|civil]] and [[criminal court]]s and a variety of [[tribunal]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] has placed a requirement that courts take into account the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt;

The introduction of a tax is a [[legislature|legislative]] function; collecting tax is an [[executive (government)|executive]] and administrative function; settling tax disputes is a judicial function, as is [[judicial review]] of executive decisions.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; However, such an approach does not in itself enlighten what each role entails: the audit of public expenditure was a judicial function in the fourteenth century; an executive one in the eighteenth; and is now a legislative function. This is not in itself a measure of efficiency or good process, or what the function actually entails.&lt;ref name="daintith12"/&gt;

The separation of powers may require, depending on interpretation, that the membership of the three powers must be separate; that one of the three powers does not control the work of another; or that one organ of government should not exercise the powers of another. Keeping all three roles separate is seen as both theoretically and practically impossible.&lt;ref name="ewing87"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislature and executive==

The legislature and executive have a close relationship in the UK constitution. This led  [[Walter Bagehot]] to declare the "nearly complete fusion" of the roles in the nineteenth century. Other writers have stressed that the harmonisation of the legislature and executive does not preclude their distinctiveness.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; By convention, [[Minister (government)|government minister]]s are drawn from one of the two houses; the weight of democratic responsibility entails that most come from the House of Commons.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt; There is, however, a limit on their number.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; Most other members of the executive are excluded from holding legislative office, including the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]], the [[British Armed Forces|armed forces]], and the police, some of whom are prevented from becoming involved in any political affairs. The crossover in personnel is effectively limited to ministers.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; The Prime Minister wields considerable power on behalf of the executive, as party leader and chief spokesperson for government policy.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

When the government has a clear majority it wields a lot of power to push through legislation. A 1978 [[Select committee (Westminster system)|Select Committee]] report suggested:&lt;ref name="bradley88"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The balance of advantage between Parliament and Government is so weighted in favour of Government that it is inimical to the proper working of our parliamentary democracy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Between 1979 and 2010, the government had a safe majority which made the scrutiny of the government more difficult, although not impossible. The government could rely on its legislation being passed, although in some cases this did not happen.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt; The [[Conservative&amp;ndash;Liberal Democrat coalition]] complicated the party structure, since the [[leader of the Liberal Democrats]], [[Nick Clegg]], served as  [[Deputy Prime Minister]] under a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="drewry192"/&gt; However, the legislature can oust a government through a [[vote of no confidence]], as happened in [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|1979]].&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; This was driven by a growth in the political party structure, enforced through party discipline, as increased suffrage meant a far wider remit of government policy platforms.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

[[Secondary legislation]] &amp;ndash; where Parliament passes limited legislative rights to the executive through an [[Act of Parliament]] &amp;ndash; is also problematic, although necessary for the efficient working of government. Legal rules should be relatable to the Acts of Parliament on which they are based, but this is not always possible. Proper scrutiny of government actions under secondary legislation is needed to prevent abuse.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt;

==Executive and judiciary==
The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] remains an independent court, despite being organisationally part of the executive. The [[Lord Chancellor]], a member of the [[UK Cabinet|Cabinet]] is no longer a judge since the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].  The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] ([[England and Wales]]) and the [[Lord Advocate]] ([[Scottish law|Scotland]]) have "quasi-judicial roles" but are part of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 88&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of control, the [[independence of the judiciary]] is confirmed through statute, constitutional convention, and weight of opinion. In England and Wales, judges in [[superior courts]] cannot be arbitrarily dismissed by the executive, instead serving whilst in "good behaviour".&lt;ref name="ewing89"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in lower courts have similar protection from dismissal without due cause. Most members of tribunals cannot be dismissed by members of the government department of which they form part. This is important in cases of [[judicial review]] and other judicial methods of preventing government abuse of power.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt;

The judiciary undertake minor legislative functions in the form of court procedure, which, whilst the performance of a conflicting power, strengthens their independence. Tribunals are tied, but remain independent from, the executive. Government departments adjudicate on many decisions, and are required to take principles such as fairness and transparency into account in return.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; The courts provide only one method of dispute resolution, albeit one that is important where the government is one party and independence is necessary. The picture of which decision-making processes should be assigned to which body is complicated.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; There remain problems with the scope of role of the [[UK Home Secretary|Home Secretary]] in the [[penal system]] and judicial decisions with regard to sentencing.&lt;ref name="ewing90"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan LJ, in ''[[M v Home Office]]'', noted that:&lt;ref&gt;M v Home Office [1992] QB 270 at 314.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The proper constitutional relationship of the executive with the courts is that the courts will respect all acts of the executive within its lawful province, and that the executive will respect all decisions of the courts as to what its lawful province is.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In matters such as Extradition of British nationals, courts must first consent and the [[Home Secretary]] must agree and sign an Extradition Order or the individual cannot be extradited. A recent example of this is autistic computer-hacker [[Gary McKinnon]] being extradited to the United States. The courts decreed that he could be extradited and that it would not harm him. However the [[Home Secretary]] announced that she refused to sign the order as she believed it would harm his life rights and could lead to him committing suicide.

==Judiciary and legislature==
The judges of the [[UK Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] do not sit in the House of Lords. Until 2009, the judges appointed as [[Law Lords]] formed part of the House of Lords in Parliament. The creation of the Supreme Court ended confusion in name of both capacities. No [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] may hold a full-time position in the judiciary.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt;

The departure of the judiciary from the [[House of Lords]] has led to greater tension between the government, Parliament and the courts, as the senior judges are no longer able to amend and speak on Bills and Peers are no longer able to question the judges and thereby hold them to account.

The legislature retains the right to impeach members of the judiciary by agreement of both houses, but this has only happened once in three hundred years. There are restrictions on the criticism of judges in parliament.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; Courts are bound to interpret Acts of Parliament, even retrospectively, and [[legislative supremacy]] dictates that they cannot declare properly enacted law invalid. They are not bound by other resolutions of either house.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; The European Communities Act 1972 places a legislature-imposed requirement on the judiciary to follow European case law in relevant matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 90&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] allows the courts to make a [[declaration of incompatibility]], they cannot disapply legislation.&lt;ref name="ewing91"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each House of Parliament retains the right to punish offenders within its walls (including [[exclusive cognisance]]), with the potential to cause conflict.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt; However, ''[[R v Chaytor]]'' confirmed that right was limited in scope, and that it was the court that decided what that scope was.&lt;ref name="chaytor"&gt;''R v Chaytor''. [2010] [[UK Supreme Court|UKSC]] 52.&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered very unlikely that parliament would seek to protect those guilty of a crime unrelated to parliamentary business in this way.&lt;ref name="chaytor"/&gt; The courts have also exercised a quasi-legislative power through [[precedent]] &amp;ndash; for example, ending the [[marital rape]] exemption in ''[[R v R (Rape: marital exemption)]]''.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v R (Rape: marital exemption)'' [1992] 1 AC 599.&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular scope for the identification and application of personal liberties, and some cases have shaped the judiciary&amp;ndash;legislature relationship.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;

'''Socialist law''' or '''Soviet law''' denotes a general type of [[legal system]] which has been used in [[communist state|socialist and formerly socialist states]]. It is based on the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, with major modifications and additions from [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. There is controversy as to whether socialist law ever constituted a separate legal system or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=840224|pages=781–808|last1=Quigley|first1=J.|title=Socialist Law and the Civil Law Tradition|volume=37|issue=4|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|year=1989|doi=10.2307/840224}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, prior to the end of the [[Cold War]], ''socialist law'' would be ranked among the major legal systems of the world.

While civil law systems have traditionally put great pains in defining the notion of [[private property]], how it may be acquired, transferred, or lost, socialist law systems provide for most property to be owned by the [[State (polity)|state]] or by agricultural co-operatives, and having special courts and laws for state enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Soviet-law|title=Soviet law|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars argue that socialist law was not a separate legal classification.&lt;ref name="austin"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112849|title=The Death of Socialist Law?|journal = Annual Review of Law and Social Science |volume = 3|issue = |pages = 233–253|last = Markovits |first = I.|date=December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[command economy]] approach of the communist states meant that most types of property could not be owned, the [[Soviet Union]] always had a civil code, courts that interpreted this civil code, and a civil law approach to legal reasoning (thus, both legal process and legal reasoning were largely analogous to the [[France|French]] or [[Germany|German]] civil code system). Legal systems in all socialist states preserved formal criteria of the Romano-Germanic civil law; for this reason, law theorists in post-socialist states usually consider the socialist law as a particular case of the Romano-Germanic civil law. Cases of development of [[common law]] into socialist law are unknown because of incompatibility of basic principles of these two systems (common law presumes influential rule-making role of courts while courts in socialist states play a dependent role).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Soviet-law|title=Soviet law|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet legal theory==
Soviet law displayed many special characteristics that derived from the socialist nature of the Soviet state and reflected [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. [[Vladimir Lenin]] accepted the Marxist conception of the law and the state as instruments of coercion in the hands of the bourgeoisie and postulated the creation of popular, informal tribunals to administer revolutionary justice. One of the main theoreticians of Soviet socialist legality in this early phase was [[Pēteris Stučka]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Alongside this [[utopian]] trend was one more critical of the concept of "[[proletarian]] justice", represented by [[Evgeny Pashukanis]]. A dictatorial trend developed that advocated the use of law and legal institutions to suppress all opposition to the regime. This trend reached its zenith under [[Joseph Stalin]] with the ascendancy of [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], when the administration of justice was carried out mainly by the security police in [[NKVD troika|special tribunals]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

During the [[de-Stalinization]] of the [[Nikita Khrushchev]] era, a new trend developed, based on socialist legality, that stressed the need to protect the procedural and statutory rights of citizens, while still calling for obedience to the state. New legal codes, introduced in 1960, were part of the effort to establish legal norms in administering laws. Although socialist legality remained in force after 1960, the dictatorial and utopian trends continued to influence the legal process. Persecution of political and religious dissenters continued, but at the same time there was a tendency to [[decriminalization|decriminalize]] lesser offenses by handing them over to people's courts and administrative agencies and dealing with them by education rather than by incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elie |first=Marc |editor-last1=Kozlov |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last2=Gilburd |editor-first2=Eleonory  |date=2013 |title=The Thaw: Soviet Society and Culture during the 1950s and 1960s |publisher=Toronto University Press |pages=109{{hyphen}}142 |chapter=Khrushchev's Gulag: the Soviet Penitentiary System after Stalin's death, 1953-1964 |section-url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00859338/ |access-date=October 30, 2017 |isbn=978-1442644601 |id=HAL 00859338}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By late 1986, the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] era was stressing anew the importance of [[individual rights]] in relation to the state and criticizing those who violated [[procedural law]] in implementing Soviet justice. This signaled a resurgence of socialist legality as the dominant trend. Socialist legality itself still lacked features associated with Western jurisprudence.

== Characteristic traits ==
Socialist law is similar to [[common law]] or [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] but with a greatly increased [[public law]] sector and decreased [[private law]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glenn|first=H. Patrick|title=Legal Traditions of the World: Sustainable Diversity in Law|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eERrPWIQn2kC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=%22Socialist+law%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rQY-TPrODY6UjAf49cX5Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Socialist%20law%22&amp;f=false|edition= 4th |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-19-958080-4 |oclc=650838256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* extensive social warrants of the state (the rights to a job, free education, free healthcare, retirement at 60 for men and 55 for women, maternity leave, free disability benefits and sick leave compensation, subsidies to multichildren families, ...) in return for a high degree of social mobilization.
* the judicial process lacks [[adversarial system|adversary]] character; public prosecution is considered as "provider of justice."
* partial or total expulsion of the former [[ruling classes]] from the public life at early stages of existence of each socialist state; however, in all socialist states this policy gradually changed into the policy of "one socialist nation without classes"
* diversity of political views directly discouraged.
* the ruling Communist party was eventually subject to prosecution through party committees in first place.
* abolition of [[Private property#Socialist perspectives|private property]] considered as a primary goal of socialism, if not its defining characteristic, thus near total collectivization and nationalization of the means of production;
* subordination of the judiciary to the Communist Party
* low respect for [[privacy]], extensive control of the party over private life;
* low respect for [[intellectual property]] as knowledge and culture was considered a right for human kind, and not a privilege as in the free market economies.

A specific institution characteristic to Socialist law was the so-called [[burlaw court]] (or, verbally, "court of comrades", Russian товарищеский суд) which decided on minor offences.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Chinese Socialist law==
Among the remaining communist governments, some (most notably the [[People's Republic of China]]) have added extensive modifications to their legal systems. In general, this is a result of their [[free market|market-oriented]] economic changes. However, some communist influence can still be seen. For example, in Chinese [[real estate]] law there is no unified concept of [[real property]]; the state owns all land but often not the structures that sit on that land. A rather complex ''[[ad hoc]]'' system of [[use (law)|use rights]] to land property has developed, and these use rights are the things being officially traded (rather than the property itself). In some cases (for example in the case of [[city|urban]] residential property), the system results in something that resembles real property transactions in other legal systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In other cases, the Chinese system results in something quite different. For example, it is a common misconception that reforms under [[Deng Xiaoping]] resulted in the [[privatization]] of agricultural land and a creation of a [[land tenure]] system similar to those found in [[Western world|Western]] countries. In actuality, the village committee owns the land and [[contract]]s the right to use this land to individual farmers who may use the land to make money from agriculture. Hence the rights that are normally unified in Western economies are split up between the individual farmer and the village committee.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

This has a number of consequences. One of them is that, because the farmer does not have an absolute right to transfer the land, he cannot borrow against his use rights. On the other hand, there is some insurance against risk in the system, in that the farmer can return his land to the village committee if he wants to stop farming and start some other sort of business. Then, if this business does not work, he can get a new contract with the village committee and return to farming. The fact that the land is redistributable by the village committee also ensures that no one is left landless; this creates a form of [[social welfare]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There have been a number of proposals to reform this system and they have tended to be in the direction of fully privatizing rural land for the alleged purpose of increasing efficiency. These proposals have usually not received any significant support, largely because of the popularity of the current system among the farmers themselves. There is little risk that the village committee will attempt to impose a bad contract on the farmers, since this would reduce the amount of money the village committee receives. At the same time, the farmer has some flexibility to decide to leave farming for other ventures and to return at a later time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15869">{{About|the pseudolegal theory||Straw man (disambiguation)}}
'''Strawman theory''' (also called the '''Strawman illusion''') is a [[pseudolaw|pseudolegal]] theory prevalent in various movements such as [[sovereign citizen]], [[tax protestor]], [[freeman on the land]], and the [[redemption movement]]. The theory holds that an individual has two personas, one of flesh and the other a separate legal personality (i.e., the "strawman"). The idea is that an individual’s debts, liabilities, taxes and legal responsibilities belong to the strawman rather than the physical individual.{{R|"SPLC1"}} The strawman theory is recognized in law as a scam: The [[FBI]] considers anyone promoting it a likely fraudster,{{R|"FBI"}}. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) considers it a frivolous argument and fines people that use the theory on their Federal tax returns.{{R|"IRS"}}{{R|"Lii"}}

== About ==

Strawman theory traces its origins to the ancient Roman legal practice of ''[[capitis deminutio]]'' ("decrease of head"), a term used in Roman trials for the [[extinguishment]] of a person's former legal capacity. ''Capitis deminutio minima'' meant a person ceased to belong to a particular family, without loss of liberty or citizenship. ''Capitis deminutio media'' involved loss of citizenship and family, but not liberty. ''Capitis deminutio maxima'' involved loss of family, citizenship and liberty (''i.e.'', a slave or a prisoner of war).{{R|"Mackenzie1862"}} Strawman theory commonly takes the term ''capitis deminutio'' spells it "Capitis Diminutio" and claims ''capitis diminutio maxima'' was represented by an individual’s name being written in capital letters. This led to the idea that individuals had a separate legal personality now called a "strawman".{{R|"Weill"}}

The theory holds that an individual has two personas. One of them is a physical, tangible human being, and the other is the ''legal person'', often referred to as a legal fiction. When a baby is born in the U.S., a birth certificate is issued, and the parents apply for a Social Security number. Sovereigns say the government uses that birth certificate to set up a secret Treasury account which it funds with an amount ranging from $600,000 to $20 million, depending on the particular sovereign belief system. Hence, every newborn's rights are split between those held by the flesh-and-blood baby and the corporate shell account.{{R|"SPLC1"}}

Proponents of the theory believe the evidence is found on the birth certificate. Because many certificates show all capitals to spell out a baby's name, JOHN DOE (under the Strawman theory) is the name of the "straw man," and John Doe is the baby's "real" name. As the child grows, most legal documents will contain capital letters, which means that his state-issued driver's license, his marriage license, his car registration, his criminal court records, his cable TV bill, correspondence from the IRS, etc., pertain to his strawman and not his sovereign identity.{{R|"SPLC1"}} In reality, the use of all capital letters is typically done to make certain statements clear and conspicuous, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/sovereign-citizens-movement|title=Sovereign Citizens Movement|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main use of strawman theory is in escaping and denying debts, liabilities and legal responsibility. Tax protestors, "commercial redemption" and "get out of debt free" scams claim that one’s debts and taxes are the responsibility of the strawman and not of the real person. They back this claim by misreading the legal definition of ''[[person]]''{{R|"Blacks_Person"}} and a misunderstanding of the distinction between a ''[[juridicial person]]''{{R|"Blacks_Jperson"}} and a ''[[natural person]]''.{{R|"Blacks_Nperson"}} In accepted legal theory there is a difference between what is known as a ''natural person'' and that of a ''corporate person''. A ''[[corporate personhood]]'' applies to business, charities, governments and other recognized organisations. Courts recognize human beings as 'persons', not as a legal fiction joined to a flesh and blood human being but as one and the same.{{R|"CanadaLaw"}} They have never recognized a right to distance oneself from one's person, or the ability to opt out of personhood.{{R|"Lovejoy"}}

Believers of the theory also extend it to law and legal responsibilities, claiming that only their strawman is required to adhere to statutory laws. They also claim that legal proceedings in are taken against strawmen rather than persons and when one appears in court they appear as representing their strawman. The justification for this is the false notion that governments cannot force anybody to do anything. A strawman therefore created which the adherent believes he or she is free to command. Proponents cite a misinterpretation of a passage in chapter 39 of [[John, King of England|King John]]'s [[Magna Carta]] stating in part that, "no freeman will be seized, dispossessed of his property, or harmed except by the law of the land”.{{R|"MagnaCarta"}}

Freemen believe that separating from their strawman or refusing to be identified as such enables escape from their various liabilities, responsibilities, and laws. This is typically attempted by denying they are a person in the same way as their strawman, or by writing their name in non-standard ways, using red ink, and placing finger prints on court documents.{{R|"Williams"}}

Judge [[Norman K. Moon]] found such tactics an unconvincing argument in 2013 when an individual named Brandon Gravatt tried to overturn a drug conviction and get out of prison. The case was summarily dismissed by the court.{{R|"Moon"}}

It is impossible to dodge the law by insisting that an individual is different from his or her person. If a court can establish a person's identity, regardless of consent or cooperation, the court will engage in proceedings and sanctions against the individual. This is due to the legal principle known as ''[[Idem sonans]]'' (Latin for "sounding the same") which states that similar sounding names are just as valid in referring to a person.{{R|"Blacks_Idem"}} The earliest legal precedent is R v Davis in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851.{{R|"ARCHBOLD1867"}}

{{cquote|If two names spelt differently necessarily sound alike, the court may, as matter of law, pronounce them to be idem sonantia; but if they do not necessarily sound alike, the question whether they are idem sonantia is a question of fact for the jury.}}

|“The core of defendant’s argument on appeal is that (1) he was born Donald James Drew, and the person charged in this matter was DONALD JAMES DREW; (2) the capitalization of the name created a “Strawman/Stramineous Homo/Ens Legis/ Artificial Person” (artificial person); (3) the artificial person was convicted; (4) he has been incarcerated as surety chattel or security for the artificial person; and (5) he has been denied due process. “Claims so premised are patently frivolous and without merit.”{{R|"Drew"}}

|''Jaeger v. Dubuque County''
|Raymond Jaeger (plaintiff)
|Raymond Jaeger filed a $2M lawsuit against Iowa state law enforcement &amp; Department of Natural Resources, alleging illegal search and seizure. The ruling was made in response to a motion to strike the presented active defense. 
|"The court finds Jaeger’s arguments concerning capitalization otherwise specious. The court routinely capitalizes the names of all parties before this court in all matters, civil and criminal, without any regard to their corporate or individual status...Jaeger’s motions to strike are denied as to improper capitalization."{{R|"Jaeger"}}

|''United States v. Furman''
|William Michael Furman
|William Furman was charged with two counts of conspiracy related to a scheme to defraud a bank and launder money. After being convicted, Furman filed an appeal based on the strawman theory, alleging both a literal misspelling of his name and the "improper" capitalizations typically seen in such arguments.
|"Here, the difference between "Micheal" and "Michael" is a mere transposition of letters with presumably little (if any) auditory significance, and the difference between "WILLIAM MICHAEL FURMAN" and "William Michael Furman" is a mere change of case with absolutely no auditory significance."{{R|"Furman"}}

A '''term of office''' is the length of time a person serves in a particular [[elected office]]. In many jurisdictions there is a defined limit on how long terms of office may be before the officeholder must be subject to [[re-election]]. Some jurisdictions exercise [[term limits]], setting a maximum number of terms an individual may hold in a particular office.

==United Kingdom==
Being the origin of the [[Westminster system]], aspects of the [[United Kingdom]]'s system of government are replicated in many other countries.
===Monarch===
The [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|monarch]] serves as head of state until his or her death or [[abdication]].

===House of Commons===
{{seealso|House of Commons of the United Kingdom}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] Members of Parliament (MPs) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] are elected for the duration of the parliament. Following [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolution]] of the Parliament, a [[General elections (UK)|general election]] is held which consists of simultaneous elections for all seats. For most MPs this means that their terms of office are identical to the duration of the Parliament, though an individual's term may be cut short by death or [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation]]. An MP elected in a [[UK Parliamentary by-elections|by-election]] mid-way through a Parliament, regardless of how long they have occupied the seat, is not exempt from facing [[re-election]] at the next general election.

The [[Septennial Act 1715]] provided that a Parliament expired seven years after it had been summoned; this maximum period was reduced to five years by the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. Prior to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] parliaments had no minimum duration. Parliaments could be dissolved early by the monarch at the [[Prime Minister]]'s request. Early dissolutions occurred when the make-up of Parliament made forming government impossible (as occurred in [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|1974]]), or, more commonly, when the incumbent government reasoned an early general election would improve their re-election chances (e.g. [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]]). The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 mandated that Parliaments should last their full five years. Early dissolution is still possible, but under much more limited circumstances.

Because the [[government of the United Kingdom|government]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] are effectively [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] through the Commons, the terms of Parliaments and MPs do not directly apply to offices of government, though in practice these are affected by changes in Parliament. While, strictly speaking, a Prime Minister whose incumbency spans multiple Parliaments only serves one, unbroken, term of office, some writers may refer to the different Parliaments as separate terms.&lt;ref name="Thatcher 3terms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Thatcher|url=http://www.biography.com/people/margaret-thatcher-9504796|website=Biography.com|accessdate=5 February 2016|quote="During her three terms…"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Lords===
[[Hereditary peer]]s and [[life peers]] retain membership of the [[House of Lords]] for life, though members can resign or be expelled. [[Lords Spiritual]] hold membership of the House of Lords until the end of their time as bishops, though a senior bishop may be made a life peer upon the end of their bishopric (e.g. [[George Carey]], made ''Baron Carey of Clifton'' the day after he ceased being [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]).
===Devolved administrations===
The [[devolution|devolved administrations]] in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are variations on the system of government used at [[Westminster]].

The office of the leader of the devolved administrations has no numeric term limit imposed upon it. However, in the case of the [[Scottish Government]] and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] there are fixed terms for which the [[legislatures]] can sit. This is imposed at four years. Elections may be held before this time but only if no administration can be formed, which has not happened yet.
===Other elected offices===
Offices of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] other regional elected officials follow similar rules to the national offices discussed above, with persons elected to fixed terms of a few years.

==United States==

===Federal===
{{main|Federal government of the United States}}
In the [[United States]], the [[president of the United States]] is elected indirectly through the [[United States Electoral College]] to a four-year term, with a [[term limit]] of two terms (totaling eight years) or a maximum of ten years if the president acted as president for two years or less in a term where another was elected as president, imposed by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1951.

The [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] serves four-year terms. [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] serve two-year terms. [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] serve six-year terms. 

[[Federal judges]] have different terms in office. [[Article I and Article III tribunals|Article I judges]]; such as those that sit on the [[United States bankruptcy court]]s, [[United States Tax Court]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]], and certain other [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] and other forms of [[United States administrative law|adjudicative bodies]] serve limited terms: The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for 15 years, bankruptcy courts for 14. However, the majority of the federal judiciary; Article III judges, such as those of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], [[United States court of appeals|courts of appeal]], and [[United States district court|federal district courts]]; serve for life.

===State and territories===
{{main|State governments of the United States}}
The terms of office for officials in state governments varies according to the provisions of [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] and [[state law]].

The term for [[state governor]]s is four years in all states but [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]]; the [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont]] and [[Governor of New Hampshire|New Hampshire governors]] serve for two years.

The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] reported in January 2007 that among [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429232858/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/legismgt/about/numoflegis.htm]:
*44 states had terms of office for the [[lower house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state House of Representatives) at two years. Five ([[Alabama House of Representatives|Alabama]], [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana]], [[Maryland House of Delegates|Maryland]], [[Mississippi House of Representatives|Mississippi]], and [[North Dakota House of Representatives|North Dakota]]) had terms of office at four years. (The [[Nebraska Legislature]] is an exception and has a [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] with members elected for four years.)
*37 states had terms of office for the [[upper house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state Senate) at four years. Twelve ([[Arizona Senate|Arizona]], [[Connecticut Senate|Connecticut]], [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia]], [[Idaho Senate|Idaho]], [[Maine Senate|Maine]], [[Massachusetts Senate|Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire Senate|New Hampshire]], [[New York State Senate|New York]], [[North Carolina Senate|North Carolina]], [[Rhode Island Senate|Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota Senate|South Dakota]], [[Vermont Senate|Vermont]]) had terms of office at two years.

Among [[territories of the United States]]:
*In the [[American Samoa Fono]], members of the [[American Samoa House of Representatives|House]] serve two-year terms while members of the [[American Samoa Senate|Senate]] serve six-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]] have four-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature]] have two-year terms.
*The [[Legislature of Guam]] and [[Legislature of the Virgin Islands]] are unicameral and Senators have two-year terms.

Members of [[Council of the District of Columbia]] serve a four-year term.

==Canada==
As a former British territory following the [[Westminster System]], there are many similarities with the United Kingdom, although with some variations based on local customs, the federal system of government and the absentee monarch.
===Monarch===
Being a [[Commonwealth realm]], Canada shares a [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] with the United Kingdom and 14 other countries, who serves as head of state of all 16 realms until their death or abdication.

===Viceroys===
The [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] is appointed by the monarch as his/her personal representative on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], and serves [[At Her Majesty's Pleasure|for an indefinite term]], though the normal convention is 5 years. Similarly, the [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]], who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial [[Premier (Canada)|premier]]), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention. The territories have [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|Commissioners]], who are not representatives of the monarch, but are instead appointed by and represent the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]] (i.e. the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]]), and conventionally serve for about 5 years.

===House of Commons===
{{seealso|House of Commons of Canada}}

Similar to the United Kingdom, MPs serve for the duration of the Parliament. They may resign before the end of a Parliament or be elected in [[By-election|by-elections]] during the middle of a Parliament.

Under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], a Parliament may last for a maximum of 5 years from the most recent election before expiring, although all Parliaments to date have been dissolved before they could expire. Bill C-16, introduced in the [[39th Canadian Parliament|39th Parliament]], provided for fixed election dates every 4 years on the third Monday in October, beginning in 2009. However, the Prime Minister may still advise the Governor General to dissolve Parliament at any time. 

As in the United Kingdom, the cabinet and head of government are indirectly elected based on the composition of the House of Commons, they are not technically affected by the terms of legislators or Parliaments. In practice however, the terms of government office holders are affected by changes in the House of Commons, and those who serve for multiple consecutive Parliaments are generally considered to have served a single term. The term of a government generally ends when it is defeated on a confidence matter or the governing party fails to gain enough seats in a general election.

===Senate===

Senators are appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] to represent a province by the Governor General of Canada on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serve until the mandatory retirement age of 75. Senators appointed before the passage of the [[British North America Act, 1965]] served for life. Senators may also resign from office or be expelled from the Senate.

===Provincial and Territorial Legislatures===
{{seealso|Legislative assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories}}

Provincial legislatures and the legislature of the Yukon function very similarly to the federal House of Commons. MLAs (called MPPs in [[Ontario]], MNAs in [[Quebec]], and MHAs in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]) serve for the duration of the legislature, though they may resign before the legislature is dissolved or be elected in by-elections between general elections. The legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] operate using a [[Consensus government in Canada|consensus]] model, but are similar otherwise. The premiers and their cabinets are selected in the same way as in the House of Commons, and like at the federal level, the term of a provincial government can be ended by defeat in a general election or the loss of the legislature's confidence.

All provincial legislatures except that of [[Nova Scotia]] have fixed-term election legislation in place, as does the legislature of the Northwest Territories. Premiers may also advise Lieutenant Governors to dissolve legislatures at any time before the prescribed election date.

Numbers in years unless stated otherwise. Note that some countries where [[fixed-term election]]s are uncommon, the legislature is almost always dissolved earlier than its expiry date. "[[Life tenure|Until removed from office]]" refers to offices that don't have fixed terms; in these cases, the officeholder(s) may serve indefinitely until death, abdication, resignation, retirement, or forcible removal from office (such as [[impeachment]]).

In cases where the [[head of government]] is a different person from the head of state, its term of office is identical to the chamber that elected it (the legislature if it is unicameral, or most usually the [[lower house]] if it is bicameral), unless it doesn't survive a [[vote of no confidence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35594">The '''Tulane Environmental Law Clinic''' (TELC) is a [[legal clinic]] that [[Tulane University Law School|Tulane Law School]] has operated since 1989 to offer law students the practical experience of representing real clients in actual legal proceedings under state and federal [[Environmental Laws|environmental laws]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
TELC's mission is to 1) train effective and ethical lawyers by guiding law students through actual client representation; 2) expand access to the legal system, especially for those who could not otherwise afford competent legal help on environmental issues; and 3) bolster community members' capacity to participate effectively in environmental decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/more.html]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TELC is part of [[Tulane University]] School of Law's environmental law program and has become one of Louisiana's premier public interest legal services organizations, known especially for its work on [[environmental justice]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Toffolon-Weiss, Chronicles of the Environmental Justice Frontline (Cambridge University Press 2001); Steve Lerner, Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor (MIT Press 2005), see also Adam Babich, Environmental Justice in Louisiana, 51 LA.

The [[American Bar Association]] honored TELC as co-recipient of its first "Award for Distinguished Achievement in Environmental Law and Policy" in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Coyle, Tulane Law Clinic Honored For Work Communities Got Help In Environmental Cases, New Orleans Times-Picayune, July 5, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the New Orleans chapter of the Federal Bar Association honored TELC with its Camille F. Gravel Jr. Pro Bono Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsNews/newsItem.aspx?id=14150|title=Tulane University Law School - News Item Detail|website=www.law.tulane.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, TELC was a runner up for the National Law Journal's Lawyer of the Year award in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202426909943 (the award went to President Bill Clinton)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
Attorney Suzanne S. Dickey has explained that TELC student attorneys have "handled cases involving all aspects of environmental law, including air pollution, conservation of natural resources, urban land use and siting of waste facilities."&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne S. Dickey, The Tulane Environmental Law Clinic: A Voice for Louisiana Citizens, La. B.J., Aug./Sept. 2001, http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/articles/Voice%20for%20La%20Citizens.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples appear below.

*'''[[Air pollution]]''': TELC student-attorneys filed a Clean Air Act citizen suit in which the court ruled that a [[St. Bernard Parish]] oil refinery violated the Clean Air Act more than 2600 times.&lt;ref&gt;St. Bernard Citizens for Environmental Quality, Inc. v. Chalmette Refining, L.L.C., 399 F. Supp. 2d 726 (E.D. La. 2005), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/Court%20Orders/10-14-05%20St.%20Bernard%20Chalmette%202d%20SJ%20Ord.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A court in another TELC-handled case vacated a Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) permit which purported to waive Clean Air Act requirements for prevention of deterioration of air quality.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment, In re: Waste Management of Louisiana, LLC, Woodside Landfill Air Permitting Decisions, 529640 (La. App. 1 Cir. 8/22/07), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/pdfs/08-22-07%20Woodside%20PSD%201st%20Cir.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On behalf of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN),&lt;ref&gt;See http://leanweb.org&lt;/ref&gt; TELC has prosecuted a series of cases to promote cleaner air in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., South Coast Air Quality Management Dist. v. EPA, 472 F.3d 882 (D.C. Cir. 2006), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/Court%20Orders/12-22-06%20South%20Coast%20-%20DC%20Cir.pdf; see also July 8, 2008 Notice of Intent of  the Louisiana Environmental Action Network to file Clean Air Act Citizen Suit Against EPA and the LDEQ Secretary, http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/Notice%20Letters/7-8-08%20Ozone%20FIP%20NOV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this effort, TELC obtained court orders that 1) vacated an EPA attempt to extend Louisiana's deadline for achieving health protection standards for ozone air pollution in the Baton Rouge Area, and 2) vacated EPA's approval of an inter-pollutant trading plan that would have allowed Louisiana to increase emissions of [[volatile organic compounds]] in return for reductions in oxides of nitrogen ([[NOx]]).&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. EPA, No. 02-60991 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting the Court's earlier remand of an EPA attempt to extend the five parish Baton Rouge nonattainment area's deadline for meeting the health protection standard for ozone air pollution, and noting the Court's earlier vacatur of an EPA attempt to approve a trade-off of increased emissions of volatile organic compounds for decreased emissions of nitrogen oxides in the same area, and vacating EPA's approval of a contingency plan for the area based on historical emission reductions from a facility located outside of the area), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/pdfs/9-08-04%20EPA_extend_5.pdf  For an analysis of the EPA/Louisiana interpollutant trading scheme, see The Sting, How Louisiana's Emission Credit Trading System Dirties the Air, Second Generation Issues ABA Committee Newsletter (May, 2003), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/articles/05-03%20The%20Sting%20-%20La%20Emission%20Trading.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; TELC and LEAN also obtained a court order that required EPA to make a determination that increased the stringency of emission controls in the Baton Rouge area,&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. Whitman, No. 00-879-A (M.D. La., Feb. 27, 2002), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/pdfs/02-27-02_SJ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained statements from EPA and LDEQ admitting that Louisiana was operating a "bank" for [[emissions trading]] that failed to meet minimum Clean Air Act requirements.&lt;ref&gt;See LDEQ acknowledgment of illegalities in emission credit reduction "bank" (Oct. 5, 2000), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/agency/10-5-00_epa_illegal_bank.pdf, EPA response to petition to object to a Borden permit (regarding emission credit trading issues) (Dec. 12, 2000), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/agency/12-22-00_borden.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Water pollution]]''': TELC student attorneys engage in administrative actions to convince LDEQ to implement the Clean Water Act's anti-degradation provisions, including rules to protect streams designated as "outstanding natural resource waters."&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Comments on behalf of the GreenZone Task Force, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, and O'Neil Couvillion to the LDEQ (Feb. 15, 2007), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/Comments/2-15-07_landfill.pdf; LDEQ letter summarizing changes made to a Clean Water Act permit in response to comments (Feb. 26, 2007), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/agency/2-26-07_deq.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; TELC settled a case on behalf of coalition of environmental organizations to require cleanup of mercury leaked from meters used to monitor gas wells near [[Monroe, Louisiana]], where many streams are under mercury advisories.&lt;ref&gt;See Stipulated Judgment, Gulf Restoration Network v. EnerVest Operating, L.L.C., No. 07-817 (W.D. La. July 2, 2009), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/pdfs/7-2-09_Enervest.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, TELC is prosecuting a case to enjoin discharges of waste that allegedly passes through and interferes with a municipal sewage treatment plant in the Town of Independence, [[Tangipahoa Parish]], Louisiana, causing violations of Clean Water Act standards for discharges into the [[Tangipahoa River]].&lt;ref&gt;Complaint, Concerned Citizens of Independence v.

McDaniel, No. 06-4161 (E.D. La., Aug. 9, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; While the lawsuit was pending, TELC and the LDEQ engaged in negotiations that resulted in several improvements to the emergency orders. For example, on January 19, 2007, LDEQ removed "household hazardous waste . . . where segregation is not practicable" from the list of materials that the Secretary authorized the landfills to accept.&lt;ref&gt;Eighth Amended Declaration of Emergency and Administrative Order" (Hurricane Katrina and its Aftermath, A.I.

McDaniel, No. 06-4161 (E.D. La., Sept. 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Wildlife]]''': TELC represented Sierra Club as amicus in an [[Endangered Species Act]] case in which the court ordered the U.S. Department of Interior to designate critical habitat for protection of the [[Louisiana black bear]].&lt;ref&gt;Schoeffler et al v. Kempthorn, No. 6:05-cv-01573 (W.D. La. June 26, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, on July 25, 2002, TELC negotiated a settlement on behalf of Coalition for Louisiana Animal Advocates which required the U.S. Army to refrain from roundup and removal of wild horses from [[Fort Polk]] in the [[Kisatchie National Forest]] until completing an Environmental Impact Statement or Environmental Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Partial Settlement Agreement, Coalition for Louisiana Animal Advocates v.

*'''[[Global warming]]''': On behalf of [[Sierra Club]], the Alliance for Affordable Energy and others, TELC engaged in litigation to oppose construction of new coal-fired power plants which, if built, would release pollutants associated with climate change.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Petition, Alliance for Affordable Energy v. Louisiana Public Service Commission, No. 568378 (19th Jud. Dist.

*'''[[Rule of law]]''': TELC's litigation on behalf of its clients includes cases to enforce the duty of Louisiana agencies, as public trustees under the [[Louisiana Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;This duty flows from La. Const. art. IX, § 1. See In re Rubicon, Inc., 95-0108 (La. App. 1 Cir. 2/14/96); 670 So. 2d 475, 483; Save Ourselves, Inc. v. Louisiana Envtl.

TELC and Public Justice submitted a Notice of Intent to Sue the agency, alleging that EPA's plans to experiment by departing from health and safety standards would treat "a storm-devastated Louisiana parish as a laboratory for illegal experiments."&lt;ref&gt;Notice of Intent of Concerned Citizens Around Murphy to Sue to EPA (June 3, 2008) http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/Notice%20Letters/6-3-08%20CAA%20NOV%20to%20EPA%20Asbestos%20Burn.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In response, EPA dropped its plans to burn regulated asbestos containing material during the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Response to Comments, Disaster Debris Reduction Pilot Project – St. Bernard Parish (June 23, 2008), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/agency/06-23-08%20EPA%20resp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
In addition to funding from [[Tulane University Law School|Tulane Law School]], TELC relies on donations by individuals, families and corporations, foundation grants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/pdfs/acknowl.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attorney-fee recoveries.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Court Order, Holy Cross Neighborhood Association v.

==Controversy==
Many of TELC's cases involve large corporations or issues of community, statewide, or national concern.&lt;ref&gt;TELC publishes its docket at http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/docket.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, TELC's work on behalf of its clients can be controversial.&lt;ref&gt;See Cases and Controversy, Envtl.F., Oct. 6, 2006, at 38, http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/articles/controversy.pdf; see also David Jacobs, Chemical Reaction, Baton Rouge Business Report, (Dec. 15, 2009) http://www.businessreport.com/news/2009/dec/15/chemical-reaction-indt1/&lt;/ref&gt; [[John R.

*'''Shintech &amp; Rule XX Revisions''': Tensions became especially pronounced in the late 1990s when TELC represented St. James Citizens for Jobs and the Environment, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, and others in opposing Shintech, Inc.'s proposal for a [[polyvinyl chloride]] plant in a predominantly African-American and lower income community in [[St. James Parish, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Coyle, Governor v. Students in $700M Plant Case, National Law Journal, Sept.  8, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a petition that TELC and [[Greenpeace]] filed on May 22, 1997, EPA formally objected to a state-issued Clean Air Act permit for that plant on September 10, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Order Partially Granting and Partially Denying Petitions for Objections to Permits, In the Matter of Shintech Inc. and its Affiliates' Polyvinyl Chloride Production Facility, Permit Nos. 2466-VO, 2467-VO, 2468-VO (Sept. 10, 1997), at http://www.epa.gov/region07/programs/artd/air/title5/petitiondb/petitions/shintech_decision1997.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Shintech abandoned its plans for a facility in St. James Parish and built a smaller plant elsewhere in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Holden &amp; Tad Bartlett, Leaving Communities Behind: The Evolving World of Environmental Justice, 51 LA. B.J., Aug./Sept. 2003 at 95&lt;/ref&gt; A cable-television movie called "Taking Back Our Town" tells the story of the St. James Citizens' victory in this case.&lt;ref&gt;Lifetime Television broadcast, Dec. 10, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The case sparked a backlash from some Louisiana politicians and members of the business community who asked the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] to rein in TELC.&lt;ref&gt;La. Sup. Ct., Resolution Amending and Reenacting Rule XX, (Johnson, J. dissenting) (1999) at 1, at http://www.lasc.org/rules/supreme/resolution499.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The Court ultimately revised the student practice rule, although in a way that does not prevent TELC from representing clients in high impact or controversial cases.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Babich, How the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic Survived the Shintech Controversy and Rule XX Revisions: Some Questions and Answers, 32 Envtl.

Largely as a result of these events, the [[Times-Picayune]] has described TELC as the bane of former Governor [[Murphy J.
