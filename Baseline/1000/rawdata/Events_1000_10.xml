Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date. A [[New Age]] interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or [[spiritual transformation]], and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era.&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt; Others suggested that the date marked the [[End time|end of the world]] or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], an interaction between [[Earth]] and the [[Sagittarius A*|black hole at the center of the galaxy]],&lt;ref name="NASA1" /&gt; or [[Nibiru cataclysm|Earth's collision with a mythical planet called Nibiru]].

Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional [[Mayanist]] scholars stated that no extant [[Maya codices|classic Maya accounts]] forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented [[Maya civilization#History|Maya history]] and culture,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;David Stuart, ''The Order of Days: The Maya World and the Truth about 2012'', Harmony Books, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster" /&gt; while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref name="Brown 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=SI do not ♥ pseudo-science|first=Mike|last=Brown|url=http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/02/i-do-not-pseudo-science.html|year=2008|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="NASA2" /&gt;

== Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ==
{{main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}

December 2012 marked the conclusion of a ''[[b'ak'tun]]''—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in [[Mesoamerica|Central America]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the [[Olmec]],&lt;ref name="delara2006" /&gt; it has become closely associated with the [[Maya civilization]], whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Population structure of the classic period Maya" /&gt; The [[Maya script|writing system]] of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered,&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt; meaning that a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|European conquest]].

Unlike the 260-day ''[[tzolk'in]]'' still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a ''uinal'', 18 uinals (360 days) made a ''tun'', 20 tuns made a ''k'atun'', and 20 k'atuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a ''b'ak'tun''. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b'ak'tuns, 3 k'atuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}&lt;ref name="The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0" /&gt;

=== Apocalypse ===
[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]

There is a strong tradition of "world ages" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429–430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years.{{sfn|Freidel|Schele|Parker|1993|p=63}}{{ref label|A|Note a|a}} The Long Count's "zero date"{{ref label|B|Note b|b}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=46}}&lt;ref name=yucalandia/&gt; This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer [[Maud Worcester Makemson]] wrote that "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya."&lt;ref name="makemson1957" /&gt; In 1966, [[Michael D. Coe]] wrote in ''The Maya'' that "there is a suggestion&amp;nbsp;... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [b'ak'tun]. Thus&amp;nbsp;... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion."{{sfn|Coe|1966|p=149}}{{ref label|E|Note e|e}}

=== Objections ===
Coe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="carrasco1990" /&gt; In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; it did not mark the end of the calendar.&lt;ref name="milbrath1999" /&gt; "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention."&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; In 1990, Mayanist scholars [[Linda Schele]] and David Freidel argued that the Maya "did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested".{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}} Susan Milbrath, [[curator]] of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], stated that, "We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end" in 2012.&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," and, "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; "There will be another cycle," said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the [[Tulane University]] Middle American Research Institute. "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this."&lt;ref name="The Sky Is Not Falling" /&gt; Commenting on the new calendar found at [[Xultún]], one archaeologist said "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue&amp;nbsp;– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset."&lt;ref name="NG120510" /&gt;

Several prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th b'ak'tun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Indígenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle "supposes changes in human consciousness". Martín Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuraduría de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.&lt;ref name="prensalibre" /&gt;

=== Prior associations ===
The European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profecías]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the "Maia" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hoopes 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of "most distant" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]]. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the [[Spanish Conquest]] as the result of popular [[astrology|astrological]] predictions in Europe of a second [[Great Flood]] for the year 1524.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In the early 1900s, German scholar [[Ernst Förstemann]] interpreted the last page of the [[Dresden Codex]] as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b'ak'tun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.&lt;ref&gt;Förstemann 1906: 264&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1915: 32&lt;/ref&gt; who directly paraphrased Förstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, "Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&amp;nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Maya references to b'ak'tun 13 ==
It is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b'ak'tun.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.

=== Tortuguero ===
The [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ajaw. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b'ak'tun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:

&lt;div style="width: 500px"&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
: ''tzuhtzjo:m uy-u:xlaju:n pik''
: ''chan ajaw u:x uni:w''
: ''uhto:m il[?]''
: ''ye'ni/ye:n bolon yokte'''
: ''ta chak joyaj''
{{col-2}}
: It will be completed the 13th ''b'ak'tun''.
: It is 4 ''Ajaw'' 3 ''K'ank'in''
: and it will happen a 'seeing'[?].
: It is the display of ''B'olon-Yokte'''
: in a great "investiture".{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|p=8}}
{{col-end}}
&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Bolon Yokte' K'uh.jpg|thumb|The Tortuguero monument connects the end of the 13th b'ak'tun with the appearance of B'olon Yokte' K'uh, shown here on the Vase of Seven Gods.|alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open. He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]

Very little is known about the god B'olon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.&lt;ref name="eberl2005" /&gt; He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.&lt;ref name="hieroglyphic" /&gt;

Based on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36–37}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.&lt;ref name="What Will Not Happen in 2012" /&gt;

=== La Corona ===
In April–May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.&lt;ref name="Stuart 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes on a New Text from La Corona | first = David | last = Stuart | url = http://decipherment.wordpress.com/ | year = 2012 | accessdate = 6 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates beyond b'ak'tun 13 ===
Maya inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of "distance dates"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&amp;nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, {{nowrap|603&amp;nbsp;AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}} arriving at a date of 21 October 4772&amp;nbsp;AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}}{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=430}}

Another example is Stela 1 at [[Coba]] which marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or nineteen units above the b'ak'tun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent "the starting point of a huge odometer of time", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 20&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;×13×360 days,&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt; or roughly 2.687×10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the [[age of the universe]] as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.&lt;ref name=wagner&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Maya Creation Myths and Cosmography|author=Wagner, Elizabeth|editor=Grube, Nikolai|title=Maya: Divine Kings of the Rainforest|page=283|year=2000|publisher=Konemann|isbn=978-3-8290-4150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=49}}

In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in [[Xultún]], Guatemala which plot the movements of the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b'ak'tuns.&lt;ref name="NG120510"&gt;{{cite web | last = Vance | first = Eric | title = Unprecedented Maya Mural Found, Contradicts 2012 "Doomsday" Myth |work=National Geographic |date=10 May 2012 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120510-maya-2012-doomsday-calendar-end-of-world-science/ |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saturno et al. 11 May 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | date = 11 May 2012 | volume = 336 | issue = 6082 | pages = 714–717 | doi = 10.1126/science.1221444 | title = Ancient Maya Astronomical Tables from Xultun, Guatemala |author1=William A.

The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism".&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a "disconnected" society: "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge."{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=161}}

=== Origins ===
In 1975, the ending of b'ak'tun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global "transformation of consciousness". In ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness'', [[Frank Waters]] tied Coe's original date of 24 December 2011{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} to astrology and the prophecies of the [[Hopi]],&lt;ref name="particular" /&gt; while both [[José Argüelles]] (in ''The Transformative Vision'')&lt;ref name="elles1975" /&gt; and [[Terence McKenna]] (in ''The Invisible Landscape'')&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mckenna1993" /&gt; discussed the significance of the year 2012 without mentioning a specific day.

In 1983, with the publication of [[Robert J. Sharer]]'s revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's ''The Ancient Maya,''{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} each became convinced that 21 December 2012 had significant meaning. By 1987, the year in which he organized the [[Harmonic Convergence]] event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology''.&lt;ref name="Planets Won't Attend Astronomical Celebration" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elles1987" /&gt; He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a "galactic synchronization beam" that emanated from the [[Galactic Center|center of our galaxy]], that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 ''tuns'' (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in "total synchronization" and "galactic entrainment" of individuals "plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17–27}}

In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b'ak'tun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The End of the World As They Know It" /&gt; Pinchbeck claims to discern a "growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&amp;nbsp;... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic".&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt;

=== Galactic alignment ===
There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=83}} However, its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by [[esoteric]], [[fringe science|fringe]], and [[New Age]] literature that placed great significance on [[astrology]], especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of [[axial precession]].&lt;ref name="Hoopes2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoopes2012" /&gt; Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a "galactic alignment".

==== Precession ====
In the [[Solar System]], the planets and the [[Sun]] lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called "[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115–127}}

Similarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center" /&gt; Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.&lt;ref name="What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?" /&gt; In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;

==== Mysticism ====
[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or "Black Road"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]

Mystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975). 

Adherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or "Black Road".&lt;ref name="Xibalba or Xibalbe" /&gt; John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.&lt;ref name="The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness" /&gt; New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.&lt;ref name="pinchbeck2006" /&gt; Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].&lt;ref name="jenkins1998" /&gt; Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a "world tree", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}

==== Criticism ====
Astronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.&lt;ref name="jenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Alignment Zone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meeus1997" /&gt;

There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,&lt;ref name="grofe2011" /&gt; Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,&lt;ref name="jenkins2009" /&gt; have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices,{{refn|{{harvnb|Aveni|2009|pp=54–55}}, citing {{harvnb|Aveni|Hartung|2000}}.}} but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=57}}

=== Timewave zero and the ''I Ching'' ===
{{Main|Terence McKenna#Novelty theory and Timewave Zero}}
[[File:Timewave 9 11 2001.png|thumb|A screenshot of the "Timewave Zero" software|alt=a greyscale graph with multiple, jagged peaks and troughs and an overall descending pattern, set amidst complex virtual instrumentation]]
"Timewave zero" is a [[numerology|numerological]] formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of "novelty", defined as increase over time in the [[universe]]'s interconnectedness, or [[Complexity#Disorganized complexity vs. organized complexity|organized complexity]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt; [[Terence McKenna]] claimed that the universe has a [[teleological]] [[attractor]] at the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|end of time]] that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a [[technological singularity|singularity]] of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt; The [[scientific community]] considers novelty theory to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=A. |year=2009 |title=2012: Science Or Superstition (the Definitive Guide to the Doomsday Phenomenon) |publisher=The Disinformation Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-rVUCO4YyYC&amp;pg=PA261|isbn=978-1-934708-51-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=normark&gt;{{cite web |title=2012: Prophet of nonsense #8: Terence McKenna – Novelty theory and timewave zero |last=Normark |first=Johan |url=http://haecceities.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/2012-prophet-of-nonsense-8-terence-mckenna%E2%80%93-novelty-theory-and-timewave-zero/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenna expressed "novelty" in a computer program which produces a waveform known as "timewave zero" or the "timewave". Based on McKenna's interpretation of the [[King Wen sequence]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'', an ancient Chinese book on [[divination]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; the graph purports to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's [[evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution|sociocultural]] evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are resonantly related to the events of other times, and chose the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012.&lt;ref name="Dynamics of Hyperspace" /&gt; When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th b'ak'tun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;

The 1975 first edition of ''The Invisible Landscape'' referred to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed Sharer's date{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} of 21 December 2012 throughout.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt;

Novelty theory has been criticized for "rejecting countless ideas presumed as factual by the scientific community", depending "solely on numerous controversial deductions that contradict empirical logic", and encompassing "no suitable indication of truth", with the conclusion that novelty theory is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Smith II D.

The idea that the year 2012 presaged a world cataclysm, the end of the world, or the end of [[human civilization]], became a subject of popular media speculation as the date of 21 December 2012 approached. This idea was promulgated by many pages on the [[Internet]], particularly on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; [[The Discovery Channel]] was criticized for its "quasi-documentaries" about the subject that "sacrifice[d] accuracy for entertainment".&lt;ref name="PressSunBulletin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20121210/NEWS01/312110007/Cornell-Maya-expert-World-probably-won-t-end-Dec-21?odyssey=nav%7Chead|title=Cornell Maya expert: World probably won't end Dec. 21 |last=D.W.

=== Other alignments ===
Some people interpreted the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined [[gravitation]]al effect between the Sun and the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of our galaxy (known as [[Sagittarius A*]]), creating havoc on Earth.&lt;ref name="krupp" /&gt; Apart from the "galactic alignment" already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it.&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 [[light year]]s from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System.&lt;ref name="Questions answered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What would happen if a supermassive black hole came close to the Earth?" /&gt; This reading of the alignment was included on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary ''Decoding the Past''. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as "45&amp;nbsp;minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".&lt;ref name="How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary" /&gt;

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday used the term "galactic alignment" to describe a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in [[mass extinction]]s supposedly observed in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref name="fraser" /&gt; According to the [[Shiva Hypothesis]], mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc—as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years—it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.&lt;ref name="Perturbing the Oort Cloud" /&gt; However, this "alignment" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.&lt;ref name="Galactic Plane" /&gt; Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.&lt;ref name="The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane" /&gt;

A third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.&lt;ref name="Planetary Alignment" /&gt; [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above ≈300&amp;nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]], the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.&lt;ref name="Plait-alignment" /&gt;

=== Geomagnetic reversal ===
Another idea tied to 2012 involved a [[geomagnetic reversal]] (often referred to as a [[pole shift]] by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive [[solar flare]], that would release an energy equal to 100&amp;nbsp;billion [[atomic bombs]].&lt;ref name="2012: No Killer Solar Flare" /&gt; This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's [[magnetic field]] was weakening,&lt;ref name="Rapidly changing flows in the Earth's core" /&gt; which could precede a reversal of the north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic poles]], and the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], which was expected sometime around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Storm Warning|publisher=NASA|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/10mar_stormwarning/|year=2006|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific estimates, however, say that geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete,&lt;ref name="Merrill"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Merrill | first1 = Ronald T. | last2 = McElhinny | first2 = Michael W. | last3 = McFadden | first3 = Philip L. | title = The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|publisher=[[Academic Press]] | year = 1998|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not start on any particular date.&lt;ref name="Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Furthermore, the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, and that it would be fairly weak, with a below-average number of [[sunspots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Maximum: Three Solar Flares And A Coronal Mass Ejection As The Sun Reaches Peak Solar Activity|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/solar-maximum-three-solar-flares-coronal-mass-ejection-sun-reaches-peak-solar-activity-1442608|year=2013|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, there was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth.&lt;ref name="2012: No Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications.&lt;ref name="goemag" /&gt; David Morrison attributed the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer [[Michio Kaku]], who claimed in an interview with [[Fox News]] that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as "Solar Storm Warning", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt;

=== Planet X/Nibiru ===
{{main|Nibiru cataclysm}}

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called Planet&amp;nbsp;X, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which appeared in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt; The idea originated from claims of channeling [[grey aliens|alien beings]] and is widely ridiculed.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;{{sfn|Schilling|2008|p=111}} Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;

=== Other catastrophes ===
[[File:Pleiades large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pleiades]], a [[star cluster]] with supposed influence sometimes tied to the 2012 event|alt=The Pleiades star cluster]]

Author [[Graham Hancock]], in his book ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'', interpreted Coe's remarks in ''Breaking the Maya Code''{{sfn|Coe|1992|pp=275–276}} as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm.&lt;ref name="hancock" /&gt; Filmmaker [[Roland Emmerich]] later credited the book with inspiring his 2009 [[disaster film]] ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]''.&lt;ref name="chicagoscifi credits"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf | title = 2012 (2009)&amp;nbsp;– Credit List |accessdate=25 November 2009 |publisher=chicagoscifi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the [[Web Bot]] project, a computer program that purports to predict the future by analyzing Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected claims that the bot is able to predict natural disasters, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.&lt;ref name="'Web-bot project' makes prophecy of 2012 apocalypse" /&gt;

The 2012 date was also loosely tied to the long-running concept of the [[Photon Belt]], which predicted a form of interaction between Earth and [[Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]], the largest star of the [[Pleiades cluster]].&lt;ref name="morris2" /&gt; Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.&lt;ref name="Is the earth about to enter the Photon Belt, causing the end of life as we know it?" /&gt;

Some media outlets tied the fact that the [[red supergiant]] star [[Betelgeuse]] would undergo a [[supernova]] at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Connelly 19 January 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |title=Tatooine's twin suns&amp;nbsp;– coming to a planet near you just as soon as Betelgeuse explodes |last=Connelly |first=Claire |work=News.com.au |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922083805/http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years.&lt;ref name="Betelgeuse and 2012" /&gt; To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth.&lt;ref name="Is Betelgeuse about to blow?" /&gt; In December 2011, NASA's [[Francis Reddy]] issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.&lt;ref name="Reddy 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title = 2012: Fear No Supernova | publisher = NASA | last = Reddy | first = Francis | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-supernova.html | year = 2011 | accessdate = 23 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim involved [[alien invasion]]. In December 2010, an article, first published in [[examiner.com]] and later referenced in the English-language edition of ''[[Pravda]]''&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt; claimed, citing a Second [[Digitized Sky Survey]] photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; Astronomer and debunker [[Phil Plait]] noted that by using the [[small-angle formula]], one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; In January 2011, [[Seth Shostak]], chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt;

Beginning in 2000, the small French village of [[Bugarach]], population 189, began receiving visits from "esoterics"—mystic believers who had concluded that the local mountain, [[Pic de Bugarach]], was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army.&lt;ref name="For End of the World, a French Peak Holds Allure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuel 2010" /&gt; "We've seen a huge rise in visitors", Delord told ''[[The Independent]]'' in March 2012. "Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last year we had 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage à ovnis' [a garage for [[UFO]]s]. The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal."&lt;ref name=hippies /&gt; In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayan Doomsday: French Police Block Access to Survivors' Refuge Pic de Bugarach|author=Hanna Osborne|publisher=International Business Times|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129090241/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|archivedate=29 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared at the height of the "event".

== Cultural influence ==
The 2012 phenomenon was discussed or referenced in several media. Several TV documentaries, as well as some contemporary fictional references to the year 2012, referred to 21 December as the day of a cataclysmic event.

The [[UFO conspiracy]] TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' cited 22 December 2012 as the date for an alien colonization of the Earth and mentioned the [[Mayan calendar]] "stopping" on this date.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; The [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]] aired a handful of special series on doomsday that included analysis of 2012 theories, such as ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' (2005–2007), ''2012, End of Days'' (2006), ''[[Last Days on Earth]]'' (2006), ''Seven Signs of the Apocalypse'' (2009), and ''Nostradamus 2012'' (2008).&lt;ref name="Armageddon series" /&gt; The [[Discovery Channel]] also aired ''2012 Apocalypse'' in 2009, suggesting that massive [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storms]], [[magnetic pole reversal]], earthquakes, [[supervolcano]]es, and other drastic natural events could occur in 2012.&lt;ref name="2012 Apocalypse" /&gt; In 2012, the [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]] launched a show called ''[[Doomsday Preppers]]'', a documentary series about [[survivalism|survivalists]] preparing for various cataclysms, including the 2012 doomsday.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic Doomsday Preppers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Doomsday Preppers | work = National Geographic | url = http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/doomsday-preppers/ | accessdate = 6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of books were published on the topic.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; The bestselling book of 2009,&lt;ref name="Best-Selling Books of 2009" /&gt; [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Lost Symbol]]'', featured a coded mock email number (2456282.5) that decoded to the [[Julian date]] for 21 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of The Lost Symbol|author1=Dan Bernstein |author2=Arne de Kiuzer |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qgqfqUjF_38C&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=2456282.5+julian+date+%22lost+symbol%22|accessdate=19 December 2012|isbn=978-0-297-86060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinema, the 2009 disaster film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a [[stealth marketing]] campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional "Institute for Human Continuity" called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic.&lt;ref name="sony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Relax, the end isn't nigh" /&gt; Although the campaign was heavily criticized,&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name="2009 Worldwide Grosses" /&gt; An article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' attributed the widespread fear of the 2012 phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicted the Chinese building "survival arks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China fears end of the world is nigh|author=Malcolm Moore|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9729270/China-fears-end-of-the-world-is-nigh.html| accessdate=11 December 2012|location=London|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' featured a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun on a collision course with Earth.&lt;ref name="Sunny Kirsten Dunst is picture perfect at the Cannes photocall for her provocative new film Melancholia" /&gt; Announcing his company's purchase of the film, the head of [[Magnolia Pictures]] said in a press release, "As the 2012 apocalypse is upon us, it is time to prepare for a cinematic last supper".&lt;ref name="Magnolia Picks Up North American Rights to Lars von Trier's 'Melancholia'" /&gt;

The phenomenon also inspired several rock and pop music hits. As early as 1997, "[[A Certain Shade of Green]]" by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] referred to the mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 ("Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?"). More recent hits include "[[2012 (It Ain't the End)]]" (2010) performed by [[Jay Sean]] and "[[Till the World Ends]]" (2011) performed by [[Britney Spears]]. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet [[hoax]] related to South Korean singer [[Psy]] being one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once Psy's "[[Gangnam Style]]" YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |newspaper=[[New Straits Times]] |title=Much ado about apocalypse |first=Chok |last=Suat Ling |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104174754/http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian composer [[A.

A number of brands ran commercials tied to the 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company [[General Motors]] aired an advertisement during the annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football game]] in which a group of friends drove [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, [[Jell-O]] ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at [[Boston University]], questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Vanessa |title=Brands Capitalize on 'Impending Apocalypse' |publisher=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-19/brands-capitalizing-on-the-impending-apocalypse|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin|30em}}
* {{note label|A|a|a}} The [[13 (number)|number 13]] plays an important role in Mesoamerican calendrics; the ''[[tzolk'in]]'', or sacred calendar, was divided into 13 months of 20 days each. The Mayan ''may'' cycle consisted of 13 k'atuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.{{sfn|Rice|2007|pp=44, 59}}&lt;ref name="The Origin of the 260-day calendar: the gestation hypothesis reconsidered in light of its use among the Quiche Maya" /&gt;
* {{note label|B|b|b}} The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt;
* {{note label|C|c|c}} Rather than "0.0.0.0.0", the Mayan Long Count represented the date of creation as "13.0.0.0.0"&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt;
* {{note label|D|d|d}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as [[Mark Van Stone]] and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the "GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC and the end date of b'ak'tun 13 at 21 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Who's Who in the Maya World" /&gt; This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the "Lounsbury/GMT+2" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at 23 December. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;
* {{note label|E|e|e}} Coe's initial date was "24 December 2011". He revised it to "11 January AD 2013" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book,{{sfn|Coe|1980|p=151}} not settling on 23 December 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.{{refn|{{harvnb|Coe|1984}}. This correlation, which differs two days from Sharer's, is repeated in subsequent editions of Coe's book.}} The correlation of b'ak'tun 13 as 21 December 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of Robert J. Sharer's 1983 revision of the 4th edition of Sylvanus Morley's book ''The Ancient Maya'' {{harv|Morley|1983|p=603|loc=Table B2}}.

'''Aarhus Symposium''' is an annual leadership conference taking place at the [[Aarhus University|University of Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], on the first Friday in November. The aim of the event is to connect leaders of today with leaders of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; To do so, a wide range of key decision-makers are invited to share their experiences and engage in discussions with students from various universities.

Aarhus Symposium was founded in 2011 and has since expanded its concept to also involve [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Focus|Aarhus Symposium Focus]]&lt;ref name="Faglig"&gt;http://www.netvaerksportalen.dk/artikler/studerende-og-topledere-moedes-i-faglig-debat-aarhus-symposium&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Challenge|Aarhus Symposium Challenge]].&lt;ref name="Challenge"&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/97854/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium is a non-profit organisation, and all symposia are organised by voluntary students together with a pro-bono board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/erhverv/ECE7183981/Leder-event-udsolgt-p%C3%A5-90-sekunder/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/become-a-partner/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Four students at [[Aarhus University]] established Aarhus Symposium in 2011: David Scherer, Jens Riis Andersen, Kasper Vinther Olesen, and Andreas Emmertsen. They gathered support from other students to organise the very first Aarhus Symposium with the objective of building a bridge between students, i.e. the future leaders, and leaders in today’s businesses and society.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/12/3184822/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://stiften.dk/aarhus/Erhvervslivets-tunge-drenge-yder-studiehjaelp/artikel/92572&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual Aarhus Symposium welcomed renowned speakers from the business society such as Carsten Bjerg (then CEO of [[Grundfos]]), Lars Rohde (then CEO of [[Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension|ATP]]), and Maria Rønn (CEO of [[DR (broadcaster)|Danmarks Radio]]).&lt;ref name="Growth"&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/past-symposia/growth-in-distressed-economies/&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years, the programme has extended to include prominent speakers such as [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Denmark]],&lt;ref&gt;http://kongehuset.dk/menu/nyheder/abning-af-aarhus-symposium-2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lars Rebien Sørensen (president and CEO of [[Novo Nordisk]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE8162162/Studerende-har-hyret-verdens-bedste-chef/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://jyskebank.tv/nutidens-og-fremtidens-ledere-modes-til-aarhus&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium has grown through the years as a result of wide support from students, speakers, partners, and others.&lt;ref name="Faglig"/&gt; In 2012, the Organising Committee introduced Battle of the Economists; an event to take place on Monday in the week of Aarhus Symposium. It provided a national focus to the overall theme of Aarhus Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/63904/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt; The event was renamed Aarhus Symposium Focus in 2016 to broaden the possibilities for topics that exceed economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/aarhussymposium/docs/booklet2016_final_rgb&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Aarhus Symposium Challenge was established to strengthen the connection between students and the leaders of today.&lt;ref name="Challenge"/&gt; Aarhus Symposium Challenge is an essay competition in which selected speakers put forth a challenge for students to solve. Through their essay, students obtain a seat at both Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus, and they potentially qualify for [[Aarhus Symposium#Leaders' Forum|Leaders’ Forum]]. Since its initiation in 2013, an increasing number of students have participated in Aarhus Symposium Challenge, making it the primary sign-up for Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/aarhus-symposium-challenge/&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium takes place on the first Friday in November. Here, business executives and key decision-makers are invited to share their experiences and insights regarding a specific theme. They do so with different perspectives that reflect the tracks, i.e. subtopics, of the event.

=== Leaders' Forum ===
[[File:ASForum.jpg|thumb|left|Leaders’ Forum session with Connie Hedegaard at Aarhus Symposium 2015.]]
Leaders’ Forum is an exclusive and intimate session where selected students discuss their essay contribution with the leader that put forth the respective challenge. Only the best essay contributions under each challenge topic qualifies for this informal session.&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/challenge-faq/&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, Leaders’ Forum has attracted much attention from the media inasmuch as it is unique in a Danish context and provides both the attending students and the top leaders the opportunity to learn from each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/97871/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business.dk/digital/jimmy-maymann-det-nytter-ikke-at-ville-holde-fremskridtet-tilbage&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''accident''', also known as an '''unintentional injury''', is an undesirable, incidental, and an unplanned event that could have been prevented had [[Attendant circumstance|circumstances]] leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term "accident" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.&lt;ref name=Robertson2015&gt;{{cite book | last = Robertson | first = Leon S. | title = Injury Epidemiology: Fourth Edition | year = 2015 | publisher = Lulu Books | url = http://www.nanlee.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical and non-physical===
Physical examples of accidents include unintended motor vehicle collisions or falls, being injured by touching something sharp, hot, moving objects, contacting electricity or ingesting poison. Non-physical examples are unintentionally revealing a [[secret]] or otherwise saying something incorrectly, accidental deletion of data, forgetting an appointment etc.

===By activity===
* Accidents during the execution of work or arising out of it are called [[work accident]]s. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), more than 337 million accidents happen on the job each year, resulting, together with occupational diseases, in more than 2.3 million deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/safety-and-health-at-work/lang--en/index.htm ILO Safety and Health at Work]". International Labour Organization (ILO)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In contrast, [[leisure]]-related accidents are mainly [[Sports injury|sports injuries]].

===By vehicle===

* [[Aviation accidents and incidents|Aviation]]
* [[Bicycle safety|Bicycles]]
* [[Sailing ships]]
* [[Traffic collision]]s
* [[Train wrecks]]
* [[Trams]]

==Common causes==
{{See also|Preventable causes of death}}
[[File:Accidents.svg|thumb|300px|Incidence of accidents (of a severity of resulting in seeking medical care), sorted by activity (in Denmark in 2002).]]
Poisons, vehicle collisions and falls are the most common causes of fatal injuries. According to a 2005 survey of injuries sustained at home, which used data from the National Vital Statistics System of the United States [[National Center for Health Statistics]], falls, poisoning, and fire/burn injuries are the most common causes of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Runyan CW, Casteel C, Perkis D |title=Unintentional injuries in the home in the United States Part I: mortality |journal=Am J Prev Med |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=73–9 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15626560 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2004.09.010 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States also collects statistically valid injury data (sampled from 100 hospitals) through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System administered by the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]].&lt;ref name=NEISS&gt;CPSC. [http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Safety-Education/Safety-Guides/General-Information/National-Electronic-Injury-Surveillance-System-NEISS/ National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)]. Database query available through: [http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/ NEISS Injury Data].&lt;/ref&gt; This program was revised in 2000 to include all injuries rather than just injuries involving products.&lt;ref name=NEISS/&gt; Data on [[emergency department]] visits is also collected through the [[National Health Interview Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;NCHS. [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/ervisits.htm Emergency Department Visits]. CDC.&lt;/ref&gt; In The U.S. the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] has available on their website extensive statistics on workplace accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/iif|title=Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities|author=|date=|website=www.bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Accidental incest''' is [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or [[marriage]] between persons who were unaware of a family relationship between them which would be considered [[incest]]uous.

The laws of many jurisdictions [[Void marriage|void incestuous marriages]], even if entered into without awareness of the kinship. If an incestuous relationship is suspected, [[DNA testing]] may be used. Some jurisdictions permit offspring of IVF donations access to donation records or to adoption records.

==Causes==
People may be unaware of a [[kinship]] relationship between them in a number of circumstances. For example, [[artificial insemination]] with an anonymous [[sperm donation|donated sperm]] may result in offspring being unaware of any biological relations, such as paternity or half siblings. To reduce the likelihood of accidental incest, fertility clinics usually limit the number of times that a donor's sperm may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9iJlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RYgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2368,2279497&amp;dq=accidental-incest |title=Accidental Incest Risk Increases |date=15 March 1979 |work=Edmonton Journal |agency=Associated Press |page=61 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=coNSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hwUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6125,3788930&amp;dq=accidental-incest |title=Report From A Test Tube Baby |last=Atallah |first=Lillian |date=19 April 1976 |work=Ocala Star-Banner |page=35 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries have laws limiting the number of children a donor can father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/30/international/europe/30sperm.html |title=Spreading Scandinavian Genes, Without Viking Boats |last=Alvarez |first=Lizette |date=30 September 2004 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others limit sperm donations based on family numbers to enable one family to have true siblings.

[[Taiwan]] allows those conceived by artificial means to find out if they are related to a person they are considering marrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/05/11/2003360370 |title=DOH working on provision to stop accidental incest |last=Oung |first=Angelica |date=11 May 2007 |work=The Taipei Times |page=2 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |location=Taiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidental incest may also arise in the following situations:
* Children separated from their family at birth,
* [[Child abandonment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Angelica |first=Jade Christine |title=A Moral Emergency: Breaking the Cycle of Child Sexual Abuse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-F92TlEyr8oC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22accidental+incest%22&amp;ei=-P-HTa2tOKqO0QHR58T9DQ&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwATgK&amp;q=%22accidental%20incest%22 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sexual exploration.

==Notable cases==
*In 2008, it was reported that a British brother and sister, who were twins separated at birth, married without knowing of their relationship. According to the report, the relationship was discovered soon after their wedding, and the marriage was annulled. The case has raised the issue regarding whether adoptions should be kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/01/11/twins.married/?imw=Y&amp;iref=mpstoryemail |title=Unknowing twins married, lawmaker says |publisher=CNN |accessdate=23 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://culturekitchen.com/mole333/blog/accidental_incest_twins_separated_at_birth_marr |title=Accidental Incest: Twins Separated at Birth Marry |last=Sabater |first=Liza |publisher=Culture Kitchen |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been raised, however, about whether the story is, in fact, true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Henley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/15/familyandrelationships.jonhenley |title=Did a pair of twins really get married by mistake? |work=The Guardian |accessdate=3 April 2012 |location=London |date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An engaged couple in South Africa, who had been together for five years and were expecting a child, discovered that they were brother and sister just before their wedding. They were raised separately and met as adults in college. Just before the wedding, their parents met and they came to realize that they were siblings. The couple broke off the relationship after the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stewart |last=Maclean |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2057081/Engaged-couple-discover-brother-sister-parents-meet-days-wedding.html |title=Engaged couple discover they are brother and sister when their parents meet just before wedding |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Andrea Michaels was born in the [[Arbe concentration camp]] (today [[Rab]], [[Croatia]], on the northern shore of the [[Adriatic Sea]]) to Lelja Kauders (b. Zagreb, Yugoslavia, August 25, 1923 – d. Los Angeles California, May 30, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Tributes.com/show/Lelja-Gerson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ben7879&gt;Wright, David, ''Yes You Can! Reaching Your Potential While Achieving Greatness - with Dr. Warren Bennis, Andrea Michaels and Jim Rohn''. Sevierville, Tennessee: Insight Publishing, 2010, pp. 77-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels and her mother, along with her mother's [[Jewish]] parents, Paul (Palvo) Kauders and Elza Ackerman Kauders, escaped in a small boat across the Adriatic to Italy.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; Michaels lived in Italy to the age of four with her grandparents until her mother, who had married an American pilot, sent for her to come live in America.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; The marriage ended, and after Michaels arrived in America, her mother married Peter Gerson, who adopted Andrea and moved the family from [[Silverlake, California]], to [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; When Michaels was ten, the family moved to [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt;

An only child Michaels graduated from [[Burbank High School (Burbank, California)|Burbank High School]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classmates.com/places/school/school/3516/m?startYear=1900&amp;endYear=9999&amp;communityId=3516&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels attended the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1961 and 1962, transferring to the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA) before marrying Bob Spritz on February 1, 1964.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; The marriage lasted ten years, and they had a son, Jon (b. July 24, 1970).&lt;ref name=reflect/&gt; After her divorce from Spritz, she changed her last name as well as that of her son's to "Michaels."&lt;ref name=reflect/&gt; Michaels returned to UCLA in 1970 and earned a degree, with honors, in [[Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;2002 Hall of Fame, NAWBOLA.org./About_Us/2002_hof.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
Instead of pursuing a career in Psychology, Michaels began working with the Ron Rubin Orchestras in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Maggie, "Spectacular Events Keep Encino Firm in Demand," Features Section, Los Angeles Times, November 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, she became interested in the [[event planning]] business when there was no formalized industry. She produced her first event in 1978—-a [[Anniversary|bicentennial]] celebration for Marsh McClellan Insurance Company. By 1982, the company had been restructured and renamed Michaels, Rubin and Associates.&lt;ref name=ben7879 /&gt; Michaels and Rubin dissolved their relationship in December 1988, and on that same day, Extraordinary Events was launched.&lt;ref&gt;"Coffee With Andrea Michaels - Meetings And Conventions".

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Carbon monoxide poisoning''' typically occurs from [[inhalation|breathing]] in [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) at excessive levels.&lt;ref name=Sc2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schottke|first1=David|title=Emergency Medical Responder: Your First Response in Emergency Care|date=2016|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1284107272|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910171934/https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms are often described as "[[flu]]-like" and commonly include [[headache]], [[dizziness]], weakness, vomiting, [[chest pain]], and [[confusion]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; Large exposures can result in [[loss of consciousness]], [[arrhythmias]], [[seizures]], or death.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; The classically described "cherry red skin" rarely occurs.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Long term complications may include feeling tired, trouble with memory, and movement problems.&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; In those [[smoke inhalation|exposed to smoke]], [[cyanide toxicity]] should also be considered.&lt;ref name=Gu2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=JA|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=Critical care clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=537–48|pmid=22998990|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur accidentally or as an [[suicide|attempt to end one's life]].&lt;ref name=Buck2011/&gt; CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating.&lt;ref name=Bl2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleecker|first1=ML|title=Carbon monoxide intoxication|journal=Handbook of clinical neurology|date=2015|volume=131|pages=191–203|pmid=26563790|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-62627-1.00024-X|series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|isbn=978-0444626271}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced during [[incomplete combustion|incomplete burning]] of [[organic matter]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; This can occur from [[motor vehicles]], heaters, or cooking equipment that run on [[carbon-based fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; It can also occur from exposure to [[methylene chloride]].&lt;ref name=Fer2017/&gt; Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with [[hemoglobin]] to form [[carboxyhemoglobin]] (HbCO) preventing the [[blood]] from carrying [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; Additionally, [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondria]]l [[cytochrome oxidase]] are affected.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Efforts to prevent poisoning include [[carbon monoxide detector]]s, proper venting of [[gas appliances]], keeping chimneys clean, and keeping [[exhaust system]]s of vehicles in good repair.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ&gt;{{cite web|last1=Health|first1=National Center for Environmental|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning – Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en-us|date=30 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705012403/https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm|archivedate=5 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving [[oxygen therapy|100% oxygen]] along with [[supportive care]].&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; This should generally be carried out until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; While [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buck2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=NA|last2=Juurlink|first2=DN|last3=Isbister|first3=G|last4=Bennett|first4=MH|last5=Lavonas|first5=EJ|title=Hyperbaric oxygen for carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=13 April 2011|issue=4|pages=CD002041|pmid=21491385|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002041.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
Carbon monoxide poisoning is relatively common, resulting in more than 20,000 [[emergency department]] visits a year in the United States.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penney|first1=David G.|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0849384189|page=569|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA569|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910171934/https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA569|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most common type of fatal poisoning in many countries.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002&gt;{{cite journal | author=Omaye ST | title=Metabolic modulation of carbon monoxide toxicity | journal=Toxicology |date=Nov 2002 | pages=139–50 | volume=180 | issue=2 | pmid=12324190 | doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00387-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States non-fire related cases results in more than 400 deaths a year.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of [[portable generators]] during [[power outage]]s.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer2017&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferri|first1=Fred F.|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017 E-Book: 5 Books in 1|date=2016|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0323448383|pages=227–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910171934/https://books.google.com/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toxic effects of CO have been known since [[ancient history]].&lt;ref name=Blu2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blumenthal|first1=I|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=June 2001|volume=94|issue=6|pages=270–72|pmid=11387414|doi=10.1177/014107680109400604|pmc=1281520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realization that hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.&lt;ref name=Blu2001/&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Carbon monoxide is not toxic to all forms of life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with hemoglobin so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus has no effect on photosynthesising plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/HC270799/HDL/ENV/enven/vol321.htm|title=Carbon monoxide|work=ernet.in|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414051805/http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/HC270799/HDL/ENV/enven/vol321.htm|archivedate=2014-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is easily absorbed through the lungs.&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt; Inhaling the gas can lead to [[Cerebral hypoxia|hypoxic injury]], [[Brain damage|nervous system damage]], and even [[death]].

One of the major concerns following acute carbon monoxide poisoning is the severe delayed neurological manifestations that may occur. Problems may include difficulty with higher intellectual functions, [[memory loss|short-term memory loss]], [[dementia]], [[amnesia]], [[psychosis]], irritability, a strange [[gait]], speech disturbances, [[Parkinson's disease]]-like syndromes, [[cortical blindness]], and a [[Depression (mood)|depressed mood]].&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Choi IS|title=Delayed neurologic sequelae in carbon monoxide intoxication|journal=Archives of Neurology|volume=40|issue=7|pages=433–35|date=July 1983|pmid=6860181|doi=10.1001/archneur.1983.04050070063016|url=http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=582033|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819232412/http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=582033|archivedate=2012-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depression may occur in those who did not have pre-existing depression.&lt;ref name="ClinNeurolNeurosurg2001-roohi"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Roohi F, Kula RW, Mehta N |title=Twenty-nine years after carbon monoxide intoxication|journal=Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery|date=July 2001|pages=92–95|volume=103|issue=2|pmid=11516551|doi=10.1016/S0303-8467(01)00119-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These delayed neurological [[sequelae]] may occur in up to 50% of poisoned people after 2 to 40 days.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; It is difficult to predict who will develop delayed sequelae; however, advanced age, loss of consciousness while poisoned, and initial neurological abnormalities may increase the chance of developing delayed symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Myers RA, Snyder SK, Emhoff TA |title=Subacute sequelae of carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|volume=14|issue=12|pages=1163–67|date=December 1985|pmid=4061987|doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(85)81022-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One classic sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is more often seen in the dead rather than the living – people have been described as looking red-cheeked and healthy (see below). However, since this "cherry-red" appearance is common only in the deceased, and is unusual in living people, it is not considered a useful diagnostic sign in clinical medicine. In pathological (autopsy) examination the ruddy appearance of carbon monoxide poisoning is notable because unembalmed dead persons are normally bluish and pale, whereas dead carbon-monoxide poisoned persons may simply appear unusually lifelike in coloration.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simini B|title=Cherry-red discolouration in carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Lancet| volume=352|issue=9134| page=1154|date=October 1998|pmid=9798630|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)79807-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JEmergMed2002-brooks"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brooks DE, Lin E, Ahktar J |title=What is cherry red, and who cares?|journal= [[The Journal of Emergency Medicine]] |date=February 2002|pages=213–14|volume=22|issue=2|pmid=11858933|doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colorant effect of carbon monoxide in such postmortem circumstances is thus analogous to its use as a red colorant in the commercial meat-packing industry.

== Pathophysiology ==

The precise mechanisms by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome oxidase]] and restricting oxygen supply, and carbon monoxide causing [[brain]] [[lipid peroxidation]].&lt;ref name="Weaver-NEJM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bateman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bateman DN|title=Carbon Monoxide|journal=Medicine|volume=31|issue=10|page=233|date=October 2003|doi=10.1383/medc.31.10.41.27810}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt;

=== Hemoglobin ===
[[File:Hemoglobin saturation curve.svg|thumb|Carbon monoxide shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to the left.]]
Carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen, and the only enzyme in the human body that produces carbon monoxide is [[heme oxygenase]], which is located in all cells and breaks down [[heme]]. Under normal conditions, carbon monoxide levels in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] are approximately 0 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]] because it has a higher diffusion coefficient and the body easily gets rid of any CO made.&lt;ref name="Kaplan.Physio"&gt;{{cite book|title=USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes: Physiology|year=2011|author=Dunn, Robert B.|author2=Kudrath, W. |author3=Passo, SS |author4=Wilson, LB|pages=167–68|chapter=7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Townsend CL, Maynard RL |title=Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=59|issue=10|pages=708–11|date=October 2002|pmid=12356933|pmc=1740215|doi=10.1136/oem.59.10.708|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPhysiol1895-Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haldane J|title=The action of carbonic oxide on man|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1895|pages=430–62|volume=18|url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|pmid=16992272|issue=5–6|pmc=1514663|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1895.sp000578|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708152937/http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemoglobin is a [[Tetrameric protein|tetramer]] with four oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon monoxide at one of these sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gorman D, Drewry A, Huang YL, Sames C |title=The clinical toxicology of carbon monoxide|journal=Toxicology|date=May 2003|pages=25–38|volume=187|issue=1|pmid=12679050|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the [[oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve|oxygen dissociation curve]] to the left.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.

=== Myoglobin ===

Carbon monoxide also binds to the [[hemeprotein]] [[myoglobin]]. It has a high affinity for myoglobin, about 60 times greater than that of oxygen.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; This causes reduced [[cardiac output]] and [[hypotension]], which may result in [[brain ischemia]].&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt;

=== Cytochrome oxidase ===

Another mechanism involves effects on the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain that is responsible for effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to [[cytochrome oxidase]] with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gorman DF, Runciman WB |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Anaesthesia and Intensive Care |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=506–11 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1750629 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient [[adenosine triphosphate]] synthesis. Cells respond by switching to [[anaerobic metabolism]], causing [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], [[lactic acidosis]], and eventual cell death.&lt;ref name="PharmacolToxicol2003-alonso"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso JR, Cardellach F, Lopez S, Casademont J, Miro O |title=Carbon monoxide specifically inhibits cytochrome c oxidase of human mitochondrial respiratory chain|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology|date=September 2003|pages=142–46|volume=93|issue=3|pmid=12969439|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0773.2003.930306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of [[oxidative metabolism]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt;

=== Central nervous system effects ===

The mechanism that is thought to have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain [[lipid peroxidation]] (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes [[endothelial]] cell and platelet release of [[nitric oxide]], and the formation of [[oxygen free radicals]] including [[peroxynitrite]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, [[capillary]] leakage, [[leukocyte]] sequestration, and [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="JRSocMed2001-blumenthal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blumenthal I|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=June 2001|pages=270–72|volume=94|issue=6|pmid=11387414|url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11387414|format=Free full text|pmc=1281520|doi=10.1177/014107680109400604}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these effects is [[lipid peroxidation]], which causes delayed reversible [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinization]] of [[white matter]] in the central nervous system known as [[Grinker myelinopathy]], which can lead to [[edema]] and [[necrosis]] within the brain.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt; This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral [[white matter]] and [[basal ganglia]].&lt;ref name="JRSocMed2001-blumenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fan HC, Wang AC, Lo CP, Chang KP, Chen SJ |title=Damage of cerebellar white matter due to carbon monoxide poisoning: a case report|journal=[[The American Journal of Emergency Medicine]]|volume=27|issue=6|pages=757.e5–e7|date=July 2009|pmid=19751650|doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2008.10.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, [[globus pallidus]], [[cerebellum]], [[hippocampus]] and the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref name="Prockop"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Prockop LD, Chichkova RI |title=Carbon monoxide intoxication: an updated review|journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences|date=Nov 2007|pages=122–30|volume=262|issue=1–2|pmid=17720201|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fukuhara M, Abe I, Matsumura K, Kaseda S, Yamashita Y, Shida K, Kawashima H, Fujishima M |title=Circadian variations of blood pressure in patients with sequelae of carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=American Journal of Hypertension |volume=9|issue=4 Part 1|pages=300–05|date=April 1996|pmid=8722431|doi=10.1016/0895-7061(95)00342-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===

Carbon monoxide poisoning in pregnant women may cause severe adverse [[fetus|fetal]] effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] by decreasing the release of maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the [[placenta]] and combines with [[fetal hemoglobin]], causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt; Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical.&lt;ref name="Greingor"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Greingor JL, Tosi JM, Ruhlmann S, Aussedat M |title=Acute carbon monoxide intoxication during pregnancy. One case report and review of the literature|journal=Emergency Medicine Journal|volume=18|issue=5|pages=399–401|date=September 2001|pmid=11559621|pmc=1725677|doi=10.1136/emj.18.5.399|url=http://emj.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11559621}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Farrow JR, Davis GJ, Roy TM, McCloud LC, Nichols GR |title=Fetal death due to nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1448–52|date=November 1990|pmid=2262778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

[[File:Breath CO Monitor.jpg|thumb|Breath CO monitor displaying carbon monoxide concentration of an exhaled breath sample (in ppm) with its corresponding percent concentration of carboxyhemoglobin.]]
As many symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult.&lt;ref name="Varon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bennetto L, Powter L, Scolding NJ |title=Accidental carbon monoxide poisoning presenting without a history of exposure: A case report|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|volume=2|issue=1|page=118|date=April 2008|pmid=18430228|doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-118|pmc=2390579}}&lt;/ref&gt; A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] compared to the amount of [[hemoglobin]] in the blood.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

The ratio of carboxyhemoglobin to hemoglobin molecules in an average person may be up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%.&lt;ref name="Clinical Toxicology2001-ford"&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Ford MD, Delaney KA, Ling LJ, Erickson T |title=Clinical Toxicology|year=2001|page=1046|publisher=WB Saunders Company|isbn=0721654851}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10–30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30–90%.&lt;ref&gt;Sato K, Tamaki K, Hattori H, et al.

Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 237–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

As people may continue to experience significant symptoms of CO poisoning long after their blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration has returned to normal, presenting to examination with a normal carboxyhemoglobin level (which may happen in late states of poisoning) does not rule out poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keleş A, Demircan A, Kurtoğlu G |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning: how many patients do we miss?|journal=European Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=15|issue=3|pages=154–57|date=June 2008|pmid=18460956|doi=10.1097/MEJ.0b013e3282efd519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring===
Carbon monoxide may be quantitated in blood using [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometric]] methods or [[chromatography|chromatographic techniques]] in order to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in a person or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal exposure.

In new homes, AC-powered detectors must have battery backup and be interconnected to ensure early warning of occupants at all levels.&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt; NFPA 720-2009 is the first national carbon monoxide standard to address devices in non-residential buildings. These guidelines, which now pertain to schools, healthcare centers, nursing homes and other non-residential buildings, include three main points:&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt;
:1. A secondary power supply (battery backup) must operate all carbon monoxide notification appliances for at least 12 hours,
:2. Detectors must be on the ceiling in the same room as permanently installed fuel-burning appliances, and
:3. Detectors must be located on every habitable level and in every [[HVAC]] zone of the building.

Gas organizations will often recommend to get gas appliances serviced at least once a year.&lt;ref name="Gas Safe Register (UK Government Organization)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gas Safety in the Home |publisher=UK Gas Safe Register |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url=http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502012946/http://gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2006, the US state of Massachusetts requires detectors to be present in all residences with potential CO sources, regardless of building age and whether they are owner-occupied or rented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|title=MGL Ch. 148 §28F{{frac|1|2}} – Nicole's Law, effective March 31, 2006|work=malegislature.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230154311/http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|archivedate=December 30, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is enforced by municipal inspectors, and was inspired by the death of 7-year-old Nicole Garofalo in 2005 due to snow blocking a home heating vent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305145343/http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |archivedate=2013-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions may have no requirement or only mandate detectors for new construction or at time of sale.

Despite similar deaths in vehicles with clogged exhaust pipes (for example in the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978]] and [[February 2013 nor'easter]]) and the commercial availability of the equipment, there is no legal requirement for automotive CO detectors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===World Health Organization recommendations===
The following guideline values (ppm values rounded) and periods of time-weighted average exposures have been determined in such a way that the carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) level of 2.5% is not exceeded, even when a normal subject engages in light or moderate exercise:
* 100&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (87 ppm) for 15 min
* 60&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (52 ppm) for 30 min
* 30&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (26 ppm) for 1 h
* 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (9 ppm) for 8 h

For indoor air quality 7&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (6 ppm) for 24 h (so as not to exceed 2% COHb for chronic exposure)

=== Hyperbaric oxygen ===
[[File:HyperBaric Oxygen Therapy Chamber 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A person within a hyperbaric oxygen chamber]]

==History==
&lt;!-- Editors are strongly requested NOT to change the title of this paragraph until consensus has been achieved on the talk page. --&gt;

The earliest description of carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; Documented cases of carbon monoxide being used as a [[Suicide methods#Carbon monoxide|method of suicide]] date to at least 100 BC in [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penney|first1=David G.|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0849384189|page=754|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910172025/https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|archivedate=2017-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work ''Misopogon'': "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside."&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Misopogon'' 341C-D&lt;/ref&gt; This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]].

[[John Scott Haldane]] identified carbon monoxide as the lethal constituent of [[afterdamp]], the gas created by [[combustion]], after examining many bodies of miners killed in pit explosions. Their skin was coloured cherry-pink from [[carboxyhaemoglobin]], the stable compound formed in the blood by reaction with the gas. As a result of his research, he was able to design respirators for rescue workers. He tested the effect of carbon monoxide on his own body in a closed chamber, describing the results of his slow poisoning. In the late 1890s, he introduced the use of small animals for miners to detect dangerous levels of carbon monoxide underground, either white mice or canaries. With a faster metabolism, they showed the effects of poisoning before gas levels became critical for the workers, and so gave an early warning of the problem. The [[canary in a coal mine|canary]] in British pits was replaced in 1986 by the electronic gas detector.

As part of the [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]], German [[Nazi]]s used [[gas van]]s at [[Chelmno extermination camp]] and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several [[extermination camp|death camps]] such as [[Treblinka]], [[Sobibor]] and [[Belzec]]. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in [[action T4]], the programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and [[disabled people]] before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by [[IG Farben]] in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]]. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers of people in the gas vans and the special [[gas chamber]]s used in the [[death camp]]s such as [[Treblinka]]. [[Exhaust fumes]] from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Genocide|vauthors=Totten S, Bartrop P, Markusen E|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood|pages=129, 156|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526000146/http://books.google.com/books?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;ots=S8jhBY6NxB&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|archivedate=2013-05-26|df=|isbn=978-0313346422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of oxygen as treatment began in 1868.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; The use of hyperbaric oxygen in rats following poisoning was studied by Haldane in 1895 while its use in humans began in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt;

==Research==
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the body as a byproduct of converting [[protoporphyrin]] into [[bilirubin]]. This carbon monoxide also combines with hemoglobin to make carboxyhemoglobin, but not at toxic levels.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

Small amounts of CO are beneficial and enzymes exist that produce it at times of oxidative stress. Drugs are being developed to introduce small amounts of CO during certain kinds of surgery, these drugs are called [[carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foresti|first1=R|last2=Bani-Hani|first2=MG|last3=Motterlini|first3=R|title=Use of carbon monoxide as a therapeutic agent: promises and challenges.|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=April 2008|volume=34|issue=4|pages=649–58|pmid=18286265|doi=10.1007/s00134-008-1011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catastrophism''' was the theory that the [[Earth]] had largely been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turney |first=C.S.M. |last2=Brown |first2=H. |year=2007 |title=Catastrophic early Holocene sea level rise, human migration and the Neolithic transition in Europe |journal=[[Quaternary Science Reviews]] |volume=26 |pages=2036–2041 |bibcode= 2007QSRv...26.2036T |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.07.003 |issue=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] (sometimes described as [[gradualism]]), in which slow incremental changes, such as [[erosion]], created all the Earth's [[geology|geological]] features. Uniformitarianism held that the present was the key to the past, and that all geological processes (such as [[erosion]]) throughout the past were like those that can be observed now. Since the early disputes, a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed, in which the [[scientific consensus]] accepts that there were some catastrophic events in the geologic past, but these were explicable as extreme examples of natural processes which can occur.

Catastrophism held that [[geological epoch]]s had ended with violent and sudden natural catastrophes such as great floods and the rapid [[orogeny|formation of major mountain chains]].  Plants and animals living in the parts of the world where such events occurred were [[extinction|made extinct]], being replaced abruptly by the new forms whose fossils defined the geological strata. Some catastrophists attempted to relate at least one such change to the Biblical account of [[Noah's flood]].

The concept was first popularised by the early 19th-century French scientist [[Georges Cuvier]], who proposed that new life forms had moved in from other areas after local floods, and avoided  religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="McG 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133" /&gt;

==History==

===Geology and biblical beliefs===
{{Main article|history of geology}}
In the early development of [[geology]], efforts were made in a predominantly [[Christian]] western society to reconcile biblical narratives of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] and the [[Universal Flood Myth#Jewish|universal flood]] with new concepts about the processes which had formed the Earth. The discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was "stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the [[Greeks]]", an example being [[Plutarch]]'s account of the [[Universal Flood Myth#Ogyges|Ogygian flood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvardnb|King|1877|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuvier and the natural theologians===
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

The leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early nineteenth century was the French [[anatomist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Georges Cuvier]]. His motivation was to explain the patterns of [[extinction]] and [[faunal succession]] that he and others were observing in the [[fossil]] record. While he did speculate that the catastrophe responsible for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia might have been the result of the inundation of low-lying areas by the sea, he did not make any reference to [[Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="McG 3"&gt;{{Harvardnb|McGowan|2001|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did he ever make any reference to divine creation as the mechanism by which repopulation occurred following the extinction event. In fact Cuvier, influenced by the ideas of the [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the intellectual climate of the [[French revolution]], avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier also believed that the [[stratigraphic]] record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions, which he viewed as recurring natural events, amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast in Britain, where [[natural theology]] was influential during the early nineteenth century, a group of geologists including [[William Buckland]] and [[Robert Jameson]] interpreted Cuvier's work differently. Cuvier had written an introduction to a collection of his papers on fossil quadrupeds, discussing his ideas on catastrophic extinction. Jameson translated Cuvier's introduction into English, publishing it under the title ''Theory of the Earth''. He added extensive editorial notes to the translation, explicitly linking the latest of Cuvier's revolutions with the biblical flood. The resulting essay was extremely influential in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckland spent much of his early career trying to demonstrate the reality of the biblical flood using geological evidence. He frequently cited Cuvier's work, even though Cuvier had proposed an inundation of limited geographic extent and extended duration, whereas Buckland, to be consistent with the biblical account, was advocating a universal flood of short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Buckland abandoned [[flood geology]] in favor of the [[glaciation]] theory advocated by [[Louis Agassiz]], following a visit to the Alps where Agassiz demonstrated the effects of glaciation at first hand. As a result of the influence of Jameson, Buckland, and other advocates of natural theology, the nineteenth century debate over catastrophism took on much stronger religious overtones in Britain than elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of uniformitarianism in geology===
Uniformitarian explanations for the formation of [[sedimentary rock]] and an understanding of the immense stretch of [[geological time]], or as the concept came to be known [[deep time]], were found in the writing of [[James Hutton]], sometimes known as the father of geology, in the late 18th century. The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] built upon Hutton's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the Earth's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time. Lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work, ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', published in the 1830s, which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like Cuvier and Buckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From around 1850 to 1980, most geologists endorsed [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] ("The present is the key to the past") and [[gradualism]] (''geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time'') and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as [[earthquakes]], [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time, played any significant role in the formation of the Earth's surface. Instead they believed that the earth had been shaped by the long term action of forces such as volcanism, earthquakes, erosion, and sedimentation, that could still be observed in action today. In part, the geologists' rejection was fostered by their impression that the catastrophists of the early nineteenth century believed that God was directly involved in determining the history of Earth. Some of the theories about Catastrophism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were connected with [[religion]] and catastrophic origins were sometimes considered [[Miracle|miraculous]] rather than natural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in uniformitarianism made the introduction of a new catastrophe theory very difficult. In 1923 [[J Harlen Bretz]] published a paper on the [[channeled scablands]] formed by glacial [[Lake Missoula]] in Washington State, USA. Bretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day, kicking off an acrimonious 40 year debate. Finally in 1979 Bretz received the [[Penrose Medal]]; the [[Geological Society of America]]'s highest award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geosociety.org/awards/past.htm Penrose Medal 1979] to J Harlen Bretz, [[Geological Society of America]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Velikovsky's views===
{{Main|Velikovskyism}}
In the 1950s, [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] propounded catastrophism in several popular books. He speculated that the planet [[Venus]] is a former "[[comet]]" which was ejected from [[Jupiter]] and subsequently 3,500 years ago made two catastrophic close passes by Earth, 52 years apart, and later interacted with Mars, which then had a series of near collisions with Earth which ended in 687 BCE, before settling into its current [[orbit]]. Velikovsky used this to explain the biblical [[Ten Plagues|plague]]s of [[Egypt]], the biblical reference to the "Sun standing still" for a day (Joshua 10:12 &amp; 13, explained by changes in Earth's rotation), and the sinking of [[Atlantis]]. Scientists vigorously rejected Velikovsky's conjectures.&lt;ref name="UnMuseum"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krystek |first1=Lee |title=Venus in the Corner Pocket: The Controversial Theories of Immanuel Velikovsky |url=http://www.unmuseum.org/velikov.htm |publisher=Museum of Unnatural Mystery |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current application==
Neocatastrophism is the explanation of sudden extinctions in the palaeontological record by high magnitude, low frequency events (such as asteroid impacts, super-volcanic eruptions, supernova gamma ray bursts, etc.), as opposed to the more prevalent [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] thought which emphasises low magnitude, high frequency events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goudie |first1=A. |year= |title=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |page=709 |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luis Alvarez impact event hypothesis===
{{Main|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event}}

Over the past 25 years, a scientifically based catastrophism has gained wide acceptance with regard to certain events in the distant past. One impetus for this change came from the publication of a historic paper by [[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] in 1980. This paper suggested that a {{convert|10|km|mi}} [[asteroid]] [[Impact event|struck Earth]] 66 million years ago at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. The impact wiped out about 70% of all species, including the [[dinosaur]]s, leaving behind the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–T boundary). In 1990, a {{convert|180|km|mi}} candidate crater marking the impact was identified at [[Chicxulub Crater|Chicxulub]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]].

Since then, the debate about the [[extinction]] of the dinosaurs and other [[mass extinction]] events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact, widespread volcanism (which occurred about the same time), or some other mechanism or combination. Most of the mechanisms suggested are catastrophic in nature.

The observation of the [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] cometary collision with Jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events occur as natural events.

===Comparison with uniformitarianism===
One of the key differences between catastrophism and uniformitarianism is that uniformitarianism requires the assumption of vast timelines, whereas catastrophism does not. Today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints, taking the view that [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] is a slow, gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |year=2007 |chapter=Uniformitarianism |chapterurl=http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=6th |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624122338/http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |archivedate=2006-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moon-formation===
{{Main|Giant impact theory}}
Modern theories also suggest that Earth's anomalously large [[moon]] was formed catastrophically. In a paper published in ''Icarus'' in 1975, [[William K. Hartmann]] and [[Donald R. Davis]] proposed that a catastrophic near-miss by a large [[planetesimal]] early in Earth's formation approximately 4.5 billion years ago blew out rocky debris, remelted Earth and formed the [[Moon]], thus explaining the Moon's lesser density and lack of an iron core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Gott III |first=J.

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}
'''Closure''' is the term used to refer to the actions necessary when it is no longer necessary or possible for a [[business]] or other organization to continue to operate.  Closure may be the result of a [[bankruptcy]], where the organization lacks sufficient funds to continue operations, as a result of the [[proprietor]] of the business dying, as a result of a business being purchased by another organization (or a competitor) and shut down as superfluous, or because it is the non-surviving entity in a [[corporate merger]].  A closure may occur because the purpose for which the organization was created is no longer necessary.

While a closure is typically of a business or a [[non-profit organization]], any [[entity]] which is created by human beings can be subject to a closure, from a single church to a whole religion, up to and including an entire country if, for some reason, it ceases to exist.

Closures are of two types, voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary closures of organizations are much rarer than involuntary ones{{fact|date=December 2013}}, as, in the absence of some change making operations impossible or unnecessary, most operations will continue until something happens that causes a change requiring this situation.

The most common form of voluntary closure would be when those involved in an organization such as a social club, a band, or other non-profit organization decide to cease operating. Once the organization has paid any outstanding debts and completed any pending operations, closure may simply mean that the organization ceases to exist.

If an organization has debts that cannot be paid, it may be necessary to perform a liquidation of its assets. If there is anything left after the assets are converted to cash, in the case of a for-profit organization, the remainder is distributed to the stockholders; in the case of a non-profit, by law{{clarifyme|date=December 2013}} any remaining assets must be distributed to another non-profit.

If an organization has more debts than assets, it may have to declare bankruptcy. If the organization is viable, it may reorganizes itself as a result of the bankruptcy and continue operations. If it is not viable for the business to continue operating, then a closure occurs through a bankruptcy [[liquidation]]: its assets are liquidated, the creditors are paid from whatever assets could be liquidated, and the business ceases operations.

Possibly the largest "closure" in history (but more closely analogous to a demerger) was the split of the [[Soviet Union]] into its constituent countries. In comparison, the end of [[East Germany]] can be considered a [[merger]] rather than a closure as [[West Germany]] assumed all of the assets and liabilities of [[East Germany]]. The end of the Soviet Union was the equivalent of a closure through a bankruptcy liquidation, because while [[Russia]] assumed most of the assets and responsibilities of the former Soviet Union, it did not assume all of them. There have been issues over who is responsible for unpaid [[parking ticket]]s accumulated by [[motor vehicle]]s operated on behalf of [[diplomatic mission]]s operated by the former Soviet Union in other countries, as Russia claims it is not responsible for them.

Several major business closures include the bankruptcy of the [[Penn Central]] railroad, the [[Enron scandal]]s, and [[MCI Worldcom]]'s bankruptcy and eventual merger into [[Verizon]].

'''Devendrar Jayanthi''' is a festival celebrated annually on 11 September. It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of [[Immanuvel Devendrar]], a freedom fighter and [[Indian National Congress]] leader who took part in the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]] during the [[British Raj]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-immanuel-sekaran-brave-dalit-leader-who-lost-his-life-savarna-brutality-49168|title=Thiyagi Immanuel Sekaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the [[Indian Army]] in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of [[Pallar]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Immanuel Sekaran an Icon of depressed class}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of chief minister [[K. Kamaraj]].

==Political background==
[[File:Devendrar_Jayanthi_in_Paramakudi.jpg|thumb|200px|Gathering at Immanuel sekaran memorial on Devendrar jayanthi]]

Immanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]], and opposed by the [[Forward Block]], which was itself favoured by the [[Maravar]] community. The two sides clashed during elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/immanuel-sekaran-in-the-vanguard-of-dalit-struggle/article2443838.ece|title=Caste riots of South Tamilnadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence erupted notably in the districts of [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramanathapuram]] and [[Madurai district|Madurai]] which claimed over 40 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1522/15220360.htm|title=Series of violence that shooked the south}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Devendrar jayanthi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Two-month-ban-issued-in-Ramanathapuram-district/articleshow/42094253.cms|title=Law and Order problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2820/stories/20111007282012800.htm|title=Paramakudi police firing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/dalit-leader-immanuel-death-anniversary-passes-off-peacefully/other/news/620462.html|title=Immanuel devendrar remebrance day passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics claim that political parties used them as a form of [[vote bank]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/politics/tamil-nadu-caste-realities-unlikely-to-change-any-time-soon|title=Caste reality of Tamilnadu politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikatan.com/news/tamilnadu/10365.art|title=Immanueal Sekaran jayanthi celebrations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/freedom+fighter+dalit+icon+remembering+tamil+nadu+s+immanuel+sekaran-newsid-57791528|title=Sekaran jayanthi passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diminished value''', Diminution in Value, or commonly referred to as "DV" are the terms generally used to describe the economic loss in a property's value as a result of having been damaged. Diminished Value (DV) is often associated with vehicles that have been damaged, however, it is applicable to other property of value including collectibles such as jewelry, artwork, etc. For the purposes herein, reference will involve the loss in value of a damaged automobile where the term is often applied.

Unlike "depreciation", which is an anticipated and predictable loss in value over time, ‘Inherent Diminished Value’ is a loss in value due to a specific, sudden and unexpected negative occurrence. Diminished value of an automobile following an accident may occur in one of three ways (or a combination thereof):

(1) repair-related diminished value;

(2) Immediate diminished value; and

(3) inherent diminished value.

'''Repair-related diminished value''' is the loss of value due to the inability to perfectly repair the vehicle, so it is worth less after repairs than it was before the wreck. '''Immediate Diminished Value''' – The difference in resale value of a vehicle immediately before damage has occurred and immediately after damage has occurred (prior to repair).  As courts are rarely the chosen venue for recovery of property damage, the standard of "Immediate Diminished Value" is rarely employed in resolving Property Damage claims. This also refers to a loss of value caused by the insurer's direct involvement in the claim adjustment in which the insurer exerts control over the repairs and repairs are incomplete, insufficiently performed, or otherwise restore the vehicle to less than the standard condition.

'''Inherent Diminished Value''' - Assumes optimal repair quality has been achieved and is defined as the amount by which the resale value of a repaired vehicle has been reduced simply because the subject vehicle now has a significant damage history. This is the most widely recognized and accepted form of Diminished Value. It is also the basis upon which any supplemental form of Diminished Value would be added. A common "Supplemental" form of Diminished Value is "Repair Related Diminished Value".

Usually, a frame or structurally damaged vehicle cannot be re-sold as a "[[certified pre-owned]] vehicle."

The true measure of a damaged vehicle's inherent loss in value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. The standard rule as to establishing a value on late model vehicles would be: 20-25% behind book (Black Book, KBB, NADA) and utilize actual sales results, and not on advertised prices.

While some may claim Diminished Value (DV) is subjective and based upon perception or speculation, the old adage "perception becomes reality' applies and as such Diminution in Value is real simply because, for the most part, no reasonable and prudent person is willing to pay the same price for a vehicle with a history of damage as they would for one never having been damaged. Retailers often offer discounts for scratches and dents on appliances, electronics and dented canned goods; it is, therefore, reasonable that the value of a damaged motor vehicle will suffer a lessening in value.

Additional factors may be taken into consideration in evaluating the loss in value of a damaged and repaired vehicle and may include, but not be limited to: the vehicle itself (i.e. rare collectible, originality, market desirability etc.), the vehicle’s pre-loss condition, severity of the sustained damages (i.e. frame damage, flood, fire etc.), the subject vehicle’s history (i.e. one owner, prior damage/repair, death of occupants etc.), quality and thoroughness of the performed repairs, (i.e. quality of parts, materials, workmanship, etc.) and additional value considerations including, but not limited to values associated with pre-owned certification programs.etc.

Auto insurance companies may not readily recognize or offer to pay for diminished value. Each state may have differing opinions of DV. Example; The state of Georgia allows the insured party (the first-party Policyholder) to make a claim for their remaining economic loss for DV from their own insurance company while the neighboring state of Florida does not. Most states, however, allow the victim of another's negligence (third-party) to make a DV claim from the at-fault party.

The length of time to collect Diminished Value will vary depending upon each state's statute of limitations for first party (contractual) claims and third-party (restatement of tort) claims.

==Diminished Value Appraisal==
{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}
A diminished value [[wikt:appraisal|appraisal]] evaluates the difference in value of a [[motor vehicle]] after a collision repair. Reports are usually compiled by an Auto Appraisal Expert experienced in the field of DV and who may provide expert testimony for Appraisals, Arbitration, Mediation or Litigation in a court of law. This Assessment report is used when filing or disputing a diminished value claim against another party and/or an [[insurance]] company. The report measures a damaged vehicle’s inherent loss in value. The diminished value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. In most cases even if the repair was done expertly, the value of the automobile will still be considerably less after a loss. When consumers find that a vehicle has been in an accident, most consumers will never pay the same price for a repaired vehicle as compared to one with no loss history.

Some reports include an assessment of the damage done to a motor vehicle, the quality of the performed repair, the market value of the vehicle before and after the accident.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diminishedvalue.law/info-center/how-to-prove-diminished-value-of-a-vehicle/|title=Coffey Trial Law - Diminished Value|website=www.diminishedvalue.law|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are no set rules for measuring diminished value, and since every vehicle loses value differently, a one size fits all formula would be fundamentally inaccurate.

==Regional==
Recognition of concept of diminished value varies from country to country {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===United States===
Some states' statutes acknowledge diminished value and provide the ability for consumers to collect first party claims of DV from their own insurance companies under their own policies. Most states allow the consumer to collect third party claims from the at-fault driver's insurance company. Some states recognize liability for third party claims but not first party claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diminution-of-value-in-all-50-states.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
In Georgia, vehicle owners can collect DV against their own policy.

=== Florida ===
Diminished value is part of the Florida Standard Civil Jury Instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Standard Jury Instructions - Civil|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/civ_jury_instructions/instructions.shtml#500|publisher=State of Florida|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diminished value [[case law]] in Florida is based primarily on two cases.

* Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company, '''819 So.2d 732''' (Florida 2002).
The ability to receive diminished value [[financial compensation]] from an at-fault driver for their negligence was decided by the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in the Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company case.  After Siegle insurance companies are able to exclude responsibility for the payment of diminished value to the vehicle that they insure through the language in the policy.
* McHale vs. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. '''409 So.2d 238''' (1982)
The [[Florida Third District Court of Appeal]], upheld that the correct measure of damages is the cost of repair plus any reduction in the value of the vehicle. The Court also directed that proving the reduction in value is the burden of the [[Plaintiff]] bringing the claim.

=== Louisiana ===
Diminished value is provided in [http://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=408380 Louisiana Revised Statute 9:2800.17].  The vehicle owner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the fair market value would be less than its value before the vehicle was damaged.

===Washington===
On July 15, 2014, a policyholder in Washington state filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of Pierce County seeking diminished value insurance benefits under their automobile insurance policies.  The insurance company filed a notice to remove the lawsuit to federal district court on August 20, 2014.  The case is titled ''Johnston v. United Services Automobile Ass'n''.

===Canada===
The ability to recover damages for accelerated depreciation varies from Province to Province.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In [[British Columbia]], law recognizes this loss as a recoverable damage and quantify the claim based on the diminished value at the time the collision occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20c%20--/court%20rules%20act%20rsbc%201996%20c.%2080/05_regulations/19_168_2009%20supreme%20court%20civil%20rules/168_2009_02.xml Rule 11-2 BC Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rules addressing the admissibility of depreciation reports in court vary by jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  For example, in British Columbia, Canada, [http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20C%20--/Court%20Rules%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%2080/05_Regulations/19_168_2009%20Supreme%20Court%20Civil%20Rules/168_2009_02.xml#part11 the BC Supreme Court requires such reports to comply with Rule 11].

On 19 February 1978, Egyptian special forces raided [[Larnaca International Airport]] near [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], in an attempt to intervene in a [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]. Earlier, two assassins had killed prominent Egyptian newspaper editor [[Yusuf Sibai]] and then rounded up as hostages several Arabs who were attending a convention in [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=1978: Egyptian forces die in Cyprus gunfight | date=1978-02-19 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/19/newsid_2565000/2565701.stm | work =BBC | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cypriot forces were trying to negotiate with the hostage-takers at the airport, Egyptian troops launched their own assault without authorization from the Cypriots. The unauthorized raid led to the Egyptians and the Cypriots exchanging gunfire, killing or injuring more than 20 of the Egyptian commandos.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; As a result, Egypt and Cyprus severed political ties for several years after the incident.

== Hijacking ==
In the late hours of 18 February 1978, Yusuf Sibai, editor of a prominent [[Egypt]]ian newspaper and a friend of the [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Anwar Sadat]], was [[assassinated]] by two gunmen at a convention being held at the [[Nicosia]] Hilton. The two assassins rounded up 16 Arab convention delegates as hostages (among them, two P.L.O. representatives and one Egyptian national) and demanded transportation to [[Larnaca International Airport]]. They also demanded and were supplied with a [[Cyprus Airways]] DC-8 aircraft. Following negotiations with the Cypriot authorities, the hijackers were allowed to fly the aircraft out of Cyprus with 11 hostages and four crew members. The aircraft, however, was denied permission to land in [[Djibouti]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and was forced to return and land in [[Cyprus]] a few hours later.

According to a report in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Sadat was aggrieved by the assassination of his personal friend and begged the Cypriot President, [[Spyros Kyprianou]] to rescue the hostages and extradite the terrorists to Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Murder and Massacre on Cyprus | date= March 6, 1978 | publisher= | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915969-2,00.html | work =[[Time Magazine]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cypriot President responded by promising to oversee the rescue operation and any negotiations personally, and travelled to the airport himself. According to the same report however, Sadat dispatched an elite [[Unit 777|antiterrorism unit]] (Task Force 777) to Cyprus aboard a [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft. Cairo merely informed Kyprianou that ''"people are on the way to help rescue the hostages"'' and did not reveal who was on board nor what their intentions were.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Upon landing in Cyprus, the Egyptian force immediately launched an all out assault, dispatching a single [[Jeep]] all-terrain vehicle with three men to race ahead of an estimated 58 troops (another report has this figure at 74&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19780219-1 |title=Criminal Occurrence description |accessdate=2008-02-02 |date=1978-02-19 |publisher=Aviation Safety Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;) moving towards the hijacked aircraft on foot.

== Egyptian raid ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
As the [[Egypt]]ian troops advanced quickly towards the hijacked DC-8 aircraft and the [[Cypriot National Guard]] forces who surrounded it, the Cypriot forces reportedly issued a single verbal warning to halt and submit, though in other reports, the Cypriots issued two verbal warnings, the second a demand for the Egyptians to return to their aircraft. As this occurred, the occupants of the Jeep and the Cypriot National Guardsmen exchanged gunfire, and the Egyptian Jeep was struck by a [[rocket propelled grenade]] (RPG), as well as gunfire, killing all three occupants. As the vehicle came to a halt, the [[Cyprus|Cypriots]] and the main Egyptian force confronted each other at a range of less than {{convert|300|m|yd}}, and it is variously reported that the Egyptians, who lacked any form of cover, dropped down onto the tarmac in prone firing positions. At this moment, the two forces engaged each other with heavy gunfire, and the Cypriots opened fire on the Egyptian C-130H aircraft with a 106&amp;nbsp;mm anti-tank missile, striking it in the nose and killing all three crew on board.

With their aircraft destroyed, the Egyptian force and the Cypriot National Guard exchanged heavy gunfire for nearly an hour in sporadic fighting on the open tarmac. Some of the Egyptian troops took cover in a nearby empty [[Air France]] aircraft.

Cypriot President Spyros Kyprianou, who was watching the events unfolding from the airport control tower, was forced to withdraw from the windows and take cover as Egyptian commandos struck the tower with automatic gunfire.

==Aftermath==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
Of the Egyptian commando force, 15 men were killed, in addition to three crew of the C-130H Hercules transport aircraft who were killed when it was struck by a missile. An estimated 15 more Egyptian commandos were reported to have been taken injured to [[Larnaca]] General Hospital with gunshot wounds.

Following the assault, it emerged that the surrender of the two hostage-takers had already been secured at the time of the failed Egyptian attack, and the two men were taken prisoner by the Cypriots and later extradited to [[Egypt]], where they received death sentences, later commuted to life sentences.

On 20 February, Egypt recalled its diplomatic mission and requested the Cyprus government to do the same in Cairo. Cyprus requested the withdrawal of Egypt's military attaché.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Watts | coauthors= | title=Angry Egyptians call envoys home as Cyprus dispute grows | date=February 21, 1978 | publisher= | url=http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | work=[[The Times]] Digital Archive | pages=1; Issue 60242; col F | accessdate=2008-05-02 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030906202207/http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | archivedate=September 6, 2003 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Egypt]] and [[Cyprus]] severed political ties for several years after the incident, until President Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981.

'''Fictitious''' or '''fake entries''' are deliberately incorrect entries in [[reference work]]s such as [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], [[encyclopedia]]s, maps, and directories. There are more specific terms for particular kinds of fictitious entry, such as Mountweazel, [[trap street]], paper street, paper town, [[phantom settlement]], and [[:wikt:nihilartikel|nihilartikel]].&lt;ref name="worldwidewords1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-nih1.htm |title=Nihilartikel |publisher=World Wide Words |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictitious entries are included either as a humorous hoax or as a '''copyright trap''' to reveal subsequent [[plagiarism]] or [[copyright infringement]]. 

==Terminology==
The [[neologism]] ''Mountweazel'' was coined by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' based on a fictitious biographical entry in the 1975 ''[[New Columbia Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref name=mountweazel&gt;Henry Alford, [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829ta_talk_alford "Not a Word"], ''The New Yorker'' August 29, 2005 (accessed August 29, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''nihilartikel'', combining the Latin ''nihil'' ("nothing") and German ''Artikel'' ("article"), is sometimes used.&lt;ref name="worldwidewords1"/&gt;

== Copyright traps ==
By including a trivial piece of false information in a larger work, it is easier to demonstrate subsequent [[plagiarism]] if the fictitious entry is copied along with other material. An admission of this motive appears in the preface to [[Chambers Harrap|Chambers']] 1964 [[mathematical tables]]: "those [errors] that are known to exist form an uncomfortable trap for any would-be plagiarist".&lt;ref&gt;L. J. Comrie, ''Chambers's Shorter Six-Figure Mathematical Tables'', Edinburgh: W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1964, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[trap street]]s may be included in a [[map]], or invented phone numbers in a [[telephone directory]].

Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright (see [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred Worth lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] or ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'', 796 F.Supp. 729, [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York|E.D.N.Y.]], 1992.)&lt;ref&gt;Fred Greguras, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050301065154/http://oikoumene.com/databprotect.html U.S. Legal Protection for Databases], Presentation at the Technology Licensing Forum September 25, 1996. Archived March 1, 2005 on the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Official sources ===
Most listings of the members of the [[German parliament]] feature the fictitious politician [[Jakob Maria Mierscheid]], allegedly a member of the parliament since 1979. Among other activities he is reported to have contributed to a major symposium on the equally fictitious [[stone louse]] in Frankfurt.

=== Reference works ===
Fictitious entries in reference publications often occur in an attempt to catch plagiarism, such as: 

* In August 2005, ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary|The New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' gained media coverage&lt;ref name="mountweazel" /&gt; when it was leaked that the second edition contained at least one fictional entry. This later was determined to be the word ''[[esquivalience]]'', defined as "the wilful avoidance of one's official responsibilities," which had been added to the edition published in 2001. It was intended as a copyright trap, as the text of the book was distributed electronically and thus very easy to copy.
* [[Joel Whitburn]]'s pop chart research books say that [[Ralph Marterie]]'s version of "The Song of Love" peaked at No. 84 for the week ending December 26, 1955. However, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' did not put out an issue that week, and Marterie never recorded this song. A similar situation occurs in his compilation of ''Billboard''{{'}}s rock charts, where Whitburn includes the fictitious song "Drag You Down" by the equally non-existent group "The Cysterz".

=== Maps ===
Fictitious entries on maps may be called [[phantom settlement]]s, [[trap streets]],&lt;ref&gt;SA Mathieson, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/may/11/copyright.epublic "A sidestep in the right direction"], ''The Guardian'', May 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; paper towns, cartographer's follies, or other names. They are intended to help unmask copyright infringements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/the-fake-places-that-only-exist-to-catch-copycat-cartog-1695414770 Gizmodo: "Fake places that exist to catch copycats"]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1978, the fictional [[Ohio]] towns of [[Beatosu and Goblu]] were inserted into that year's official state of [[Michigan]] map as nods to the [[University of Michigan]] and its traditional rival, [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name="Monmonier"&gt;{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-226-53421-9 |pages= 50–51 |edition=2nd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictional town of [[Agloe, New York]], was invented by map makers, but eventually became identified as a real place by its county administration because a building, the Agloe General Store, was erected at its fictional location. The "town" is featured in the novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' by [[John Green (author)|John Green]] and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]].
* Mount Richard, a fictitious peak on the [[continental divide]] in the United States, appeared on county maps in the early 1970s. It was believed to be the work of a draftsman, Richard Ciacci. The fiction was undiscovered for two years.&lt;ref name="Monmonier" /&gt;
* In the United Kingdom in 2001, the [[Ordnance Survey]] (OS) obtained a  £20m out-of-court settlement from [[The Automobile Association|Automobile Association]] (the AA) after content from OS maps was reproduced on AA maps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130521130707/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/media/news/2001/march/centrica.html "Centrica and Ordnance Survey settle AA copyright case"], March 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ordnance Survey denied that it included "deliberate mistakes" in its maps as copyright traps, claiming the "fingerprints" which identified a copy were stylistic features such as the width of roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Clark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/06/andrewclark |title=Copying maps costs AA £20m |newspaper=The Guardian |date=March 6, 2001 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictitious English town of [[Argleton]] was investigated by [[Steve Punt]] in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme ''Punt P.I''. The programme concluded that the town's entry may well have originated as a copyright trap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00trzfl ''Punt PI''], BBC Radio 4, September 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trivia books, etc. ===

*''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'' placed deliberately false information about the first name of TV detective [[Columbo]] for copy-trap purposes and then sued [[Trivial Pursuit]] (which based some of their questions and answers on the work), without success.

=== Other copyright infringement ===
Other examples of copyright infringement that do not fall under the above categories include: 

* In the summer of 2008, the state-owned Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute ({{lang-sk|Slovenský hydrometeorologický ústav, short: SHMÚ}}) became suspicious that a competing commercial service, the website meteo.sk, was stealing their data. On August 7, 2008, SHMÚ deliberately altered the temperature for [[Chopok]] from 9.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 1&amp;nbsp;°C. In a short time, the temperature of 1&amp;nbsp;°C appeared for Chopok at meteo.sk as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sme.sk/c/4018705/shmu-podozrieva-meteo-ze-opisuje.html SHMÚ suspicious that meteo.sk is stealing their data] News portal SME.sk (in Slovak)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]] in the Netherlands once deliberately included a false story about a fire in their radio newscast to see if [[Radio Veronica]] takes its news from the ANP. Several hours later, Radio Veronica also aired the story.
* [[Google]], alleging its search results for a misspelling of [[tarsorrhaphy]] started appearing in [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] results partway through the summer of 2010, created fabricated search results where a hundred query terms like "[[hiybbprqag]]", "delhipublicschool40 chdjob" and "juegosdeben1ogrande" each returned a link to a single unrelated webpage. Nine of the hundred fraudulent results planted by Google were later observed as the first result for the bogus term on Bing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogue|first1=Glenn|title=On Google's Bing Sting|url=https://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/on-googles-bing-sting/?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/google-accuses-microsoft-of-stealing-its-search-results-20110202-1acsl.html |title=Bing Copying Google?

== Scrutiny Checks ==
{{see also |List of scholarly publishing stings}}
Some publications such as those published by [[Harvard]] [[biologist]] [[John Bohannon]] are used to detect lack of [[replication crisis|academic scrutiny]], [[peer review | editorial oversight]], [[fraud]] and/or [[p hacking]] on the part of authors or their publishers.  Trap publications may be used by publishers to immediately reject articles citing them, or by academics to detect journals of ill repute (those that would publish them or works citing them).

== Humorous hoaxes ==

=== Reference publications ===
Fictitious entries often occur in reference publications as a prank, or [[practical joke]], in an attempt to be humorous, such as: 

* The [[German language|German-language]] ''[[Der neue Pauly]]. Enzyklopaedie der Antike'', edited by H. Cancik and H. Schneider, vol. 1 (Stuttgart, 1996, {{ISBN|3-476-01470-3}}) includes a fictitious entry now well known amongst classicists: a deadpan description of an entirely fictional [[Roman Empire|Roman]] sport, ''[[apopudobalia]]'', which resembles modern [[football (soccer)|association football]].
* ''[[Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography]]'' (1887–1889) contains about two hundred fictitious entries.
* ''[[Zzxjoanw]]'' was the last entry in Rupert Hughes’ ''Music Lovers’ Encyclopedia'' of 1903, and it continued as an entry in subsequent editions down to the 1950s. It was described as a [[Māori language|Māori]] word for a drum. Later, it was proved to be a [[hoax]] (having seemed suspect because Māori does not use the letters J, X or Z).
* The 1975 ''[[New Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' contains a fictitious entry on ''Lillian Virginia Mountweazel'' (1942–1973).&lt;ref name="mountweazel" /&gt; Her biography claims she was a fountain designer and [[photographer]], best known for ''Flags Up!'', a collection of photographs of rural American [[Letter box|mailboxes]]. Supposedly she was born in [[Bangs, Ohio]], and died in an explosion while on assignment for ''Combustibles'' magazine. Mountweazel was the subject of an exhibit in Dublin, Ireland, in March 2009 examining her fictitious life and works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2009/0320/1224243084358.html "The Life and Times of Lillian Virginia Mountweazel"], Aidan Dunne, ''[[The Irish Times]]'', March 20, 2009. Retrieved March 27 2009 {{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first printing in 1980 of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' contains two fictitious entries: on Guglielmo Baldini, a non-existent Italian composer, and Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup, who purportedly composed a small amount of music for [[flute]]. Esrum-Hellerup's surname derives from a Danish village and a suburb in [[Copenhagen]]. The two entries were removed from later editions, as well as from later printings of the 1980 edition.
* The [[German language|German-language]] medical encyclopedia ''Pschyrembel Klinisches Wörterbuch'' features an entry on the ''Steinlaus'' ([[stone louse]]), a rock-eating animal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225741.800-the-word-copyright-trap.html The word: Copyright trap] ''New Scientist'' October 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific name ''Petrophaga lorioti'' implies its origin: a creation of the German humorist [[Vicco von Bülow|Loriot]]. The ''Pschyrembel'' entry was removed in 1996 but, after reader protests, was restored the next year, with an extended section on the role of the stone louse in the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]].

=== Practical jokes ===
Fictitious entries occasionally feature in other publications in an attempt to be humorous, such as:

*[[Rhinogradentia]] are a fictitious [[mammal]]ian [[Order (biology)|order]], extensively documented in a series of articles and books by the equally fictitious [[Germany|German]] naturalist [[Harald Stümpke]]. Allegedly, both the animals and the scientist were the creations of [[Gerolf Steiner]], a [[zoology]] professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]].
*[[Taro Tsujimoto]] is a fictional character often included in [[Buffalo Sabres]] reference works. Tsujimoto, an alleged Japanese forward, was the creation of Sabres general manager [[Punch Imlach|George "Punch" Imlach]] designed to fool the [[National Hockey League]] during the [[1974 NHL Amateur Draft]]; Imlach drafted Tsujimoto and only months later—well after the pick was made official—admitted that the league had been fooled by the fictitious player.
*[[Franz Bibfeldt]] is a fictitious theologian created by Robert Howard Clausen for a footnote in a student paper. Bibfeldt was later popularized by Clausen's classmate [[Martin Marty]] as an ongoing in-joke among theologians, including a book and a parody lecture series at the University of Chicago Divinity School.
* At least two [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|sports teams]] at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] have long included [[George P. Burdell]], a fictitious student originally created as a practical joke by a Tech student in 1927, in their lists of [[Varsity letter|lettermen]] in team media guides:
**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Football]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1928, 1929, and 1930 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/info-guide-16.pdf |title=All-Time Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Football 2016 Media Guide |page=136 |publisher=Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Men's basketball]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/gtmbb_info_guide_1617.pdf |title=Tech Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Basketball 2016–2017 Information Guide |page=82 |publisher=[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puzzles/games ===
Many publications have included false items and then challenged readers to identify it, including:
*[[Australia]]n [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] [[Tim Flannery]]'s book ''[[Astonishing Animals]]'' includes one imaginary animal and leaves it up to the reader to distinguish which one it is.
*The product catalogue for Swedish consumer electronics and hobby articles retailer [[Teknikmagasinet]] contains a fictitious product. Finding that product is a contest, ''Blufftävlingen'', in which the best suggestion for another fictitious product from someone who spotted the product gets included in the next issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teknikmagasinet.se/nydb/db.pl?template_file=link_bluffen.html |title=Teknikmagasinet – meningen med livet |publisher=Teknik magasinet |language=sv |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |trans-title=Meaning of life |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403100827/http://www.teknikmagasinet.se/nydb/db.pl?template_file=link_bluffen.html |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Muse (children's magazine)|Muse]]'', a US magazine for children 10–14, regularly includes a two-page spread containing science and technology news. One of the news stories is false and readers are encouraged to guess which one.
*''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' (a magazine devoted to games and puzzles) used to include a fake advertisement in each issue as one of the magazine's regular games.
*The book ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]'' describes many bizarre and obscure films. The authors of the work state that one film described by the book is a complete hoax, and they challenge readers to spot the made-up film; the imaginary film was ''Dog of Norway'', which supposedly starred "Muki the Wonder Dog", named after the authors' own dog

== Fictitious entries in fiction ==
Fictitious entries are sometimes plot points in fiction, including:

* A [[Fred Saberhagen]] [[science fiction]] short story, "The Annihilation of Angkor Apeiron", in which an encyclopedia article for a star system is a fictitious entry included in the encyclopedia to detect plagiarism, which causes a [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]] ship to end up in an empty star system where it runs out of fuel and ceases to be a threat to humanity.
* [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s short story "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]" tells of an encyclopedia entry on what turns out to be the imaginary country of Uqbar. This leads the narrator to the equally fantastic region of Tlön, the setting for much of the country's literature.
* The fictitious entry [[Agloe, New York]], is a key plot point in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]]. ''Paper Towns'' also references the fictitious entry "Lillian Mountweazel" in the name of the Spiegelman family's dog, Myrna Mountweazel.
* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Face the Raven]]", a hidden community lives in a London alley. [[Clara Oswald]] helps the Doctor start the search for that community by searching for any trap streets within the London city limits.

== Legal action ==
Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright. However, due to the [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred%20Worth%20lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] where the Supreme Court ruled that "information alone without a minimum of original creativity cannot be protected by copyright", there are very few cases where copyright has been proven. Many of these cases that go to court are dismissed and the affected party is rewarded no compensation.

* Fred L. Worth, author of ''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'', filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of [[Trivial Pursuit]]. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even his own fictitious entries that he had added to the books to catch anyone who wanted to violate his copyright. However, the case was thrown out by the district court judge as the Trivial Pursuit inventors argued that facts are not protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOYKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2U8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4598,4685968|title=The Courier - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/796/729/1559434/|title=Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co., 796 F. Supp. 729 (E.D.N.Y. 1992)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a New York Corporation that published and sold a New York City taxi driver's guide entitled ''Official New York Taxi Driver's Guide,'' attempted to sue Hagstrom Map Corporation who published and sold ''New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Drivers Guide,'' that Hagstrom allegedly violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] for permanent injunction of their guide, damages, and attorney fees. However, this case was dismissed by the United States Federal Court because it found that fictitious entries (in this case, a "[[trap street]]") are not themselves protected by copyright.
* In ''Alexandria Drafting Co. v. Andrew H. Amsterdam dba Franklin Maps'', Alexandria Drafting Corporation filed suit against Franklin Maps alleging that Franklin Maps had violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] by copying their map books. However, this case was dismissed although the judge cited that there was a single instance of original copyright, but this was not sufficient evidence to support copyright infringement. Additionally the judge cited ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'' as previous case law to support that "fictitious names may not be copyrighted" and "the existence, or non-existence, of a road is a non-copyrightable fact."
* In one particular case, in 2001 [[The Automobile Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to settle a case for £20,000,000 when it was caught copying [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. However, in this copyright infringement case there was no instance of a purposeful copyright trap. Instead, the prosecution sued for specific stylistic choices, such as the width and style of the roads. 

== Simple Errors ==
Often times there will be errors in maps, dictionaries, and other publications, that are not deliberate and thus are not fictitious entries. For example, within dictionaries there are such mistakes known as [[ghost words]], "words which have no real existence […] being mere coinages due to the blunders of printers or scribes, or to the perfervid imaginations of ignorant or blundering editors."&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Skeat, The Transactions of the Philological Society 1885-7 (Oxford: Blackwell, 1885-7) Vol. II, p.351.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GNC, Boston.JPG|thumb|[[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] displays its Global Message]]

'''Global Night Commute''' was a worldwide event organized by the makers of the film ''[[Invisible Children]]'' through the organization [[Invisible Children, Inc.]] It took place on April 29, 2006. Youths from around the world walked to city centers and spent the night in parks to show support for [[Ugandan]] children who walk every night into city centers attempting to avoid capture by the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA).

== Overview ==
These children, between the ages of 3 and 17, from [[Acholiland]] in Northern Uganda, are referred to as "night commuters". They walk up to 20&amp;nbsp;km (12&amp;nbsp;mi) from [[internally displaced person]] camps to larger towns, notably [[Gulu]], in search of safety from the LRA.

The Global Night Commute was similar to other initiatives raising awareness about the plight of the children in Acholiland like the [[Gulu Walk]] that took place in over 40 cities internationally in October 2005; however, the Global Night Commute took place on a much larger scale. Over 58,000 people signed up to participate in the event, but over 80,000 attended in total; it took place in 130 cities in seven countries.&lt;ref name=gnc&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Night Commute |url=http://www.invisiblechildren.com/theMovement/globalNightCommute/ |accessdate=2006-04-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425060858/http://www.invisiblechildren.com/theMovement/globalNightCommute/ |archivedate=2006-04-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the event was to raise awareness and ultimately end Africa's longest running conflict by facilitating a change in the policies of the United States government.  The slogan for the event is "On April 29th, we gathered. To make a difference. To end a war."

'''Human response to [[disaster]]s''' has been recorded throughout human history.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  In ancient times disasters were often perceived as a result of a deity, divine being, or spiritual creature showing their displeasure over human behavior.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This later changed as humans began to see disasters as natural events that caused physical destruction and social chaos to individuals, communities, and societies as opposed to responses to human actions.

The term "disaster myth" has been created to describe the belief that people will behave in an irrational, uncontrolled, and even extreme manner outside of normal and accepted social standards despite evidence that proponents state prove otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;John Drury, David Novelli, and Clifford Stott, “Psychological disaster myths in the perception and management of mass emergencies: Psychological disaster myths,” ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'', 43 (2013): 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Aptekar, ''Environmental Disasters in Global Perspective'' (New York: G.K. Hall &amp; Co., 1994), 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the term further state that people will only act irrationally in the direst of circumstances when terrible danger is imminent and no avenue of escape appears available. They argue that these disaster myths cause a negative impact when they cause people, officials, and disaster-relief organizations to make detrimental or incorrect [[disaster response|disaster planning and response]] decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panic/Scared ==
One commonly held disaster myth is that people develop an insurmountable, illogical fear in the face of a [[disaster]].  In turn, this fear becomes infectious, spreads to others, and causes people to flee without thinking and in a chaotic manner that could hurt those around them.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, just the opposite can be expected in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when experiencing the increased stress from an [[earthquake]], since they arrive unannounced and it is not known when the aftershocks will end, people continue to act rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only do few people panic, most are unwilling to participate in an organized evacuation.  Those who live in the disaster area tend to stay in place.  The only ones who usually flee are the visitors, tourists, and transients.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Disaster]]s also draw people to the area.  Some want to help while others just want to see the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general public and organizations involved in [[emergency management|emergency planning, management, and response]] all tend to accept this disaster myth as reality.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S191-S192.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Panic]]king can cause harm to others if people flee without thought.  Staying put can be even worse since the people are not getting away from the [[disaster|disaster’s]] damage and destruction.  When necessary, people should evacuate in an orderly manner to avoid the [[disaster]].  It also provides an opportunity to help others evacuate who may need assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  The myth of [[panic]] can cause officials to be cautious when issuing public bulletins.  By not wanting to instigate or amplify the believed [[panic]], officials may wait too long to provide the information on which the populace should act.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid contributing to or increasing the level of this mythical [[panic]], officials have also chosen to not share information about preparations for some types of [[disaster]]s (e.g. [[chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[biological warfare|biological]] attacks).&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260.&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithesis of the panic myth was seen with Orson Welles’ [[The War of the Worlds]] radio broadcast in 1938, the [[Cocoanut Grove fire|1942 Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire]], and as [[Hurricane Carla]] approached the Gulf Coast areas of Texas and Louisiana in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rational behavior also dominated after [[earthquake]]s in Europe, North and South America, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite many reports of widespread [[panic]], evidence later proved otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  The myth of [[panic]] affecting the official warnings of authorities has been seen in Mexico when the Rio Grande River flooded, in Italy during the [[flood]]ing of the city of Florence, and after a volcanic eruption in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the instances when authorities chose to send the military instead of humanitarian organizations in response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], it was in some part to help manage and control the perceived [[panic]] among the population.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shock ==
Many people believe those who experience a [[disaster]] firsthand experience emotional trauma that has both immediate and lasting effects.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought the initial devastation of the [[disaster]] leaves people too fragile and in [[Acute stress reaction|shock]].&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, they are unable to cope with their situation or participate in recovery efforts.  They are consequently dependent on assistance from outside relief agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in a small minority of cases does this myth turn out to be true.  And many times, the experienced shock is short-lived.  What in fact happens in most cases is people react immediately to the [[disaster]] and its effects.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[disaster]] can also be a jolt of energy which drives people to respond to the emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Claude de Ville de Goyet, “Stop Propagating Disaster Myths,” ''The Lancet'', 356, no. 9231 (August 26, 2000): 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who went through the [[disaster]] are the first engaged in relief and rescue efforts before any outside agency.  They come together along familiar lines such as family and friends and then move as needed to a larger scale involving groups with which they associate (e.g. churches).  If the familiar cannot be contacted or they are unable to respond, only then do most people look toward the faceless law enforcement, welfare, and relief organizations for assistance.  People will also seek help from outside the familiar when special equipment or medical skills are required.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of widespread shock leads outside relief organizations to plan their efforts as if they are the only ones who will be providing assistance.  This may create a disconnected rather than complementary relationship between them and the local agencies.  Additionally, the feeling on the part of the survivors that they do not need to rely on outsiders coupled with the relief organizations believing they are saviors creates a wall between the two which in turn inhibits communication, coordination, and effective relief and recovery efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

People’s reliance on self and the well-known was seen in a variety of disaster types such as the [[1953 Flint-Beecher tornado|1953 tornado in Flint-Beecher, Michigan]], the 1955 flood of Marysville and Yuba City, California, [[Hurricane Audrey]] in 1957, [[Hurricane Carla]] in 1961, [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965, and the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|1971 earthquake in San Fernando, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both in [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|Mexico City in 1985]] and in [[1999 Izmit earthquake|Turkey in 1999]], thousands of local residents banded together to search for fellow victims in the earthquake wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neighbors performed more than half of the rescue activities after the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake]] hit Kobe City, Japan in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S192.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assistance ==
People believe the population impacted by a [[disaster]] are unable to do anything about their situation so are standing by just waiting for the saviors from afar to swoop in with the solution to all of their suffering.  Not only that, relief organizations often think the aid must be provided immediately.  This myth is especially pervasive when the [[disaster]] strikes a third-world country and it is a “superior” western country coming to the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762-763.&lt;/ref&gt;

While relief organizations with emergency managers, medical teams, and the like do offer assistance after a [[disaster]], most people are actually saved by other survivors and local authorities, agencies, and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this myth, more supplies are often sent than the disaster area typically needs.  In addition to excess quantity, much of the supplies end up being of little to no use.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relief organizations often do not wait for an assessment of the disaster area and an identification of needs which can be provided by local officials or performed by themselves.  As a consequence, money is often wasted on sending unneeded teams of experts or supplies when local authorities and victims would benefit more if that same money was allocated towards providing resources that filled gaps and complemented their efforts.  Donors compound the issue by donating used clothing, household items, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  With too many supplies on-hand or in possession of supplies they cannot use, local officials are forced to waste manpower and resources on disposing of them.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of providing unwanted and unrequested goods, organizations and donors should send money which can be more easily applied to fulfilling local needs.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this myth’s impact was seen following the [[1993 Hokkaidō earthquake]] as authorities were forced to spend 1.2 million in U.S. dollars on the removal of unnecessary relief supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resources ==
Outside rescue, relief, and recovery agencies almost always miscalculate the amount of available resources for basic needs that are available locally in the aftermath of a [[disaster]].  They believe there are not enough materiel, supplies, and personnel for the initial response.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, there are usually enough supplies to last several weeks.  Enough food can normally be found in stores, warehouses, and people’s homes.  Clothing is rarely needed.  Medical supplies reside in hospitals, warehouses, or nearby communities.  Hospitals as well as police and fire departments often transition to 24-hour operations.  And no evidence is available that proves the unfound belief that key personnel will leave their posts to go attend to their families and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief agencies tend to believe they must act immediately rather than assess the situation first.  As a result, they often provide supplies when there is already enough on-site for the immediate future.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime ==
The prevalence of [[looting]] in the wake of [[disaster]]s is another common myth.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that [[disaster]]s provide cover for criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scenario, people take advantage of law enforcement and other agencies responsible for maintaining the peace, safety, and security being occupied with disaster response and relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  People believe criminals will use the [[disaster]] as an opportunity to loot due to a prevalence of evacuated, abandoned, and unguarded homes and stores.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[looting]] can occur, they are always isolated incidents.  And much reported [[looting]] is either entirely false or, at worst, desperate survivors scavenging for necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

But because people believe [[looting]] happens, they frequently refuse to leave despite the disaster’s destruction and damage in order to protect their homes and property.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  When no [[looting]] occurs, people tend to believe it is because enough security was in place to prevent it rather than looters did not exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, officials who believe in this myth end up assigning personnel to a protection role rather than to a much more critical rescue, relief, or logistics support function.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of connection between [[disaster]]s and [[looting]] was seen in the rates for theft and burglaries actually falling after [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  This myth’s impact was also seen outside the United States as evidenced by many Guatemalans staying after the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976 earthquake]] out of fear of having their animals, homes, and possessions stolen.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morale ==
People tend to believe that survivors are extremely negative after a disaster and need to assurance that the outside world cares and the future is bright for themselves and their community.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, people are most often optimistic and have very high [[morale]] in a disaster’s aftermath.  They frequently subordinate any personal feelings of loss and suffering in order to apply themselves to providing food, shelter, and other services to those in need.  Their motivation to help one another boosts the sense of community and togetherness.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the myth, dignitaries and officials feel the need to come to the disaster area to reassure the survivors.  They often make promises of aid that either are not kept or do not happen in a timely manner.  This can cause survivors to resent outsiders.  This resentment in turn can prevent the survivors from asking for needed skills and resources that the outsiders can in fact provide.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease ==
When a [[disaster]] results in deaths, especially in large quantities, people often believe they are at considerable risk of catching a [[disease]] from them.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also believe [[epidemic|disease epidemics]] develop in the wake of [[disaster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that they died from the [[disaster]] does not make them a risk for spreading [[disease]]s.  If a body does carry a [[infection|communicable disease]], the person already had it when he or she was alive.  The fact that the body is now stationary and will remain in one place makes it less of a risk than prior to death.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  And an [[epidemic]] would happen only if either of two circumstances exist:  1) the [[disaster]] brings [[disease]] with it for which the people are not immune or 2) the disaster’s effects lead to [[malnutrition]], the [[malnutrition]] increases susceptibility to [[disease]], and finally, a large number of people contract the [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in the myth can result in the hurried disposal of the bodies without proper identification, burial, or involvement by the next of kin.  This can add to the suffering of survivors because they were not allowed to properly care for their loved ones.  In addition to the personal toll, needlessly disposing of dead bodies can divert personnel and supplies from other areas where at that time they are needed more (e.g. involved in actions that benefit those still living).&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fear or rumor of an [[epidemic]] can also cause relief organizations to provide medicines, resources, and other aid for a problem that does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This myth has been repeated many times such as in the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972 earthquake in Managua, Nicaragua]], [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998, the [[1999 Izmit earthquake|1999 earthquake in Turkey]], and the [[2000 Mozambique flood|2000 flooding in Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, rumors of [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[dysentery]], and [[typhus]] that were later proven to be false followed the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976 earthquake in Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetuation of myths ==
[[File:Hydra1.gif|thumb|Myths Live On]]

=== By people ===
People who have experienced a [[disaster]] often believe the dramatic accounts of their own suffering.  It allows them to pass off their actions as atypical and heroic.  In the process of telling others about their involvement, the mythic component of their story is spread along with the reality.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disaster survivors tend to worry about [[looting]].  Their increased anxiety can cause them to spread reports whether they definitely know of any or not.  While most people who are asked admit to not having personally witnessed or experienced [[looting]], many claim of being aware of it elsewhere.  The belief in [[looting]] can make people jump to the conclusion that looting was the cause of items going missing before considering the [[disaster]] may have moved, buried, or destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By organizations ===
Government agencies, civilian organizations, and [[first responder]]s all believe to some extent in disaster myths.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2266.&lt;/ref&gt;  When this happens, the myths in turn are often included in their [[disaster response|planning and response]] to [[disaster]]s, victims, and survivors.  And practices based even partially on disaster myths are not only likely to result in inappropriate or inefficient relief and response actions, they can also help to perpetuate the myths thereby affecting people and property in the next [[disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 2269.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of how organizations can perpetuate disaster myths takes place in the days following a [[disaster]] and up until official numbers are compiled.  During this time, officials from emergency, relief, rescue, and welfare organizations can overestimate the loss of life and destruction of property.  This sheds a more positive light on their organizations since they can point to effective emergency procedures and local heroism as the reason their figures turned out to be higher than the actual numbers.  If their calculations end up being lower than the official figures, they might be blamed for incompetence and inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the inability to cope by a disaster-site’s community and people is a myth, it continues to be believed.  One reason is the justification relief agencies give while promoting the assistance they provide.  They feel they are needed because they believe facilities such as hospitals, police and fire departments, and other local first responders do not have the capacity to meet the sheer demand from a disaster.  And if their efforts do not go as planned, they often point to survivors’ irrationality rather than reassess the assumptions on which they developed their relief plans.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local, regional, and national officials make up a primary source of information for the media.  In the self-imposed small window the media has to get out the latest details of the disaster, fact-checking sometimes suffers and they rely solely on the officials' accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, officials substantially influence the media's portrayal and what viewers, listeners, and readers see.  An example of this is seen in officials highlighting the positives within their own organization's efforts while downplaying the information from and activities by unofficial groups and sources.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Goltz, "Are the News Media Responsible for the Disaster Myths? A Content Analysis of Emergency Response Imagery," ''International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters 2'', no. 3 (1984): 365-366.&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by the media, law enforcement officials frequently say they are taking sufficient action to prevent [[looting]] even if they have taken no action on the issue.  If the norm happens and little to no [[looting]] occurs, they may be credited for the absence of crime.  But if the exception to the rule happens, they do not want to be blamed for not protecting against the [[looting]].  Whether it is true or not, people believe local law enforcement is out keeping the area secure from looters and the myth continues to propagate.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By media ===
Many myths are perpetuated by the mass media to include newspapers, television, radio, and internet news.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S201.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is largely due to the way they portray [[disaster]]s.  In fact, most people base their opinions and beliefs regarding [[disaster]]s and survivor behavior on what they see in the media.  The media strives to keep their viewers’ and readers’ attention for as long as possible.  Drama and destruction is interesting and compelling; most of everything else is secondary.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the most part, the media, regardless of country, takes a fairly standard approach to disaster coverage and reporting.  Immediately after the [[disaster]], they rely on statistics of destruction and damage followed by stories of victims and those providing the rescue and relief.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 129-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media repeatedly moves away from discussing the [[disaster]] as a whole to focusing on individual parts and the drama involved in them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of its manner in covering [[disaster]]s, the media may capture only pieces instead of the entire event while emphasizing the unusually heroic or unusually tragic incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

A main focus of media coverage centers on [[emergency management]] organizations performing rescue and relief actions in the disaster area.&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, 364-365.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media frequently portrays international relief teams as angels saving the victims from the disaster's destruction while simultaneously implying the local officials are negligent, inept, or corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this backdrop, the portrayal of a breakdown in society and social behavior is more likely to appear in coverage of [[disaster]]s occurring outside the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, 365.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this type of portrayal that helps perpetuate disaster myths involves the frequent reports of people panicking in both small and large numbers to the point of fleeing when faced by an oncoming [[disaster]] such as a [[hurricane]].&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, when the international media noticed few stories of [[looting]] coming out of [[Japan]] following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Great East Japan Disaster in 2011]], they generally remarked on how well the Japanese people behave.  By believing in this myth, they assumed the Japanese showed more behavioral control than other societies rather than understanding it rarely happens in association with any [[disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S192.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 2010, U.S. helicopters entered Pakistani airspace after ground troops determined that a mortar attack by militants in Pakistan was imminent, according to the Coalition. Pakistani [[Frontier Corps]] troops manning the Mandata Kadaho border post fired warning shots, and the helicopters responded by firing two missiles that destroyed the post. Three soldiers were killed and another three wounded. Pakistan responded by closing a key NATO supply route for eleven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/30/AR2010093000145.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Karin | last=Brulliard | title=Pakistan blocks NATO's Afghan-bound supply trucks after airstrike kills 3 | date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''leap year''' (also known as an '''intercalary year''' or '''bissextile year''') is a [[calendar year]] containing one additional day (or, in the case of [[lunisolar calendar]]s, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the [[astronomical year|astronomical]] or [[seasonal year]].&lt;ref name="Meeus"&gt;{{citation|last1 = Meeus | first1=Jean | date = 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithims | publisher = Willmann-Bell | page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, calendars that have the same number of days in each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track. By inserting (also called ''[[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalating]]'') an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is called a common year.

For example, in the [[Gregorian calendar]], each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by [[February 29|extending February to 29 days]] rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in years which are multiples of four (with the exception of centennial years not divisible by 400). Similarly, in the lunisolar [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Adar 1|Adar Aleph]], a 13th lunar month, is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons. In the [[Bahá'í Calendar]], a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the [[vernal equinox]].

The name "leap year" probably comes from the fact that while a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next, the day of the week in the 12 months following the leap day (from March 1 through February 28 of the following year) will advance two days due to the extra day (thus "leaping over" one of the days in the week).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Douglas | last=Harper | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=leap+year&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | title = leap year | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/leap-year|title=leap year - Definition of leap year in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English | accessdate = June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Christmas Day]] (December 25) fell on a Sunday in 2016, and Monday in 2017, then it will fall on Tuesday in 2018, and Wednesday in 2019 but then "leaps" over Thursday to fall on a Friday in 2020.

The length of a day is also occasionally changed by the insertion of [[leap second]]s into [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), owing to the variability of Earth's rotational period. Unlike leap days, leap seconds are not introduced on a regular schedule, since the variability in the length of the day is not entirely predictable.

==Gregorian calendar==
{{See also|Gregorian calendar}}
[[File:Leap Centuries.jpg|thumb|right|An image showing which century years are leap years in the Gregorian calendar.]]
In the Gregorian calendar, the standard calendar in most of the world, most years that are multiples of 4 are leap years. In each leap year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28. Adding one extra day in the calendar every four years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 days is shorter than a [[tropical year]] by almost 6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Ed. K. Lee |last1=Lerner |first2=Brenda W. |last2=Lerner |title=Calendar |encyclopedia=The Gale Encyclopedia of Science |year=2004 |publisher=[[Gale]] |location=Detroit, MI |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some exceptions to this basic rule are required since the duration of a tropical year is slightly less than 365.25 days. The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reform]] modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php Introduction to Calendars]. (15 May 2013). [[United States Naval Observatory]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over a period of four centuries, the accumulated error of adding a leap day ''every'' four years amounts to about three extra days. The Gregorian calendar therefore drops three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its ''leap cycle''. This is done by dropping February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.&lt;ref name="usno"&gt;{{citation | author = United States Naval Observatory | authorlink = United States Naval Observatory | date = June 14, 2011 | url = http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/leap_years.php | title = Leap Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lerner|Lerner|2004|p=681}} The years 1600, 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200 and 2300 are common years.

The Gregorian calendar was designed to keep the [[vernal equinox]] on or close to March 21, so that the date of [[Easter]] (celebrated on the Sunday after the ecclesiastical [[full moon]] that falls on or after March 21) remains close to the vernal equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = E. G. | last = Richards | date = 1998 | title = Mapping time: The Calendar and its History | publisher = Oxford University Press | pages = 250–1 | isbn = 0-19-286205-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The "[[Gregorian calendar#Accuracy|Accuracy]]" section of the "[[Gregorian calendar]]" article discusses how well the Gregorian calendar achieves this design goal, and how well it approximates the [[tropical year]].

===Algorithm===
&lt;!-- PLEASE DISCUSS ALGORITHM ON TALK PAGE BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES --&gt;

The following [[pseudocode]] determines whether a year is a ''leap year'' or a ''common year'' in the Gregorian calendar (and in the proleptic Gregorian calendar before 1582). The ''year'' variable being tested is the integer representing the number of the year in the Gregorian calendar, and the tests are arranged to dispatch the most common cases first. Care should be taken in translating mathematical integer divisibility into specific programming languages.

'''if''' (''year'' is not [[divisor|divisible]] by 4) '''then''' (it is a common year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else if''' (''year'' is not divisible by 100) '''then''' (it is a leap year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else if''' (''year'' is not divisible by 400) '''then''' (it is a common year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else''' (it is a leap year)

The algorithm applies to proleptic Gregorian calendar years before 1, but only if the year is expressed with [[astronomical year numbering]]. It is not valid for the BC or BCE notation. The algorithm is not necessarily valid for years in the Julian calendar, such as years before 1752 in the British Empire.  The year 1700 was a leap year in the Julian calendar, but not in the Gregorian calendar.

===Leap day===
{{Main|February 29}}
[[File:Calendar-leapyeardate.jpg|thumb|right|A Swedish pocket calendar from 2008 showing February 29]]
[[File:Japanese Calendar with Verses by Osman Edwards 1900 February.jpg|thumb|February 1900 calendar showing that 1900 was not a leap year]]

February 29 is a date that usually occurs every four years, and is called leap day. This day is added to the calendar in leap years as a corrective measure, because the Earth does not orbit the sun in precisely 365 days.

The Gregorian calendar is a modification of the [[Julian calendar]] first used by the Romans. The [[Roman calendar]] originated as a lunisolar calendar and named many of its days after the [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygies]] of the moon: the new moon (''Kalendae'' or calends, hence "calendar") and the full moon (''Idus'' or ides). The ''Nonae'' or nones was not the first [[Lunar phase|quarter moon]] but was exactly one ''nundina'' or Roman market week of nine days before the ides, inclusively counting the ides as the first of those nine days. This is what we would call a period of eight days. In 1825, [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]] believed that the lunisolar calendar was abandoned about 450 BC by the [[decemvirs]], who implemented the [[Roman calendar|Roman Republican calendar]], used until 46 BC. The days of these calendars were counted down (inclusively) to the next named day, so February 24 was ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' ("the sixth day before the calends of March") often abbreviated a. d. VI Kal. Mart. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] counted days inclusively in their calendars, so this was actually the fifth day before March 1 when counted in the modern exclusive manner (not including the starting day).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Thomas Hewitt | last = Key | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html | title = Calendarium | publisher = University of Chicago | orig-year = 1875 | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican calendar's intercalary month was inserted on the first or second day after the [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminalia]] (a. d. VII Kal. Mar., February 23). The remaining days of Februarius were dropped. This intercalary month, named Intercalaris or [[Mercedonius]], contained 27 days. The religious festivals that were normally celebrated in the last five days of February were moved to the last five days of Intercalaris. Because only 22 or 23 days were effectively added, not a full lunation, the calends and ides of the Roman Republican calendar were no longer associated with the new moon and full moon.

The Julian calendar, which was developed in 46 BC by [[Julius Caesar]], and became effective in 45 BC, distributed an extra ten days among the months of the Roman Republican calendar. Caesar also replaced the intercalary month by a single intercalary day, located where the intercalary month used to be. To create the intercalary day, the existing ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' (February 24) was doubled, producing ''ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias''. Hence, the year containing the doubled day was a bissextile (''bis sextum'', "twice sixth") year. For legal purposes, the two days of the ''bis sextum'' were considered to be a single day, with the second half being intercalated; but in common practice by 238, when [[Censorinus]] wrote, the intercalary day was followed by the last five days of February, a. d. VI, V, IV, III and pridie Kal. Mart. (the days numbered 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 from the beginning of February in a common year), so that the intercalated day was the ''first'' half of the doubled day. Thus the intercalated day was effectively inserted between the 23rd and 24th days of February. All later writers, including [[Macrobius]] about 430, [[Bede]] in 725, and other medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of Easter), continued to state that the bissextum (bissextile day) occurred before the last five days of February.

[[File:MissaleLeapYear.jpg|thumb|right|In the older [[Roman Missal]], feast days falling on or after February 24 are celebrated one day later in leap year.]]
Until 1970, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] always celebrated the feast of [[Saint Matthias]] on a. d. VI Kal. Mart., so if the days were numbered from the beginning of the month, it was named February 24 in common years, but the presence of the bissextum in a bissextile year immediately before a. d. VI Kal. Mart. shifted the latter day to February 25 in leap years, with the [[Vigil]] of St. Matthias shifting from February 23 to the leap day of February 24. This shift did not take place in pre-Reformation Norway and Iceland; [[Pope Alexander III]] ruled that either practice was lawful ([[Liber Extra]], 5. 40. 14. 1). Other feasts normally falling on February 25–28 in common years are also shifted to the following day in a leap year (although they would be on the same day according to the Roman notation). The practice is still observed by those who use the older calendars.

=== Synchronized calendars (Bengali, Indian and Thai) ===
The Revised [[Bengali Calendar]] of Bangladesh and the [[Indian National Calendar]] organise their leap years so that the every leap day is close to a February 29 in the Gregorian calendar and vice versa. This makes it easy to convert dates to or from Gregorian.

The [[Thai solar calendar]] uses the [[Buddhist Era]] (BE), but has been synchronized with the Gregorian since [[AD]] 1941.

==Julian, Coptic and Ethiopian calendars==
From AD 8 the Julian calendar received an extra day added to February in years that are multiples of 4.

The [[Coptic calendar]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]] also add an extra day to the end of the year once every four years before a Julian 29-day February.

This rule gives an average year length of 365.25 days. However, it is 11 minutes longer than a tropical year. This means that the vernal equinox moves a day earlier in the calendar about every 131 years.

==Revised Julian calendar==
The [[Revised Julian calendar]] adds an extra day to February in years that are multiples of four, except for years that are multiples of 100 that do not leave a remainder of 200 or 600 when divided by 900. This rule agrees with the rule for the Gregorian calendar until 2799. The first year that dates in the Revised Julian calendar will not agree with those in the Gregorian calendar will be 2800, because it will be a leap year in the Gregorian calendar but not in the Revised Julian calendar.

This rule gives an average year length of 365.242222 days. This is a very good approximation to the ''mean'' tropical year, but because the ''vernal equinox'' year is slightly longer, the Revised Julian calendar for the time being does not do as good a job as the Gregorian calendar at keeping the vernal equinox on or close to March 21.

==Chinese calendar==
The [[Chinese calendar]] is [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], so a leap year has an extra month, often called an ''embolismic'' month after the Greek word for it. In the Chinese calendar the [[leap month]] is added according to a rule which ensures that month 11 is always the month that contains the northern winter [[solstice]]. The intercalary month takes the same number as the preceding month; for example, if it follows the second month (二月) then it is simply called "leap second month" i.e. {{zh|t=閏二月|s=闰二月|p=rùn'èryuè}}.

==Hebrew calendar==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jewish holiday]] --&gt;
The Hebrew calendar is lunisolar with an [[embolismic month]]. This extra month is called ''Adar Alef'' ([[Adar 1|first Adar]]) and is added before ''[[Adar]]'', which then becomes ''Adar Bet'' ([[Adar 2|second Adar]]). According to the [[Metonic cycle]], this is done seven times every nineteen years (specifically, in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19). This is to ensure that [[Passover]] ({{transl|he|''Pesah''}}) is always in the spring as required by the [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) in many verses&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 23,15 ; Exodus 34,18 ; Deuteronomy 15,1 ; Deuteronomy 15, 13&lt;/ref&gt; relating to Passover.

In addition, the Hebrew calendar has postponement rules that postpone the start of the year by one or two days. These postponement rules reduce the number of different combinations of year length and starting [[Week-day names|days of the week]] from 28 to 14, and regulate the location of certain religious holidays in relation to the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. In particular, the first day of the Hebrew year can never be Sunday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo adu rosh''}}" ({{lang|he|לא אד"ו ראש}}), i.e., "Rosh [ha-Shanah, first day of the year] is not Sunday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''adu''}} is written by three [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] signifying Sunday, Wednesday and Friday). Accordingly, the first day of Passover is never Monday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo badu Pesah''}}" ({{lang|he|לא בד"ו פסח}}), which has a double meaning — "Passover is not a legend", but also "Passover is not Monday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''badu''}} is written by three Hebrew letters signifying Monday, Wednesday and Friday).

One reason for this rule is that [[Yom Kippur]], the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar and the tenth day of the Hebrew year, now must never be adjacent to the weekly Sabbath (which is Saturday), i.e., it must never fall on Friday or Sunday, in order not to have two adjacent Sabbath days. However, Yom Kippur can still be on Saturday. These rules for the Feasts do not apply to the years from the Creation to the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses. It was at that time (cf. Exodus 13) that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob gave the Hebrews their "Law" including the days to be kept holy and the feast days and Sabbaths.

Years consisting of 12 months have between 353 and 355 days. In a {{transl|he|''k'sidra''}} ("in order") 354-day year, months have alternating 30 and 29 day lengths. In a {{transl|he|''chaser''}} ("lacking") year, the month of [[Kislev]] is reduced to 29 days. In a {{transl|he|''malei''}} ("filled") year, the month of [[Marcheshvan]] is increased to 30 days. 13-month years follow the same pattern, with the addition of the 30-day Adar Alef, giving them between 383 and 385 days.

==Islamic calendar==
The observed and calculated versions of the [[Islamic calendar]] do not have regular leap days, even though both have lunar months containing 29 or 30 days, generally in alternating order. However, the [[tabular Islamic calendar]] used by Islamic astronomers during the Middle Ages and still used by some Muslims does have a regular leap day added to the last month of the lunar year in 11 years of a 30-year cycle.&lt;ref name=timeanddateIslamicCalendar&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.timeanddate.com/date/islam-leap-year.html | title = The Islamic leap year | date = n.d. | publisher = Time and Date AS | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This additional day is found at the end of the last month, Dhu 'l-Hijja, which is also the month of the [[Hajj]].&lt;ref name=GMANewsLeapYearTrivia&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/249829/lifestyle/people/leap-year-trivia-you-might-want-to-know | title = Leap year trivia you might want to know | date = n.d. | publisher = GMA News | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hijri-Shamsi calendar, also adopted by the [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Community, is based on solar calculations and is similar to the Gregorian calendar in its structure with the exception that the first year starts with [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/73.html | title=Hijri-Shamsi Calendar | publisher=Al Islam | date = 2015 | accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu calendar==
In the [[Hindu calendar]], which is a lunisolar calendar, the embolismic month is called ''adhika maas'' (extra month). It is the month in which the sun is in the same sign of the stellar zodiac on two consecutive dark moons. ''Adhika maas'' occurs once every 33 to 34 months, compensating for the approximately eleven fewer days per year in twelve lunar months than the solar calendar. Thus, Hindu festivals tend to occur within a given span of the Gregorian calendar. For example: the No Moon during [[Diwali]] festival occurs between mid - October and mid - November. [[Buddhist calendar]]s in several related forms (each a simplified version of the Hindu calendar) are used on mainland Southeast Asia in the countries of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Thai lunar calendar|Thailand]], [[Myanmar (formerly Burma)]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

The Hindu Calendar also known as [[Vikram Samvat]] is used in [[Nepal]] as the national calendar. All the official work is done based on this calendar.

The calendar followed in some parts of [[South India]] (mainly in [[Tamil Nadu]]) is [[Solar calendar|solar]]. It has a leap year every four years.

==Bahá'í calendar==
{{main | Bahá'í calendar }}
The Bahá'í calendar is a solar calendar composed of 19 months of 19 days each (361 days). Years begin at Naw-Rúz, on the [[vernal equinox]], on or about March 21. A period of "Intercalary Days", called [[Ayyam-i-Ha]], are inserted before the 19th month. This period normally has 4 days, but an extra day is added when needed to ensure that the following year starts on the [[vernal equinox]]. This is calculated and known years in advance.

==Solar Hijri calendar==
{{main | Solar Hijri calendar }}
The [[Iranian calendar#Modern calendar (Solar Hejri)|Iranian calendar]] is an observational calendar that starts on the [[spring equinox]] and adds a single intercalated day to the last month (Esfand) once every four or five years; the first leap year occurs as the fifth year of the typical 33-year cycle and the remaining leap years occur every four years through the remainder of the 33-year cycle. The system used is more accurate and more complicated, and is based on the time of the March equinox as observed from [[Tehran]]. The 33-year period is not completely regular; every so often the 33-year cycle will be broken by a cycle of 29 years.

==Folk traditions==
[[File:Bob Satterfield cartoon about leap year traditions.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A [[spinster]] eagerly awaits the upcoming leap day, in this 1903 cartoon by [[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield.]]]]
In Ireland and Britain, it is a [[tradition]] that women may [[Proposal of marriage|propose marriage]] only in leap years. While it has been claimed that the tradition was initiated by [[Saint Patrick]] or [[Brigid of Kildare]] in 5th century Ireland, this is dubious, as the tradition has not been attested before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Mikkelson |first1=B. | last2 = Mikkelson | first2 = D.P. | date = 2010 | url = http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/february29.asp | title = The Privilege of Ladies | website = The Urban Legends Reference Pages | publisher = snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, a 1288 law by Queen [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret of Scotland]] (then age five and living in Norway), required that fines be levied if a marriage proposal was refused by the man; compensation was deemed to be a pair of leather gloves, a single rose, £1 and a kiss.&lt;ref&gt;Virtually no laws of Margaret survive. Indeed, none concerning her subjects are recorded in the twelve volume ''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'' (1814–75) covering the period 1124–1707 (two laws concerning young Margaret herself are recorded on pages 424 &amp; 441–2 of volume I).&lt;/ref&gt; In some places the tradition was tightened to restricting female proposals to the modern leap day, February 29, or to the medieval (bissextile) leap day, February 24.

According to Felten: "A play from the turn of the 17th century, 'The Maydes Metamorphosis,' has it that 'this is leape year/women wear breeches.' A few hundred years later, breeches wouldn't do at all: Women looking to take advantage of their opportunity to pitch woo were expected to wear a scarlet [[petticoat]] — fair warning, if you will."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Felten | first = E. | date = February 23, 2008 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120371485815386581 | title = The Bissextile b=Beverage | website = Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, the tradition is that if a man refuses a woman's proposal on leap day, he should buy her the fabrics for a skirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hallett | first = S. | date = February 29, 2012 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/27/leap-year-proposal-tradition_n_1305525.html | title = Leap Year Proposal: What's The Story Behind It? | website = Huffington Post | accessdate = December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, since 1980, a satirical newspaper entitled ''[[La Bougie du Sapeur]]'' is published only on leap year, on February 29.

==Birthdays==
A person born on February 29 may be called a "leapling" or a "leaper".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | date =February 28, 2012 | article = February 29: 29 things you need to know about leap years and their extra day | title = Mirror | accessdate = December 7, 2015| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/leap-years-29-things-you-746716}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common years, they usually celebrate their [[birthday]]s on February 28. In some situations, March 1 is used as the birthday in a non-leap year, since it is the day following February 28.

Technically, a leapling will have fewer ''birthday anniversaries'' than their age in years. This phenomenon is exploited when a person claims to be only a quarter of their actual age, by counting their leap-year birthday anniversaries only: for example, in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1879 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Frederic the pirate apprentice discovers that he is bound to serve the pirates until his 21st ''birthday'' (that is, when he turns 88 years old, since 1900 was not a leap year) rather than until his 21st ''year''.

For legal purposes, legal birthdays depend on how local laws count time intervals.

[[File:Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One Logo.jpg|thumb|Logo of the cancelled tour]]

'''Led Zeppelin – The 1980s, Part One''' was a planned autumn 1980 concert tour of North America by the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. It was scheduled to take place from 17 October through 15 November of that year and cover much of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The band cancelled the tour when drummer [[John Bonham]] died on 25 September, one day after the group's initial rehearsal for the tour.

==Background==
In the wake of Led Zeppelin's turmoil-plagued [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|1977 American tour]], which ended abruptly with the sudden death of his son Karac, singer [[Robert Plant]] had become averse to touring America with the band. His reluctance to do so persisted despite the success of the ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' album and the band's return to the stage at the [[Knebworth Festival 1979|1979 Knebworth Festival]] after a two-year absence. Following the conclusion of Led Zeppelin's successful [[Tour Over Europe 1980]], however, Plant had a change of heart and informed Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] that he was willing to undertake an American tour with the band in the autumn of 1980. According to writer [[Mick Wall]], though,

{{cquote|Plant did, however, lay down some strict deal-breaker conditions: no tour should take him away from his family for longer than a month; the band would play a maximum of two shows back-to-back followed by a day off; and, as with the European tour, Superdomes were out, more modest venues in; the aim to re-establish 'contact' with the audience (and, by definition, themselves). Grant and the others wearily complied.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant had been concerned about the band's lengthy absence from one of its primary markets, and had correctly viewed the European tour as a way of rekindling Plant's interest in performing in America.  Relieved by Plant's change of heart and mindful of the singer's conditions, Grant began planning a nineteen-date tour covering the American East Coast and Midwest, and envisioned Led Zeppelin undertaking additional West Coast and UK tours in early 1981. The band began preparations for the tour with renewed optimism about Led Zeppelin's future, with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] in particular commenting that the band had "new energy"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and was "almost in a rebirth situation."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; John Bonham's death, however, resulted in the scuttling of the band's touring plans, and ultimately in the demise of Led Zeppelin itself, with the breakup of the band officially announced on 4 December 1980.

While Jones's view of the state of Led Zeppelin on the eve of the 1980 North American tour was a positive one, writer [[Chris Welch]] saw things differently. In his biography of Peter Grant, Welch questioned the wisdom of the band undertaking a U.S. tour at that point in time:

{{cquote|It seems strange that Grant was quite so determined to get the band back to America, given all they had been through and the musicians' state of health. Was it just for the money? They already had an avalanche of income from record sales and publishing royalties. How many more cars, houses, farms, and antiques could they buy?&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Welch and writers Dave Lewis and Mick Wall particularly questioned John Bonham's physical and emotional fitness to tour North America at that stage. They note that by the fall of 1980 Bonham's dislike of touring, which had been steadily growing over the years, was virtually as strong as Plant's. He was particularly nervous about the potential backlash he might experience in the U.S. from his involvement in the backstage brawl at the Oakland Coliseum during Led Zeppelin's 1977 tour.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 219; Welch (2009), p. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt; As Bonham grew older, moreover, the demands of touring—along with the effects of his alcohol and drug use—took an increasing toll on his energy and stamina, and by 1980 he was struggling with fatigue. He had already permanently dropped his lengthy drum solos from the band's onstage performances.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2009), p. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt; While he came across to Lewis at the time as "delighted"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; about the upcoming trek, Bonham privately confided on the eve of the ill-fated rehearsals for ''Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One'' that he felt depressed and uneasy about going on tour, and that he felt his drumming was no longer up to scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly told Plant, "I've had it with playing drums. Everybody plays better than me. I'll tell you what, when we get to the rehearsal, you play the drums and I'll sing." &lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; After that initial rehearsal on 24 September, he complained again about going on tour while engaging in a drinking binge that would prove to be fatal.

Ironically, on 25 September, at the same time the rest of the band and its entourage were learning of Bonham's death, thousands of Led Zeppelin fans in Chicago were eagerly obtaining copies of that day's ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' containing mail order applications for the upcoming November concerts. This proved to be fruitless since the tour was immediately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 329-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the concerts on this tour, the band intended to use a scaled-down approach similar to the one they used for the European tour, which entailed fewer lighting effects, less improvisation, and fewer extended solos than their 1970s concerts. The previously rehearsed but unperformed ''In Through the Out Door'' track "[[Carouselambra]]" was included in the tentative set-list.

'''Let's do it 2008''' ({{lang-et|Teeme ära 2008}}) is the largest campaign to activate civic society in [[Estonia]] since the [[Singing Revolution]] in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} '''[[Let's Do It! World]]''' is a global campaign for cleaning all countries that grew out of Let's do it 2008. 

Over 50,000 people, or approximately 4% of the population of 1.3 million, participated in the cleanup of the forests and countryside, which would be proportionally equal to 15.3 million people in the United States, or 57 million people in India. Momentum for the event was built up with a media campaign from October 2007 to April 2008. The action was carried out during one day on 3 May 2008. More than 10,000 tons of garbage were removed from the country's forest in about 5 hours for less than 500,000 euros. Under normal circumstances it would have taken the government 3 years and 22.5 million euros to accomplish a similar feat.

==Organizers==
The initial team was:
* [[Rainer Nõlvak]]
* [[Toomas Trapido]]
* [[Kadri Allikmäe]]
* [[Henri Laupmaa]]

The group met at 29 August 2007 as recorded in the first protocol.

Other people of the main team:
* [[Ahti Heinla]]
* [[Eva Truuverk]]
* [[Tiina Urm]]
* [[Anneli Ohvril]]
* [[Jüri-Ott Salm]]

==Spreading the model==
* Since then Latvia has copied the event in September 2008 with 40,000 volunteers. Lithuania and Latvia did larger scale actions in April 2009 with 150,000 volunteers.
* The international cleanup action was announced in March 2009 and the city of Bengaluru (Bangalore) in India did similar action on 16 August 2009.
* On 17 April 2010 a similar event was organized in Slovenia - ''[[Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day!]]'' (''Očistimo slovenijo v enem dnevu'') with 12% of population participating (250.000 volunteers).
* In 2010 it is planned by Portugal (20 March), Romania (September), Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Moldova, Italy, France, Indian city of Delhi, capital of Ukraine Kyiv and some other Ukrainian towns.

This has led to the international action "[[Let's Do It! World]]" and the creation of [[World Cleanup Day]].

==Famous historical escapes==
[[File:Famous adventures and prison escapes of the civil war (1893) (14573020789).jpg|{{largethumb}}|On November 27, 1863, [[John Hunt Morgan]] and six of his officers, most notably [[Thomas Hines]], escaped from their cells in the [[Ohio Penitentiary]] by digging a tunnel from Hines' cell into the inner yard and then ascending a wall with a rope made from bunk coverlets and a bent poker iron.]]

There have been many infamous escapes throughout history:

===13th century===
* In 1244, whilst imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr]] crafted a make-shift rope made of bed sheets and cloths, lowered it, and climbed down. However, because he was heavy, the rope broke and as a consequence, he fell to his death.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8QY7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT135&amp;dq=gruffydd+ap+llywelyn+fawr+death+rope&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2i-Gvif7XAhVE-qQKHbfaD2sQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=gruffydd%20ap%20llywelyn%20fawr%20death%20rope&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
* In 1621 Dutch author [[Hugo Grotius]] escaped from [[Loevestein|Loevestein Castle]] where he was held captive by hiding himself inside a book chest. He was then smuggled outside.

===18th century===

* Englishman [[Jack Sheppard]] took to theft and burglary in 1723, and was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724 but escaped four times, making him a notorious public figure and wildly popular with the poorer classes.
* The Italian author and adventurer [[Giacomo Casanova]] escaped from prison in 1757.

===19th century===
*In the [[Libby Prison Escape]], during the [[American Civil War]], over 109 [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[POWs]] broke out of a building at [[Libby Prison]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] on the night between February 9 and February 10, 1864. All but 50 (two were drowned in the nearby [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]) successfully reached back to Union lines.
*The notorious outlaw [[Billy The Kid]] managed to escape from prison in 1881, but was captured and shot by [[Pat Garrett]] only a few months later.

===1900–1950===
* In 1901, [[Lum You]] was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by a [[Pacific County, Washington]] court.  He enjoyed great public sympathy, including from county officials, who supposedly allowed him to escape by leaving his cell door unlocked at night. He eventually seized the opportunity, but within a few days he either gave himself up or was recaptured.&lt;ref name="stevens"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sydney |last=Stevens |title=Behind Bars in Old Pacific County, 1902: The Hanging of Lum You |newspaper=Chinook Observer |date=June 7, 2011 |url=http://www.chinookobserver.com/news/history/the-hanging-of-lum-you/article_303b3b2a-912f-11e0-a1e7-001cc4c002e0.html |accessdate=August 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503121544/http://www.chinookobserver.com/news/history/the-hanging-of-lum-you/article_303b3b2a-912f-11e0-a1e7-001cc4c002e0.html |archivedate=May 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espy"&gt;{{cite book | first=Willard R. | last=Espy | authorlink=Willard R. Espy | title=Oysterville: Roads to Grandpa's Village |year=1976 |publisher=University of Washington Press |isbn=0-517-52196-2 |pages=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* German Naval Air Service Kapitänleutnant [[Gunther Plüschow]] escaped from the [[Donington Hall]] [[prisoner of war camp]] in 1915.
* [[Frederick Mors]], an Austrian-born American serial killer, was declared insane and placed into the Matteawan Institution for the Insane in the United States in 1915. He escaped in 1916 and was never seen again.
*Leonard T. Fristoe was imprisoned for double murder in 1920 of a police Constable and a deputy Sherriff in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.odmp.org/officer/17466-constable-arthur-j-st-clair ODMP memorial]&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped from Nevada State Prison in 1923. He lived for nearly 46 years under the allias of Claude R. Willis, before being turned in by his own son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-11000/longest-prison-escape/ |title=Longest prison escape |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving several years in prison he died of natural causes .
* [[John Dillinger]] served time at the Indiana State Penitentiary at Michigan City, until 1933, when he was paroled. Within four months, he was back in jail in [[Lima, Ohio]], but his gang sprang him, killing the jailer, Sheriff Jessie Sarber. Most of the gang was captured again by the end of the year in [[Tucson, Arizona]], due to a fire at the Historic Hotel Congress. Dillinger alone was sent to the Lake County jail in [[Crown Point, Indiana]]. He was to face trial for the suspected killing of police officer William O'Malley during a bank shootout in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], some time after his escape from jail. During this time on trial, a famous photograph was taken of Dillinger putting his arm on prosecutor Robert Estill's shoulder when suggested to him by reporters.
* On March 3, 1934, Dillinger escaped from the "escape-proof" (as it was dubbed by local authorities at the time) Crown Point, Indiana county jail, which was guarded by many police officers and national guardsmen. Newspapers reported that Dillinger had escaped using a fake gun made from wood, blackened and shined with shoe polish.
* French prisoner [[René Belbenoît]] escaped from the penal colony of French Guiana on March 2, 1935 when he and five others took to the sea with a boat they had bought. After a series of daring adventures, during which all of the other escapees were captured, he reached United States in 1937. In 1938 his account, ''Dry Guillotine'', was published. Belbenoît had written it in French and it was translated in English by Preston Rambo. It went through 14 printings in less than a year.
* Japanese murderer [[Yoshie Shiratori]] broke out of prison four times between the 1930s and 1940s. A novel and TV-drama ''Hagoku'' was based on his true story.
* [[Fort San Cristóbal (Spain)|Fort San Cristóbal]] is located on the top of the mountain San Cristóbal, which is very close (4&amp;nbsp;km) to [[Pamplona]], [[Spain]]. Built inside the mountain and obsolete since its opening in 1919, due to its weakness against aviation, it served as a prison. On May 22, 1938, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], around 30 prisoners organised a mutiny for a massive prison break. 792 prisoners fled but only three succeeded in getting to the [[France|French]] border; 585 were arrested, 211 died and 14 of the arrested who were considered the leaders were sentenced to death. Most fugitives were intercepted during the following days. In 1988, a sculpture was erected to honour the memory of the Republican people dead there. The fort ceased to be a prison in 1945.
* [[Colditz Castle]] was used as an "escape-proof" prisoner-of-war camp during [[World War II]], but over the course of 300 escape attempts, 130 prisoners escaped.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Thirty escapees eventually managed to reach friendly territory. The men had tunneled, disguised themselves as guards, workmen or women, sneaked away through sewer drains, and even planned to use a glider to get over the wall.
* [[André Devigny]], a French resistance fighter during World War II, escaped [[Fort Montluc|Montluc Military Prison]] in Lyons with his cellmate in April 1943.
* French author [[Henri Charrière]] tried to escape in vain several times, but eventually was successful in 1943. His story, ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'', was published and filmed [[Papillon (1973 film)|under the same name]].
* In [[Stalag Luft III|the Great Escape]], 76 Allied POWs (primarily Commonwealth airmen) escaped from [[Stalag Luft III]] during World War II. 73 of the escapees were captured and fifty of them were executed by the [[Gestapo]], while only three succeeded in reaching neutral territories.
*In the [[Cowra breakout]], at least 545 out of approximately 1000 Japanese POWs escaped from Number 12 POW Compound at Cowra on the night of 4 August 1944. Out of the roughly 500 escapees, 231 died  and 108 were wounded. 31 killed themselves and 12 were burnt to death in huts set on fire by the Japanese. Sixteen of the wounded showed signs of attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Gavin|year=1963|chapter-url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070308--1-.pdf|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1070206/|title=The Final Campaigns|chapter=Appendix 5 – The Prison Break at Cowra, August 1944|series=Australia in the War of 1939–1945. Series 1&amp;nbsp;– Army|volume=Volume 7|location=Canberra|publisher=Australian War Memorial|oclc=1297619|pp=623–624}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Great Papago Escape]], over 25 German POWs escaped by tunneling out of [[Camp Papago Park|Camp Papago Park POW facility]], near [[Phoenix, Arizona]], on the night of December 23, 1944. They then fled into the surrounding desert but because the rivers in Arizona were mostly dry and had not been navigable for decades, most of them were recaptured without bloodshed over the next few weeks.
*In the [[Acre Prison break]], 28 members of the Jewish underground groups [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] escaped from [[Acre Prison]] in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Mandatory Palestine]] (now [[Israel]]) on May 4, 1947.

===1950–1975===
*In 1959, [[Frank Freshwaters]] escaped from an Ohio prison while serving a sentence of involuntary manslaughter from a 1957 car accident. After 56 years he was arrested in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/shawshank-redemption-real-frank-freshwater-captured-after-56-years-run-fugitive-1910767 IB Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[June 1962 Alcatraz escape|Alcatraz escape on June 11, 1962]], American criminals brothers [[June 1962 Alcatraz escape#John and Clarence Anglin|John and Clarence Anglin]], and [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Morris]] escaped [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] on [[Alcatraz Island]] using an inflatable raft, never to be seen again. It was never determined by the [[FBI]] whether they succeeded in their escape or died in the attempt.
*In 1973, three [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] prisoners escaped in the [[1973 Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape|Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape]], when a hijacked helicopter landed in the exercise yard at [[Mountjoy Prison]], [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland]].
*In 1975, 28-year-old American convicted [[drug smuggler]] [[Billy Hayes (writer)|Billy Hayes]] escaped from a prison in [[İmralı]], [[Turkey]], using a rowboat. He made his way to [[Istanbul]], then to Greece, where he was eventually deported to the U.S. Hayes wrote a book on his experiences, ''[[Midnight Express (book)|Midnight Express]]'', which was later adapted into the 1978 film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|of the same name]]'' starring [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]] as Hayes.

===1975–1999===
*On 5 April 1976, in the [[Segovia prison break]], twenty nine prisoners escape from prison, in Spain's largest prison break since the country's [[Spanish civil war|civil war]]. The majority belong to the [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] [[separatism|separatist]] group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. The majority of prisoners are recaptured in shoot outs with the authorities in the next few days, during which one escapee is killed, though four manage to escape to France.     
*In 1977, the convicted murderer of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[James Earl Ray]], escaped from Brushy Mountain State Prison in Tennessee, along with six others. Ray was recaptured after two days. He had been running and hiding in the mountainous forest surrounding the prison.
*In 1977, convicted murderer James Robert Jones escaped from prison in Kansas, and lived in Florida for 37 years under the alias of Bruce Walter Keith. He was arrested in March 2014. It is assumed that he used someone else's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11222409 |title=Murderer caught after 37 years on run - World - NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date=2014-03-19 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1979, [[Assata Shakur]] successfully escaped prison in Union, New Jersey when three members of the Black Liberation Army took prison guards as hostages, freed Assata and fled in a prison van. No one was injured during the prison break, including the guards-turned-hostages who were left in the parking lot. In 1984, Shakur escaped to Cuba where she gained political asylum. Shakur was moved to the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists List on May 2, 2013.
* On 2 March 1982 in [[Peru]], [[Shining Path|PCP]] guerilla fighters [[Assault of Ayacucho prison|assaulted the Ayacucho prison]], resulting in the release of 255 inmates.

* In 1999, [[Leslie Dale Martin]] and three other inmates on [[Louisiana]]'s [[death row]] escaped from their cells at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]].  They were caught within hours, before they even managed to escape prison grounds.  The four men had managed the escape with the use of [[hacksaws]] that had been smuggled in for them by a bribed corrections officer.  Other officers were inattentive to the inmates' two to three week effort at cutting their cell doors and window.  After the escape, two corrections officers were fired and two others were demoted.  Two corrections officers later overheard Martin plotting another escape, which included taking hostages and commandeering a vehicle to ram the prison's front gates.  Martin was immediately moved to the holding cell outside the [[death chamber]], a month before his [[execution]] in 2002.

The shower area in his cell was not detectable to the security cameras, creating a blind spot. The tunnel lay 10 meters underground and was equipped with a ladder to climb to the bottom, artificial lights, air ducts and various construction materials. A makeshift motorcycle was found in the tunnel, believed to have been used to excavate the tons of earth removed, transport materials and Guzmán himself.

* The [[NASA]] [[Mars Climate Orbiter]], launched in 1998, burned up in the Martian atmosphere. A mixup between metric and [[U.S. customary unit|US Standard]] measurements in the controlling software caused the spacecraft to miss its intended 140–150&amp;nbsp;km altitude above Mars during orbit insertion, instead entering the Martian atmosphere at about 57&amp;nbsp;km.
* The NASA [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]] mission was an attempt to sample particles from the solar wind. It successfully collected a sample and returned to Earth. However at the last moment the landing parachute failed to open and the return capsule smashed into the ground at high speed, contaminating the samples.

'''Maurice Gerald Flitcroft''' (23 November 1929 – 24 March 2007) was a British [[golf]]er and audacious [[hoax]]er.

Flitcroft became notorious after hitting a score of 121 in the qualifying competition for the [[1976 Open Championship]]—the highest score recorded at the [[Open Championship]]—and by a self-professed "professional golfer".&lt;ref name=Phantom&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Scott|last2=Farnarby|first2=Simon|title=The Phantom of the Open|year=2010|publisher=Yellow Jersey Press|isbn=978-0-224-08317-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he gained significant media attention, being referred to as "the world's worst golfer". Following the 1976 Open, the rules were changed to prevent Flitcroft from attempting to enter again. Undeterred, he regularly attempted to enter the Open and several other golf competitions, either under his own name or under pseudonyms such as Gene Paceky (as in paycheque), Gerald Hoppy, and James Beau Jolley.&lt;ref name=Phantom /&gt; Flitcroft was married to Jean (died 2002) by whom he had two sons—one of whom caddied for him.

He is the subject of a biography, ''The Phantom of the Open'', by Scott Murray and [[Simon Farnaby]], published by [[Yellow Jersey Press]] in July 2010.&lt;ref name=Phantom /&gt;

In his obituary, [[The Daily Telegraph]] commented thus:

:Maurice Flitcroft ...was a [[Chain smoking|chain-smoking]] shipyard crane-operator from [[Barrow-in-Furness]] whose persistent attempts to [[Gate crashing|gatecrash]] the British Open golf championship produced a sense of humour failure among members of the golfing establishment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1547158/Maurice-Flitcroft.html|title=Maurice Flitcroft|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Flitcroft was born in [[Manchester]] on 23 November 1929.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== The 1976 Open Championship ==
According to his unpublished memoirs, Flitcroft took up the game after watching the [[1974 Piccadilly World Match Play Championship]].&lt;ref name=murray&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/golf.rydercup |title=Crazy golfer |last=Murray |first=Scott |date=19 September 2008 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flitcroft had golfing ambitions well above his ability and came to notoriety in 1976 when, posing as a professional golfer, he managed to obtain a place to play in the qualifying round of [[The Open Championship]]—despite his previous experience amounting only to some hacking around on playing fields near his home. Flitcroft recalled, "I was looking to find fame and fortune but only achieved one of the two". He was inspired to enter the tournament by Walter Danecki, a postal worker from [[Milwaukee]] who, after being barred from becoming a professional by the [[Professional Golfers' Association of America]], entered the [[1965 Open Championship]] after telling the R&amp;A that he was a pro and set a two-round score of 221 during qualifying.&lt;ref name=murray /&gt;

When he discovered, to his shock, that any amateurs entering competitions had to have an official [[Golf handicap|handicap]]—something he lacked—he simply declared himself to be a professional. It was in the same 1976 Open that a young new player, the 19-year-old [[Seve Ballesteros]] first came to the public's attention. Flitcroft prepared for the tournament by studying a golf instruction manual by [[Peter Alliss]] which was borrowed from his local library. He further studied from instructional articles by the 1966 [[PGA Championship]] winner [[Al Geiberger]], and honed his skills on a nearby beach.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

His deception (and ineptitude) were uncovered when he managed to card a 49-[[Over par|over-par]] 121—the worst score in the tournament's history; some of the other professionals playing with him were so angry that they successfully demanded a refund of their entry fees. In addition the R&amp;A gave him a lifetime ban from all their courses.&lt;ref name=murray /&gt; It seems that none of the professionals noticed that his gear comprised only a red [[Imitation leather|imitation-leather]] bag and half a set of [[Mail order|mail-order]] clubs. As a result of his abilities, he became known as "[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|The Royal &amp; Ancient]] Rabbit".

== Other work ==
After leaving school, Flitcroft joined the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]]. Following his marriage, he and his wife settled in Barrow-in-Furness, where he worked as a crane operator at the [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] shipyard.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At other times he worked as a shoe polish salesman and an ice cream man.&lt;ref name=chortle&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2017/02/24/26939/the_worlds_worst_golfer,_coming_to_cinemas# |title=The world's worst golfer, coming to cinemas |last=Richardson |first=Jay |date=24 February 2017 |website=[[Chortle]]|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2006 article in Golfonline, Flitcroft said, "I was in show business. I toured with a [[revue]], and I used to jump into a tank on the stage, I was a stuntcomedy [[high diver]]. The revue used to tour all the country and I would dive into this tank. It wasn't all glass, just the front so the spectators could see what was going on under the water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golfonline.com/golfonline/tours/britishopen/article/0,17742,1206885,00.html |title=Cloak and hacker |publisher=GolfOnline |first=Seth |last=Kelly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719210007/http://www.golfonline.com/golfonline/tours/britishopen/article/0%2C17742%2C1206885%2C00.html |archivedate=19 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After 1976 ==

After his initiation into celebrity golf, Flitcroft briefly became a C-list celebrity and had various golf trophies (usually those celebrating poor play or egregious mishaps) named after him; he also had the distinction of having the "Maurice Gerald Flitcroft Member-Guest Tournament" named after him by the 1988 Blythefield Country Club in [[Grand Rapids]]. Buddy Whitten, Blythefield's head pro stated that, "It started as a lark, but most people can't break 90 so they relate more to Maurice than they would to a touring pro." By the time of the 22nd Maurice G. Flitcroft Member-Guest Tournament, which was held in May 2000, the club had featured a [[Putting green|green]] with two [[Hole (golf)|holes]] so that even the most errant of approaches were potentially rewarded. If this wasn't enough another green had a {{Convert|12|in||adj=on}} cup.

In 1988, Flitcroft himself was flown to Blythefield to play in the event. He is reported as having told the members there that it was the first time he and his wife had been out of the house together "since their gas oven exploded." Whitten further said, "It was a different sort of experience, I'd never met a crane operator from England. But his game had gotten a little better than I expected. I think he shot in the low 90s." Flitcroft said of his performance, "I wasn't playing too well. Some faults had crept into my swing. But I hit a lot of good shots.”

Flitcroft retired from [[Vickers]] in the 1970s and devoted himself to his golf—but was reduced to the ignominy of once again playing on local fields, having been banned from every local golf club after sneaking into their grounds to play without permission.

Many years after his rise to fame, Flitcroft still received [[Mail|post]] which had been addressed simply to: Maurice Flitcroft, Golfer, England.

In 2017 comedian and writer Simon Farnaby, who co-wrote a biography of Flitcroft, stated that he was writing a film script based on the book.&lt;ref name=chortle /&gt;

== Background and official line-up ==
Originally, it was supposed to be a Brazilian version of the famous German [[Wacken Open Air]].&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; However, the promoters failed to obtain official permission to use the name, so they decided to switch it for Metal Open Air.&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; From that moment on, several bands, including [[Shaman (Brazilian band)|Shaman]], [[Megadeth]], [[Symphony X]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]],&lt;ref name="vírgula"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sem shows nem estrutura, Metal Open Air é cancelado|url=http://virgula.uol.com.br/ver/noticia/festivais-de-musica/2012/04/21/298723-sem-shows-nem-estrutura-metal-open-air-e-cancelado|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=[[Universo Online|Vírgula]]|date=21 April 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; started to confirm their performances, though a few have cancelled, including [[Shadowside]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salzano Jr|first=Costábile|title=Metal Open Air: Shadowside cancela participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_842/147389-krisiun.html|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=3 February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krisiun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: Krisiun cancela sua participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_840/152194-metalopenair.html|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=12 April 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Volbeat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: Volbeat cancela sua participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_843/146543-metalopenair.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=23 January 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly for logistical reasons.

By February/March 2012, the official announced line-up was as follows (act names in '''bold''' are headliners; El Diablo is an entertainment group that prepared rock night parties after every headliner performance):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: anunciada a programação oficial do evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_842/148537-metalopenair.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=17 February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headliners of the second day, the [[Rock and Roll All Stars]], were a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] composed of [[Gene Simmons]], [[Joe Elliott]], [[Matt Sorum]], [[Duff McKagan]] , [[Gilby Clarke]], [[Glenn Hughes]], [[Ed Roland]], [[Sebastian Bach]], [[Steve Stevens]], [[Mike Inez]], [[Billy Duffy]] and [[Charlie Sheen]], who was to be the festival's [[master of ceremonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlie Sheen convida para o Metal Open Air, que ocorre a partir de 20 de abril no Maranhão|url=http://musica.uol.com.br/ultnot/2012/04/09/charlie-sheen-convida-para-o-metal-open-air-que-ocorre-a-partir-de-20-de-abril-no-maranhao.jhtm|publisher=[[Universo Online|UOL Música]]|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Paulo|language=Portuguese|date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The festival and the cancellations ==
[[File:Symphony x 2004.tiff|thumb|right|220px|[[Michael Romeo]] (left) and [[Russell Allen]] (right); Symphony X was among the very few bands that managed to make a performance at the festival.]]

Shortly before and even during the festival, several bands cancelled their performances. British thrash band Venom, for example, had their [[Visa (document)|visas]] sent to Africa instead of Brazil by mistake,&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; thus making it impossible for them to take part of MOA and two other South American festivals. [[Hansi Kürsch]], vocalist for German power metal quartet Blind Guardian, stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Open Air 2012 performance cancelled|url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/2012/04/21/metal-open-air-2012-performance-cancelled/|publisher=Official Blind Guardian website|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|date=21 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''In 25 years of our career we [...] have been extremely successful in the avoidance of cancelled shows, so far. This unfortunately comes to a very sad end here in São Luís. Due to massive technical and administrative problems we were forced to cancel tonight's show. As far as we understand it seems to be the local management who has not been able to secure a proper festival environment, anymore. Things are pretty out of hand there. We feel very sorry about this totally unsatisfying situation, but the mistakes made by the local promoter makes an even improvised show impossible. [...] In the future we will be more careful in confirming such festivals.''}}

[[Aquiles Priester]], from Hangar, also cancelled his band's participation, stating:&lt;ref name=exame/&gt;

{{cquote|''We negotiated everything via oral conversation, but we made ourselves very much clear that we needed the total cash before our performance, since we needed to pay our trip to São Luís in our very own bus. We wouldn't accept, by any means, to play without our backline. So far, we were paid with only 25% of the cash to cover all our expenses (fuel, accommodation and food for the band and crew), we needed at least 75%.''}}

Terra Prima's members didn't receive their air tickets to São Luís nor the confirmation of their accommodations in the city.&lt;ref name=exame/&gt;

Symphony X, one of the few bands that managed to take on the stage and perform, posted a note some days later, thanking their fans for the show and criticizing the event's structure:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Open Air|url=http://www.symphonyx.com/site/news/metal-open-air/|publisher=Official Symphony X website|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''We want to thank the fans for sticking it out on Friday night! We were extremely close to having to cancel the show due to technical reasons and did not know if we would even play for sure until an hour before the set, which had already been delayed two hours. The lack of organization and chaos surrounding the event, which had also been noted by the media, had forced many bands to cancel. This is unfair to the fans in attendance, and unfortunately these fans were robbed of many performances.''}}

[[Dave Mustaine]], from Megadeth, also thanked his fans and regretted the festival's organization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Megadeth Mainman On Brazil's METAL OPEN AIR: 'We Were Playing For The People'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=172916|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''To the fans last night in São Luís, thank you. It's all I can say. One Big Mega Thank You! Yesterday's show in Sao Luis was very challenging, but we did it! [...] I was told a lot of the talent opted out from coming. I was also told the tickets cost $450 [[Brazilian real]] for the three-day weekend, and $250 BRL for just one day. The average person in this area makes $28 BRL a day, so you can do the math. [...] We were playing, no matter what. We weren't playing for the promoter anymore; we were playing for the people!''}}

[[Ricardo Confessori]], drummer for [[Shaman]], publicly contested Anthrax guitarist [[Scott Ian]] for canceling the band's performance at the festival, accusing him of not giving a good excuse for  the fans, to which Ian replied that the problem was "the whole terrible organization. We never want to cancel but they made it impossible."&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Scott_Ian/status/193877446603448320 Confessori's and Ian's discussion] at [[Twitter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, a total of 30 of the 47 invited bands cancelled their performances due to the severe logistical, structural and financial problems regarding the festival.&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; As for the fans, some had to camp inside [[stable]]s, with almost no electricity, lack of places to buy food, beverage and hygiene products and only one public toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freire|first=Pedro Henrique|title=Estábulos para cavalos viram área de camping para o público|url=http://www.oimparcial.com.br/app/noticia/especiais/metal-open-air/2012/04/20/interna_metal,113830/estabulos-para-cavalos-viram-area-de-camping-para-o-publico.shtml|publisher=O Imparcial|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|language=Portuguese|date=20 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524014607/http://www.oimparcial.com.br/app/noticia/especiais/metal-open-air/2012/04/20/interna_metal,113830/estabulos-para-cavalos-viram-area-de-camping-para-o-publico.shtml#|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barbosa|first=Alex|title=

== Aftermath ==
Soon after MOA was cancelled, both companies responsible for the festival (Negri Concerts and Lamparina Filmes e Produções) accused each other of breaking contractual rules.&lt;ref name=negrivslamparina&gt;{{cite web|last=Louise|first=Aline|title=Produtoras do Metal Open Air trocam acusações em cartas abertas|url=http://musica.terra.com.br/produtoras-do-metal-open-air-trocam-acusacoes-em-cartas-abertas,fa3cbbd670a5a310VgnCLD200000bbcceb0aRCRD.html|publisher=Terra|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|language=Portuguese|date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Home Week''' or '''Old Home Day''' is a practice that originated in the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]] similar to a harvest holiday or festival.  In its beginning in the 19th–20th century it involved a municipal effort to invite former residents of a village, town, or city—usually individuals who grew up in the municipality as children and moved elsewhere in adulthood—to visit the "Old Home", the parental household and home town. Some municipalities celebrate the holiday annually, while others celebrate it every few years.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, the practice has spread to other parts of [[North America]] and has become a broader celebration with an emphasis on local culture and history. From the [[Wilmington, Vermont]] town web site:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Town of Wilmington | authorlink = Wilmington, Vermont | title = Old Home Week 2010 | url = http://www.wilmingtonvermont.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B7F6E5A89-A189-4E95-8300-50B76E0DC660%7D | accessdate = 2008-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Old Home Week is a town event held every 10 years. It is best described as a town reunion, a celebration of Wilmington's citizens, past, present and future, and a honoring of its history. Events traditionally include a parade, a town dinner, class and family reunions and tours of local points of interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…Old Home Week is a decennial celebration and gathering of friends and acquaintances, all sharing the common experience of having resided and/or attended school, in Wilmington. It is also a celebration for all those who now live in and love their town.  Nobody is an outsider during Old Home Week.|40px|40px}}

He moved to [[New York City]] in the 1970s and was hired by [[Ian Schrager]] at [[Studio 54]], after Schrager had seen the creative designs Isabell had developed while he was working for event planner Renny Reynolds who had done work at the club and was the leading planner in his day. Schrager described how Isabell "never tried to do too much, it was never design on steroids, yet there was always the razzle-dazzle".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

He started on his own operating a floral shop within [[Bergdorf Goodman]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. He established "a full-service event-production house" in the city's [[West Village]] where he would oversee the creation of events around the world, in which the entire setting including flowers, lighting, sound and table decorations would be part of his craft. [[Anna Wintour]] of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine described him as "the king of the event world" who was "a magician"&lt;ref name="NYTObit" /&gt; and the first person that top hostesses would approach to create spectacular events. Isabell created roughly 30 events for writer and editor [[Tina Brown]]. She regarded him as "sort of a genius" who had the ability to "take any space and make magic in it".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; For over a decade, he designed the annual [[Met Ball]] for ''Vogue''.&lt;ref name=TCBG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/shopping/fashion/features/11894/|title=The Charity Ball Game|accessdate=2011-05-04|date=2005-05-21|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, he had four tons of [[glitter]] dumped on the floor of [[Studio 54]] for a New Year's Eve event, with club co-owner Ian Schrager describing how guests felt "like you were standing on stardust".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Bracketed between the 1986 wedding of [[Edwin Schlossberg]] to [[Caroline Kennedy]] and the 1996 nuptials of [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]] and [[Carolyn Bessette]], he worked on the 1994 funeral of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; For the July 1995 wedding of billionaire [[Robert Warren Miller]]'s daughter [[Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece|Marie-Chantal]] to [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece]] at [[Saint Sophia (London)|Saint Sophia]] in [[Bayswater]], [[London]], Isabell created a virtual Greek temple in a tent, including pillars topped with roses, with a budget variously estimated at $5–8 million.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Bob.

Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For the wedding of [[Alexandra von Fürstenberg]], Marie-Chantal's sister, to Prince Alexandre Egon von Fürstenberg, son of [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], Isabell transformed a tent in [[Battery Park]] into a Chinese teahouse complete with a throne room that included hanging lanterns and bamboo trees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzy Menkes|Menkes, Suzy]].

Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For Christmas 1998 at the Clinton White House, Isabell created a massive fir wreath with 1,500 lights individually colored a shade he called "Presidential blue".&lt;ref&gt;Bumiller, Elizabeth.

A '''social media newsroom''' is a company resource, set up to increase the functionality and usability of the traditional online newsroom. 

Social media newsrooms (SMNs) are intended to encourage dialogue and information sharing. Unlike online newsrooms, content is accessible to more than just journalists, but to all those with whom the company engages such as bloggers, their prospects, customers, business partners and investors. It gives these stakeholders access to news, public relations announcements, images, audio, video and other multimedia files.

In addition to posting press releases and corporate news, companies can integrate other social content from sites such as [[YouTube]], [[Flickr]] and [[Slideshow]] as well as streams from corporate [[Twitter]] accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 Communicate magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225210651/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 |date=2012-02-25 }} Hold the Front Page, Communicate magazine, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional tools for journalists such as corporate fast facts, leadership information, a multimedia library, financial information, awards and other recent media coverage are also included in an SMN.

Examples of companies effectively using social media newsrooms include [[Opel Group]], Pressat, [[First Direct]], [[MyNewsdesk]], [[Scania AB|Scania]] and [[Newport Beach]].{{cn|date=March 2012}}

{{Distinguish|The Sound of Music Live!}}
'''''The Sound of Music Live''''' is a [[television special]] that was originally broadcast by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 20 December 2015. The special was an adaptation of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', starring [[Kara Tointon]] as [[Maria von Trapp]], performed and televised [[live television|live]] from [[3 Mills Studios]] in London. 

On 9 November 2018, the production was broadcast in the United States as part of [[PBS]]'s performing arts anthology series ''[[Great Performances]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unionleader.com/great-performances-imports-uk-s-sound-of-music/article_f1a6feb2-4b7f-57f9-9a41-e05aa84a76de.html|title='Great Performances' imports UK's 'Sound of Music'|work=UnionLeader.com|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
In October 2015, ITV announced that it would transmit a live adaptation of the musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' as part of its holiday programming lineup, in what would be the first time that such a programme had been attempted in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="deadline-itvsom"&gt;{{cite web|title=ITV To Mount ‘The Sound Of Music Live!’ UK Christmas Special|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/itv-sound-of-music-live-christmas-special-kara-tointon-1201590814/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live'' was part of ITV's continuing efforts to broadcast more live "[[Event television|event]]" programs, which are designed to attract critical masses of viewers by encouraging them to watch via the original broadcast, rather than via [[video on demand|catch-up]] services and [[digital video recorder]]s. The desire for increased ITV viewership came especially in the wake of declining ratings for its reality music competition ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', whose [[The X Factor (UK series 12)|series 12]] finale had the second-smallest viewership in the programme's history. ITV had similarly broadcast live episodes of its series ''[[Coronation Street]]'' in [[Coronation Street Live (2000 episode)|2000]] and [[Coronation Street Live (2010 episode)|2010]] in honour of its 40th and 50th anniversary respectively, and in 2015 for ITV's 60th anniversary.&lt;ref name="deadline-itvsom"/&gt;

This was not the first time that ''The Sound of Music'' had been adapted in such a manner. In 2013, U.S. network [[NBC]] broadcast its own [[The Sound of Music Live!|live television adaptation of ''The Sound of Music'']] starring [[country music|country]] singer [[Carrie Underwood]]; similarly to ITV's version, it was an adaptation of the original musical, and not based on the [[The Sound of Music|film version]]. Although it received mixed reviews, it was seen by over 18 million viewers. As follow-ups, NBC produced similar adaptations of ''[[Peter Pan Live!|Peter Pan]]'' and ''[[The Wiz Live!|The Wiz]]'' in 2014 and 2015 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/the-wiz-live-nbc-s-latest-live-musical-broadcast-from-long-island-1.11164689|title=‘The Wiz Live!’: NBC’s latest live musical broadcast from Long Island|last1=Crook|first1=John|date=26 November 2015|website=newsday.com |publisher=Newsday|access-date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvline.com/2013/12/06/sound-of-music-live-ratings-nbc/ |title=Ratings: NBC's Sound of Music Live!

==Cast==
[[Kara Tointon]] played Maria, and [[Julian Ovenden]] played Captain Georg von Trapp. The supporting cast included veterans of British television and theatre, including [[Alexander Armstrong]] as Max Detweiler, [[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]] as Baroness Elsa Schraeder, [[Maria Friedman]] as Mother Abess, [[Evelyn Hoskins]] as Liesl von Trapp, Jon Tarcy as Rolf Gruber, [[Mel Giedroyc]] as the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, and [[Paul Copley]] as the butler, Franz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound of Music Live!|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dwnsbw/the-sound-of-music-live|website=Radio Times|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Sound of Music Live'' received mixed reviews. Mark Shenton of ''[[The Stage]]'' said it was a failed experiment, with "uninspired and sometimes insipid" choreography and direction, although he praised the cast's performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shenton|first1=Mark|title=The Sound of Music Live review – ‘bold experiment doesn’t pay off’|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/the-sound-of-music-live-review-bold-experiment-doesnt-pay-off/|website=The Stage|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claire Allfree of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said it lacked both the intimacy of live theatre and the scope of the big screen, but nevertheless judged it "more a success than it was a failure," saying that former ''[[EastEnders]]'' star Tointon "brought a refreshing earthiness and grit to Maria that made the passionate, unconventional novice feel thoroughly modern and accessible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound of Music Live, review: 'much to enjoy'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/12056862/the-sound-of-music-review-kara-tointon-live-itv.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' said that Tointon was "showered with praise" for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kara Tointon shocks fans with incredible vocals as she plays Maria in The Sound Of Music live|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/kara-tointon-shocks-fans-incredible-7048037|website=The Mirror|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was watched by over 3.82 million viewers according to overnight ratings figures, being beaten by the [[The Apprentice (UK series eleven)|series eleven]] finale of ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' (5.31 million) and its lead-in, the [[2015 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award|BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] presentation (5.78 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-apprentice/news/a777848/uk-tv-ratings-the-apprentice-final-loses-800000-from-last-year-sports-personality-is-top-with-57m/ |title=UK TV ratings: The Apprentice final is lowest in 10 years, Sports Personality is top with 5.7m |author=Tom Eames |work=Digital Spy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITV's The Sound of Music Live draws 4m viewers|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/itvs-the-sound-of-music-live-draws-4m-viewers/|website=The Stage|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tragedy''' is an event of great loss, usually of human life.  Such an event is said to be ''tragic''. Traditionally the event would require "some element of moral failure, some flaw in character, or some extraordinary combination of elements"&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920405&amp;slug=1484688&lt;/ref&gt; to be tragic.

Not all death is considered a tragedy. Rather it is a precise set of symptoms surrounding the loss that define it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crisis Intervention Training for Disaster Workers: An Introduction |last=Doherty |first=George W. |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=12 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of factors that define a death as ''tragic''.

An event in which a massive number of deaths occur may be seen as a tragedy. This can be re-enforced by media attention or other public outcry.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=1 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tragedy does not necessarily involve [[massacre|massive death]]. The death of a single person, e.g., a public figure or a child, may be seen as a tragedy.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt; The person need not necessarily have been [[celebrity|famous]] before death.

==Factors that make death a tragedy==
Generally, the label of "tragedy" is given to an event based on public perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=11 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of factors that can make a death be considered a tragedy.

===Scope===
The scope of an event can affect the public view, and make it appear tragic. This can be the case whether the death toll is high, or if a single, unexpected death occurs in a well-beloved person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=5 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of attachment in the public eye may also impact whether or not the event is publicly labeled as a tragedy. For example, the unexpected death of a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] student that receives heavy media attention may be seen as more tragic than that of a [[recidivism|recidivist]] prisoner who is beaten to death by fellow inmates.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1 /&gt;

===Prematurity===
A death may be viewed as a tragedy when it is premature in nature. An old person dying of old age is an expectation, but the death of a child or of a young, healthy adult that is not expected by others can be viewed as tragic.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Publicity]] is a factor in making the public view an event as a tragedy. With publicity of a large number of deaths or even a single death, this plays on the emotions of the general public, and thereby impacts perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=3 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of coverage affects the number of people in whose eyes the event is viewed as tragic. While local coverage may garner sympathy from those in the hometown of the deceased, international coverage may lead the whole world to mourn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=9 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The resulting consequences from one or more deaths can be seen as a tragedy. For example, if a large number of persons are killed in a terrorist attack, not only is life lost, but others may lose their sense of security, and this impacts the lives of others in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=8 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasting effects===
The long-term effects of an event can render it as tragic. Tragedies often have effects that shape those affected, and are remembered even long after, as they clearly impact the future for those involved. They may also be commemorated on anniversaries or whenever they otherwise come to mind.&lt;ref&gt;Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional; by Stephen B. Roberts, Willard W. C. Ashley; {{ISBN|978-1-59473-240-9}}; page 67&lt;/ref&gt; A public tragedy often leads to measures being taken to prevent similar tragic events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional, and National Tragedy |last=Roberts |first=Stephen B.  |authorlink= |author2=Willard W. C. Ashley  |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-1-59473-240-9 |page=86 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dealing with tragedy==
There are various ways tragedy can affect people.

The typical reaction to tragedy is heavy [[grief]], followed by a slow recovery. Common feelings following a tragedy include [[sadness]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[crying]], [[blame]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tragedy: A psychiatrist offers ways to deal with trauma and grief |author=Alvin F. Poussaint, M.D. |newspaper=Ebony Magazine |date=February 1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AM4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=coping+with+tragedy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jUT4TIfBFIWClAe0rvGgAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=coping%20with%20tragedy&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some people wonder what they did to deserve such suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with Tragedy |last=Ramsey |first=Tara |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=33 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, their [[religion|faith]] may be a source of comfort in the wake of tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith in the Fast Lane |last=Owens |first=Ken |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=106 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unintentional discharge''' is the event of a [[firearm]] discharging (firing) at a time not intended by the user. An unintended discharge may be produced by an incompatibility between firearm design and usage, such as the phenomenon of [[cooking off]] a round in a closed bolt machine gun, a mechanical malfunction as in the case of [[slamfire]] in an automatic weapon, user induced due to training issues or negligence, or a simple accident. The phenomenon has also been defined in the scientific literature as ''an activation of the trigger mechanism that results in an unplanned discharge that is outside of the firearm’s prescribed use''. Where prescribed use refers to departmental policies and laws related to the operation of firearms (O'Neill, 2018).

==Accidental discharge==

An '''accidental discharge''' ('''AD''') may occur when the trigger of the firearm is deliberately pulled for a purpose other than shooting—dry-fire practice, demonstration, or function testing—but ammunition is unintentionally left in the chamber.  Unintentionally leaving a firearm loaded is more likely to occur when the individual handling the gun is poorly trained, and perhaps also with removable-magazine-fed firearms (as the magazine may be removed, giving an unloaded appearance even when a round remains chambered—see discussion of magazine-safeties below).

A second common cause of negligent discharges is when the gun-handler places their finger on the trigger before they have decided to shoot.  With the finger so positioned, many activities may cause the finger to compress the trigger unintentionally.  For example, if one attempts to holster the firearm with finger on trigger, the holster edge will drive the finger onto the trigger, and discharge is likely.  If one stumbles or struggles (with an adversary) with finger on trigger, the grasping motion of both hands will likely cause the trigger finger to compress the trigger.

[[Gun safety]] rules recognize the above possibilities, and aim to prevent them. The primary firearm safety rule usually listed by any source is a version of "Always keep the gun pointed in safe direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Izak|first1=Shultz|title=Gun Safe Reviews|url=http://www.shootingandsafety.com/best-gun-safe-reviews/|website=Shooting &amp; Safety|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this rule ensures that, should an accidental discharge occur, no harm will be done.  Second, one's finger should remain outside the trigger guard until the decision has been made to fire the weapon; even if (some would say especially if) one is facing a hostile adversary and has to be prepared to fire at a moment's notice, keeping the finger out of the trigger-guard until one has decided to shoot will prevent an accidental shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob103.html|title=The subtleties of safe firearms handling|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|date=February 2007|website=Issue #103|publisher=Backwoods Home Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a firearm is not in use, storing it unloaded and in a separate container from ammunition may also help prevent accidental discharges, especially if the stored firearm is "accessed" by an unauthorized user.

On occasion, an accidental discharge can occur by means other than the finger pulling the [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]], such as dropping a loaded weapon.  Because of this possibility, most currently produced pistols are designed with a "drop-safety" or [[Safety (firearms)#Firing pin block|firing pin block]], a mechanism inhibiting or isolating the firing pin, preventing accidental discharge if the firearm is dropped.  However, most long guns do not have drop-safeties.

Prevention of dropped-firearm ADs with long guns therefore depends on the user being familiar with the precautions needed for that particular gun: it is standard practice for all long-gun users to unload the firearm's chamber before any activity that might foreseeably result in a dropped firearm (e.g., climbing a fence while hunting), and before placing the firearm in a vehicle (where sudden deceleration may cause the firearm to act as if dropped).

Accidental discharges not involving trigger-pull can also occur if the firearm is mechanically unsound: poor maintenance, abuse, inept "gunsmithing," or the use of substandard materials or defective [[ammunition]] in the gun may all lead to breakage.

In World War II, early versions of the British [[Sten gun]] were notorious for accidentally discharging when dropped. While dropping any long gun with loaded chamber can be dangerous, the use of a soft bronze bolt in early Stens—allowing the [[Sear (firearm)|sear]] contact area to wear down quickly—made ADs even more likely.

As the early Sten gun illustrates, "poor design," including the specification of unsuitable component materials, is sometimes cited as a cause for some firearms being "unsafe."  Surely, any firearm that can discharge by itself when loaded is unsafe, and no user would want to handle a firearm that has a high likelihood of accidental discharge when employed for its intended use.  But, firearm designs incorporating fewer safeties are not intrinsically unsafe—see discussion of long-guns above—even if they do require competence and proper training for safe use.

A relevant discussion attends the use of [[Safety (firearms)#Magazine Interlocks|magazine-safeties]] in semi-automatic pistols.  Such safeties prevent the pistol from firing if there is a round in the chamber, but the magazine is removed.  Some self-defense experts dislike this feature, as it may allow the pistol to be "disabled" unexpectedly during a struggle, so that the pistol fails when needed.  Others feel that it may improve user safety and prevent some accidental discharges.  Both semi-auto pistol designs, with and without magazine-safeties, are currently manufactured.

One last form of accidental discharge, known as ''[[cooking off]],'' occurs when a weapon becomes overheated, with the firing chamber hot enough to ignite the propellant charge in the ammunition round, causing the cartridge to fire.  As recently as 1979, this problem doomed the innovative [[Heckler &amp; Koch G11]] during NATO trials.

"Cooking off" is typically encountered only in [[fully automatic]] weapons, such as [[machine gun]]s, when they are fired for long periods of time without allowing the barrel and chamber of the weapon to cool down to safe temperatures.  For this reason, modern crew-served machine guns are equipped with spare [[Gun barrel|barrel]]s to allow a machine gun crew to replace an overheated barrel with a cool one, thus restoring the weapon to action while the overheated barrel is allowed to cool. Also, the majority of machine guns fire from an [[open bolt]], so the round is chambered only after pressing the trigger, just before firing.

==Negligent discharge==

A '''negligent discharge''' ('''ND''') is a discharge of a [[firearm]] involving [[Culpability|culpable]] carelessness. In judicial and military technical terms, a negligent discharge is a chargeable offence. A number of [[armed force]]s automatically consider any [[accidental discharge]] to be negligent discharge, under the assumption that a trained soldier has control of his firearm at all times. This is the case in the [[United States Army]],&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, Abel. "Proper Weapons Practices Key to Ending Negligent Discharge Incidents in Iraq." ''army.mil''. United States Army. 1 March 2007. [http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/03/01/2065-proper-weapons-practices-key-to-ending-negligent-discharge-incidents-in-iraq/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Army]], the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[British Army]] and various Police Forces within the United Kingdom.

From an article on a U.S. Air Force website:
