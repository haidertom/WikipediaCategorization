      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5873">'''Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules''' are a set of [[professional wrestling]] rules mainly used in British wrestling. They were named after [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans]] who ordered a unified set of rules written up for professional wrestling in the British Isles.  The style of wrestling under the Mountevans rules was advertised by promoters as '''Modern Freestyle Wrestling'''.

== History ==
[[Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom]], under the [[All-in professional wrestling|All In]] rules, had been popular in the 1930s. However, as a result of a shift in focus away from technical skill and towards violence including usage of weapons, it was banned towards the end of the decade by the [[London County Council]].&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

After a failed attempt to relaunch the sport with a show at [[Harringay Arena]], [[Middlesex]] in 1947 was condemned by journalists as being "fake",&lt;ref name=bleach /&gt; Admiral-Lord Mountevans along with radio personality [[A. B. Campbell|Commander Archibald Bruce Campbell]], [[Maurice Webb (politician)|Maurice Webb]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and Norman Morell, an [[Amateur wrestling]] champion and professional wrestling promoter, formed a committee to formalise professional wrestling in the United Kingdom and write up a set of unified rules.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book | first = John | last = Listner  | title = Slamthology: Collected Wrestling Writings 1991-2004 | publisher = Lulu.com | location =  | year = 2005| isbn = 1411653297  | page = 255}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Once the rules were written, they were almost universally accepted with 95% of promotions in the United Kingdom adopting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/90279549/1946-The-Rules-Governing-Professional-Wrestling-Alll-the-Techniques-to-go-Along-With-Them |title=(1946) The Rules Governing Professional Wrestling &amp; All the Techniques to go Along With Them |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the rules were adopted by the newly formed [[Joint Promotions]], officially as a way to uphold the committee's ideology but was also considered to be a way for Joint Promotions to effectively control British wrestling.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

In London, the new rules led to the ban on professional wrestling being lifted however a by-law authorised by the [[Home Office]] and the [[Metropolitan Police]] kept female wrestling banned within the [[Greater London]] area until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/wrestlingfun/histor1.htm |title=Historic Bouts |publisher=Geocities (archived) |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weight divisions ==
The rules set out seven [[Professional wrestling weight classes|weight divisions]] with maximum weight limits and called for champions to be crowned of each limit : Lightweight ({{convert|154|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=x| or ~}}), Welterweight ({{convert|165|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=x| or ~}}), Middleweight ({{convert|176|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=x| or ~}}), Heavy Middleweight ({{convert|187|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=x| or ~}}), Light Heavyweight ({{convert|198|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=x| or ~}}), Mid-Heavyweight ({{convert|209|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=x| or ~}}) and Heavyweight for all weights above {{convert|210|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=bleach&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/404251-the-history-of-british-wrestling-part-one |title=The History of British Wrestling: Part One |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days, the champions of these weight divisions were also known as Mountevans Champions as the Championships also included Mountevans in their official names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingheritage.co.uk/noangelofislington.htm |title=No Angel of Islington |publisher=Wrestling Heritage |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
The Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules defined what holds were legal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingfurnace.com/formalities/holds/holds.htm |title=The Wrestling Furnace Picture Gallery - Wrestling Holds |publisher=Wrestling Furnace |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102213816/http://www.wrestlingfurnace.com/formalities/holds/holds.htm |archive-date=2012-11-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and how a fall could be scored:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingfurnace.com/formalities/rules/rules.htm |title=The Wrestling Furnace Picture Gallery - Wrestling Rules |publisher=Wrestling Furnace |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fall could be awarded by the following means:
*[[Pinfall]]
*[[Submission]]
*[[Countout|Knockout]] - failing to answer the referee's 10 count when thrown or knocked to the canvas or outside the ring.
* Technical Knockout - If the opponent is ruled unfit to continue by the referee.
*[[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|Disqualification]] - generally applicable upon a wrestler receiving the third of three "Public Warnings" given by the referee for serious or persistent offences.

In singles matches for the best of three falls, a win was immediately awarded in the event of a knockout or disqualification, regardless of whether or not falls had previously been scored.  Later when [[Tag Team]] wrestling was introduced to Britain, generally the disqualified or knocked-out wrestler was eliminated and a single fall awarded to the opposing team.  The partner of the eliminated wrestler would then continue the match for any remaining falls under [[Handicap match|handicap tag]] conditions.

A '''ball pump needle''' is a metal device in which [[air]] passes through it, from an inflating pump to a ball of sports. Such as the ones of football, [[Ball (association football)|soccer]], volleyball, basketball, [[Rugby ball|rugby]], handball or waterpolo. Using a lubricant facilitates insertion of the inflation needle. A ball needle is related to a ball pump.

[[File:Baseball diamond marines.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The baseball diamond of the [[San Diego]] [[San Diego Padres|Padres]]' [[Petco Park]], seen from the left-field stands.]]

A '''baseball field''', also called a '''ball field''', '''sandlot''' or a '''baseball diamond''', is the [[playing field|field]] upon which the game of [[baseball]] is played. The term can also be used as a [[metonym]] for a [[baseball park]].

==Specifications==
:''Unless otherwise noted, the specifications discussed in this section refer to those described within the [[Official Baseball Rules]], under which Major League Baseball is played.''&lt;ref name="Rule1" /&gt;
[[File:Baseball diamond.svg|thumb|500px|Diagram of a baseball field.]]
The starting point for much of the action on the field is [[home plate]] (officially "home base"), which is a five-sided slab of whitened rubber, {{convert|17|in|cm}} square with two of the corners removed so that one edge is 17 inches long, two adjacent sides are {{convert|8.5|in|cm}} and the remaining two sides are {{convert|12|in|cm}} and set at an angle to make a point. The plate is set into the ground such that its surface is level with the surrounding ground. Adjacent to each of the two parallel 8.5-inch sides is a batter's box. The point of home plate where the two 12-inch sides meet at right angles is at one corner of a {{convert|90|ft|m|2|adj=on}} square. The other three corners of the square, in counterclockwise order from home plate, are called [[first base|first]], [[second base|second]], and [[third base]]. Three canvas or rubber bases {{convert|15|in|cm}} square and {{convert|3|-|5|in|cm}} in thickness made of soft material mark the three bases.

Near the center of the square is an artificial hill known as the pitcher's mound, atop which is a white rubber slab known as the pitcher's plate, colloquially the "rubber." The specifications for the pitcher's mound are described [[#Pitcher's mound|below]].

All the bases, including home plate, lie entirely within fair territory. Thus, any batted ball that touches those bases must necessarily be in fair territory. While the first and third base bags are placed so that they lie inside the 90-foot square formed by the bases, the second base bag is placed so that its center (unlike first, third and home) coincides exactly with the "point" of the ninety-foot square. Thus, although the "points" of the bases are 90 feet apart, the physical distance between each successive pair of base markers is closer to {{convert|88|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=DIAGRAM NO 2|page=5|title=Official Rules of Major League Baseball, 2013 Edition|publisher=Triumph Books|isbn=978-1-60078-797-3|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2013/official_baseball_rules.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines from home plate to first and third bases extend to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction and are called the foul lines. The portion of the playing field between (and including) the foul lines is fair territory; the rest is "foul territory." The area within the square formed by the bases is officially called the infield, though colloquially this term also includes fair territory in the vicinity of the square; fair territory outside the infield is known as the outfield. Most baseball fields are enclosed with a fence that marks the outer edge of the outfield. The fence is usually set at a distance ranging from {{convert|300|to|420|ft|m|-1}} from home plate. Most professional and college baseball fields have a right and left foul pole. These poles are at the intersection of the foul lines and the respective ends of the outfield fence and, unless otherwise specified within the [[ground rules]], lie in fair territory. Thus, a batted ball that passes over the outfield wall in flight and touches the foul pole is a fair ball and the batter is awarded a home run.

==First base==
{{main|First baseman}}
[[File:Chris Davis, Kevin Pillar (34422505340).jpg|thumb|right|[[Kevin Pillar]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] reaches first base safely as Chris Davis of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] attempts to scoop a bouncing ball thrown by one of the other infielders during a game in May 2017]] 

First base is the first of four bases that must be touched by a player on the batting team in order to score a run. Unlike when an offensive player reaches second or third base, it is permissible for a batter-runner to overrun first base without being in jeopardy of being put out. After contact is made with the base, the batter-runner may slow down and return to first base at his leisure, so long as he makes no move or attempt to advance to second base.

The first baseman is the defensive player responsible for the area near first base. A professional first baseman is often a slow runner and tall.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  A tall first baseman presents a large target to which other fielders can throw, and his height gives him a larger range in reaching and catching errant throws. Players who are left-handed are marginally preferable for first base because: first, it is easier for a left-handed fielder to catch a [[Pickoff|pick-off]] throw from the pitcher and tag the baserunner; and, second, it is easier for a left handed thrower to make the throw to second base to start a 3–6–3, 3–6–4, or a 3–6–1 double play.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Also, a right-handed first baseman must, when setting himself up to receive a throw from an infielder, execute a half-pivot near the base; this is a move that a left-hander need not make (this advantage is very marginal, however). There are three infield positions that can only effectively be occupied by right-handed players: 2nd base, 3rd base, and shortstop. This is because of the time it takes to pivot and set to throw. It takes a left-handed thrower more time to make that pivot and in the fast-paced major league game, that time is critical. As a result, there are fewer positions a left-handed player can occupy, and if that player is not fast, the outfield may not be a good fit.

In the [[Baseball scorekeeping|numbering system]] used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.

==Second base==
{{main|Second baseman}}
[[File:Second baseman Brian Dozier trying to turn double play.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brian Dozier]] of the [[Minnesota Twins]] leaps over a sliding [[Jonathan Schoop]] of the Baltimore Orioles attempting to turn a [[double play]]]]

Second base is the second of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a base runner in order to score a run for that player's team. Second base is typically defended by the second baseman and the [[shortstop]]. Second base is also known as the keystone sack. A runner on second base is said to be in "scoring position," owing to the high likelihood of reaching home plate and scoring a run from second base on most base hits. Since second is the farthest base from home plate, it is the most common target of [[base stealing]].

Ideally, the second baseman and shortstop possess quick hands and feet and the ability to release the ball rapidly and with accuracy. One will usually cover second base when the other attempts to field the ball. Both players must communicate well to be able to make a [[double play]]. Particular agility is required of the second baseman in double play situations, which usually forces the player to throw towards first while his momentum carries him in the opposite direction. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4, and the shortstop 6.

==Third base==
[[File:Andy Wilkins rounds the bases.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Andy Wilkins rounds third base following a home run for the [[2010 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team]].]]
{{main|Third baseman}}
Third base is the third of four bases a base runner must touch in a counterclockwise succession in order to score a run. Many batted balls that result in the batter being put out (such as a [[sacrifice fly]]) may nevertheless allow a runner to reach home plate and score a run from third base, provided that the third and final out is not recorded before he can do so. A runner on third base is therefore particularly valuable to the batting team when fewer than two outs have been recorded.

The third baseman is the defensive player whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base. A third baseman ideally possesses quick reaction to batted balls and a strong arm to make the long throw to first base. The distance from 3rd to 1st is about {{convert|127|ft|m}}. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.

==Home plate==
{{redirect|Home plate}}
[[File:Home base of baseball field in Třebíč, Czech Republic.jpg|thumb|Home plate of a baseball field]]
Home plate, formally designated home base in the rules, is the final base that a player must touch to score. Unlike the other bases, home plate is a [[pentagon|five-sided]] slab of whitened rubber that is set at ground level. The use of rubber was developed by [[Bob Keating|Robert Keating]], who pitched one game for the 1887 Baltimore Orioles. Previously the plate was made of stone, iron, or wood.&lt;ref&gt;James, B. New Historical Baseball Abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimensions of home plate are {{convert|17|in|cm}} across the front, {{convert|8.5|in|cm}} down each side, with a triangular rear of two sides of {{convert|12|in|cm}}. The rear edges are at 45 degrees to the sides, making a point at the back.&lt;ref name="Rule1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/objectives_1.jsp|title=Official Rules: 1.00 Objectives of the Game|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plate is white and surrounded by a black strip {{convert|3/4|in|cm}} in width. The plate sits entirely in "fair" territory, with the two rear edges aligned with the right and left field foul lines. The length and angle requirements for home plate mandate that it is not a regular pentagon; it is a 17 by 8.5 inches rectangle with an isosceles triangle of base 17 inches and equal sides of 12 inches attached to the back.

{{convert|50|to|100|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} behind home plate is the [[backstop (baseball)|backstop]], which is a wall/fence that will stop [[wild pitch]]es, [[passed ball]]s, and [[foul ball]]s. In enclosed stadiums, the backstop is often composed of a lower part, which is like any other part of the wall, and an upper netting to protect spectators seated behind it; in recreational baseball fields, there is usually a tall [[chain-link fence]], including an angled top section, composing the entire backstop.

==Batter's box and catcher's box==&lt;!---"Catcher's box" and variations of that spelling redirect here. Additionally, it has been recommended to merge "Batter's box" and various spellings in this section ---&gt;
[[File:David-ortiz-batters-box.JPG|right|thumb|300px|[[David Ortiz]] (in gray) of the [[Boston Red Sox]] stands in the left-handed hitters' batter's box at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] against the [[Chicago White Sox]] on July 7, [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]].]]
The batter's box is the place where the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] stands when ready to receive a [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] from the [[pitcher]]. It is usually drawn in [[chalk]] on the dirt surrounding [[home plate]], and the insides of the boxes are watered down before each game.

The chalk lines delineating the two foul lines are rarely extended through the batter's boxes. However, those lines exist conceptually for the purpose of judging a batted ball fair or foul. In addition, inside edges of the batter's boxes are often not laid-in with chalk. Similarly, though not marked, those lines continue to exist for the purpose of the rules pertaining to the batter's box and the batter's position relative thereto.

There are two batter's boxes, one on each side of home plate. The batter's boxes are {{convert|4|ft|m|2}} wide and {{convert|6|ft|m|2}} long. The batter's boxes are centered lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each batter's box {{convert|6|in|cm}} from the near edge of home plate. A [[handedness|right-handed]] batter would stand in the batter's box on the left side of home plate from the perspective of the [[catcher]] and umpire. A left-handed batter would stand in the batter's box to their right. A batter may only occupy one batter's box at a time and may not legally leave the batter's box after the pitcher has come set or has started his windup. Should the batter wish to leave the batter's box once the pitcher has engaged the [[pitcher's plate|rubber]], he must first ask the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] for [[Time-out (sport)|time-out]]. Time will not be granted if the pitcher has already started his pitching motion. For playing rules relating to the batter's box, see Rules 6.05 and 6.06 of the [[Official Baseball Rules]].

==Foul poles==
[[File:Dsc03277.JPG|right|thumb|250px|One of two foul poles at [[Citizens Bank Park]], Philadelphia.]]
Foul poles, if present, help umpires judge whether a fly ball hit above the fence line is [[Foul ball|foul]] (out of play) or fair (a [[home run]]). The poles are a vertical extension of the foul lines at the edge of the field of play. The outer edge of the foul lines and foul poles define foul territory. Both the lines and the poles are in fair territory, in contrast to American football and basketball, where the lines marking the playing boundaries are out of bounds. The minimum distance to hit a home run (along either foul line) is set by baseball rules, generally at {{convert|325|feet|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/rules/field-dimensions |title=Field Dimensions |publisher=MLB.com |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1920,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} the foul lines extended indefinitely; a batter was awarded a home run only if a fly ball out of the field was fair where it landed, or "when last seen" by the umpire. Now, a batted ball that leaves the field in flight is judged fair or foul at the point it leaves the field. Thus, such a fly ball passing on the fair side of a foul pole, or hitting a foul pole, is a home run regardless of where the ball goes thereafter.

Foul poles are typically much higher than the top of the outfield fence or wall, and often have a narrow screen running along the fair side of the pole. This further aids the umpires' judgment, as a ball that bounces off this screen is a home run. It can still be a difficult call, especially in ballparks with no outfield stands behind the poles to provide perspective. [[Wrigley Field]] is notorious for arguments over long, curving flies down a foul line (most notably in left field) that sail higher than the foul pole.

At Major League Baseball fields, foul poles are usually yellow. Those at [[Citi Field#Features|Citi Field]] are orange. At the [[Rogers Centre]], there are no foul poles, but large nets suspended from the roof that serve the same purpose. At [[Petco Park]], there is no foul pole in left field; the pole's function is served by a yellow metal strip along the corner of the Western Metal Supply Co. building.

==Pitcher's mound==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[San Francisco Giants]] --&gt;
[[File:Baseball pitch release.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The pitcher moves forward off the rubber as the pitch is released.]]
In roughly the middle of the square, equidistant between first and third base, and a few feet closer to home plate than to second base, is a low artificial hill called the pitcher's mound. This is where the [[pitcher]] stands when throwing the [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]]. Atop the mound is a white rubber slab, called the pitcher's plate or pitcher's rubber. It measures {{convert|6|in|cm}} front-to-back and {{convert|2|ft|cm}} across, the front of which is exactly {{convert|60|ft|6|in|m}} from the rear point of home plate. This peculiar distance was set by the rule makers in 1893, not due to a clerical or surveying error as popular myth has it, but intentionally (further details under ''[[#History|History]]'').

In [[Major League Baseball]], a regulation mound is {{convert|18|ft|m}} in diameter, with the center {{convert|59|ft|m}} from the rear point of home plate, on the line between home plate and [[second base]]. The front edge of the ''pitcher's plate'' or ''rubber'' is {{convert|18|in|cm}} behind the center of the mound, making the front edge's midpoint 60 feet 6 inches from the rear point of home plate. Six inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) in front of the pitcher's rubber the mound begins to slope downward. The top of the rubber is to be no higher than ten inches (25&amp;nbsp;cm) above home plate. From 1903 through 1968, this height limit was set at {{convert|15|in|cm}}, but was often slightly higher, sometimes as high as {{convert|20|in|cm}}, especially for teams that emphasized pitching, such as the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], who were reputed to have the highest mound in the majors.

A pitcher will push off the rubber with his foot in order to gain velocity toward [[home plate]] when pitching. In addition, a higher mound generally favors the pitcher. With the height advantage, the pitcher gains more leverage and can put more downward velocity on the ball, making it more difficult for the batter to strike the ball squarely with the [[baseball bat|bat]]. The lowering of the mound in 1969 was intended to "increase the batting" once again, as pitching had become increasingly dominant, reaching its peak the prior year; 1968 is known among baseball historians as "The Year of the Pitcher." This restrictive rule apparently did its job, contributing to the hitting surge of modern baseball.

A pitcher's mound is difficult for [[groundskeeper]]s to maintain. Usually before every game it is watered down to keep the dust from spreading. On youth and amateur baseball fields, the mound may be much different from the rule book definition due to erosion and repair attempts. Even in the major leagues, each mound gains its own character, as pitchers are allowed to kick away pieces of dirt in their way, thereby sculpting the mound a bit to their preference.

The pitcher may keep a [[rosin]] bag on the rear of the mound to dry off his hands. Major League Baseball teams are also permitted [[Cleat (shoe)|cleat]] cleaners on the back of the mound. This may be a flat grate-style plate, or simply a hand tool such as a piece of wood used to remove mud and dirt from cleats. These items are allowed to remain on the backside of the mound at the discretion of the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]], thus reducing the probability that they will affect a live play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/pitcher_8.jsp|title=Official Rules|work=Major League Baseball|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseline==
A baseline is the straight line between two adjacent bases. Baselines are not drawn on the field, although the foul lines serve to mark the baseline between home plate and first base, and between third base and home.

===Running baseline===
Generally, [[baserunner|base runner]]s are not required to follow the baseline. A base runner seeking to advance more than one base typically "rounds" the base, following a more circular path. However, a base runner's left-right motion is constrained when the defense tries to [[Tag out|tag]] him. At the moment the defense begins the attempt, the baserunner's running baseline is established as a direct line from his current position to the base he is trying for. A runner straying more than {{convert|3|ft|m|0|spell=in}} away from this baseline to avoid a tag may be called out.

===Running lane===
Beginning halfway between home and first base, and ending at first base, there is a second chalk line to the right of the foul line. This second line and the part of the foul line it runs parallel to, form the running lane that defines the path in which a batter-runner must run as he is advancing to first base. Rule 6.05(k) of the [[Official Baseball Rules]] states that, if a batter-runner running to first base runs outside the running lane, and "in doing so" interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first, then the batter-runner is automatically out. First base itself is not located in the running lane, but Rule 6.05 lets the batter-runner leave the running lane "by means of a step, stride or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base" to step on first base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Baseball Explained|author=Mahony, Phillip|publisher=McFarland Books|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grass line==
[[File:Metrodome ALDS Oct 2004.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], showing a white "grass" line. ]] The grass line, where the dirt of the infield ends and the grass of the outfield begins, has no special significance to the rules of the game, but it can influence the outcome of a game. Dirt running paths between the bases (and, at one time and still in some parks, between the pitcher and the catcher) have existed since the beginning of the game, although they were not mentioned in the rule books until around 1950, and their specifications are flexible. In addition to providing a running path, the grass lines act as a visual aid so that players, [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]] and fans may better judge distance from the center of the diamond. Occasionally the ball may take a tricky bounce off the dirt area or the edge between the dirt and the grass. Multiple [[World Series]] championships (including 1924, 1960 and 1986) have been decided or heavily influenced by erratic hops of [[ground ball]]s.

In [[artificial turf]] stadiums, infield dirt was originally only placed around the bases and around the pitcher's and batting areas, which are referred to as "sliding pits."  In this configuration, the "grass line" is usually designated with a white arc. Among Major League Baseball fields, [[Rogers Centre]] was the last stadium to maintain this type of configuration and was reconfigured with a full dirt infield starting in the 2016 MLB season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto Blue Jays' new dirt infield under construction at Rogers Centre|date=February 10, 2016|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/construction-begins-new-dirt-infield-rogers-centre-1.3442659|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[college baseball]] parks with artificial turf fields, the entire field (along with possibly the pitcher's mound) is made up of turf, with parts of the field mainly containing dirt instead merely being clay-colored turf.

==Outfield==
{{anchor|outfield}}The [[outfield]] is made from thick grass or artificial turf. It is where the outfielders play. The positions to play in the outfield are right, center, and left field (named in relation to the batter's position; thus left field is beyond third base and right field is beyond first base). Outfields vary in size and shape depending on the overall size and shape of the playing field. The outfield stretches from the infield to the outfield wall and it contains the warning track. Outfields especially vary from Little League to Major League fields. Little League outfields vary more in size than Major League outfields. Outfields often differ from infields in the specific type of grass used, but most Major League outfields are grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballpilgrimages.com/grass-at-major-league-ballparks.html|title=Major League Baseball Ballpark Grass and Turf|website=www.baseballpilgrimages.com|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warning track==
[[File:Outfield warning track from the right field line, Husky Field - Baseball.JPG|thumb|right|The warning track abutting the outfield fence of Husky Field, used by the Houston Baptist Huskies baseball team]]
The warning track is the strip of dirt at the edges of the baseball field (especially in front of the home run fence and along the left and right sides of a field). Because the warning track's color and feel differ from the grass field, a fielder can remain focused on a fly ball near the fence and measure his proximity to the fence while attempting to catch the ball safely.

A warning track's width is not specified in the rules. It is generally designed to give about three steps of warning to the highest-level players using the field. Typical widths run from about six feet for Little League fields to about {{convert|10|-|15|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} for college- or professional-level play. A warning track this wide also lets groundskeepers avoid driving maintenance vehicles on the grass.

The track can be composed of finely ground rock particles such as cinders, which is why announcer [[Bob Wolff]] called it the "cinder path" rather than the "warning track."

The idea of a warning track originated in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], where an actual running track was built for use in track and field events. When ballpark designers saw how the track helped fielders, it soon became a feature of every ballpark.

Single-minded fielders often crash into a wall trying to make a catch despite the warning track. For this reason, outfield walls are typically padded for extra safety. [[Wrigley Field]]'s brick wall is covered only by ivy, which is not especially soft. However, there are pads on the walls of the tight left and right field corners in foul ground.

''Warning-track power'' is a derogatory term for a batter who seems to have just enough power to hit the ball to the warning track for an out, but not enough to hit a home run. The term more generally refers to someone or something that is almost but not quite good enough for something.

==Outfield wall==
[[File:Green Monster 2006.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Green Monster]] in 2006, showing the manual scoreboard and Green Monster seating, and more recent additions, including charity advertisements along the top, billboards above the Green Monster seating, and the [[American League East]] standings.]]
[[File:Jacob's Field Fultz and Betancourt in the Bullpen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pitchers warming up in the bullpen]]

The outfield wall or outfield fence is the wall or fence that marks the outer boundary of the outfield. A ball passing over the wall is [[dead ball|dead]]; if it passes over the wall in [[fair territory]] while [[in flight]], it is a home run. The official rules do not specify the shape, height, or composition of the wall, or a specific mandatory distance from home plate (though Major League Baseball mandates a minimum distance of {{convert|250|ft|m}} and recommends a minimum distance of {{convert|320|ft|m}} at the foul poles and {{convert|400|ft|m}} at center field). As a result, baseball fields can vary greatly along those lines. The wall has numbers affixed or painted on it that denote the distance from that point on the wall to home plate. In most modern major league ballparks, the wall is made of some hard material (e.g., concrete, plywood, sheet metal) with padding on the field side to protect players who may collide with the wall at high speed while trying to make a play. [[Chain link fencing]] may also be incorporated into the wall in areas where the wall needs to be transparent, e.g., an outfield [[bullpen]], a spectator area behind the wall, or to protect a [[scoreboard]] incorporated into the wall. Many ballparks feature a yellow line denoting the top of the wall to aid umpires in judging whether the ball passed over the wall or if the ball is fair or foul.

==Bullpen==
{{main|Bullpen}}
The bullpen (sometimes referred to as simply "the 'pen") is the area where pitchers warm up before entering a game. Depending on the ballpark, it may be situated in foul territory along the baselines or just beyond the outfield fence. Relief pitchers usually wait in the bullpen when they have yet to play in a game, rather than in the [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] with the rest of the team. The starting pitcher also makes his final pregame warmups in the bullpen. Managers can call coaches in the bullpen on an [[hotline|in-house telephone]] from the dugout to tell a certain pitcher to begin his warmup tosses.
"Bullpen" is also used [[metonymy|metonymically]] to describe a team's collection of relief pitchers.

==On-deck circles==
{{main|On-deck}}
There are two on-deck circles in the field, one for each team, positioned in foul ground between home plate and the respective teams' benches. They are technically known as next-batter's boxes. The on-deck circle is where the next scheduled batter, or "on-deck" batter, warms up while waiting for the current batter to finish his turn. The on-deck circle is either an area composed of bare dirt; a plain circle painted onto artificial turf; or often, especially at the professional level, a mat made from artificial material, with the team or league logo painted onto it.

==Coach's boxes==
The [[coach's box]]es, located behind first and third base, are where the first and third base [[coach (baseball)|coaches]] are supposed to stand, although coaches often stand outside the box. This is permissible as long as the coach does not interfere with play and the opposing team does not object (in which case the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] shall ensure that all coaches on both teams must abide by the boundaries of the coach's boxes). The coach's boxes are marked with chalk or paint. In the early days of baseball, the term "coacher's box" was used, as "coach" was taken to be a verb. As the term "coach" evolved into a noun, the name of the box also changed.

==History==
{{Original research section|date=May 2012}}
The basic layout of the diamond has been little changed since the original [[Knickerbocker Rules]] of the 1840s. The distance between bases was already established as {{convert|90|ft|m|2}}, which it remains. Through trial and error, 90 feet had been settled upon as the optimal distance. 100 feet would have given too much advantage to the defense, and 80 feet too much to the offense.

The original Knickerbocker Rules did not specify the pitching distance explicitly. By the time major league baseball began in the 1870s, the pitcher was compelled to pitch from within a "box" whose front edge was {{convert|45|ft|m}} from the "point" of home plate. Although he had to release the ball before crossing the line, as with bowlers in [[cricket]], he also had to start his delivery from within the box; he could not run in from the field as bowlers do. Furthermore, the pitcher had to throw underhand. By the 1880s, pitchers had mastered the underhand delivery—in fact, in 1880, there were two [[perfect game]]s within a week of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/boxscore/06121880.shtml|title=Lee Richmond Perfect Game Box Score by Baseball Almanac|work=baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to "increase the batting," the front edge of the pitcher's box was moved back 5 feet in 1881, to {{convert|50|ft|m}} from home plate. The size of the box was altered over the following few years. Pitchers were allowed to throw overhand starting in 1884, and that tilted the balance of power again. In 1887, the box was set at {{convert|4|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|5.5|ft|m}} deep, with the front edge still 50 feet from the plate. However, the pitcher was compelled to deliver the ball with his back foot at the {{convert|55.5|ft|m|adj=on}} line of the box, thus somewhat restricting his ability to "power" the ball with his overhand delivery.&lt;ref name=Lansch&gt;{{cite book|title=Glory Fades Away|author=Lansch, Jerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}}

In 1893, the box was replaced by the pitcher's plate, although "the box" is still used today as a slang term for the pitcher's location on the field. Exactly 5 feet was added to the point the pitcher had to toe, again "to increase the batting" (and hopefully to increase attendance, as fan interest had flagged somewhat), resulting in the seemingly peculiar pitching distance of {{convert|60.5|ft|m|2}}.&lt;ref name=Lansch/&gt;{{rp|230}}

Many sources suggest that the pitching distance evolved from 45 to 50 to 60.5 feet. However, the first two were the "release point" and the third is the "pushoff point," so the 1893 increase was not quite as dramatic as is often implied; that is, the 1893 rule change added only 5 feet to the release point, not 10.5 feet.

Originally the pitcher threw from flat ground, but over time the raised mound was developed, somewhat returning the advantage to the pitchers. Before the mid-20th century, it was common for baseball fields to include a dirt pathway between the pitcher's mound and home plate. This feature is sometimes known as the "keyhole" due to the shape that it makes together with the mound. The keyhole was once as wide as the pitcher's box and resembled a [[cricket pitch]]. Sometimes this path extended through the batting area and all the way to the backstop. Once the rounded pitcher's mound was developed, the path became more ornamental than practical, and was gradually thinned before being largely abandoned by the 1950s. In recent years some ballparks, such as [[Comerica Park]] and [[Chase Field]] in the major leagues, have revived the feature for nostalgic reasons.

[[File:Game 3 of the 2006 NBA Finals.jpg|thumb|right|The home court of the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]]] In [[basketball]], the '''basketball court''' is the playing surface, consisting of a rectangular floor with baskets at either end. In professional or organized basketball, especially when played indoors, it is usually made out of a [[wood]], often [[maple]], and highly polished and completed with a 10 foot rim. Outdoor surfaces are generally made from standard paving materials such as [[concrete]] or [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]].

== Dimensions ==
Basketball courts come in different sizes. In the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the court is {{convert|94|by|50|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. Under [[FIBA|International Basketball Federation]] (FIBA) rules,&lt;ref name="FIBA2006Rules"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.fiba.com/asp_includes/download.asp?file_id=328 | title = Official Basketball Rules 2006 | format = pdf | work =  | publisher = [[FIBA|International Basketball Federation]] | accessdate = 2007-04-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070406072645/http://www.fiba.com/asp_includes/download.asp?file_id=328| archivedate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the court is minutely smaller, measuring exactly {{convert|28|by|15|meters|ft|sigfig=3}}. In amateur basketball, court sizes vary widely. The baskets are always {{convert|10|ft|m|sigfig=3}} above the floor (except possibly in youth competition). Basketball courts have a three-point arc at both baskets. A basket made from behind this arc is worth three points; a basket made from within this line, or with a player's foot touching the line, is worth 2 points. The free-throw line, where one stands while taking a foul shot, is located within the three-point arc at 15 feet from the basket. A foul shot is worth 1 point, but if a shot is made from the foul line while in play it is still worth 2 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wissel|first=Hal|title=Basketball: steps to success|year=1994|publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc.|location=United States|isbn=0-7360-5500-2|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections==
[[File:Basketball terms.png|thumb|300px|Most important terms related to the basketball court]]
===Center circle===
The only two players permitted to enter this area prior to the tipoff are the players contesting the jump ball (usually but not always centers). Both players jump when the referee throws the ball in the air, each attempting to tap the ball into the hands of a player of their own team.

===Three-point line===
The three-point line is the line that separates the two-point area from the [[three-point field goal|three-point area]]; any shot converted beyond this line counts as three points. If the shooting player steps on the line, it is counted as two points. Any foul made in the act of shooting beyond the three-point line would give the player three [[free throws]] if the shot does not go in, and one if it does.

The distance to the [[three-point field goal|three-point]] line from the center of the basket varies depending on the level or league, and has changed several times. These are the current distances, with the league or level using each distance:

* 19.75&amp;nbsp;ft (6.02 m): High School
* 20.75&amp;nbsp;ft (6.32 m): NCAA
* 21.65&amp;nbsp;ft (6.60 m) to 22.15&amp;nbsp;ft (6.75 m): WNBA and FIBA
* 22&amp;nbsp;ft (6.71 m) to 23.75&amp;nbsp;ft (7.24 m): NBA

The NBA adopted the three-point line at the start of the [[1979–80 NBA season|1979–80 season]]. This is of variable distance, ranging from {{convert|22|ft|m}} in the corners to {{convert|23.75|ft|m}} behind the top of the key. During the 1994–95, 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons, the NBA attempted to address decreased scoring by shortening the overall distance of the line to a uniform {{convert|22|ft|m}} around the basket. It was moved back to its original distance after the 1996–97 season. FIBA and the NCAA both adopted the three-point line in 1985.

In most high school associations in the United States, the distance is 19.75 feet. This was formerly the distance for [[college basketball]] as well. On May 26, 2007, the NCAA playing rules committee agreed to move the three-point line back one foot to 20.75 feet for the men. This rule went into effect for the 2008–2009 season. The three-point line for women (NCAA) moved back one foot to 20.75 feet at the start of the 2011–2012 season.

The international distance, used in most countries outside the United States and in [[FIBA]] and [[WNBA]] competition, is currently 6.6&amp;nbsp;m (21.65&amp;nbsp;ft) to 6.75&amp;nbsp;m (22.15&amp;nbsp;ft).

===Perimeter===
The perimeter is defined as the areas outside the free throw lane and inside the three-point line. Shots converted (successfully made) from this area are called "perimeter shots" or "medium-range shots."
If a player's foot is on the three-point line, the shot is considered a perimeter shot.

===Low post area===
The low post is defined as the areas that are closest to the basket but outside of the free throw lane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbaballers.org/BasketballGlossary/Basketball-Glossary-L.html Basketball Glossary Terms, Definition, Lane violation, Low post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430102709/http://nbaballers.org/BasketballGlossary/Basketball-Glossary-L.html |date=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is fundamental to strategy in basketball. Skilled low post players can score many points per game without ever taking a [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]].

=== Key ===
The [[key (basketball)|key]], free throw lane or shaded lane refers to the usually painted area beneath the basket; for the NBA it is {{convert|16|ft|m}} wide, for the NCAA it is {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide; for both instances it extends {{convert|15|ft|m}} from the backboard. At the top of the rectangle is the [[free throw]] line, behind which players shoot uncontested shots when they're fouled. A circle is drawn around the free-throw line with a {{convert|6|ft|m}} [[radius]]; this is used for jump ball instances, as is done at the [[#Center circle|center circle]].  Two 6-inch hash lines, 3&amp;nbsp;ft from the free throw lane line and 5&amp;nbsp;ft 8 in from the free throw line, show the lower defensive box linked to the restricted area.

For FIBA tournaments, since October 2010 the key has been a rectangle 4.9 m wide and 5.8 m long. Previously it was a trapezoid 3.7 meters (12&amp;nbsp;ft) wide at the free-throw line and 6 meters (19 feet and 6.25&amp;nbsp;inches) at the end line.

The key is primarily used to prevent players from staying beneath the basket of the opponents' team for long periods (maximum three seconds).

The restricted area arc is a semi-circular arc drawn around the area directly underneath the basket. With some exceptions, members of the defending team cannot draw charging fouls in this area.
The restricted arc in all North American rule sets above high school level ([[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] men's and women's, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]) has a radius 4 feet (1.22 m) from below the center of the basket. The restricted area arc rule first appeared at any level of basketball in the NBA in the 1997-98 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factuation.com/shaq-and-the-no-charge-zone-rule/ |title=Shaq and the No Charge Zone Rule |publisher=Factuation |date=July 1, 2015 |website=Factuation |access-date=February 27, 2018 |quote=In the 1997-1998 season, NBA added the “no charge zone” or the “restricted area”. This is the portion of the key, denoted by an arc in the painted area that is positioned four feet from the basket. The arc is important because a defending player can not force a charging foul within this area. It was designed to provide benefit offensive post-up player like [Shaquille] O’Neal, players who drive to the basket and limit collisions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAA restricted area arc was originally established for the 2011–12 men's and women's seasons at a {{conv|3|ft|adj=on}} radius from below the center of the basket, and was extended to match the (W)NBA radius for the 2015–16 season and beyond.

===Other lines===
On NBA floors, two hash marks are drawn at the end lines near the key to mark the area known as the lower defensive box. A defensive player is allowed to draw a charging foul within the restricted arc if the offensive player receives the ball and/or starts his drive within this area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/nba101/misunderstood_0708.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, two lines are drawn on each of the sidelines, 28 feet from each of the endlines, which designates the extent of the coaching box and bench. This line marks the farthest extent a coach (aside from the sidelines) can stand. Directly behind this area is the team bench.

On the half-court line of NBA floors two lines extend outside the playing court, designating the place where substitutes wait before they can enter the playing court; directly behind this area are the various off-court officials such as the timekeeper and reserve referee.

===FIBA changes===

On April 26, 2008, FIBA announced several major rules changes involving the court markings. These changes took effect for major international competitions on October 1, 2010, after that year's World Championships [[2010 FIBA World Championship|for men]] and [[2010 FIBA World Championship for Women|women]], and became mandatory for other competitions on October 1, 2012 (although national federations could adopt the new markings before 2012). The changes were as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/lateNews/p/newsid/24352/arti.html |title=The FIBA Central Board approves historic rule changes |publisher=FIBA |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2008-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080430210952/http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/lateNews/p/newsid/24352/arti.html| archivedate= 30 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The shape of the key changed from a trapezoid to a rectangle as it is in the NBA, with NBA dimensions.
* The three-point line moved back to 6.75 meters (22&amp;nbsp;ft 1.7 in) from 6.25 meters (20&amp;nbsp;ft 6.1 in), compared to {{convert|23|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}} for the NBA at the top of the arc.
* The FIBA adopted the NBA's restricted area arc with a marginally wider radius of 1.25 meters (4&amp;nbsp;ft 1.2 in).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3624">The '''blood rule''' is a rule used in many [[sports]] that states that an athlete that receives an [[open wound]], is bleeding, or who has [[blood]] on them or their clothes, must immediately leave the playing area to receive medical attention.&lt;ref name="MelbourneCitySports"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melbournecitysports.ymca.org.au/index_general.asp?menuid=100.220 |title=Blood Rule |publisher=Melbourne City Sports |accessdate=2007-07-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624161059/http://www.melbournecitysports.ymca.org.au/index_general.asp?menuid=100.220 |archivedate=2007-06-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they may be able to play again later, they cannot go back and play again until the wound is taken care of, bleeding has stopped, and all contaminated [[Sports equipment|equipment]] has been replaced.&lt;ref name="smartplay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplay.net/ouch/injuries/blood/bloodinfo.html|title=The Blood Rule|publisher=Smartplay|accessdate=2007-07-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616031710/http://www.smartplay.net/ouch/injuries/blood/bloodinfo.html|archivedate=2007-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main concern addressed by this rule is the spread of [[infectious diseases]] like [[Human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), [[Hepatitis]], and other diseases that can be spread through the contact of blood.&lt;ref name="smartplay" /&gt;

Though there are two options that can be chosen: the first option is that the player be [[wiktionary:substituted|substituted]] and play resumes, or the official can halt play until the player has returned, the [[wiktionary:former|former]] being the most commonly chosen.&lt;ref name="Footy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footy.com.au/dags/FAQ1v1-5.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Australian Rules Football|publisher=Footy.com.au|accessdate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[National Rugby League]], the latter option is first employed; play stops whilst the player's medical staff attends to the wound. If the bleeding is not stanched to the referee's satisfaction, the player must then leave the field for further attention.  In sports such as [[association football]], a player may leave the field without being substituted immediately, his team playing short-handed until he re-enters play, is replaced, or the match ends (if the injury cannot be satisfactorily healed and the team is out of substitutions).

If a player refuses to leave even though an official requests they do so this occurs, the official will stop play, and if the player continues to stay after play has ceased, the official will enforce the rules for accompanying [[Sports league|league]], which may include forfeiture of the game.

Some sports where this is used are [[Australian Rules Football]],&lt;ref name="Footy" /&gt; [[NCAA Baseball]],&lt;ref name="NCAABaseball"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.ncaa.org/membership/champadmin/baseball/umpiring/2004/RulesChanges04.pdf|title=2004 Baseball Rules Changes and Points of Emphasis|publisher=[[NCAA]]|accessdate=2007-07-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222750/http://www1.ncaa.org/membership/champadmin/baseball/umpiring/2004/RulesChanges04.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major American sports leagues]] like the [[National Hockey League]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, [[National Basketball Association]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, and [[Major League Soccer]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}.

{{wikinews|Borussia Dortmund's team bus hit with explosives before Champions League match, Marc Bartra injured}}
On 11 April 2017, the tour bus of German football team [[Borussia Dortmund]] was attacked with [[roadside bomb]]s in [[Dortmund]], Germany. Three bombs exploded as the bus ferried the team to the [[Westfalenstadion]] for the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League knockout phase#Borussia Dortmund v Monaco|first leg of their quarter-final]] against [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]]. One of the team's players, [[Marc Bartra]], and a policeman were wounded, but the strengthened windows of the bus prevented further casualties.

The initial line of inquiry assumed that it was an [[Islamic terrorism|Islamist terrorist]] attack due to letters found at the scene, which claimed the attack was an act of retaliation for Muslims killed in the [[German intervention against ISIL|German military intervention]] against [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], and threatened further attacks unless Germany withdraws and the [[Ramstein Air Base|US military base in Ramstein]] is shut down. However, discrepancies in the evidence eventually led investigators to consider it a [[false flag]] attack. Additional claims of responsibility, supposedly from far-left and far-right groups, were also investigated.

On 21 April 2017, German police arrested a man on suspicion of planting bombs to drive down the Borussia Dortmund share price and profit by [[Warrant (finance)|put warrants]] he bought prior to the attack.&lt;ref name="guardian-21apr"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/21/dortmund-bus-attack-suspect-arrested-as-police-allege-share-dealing-plot|title=Dortmund attack: man arrested on suspicion of share-dealing plot|date=21 April 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 April 2017|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bombing==
The team bus of [[Borussia Dortmund]] was attacked with three homemade [[pipe bomb]]s while on its way to [[Westfalenstadion]] in [[Dortmund]]. The bombs were hidden in hedges by the roadside and detonated at around 19:15 [[Central_European_Summer_Time|local time]] (17:15 [[UTC]]).&lt;ref name="bvbannounce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; They were packed with sharp metal pins and had a reach of about 100 meters (109 yards). Based on the type of detonator and explosive involved, German authorities assume "terrorist involvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/12/europe/dortmund-explosion-germany/index.html|title=Dortmund bus attack: 1 detained, 'terrorist involvement' suspected|website=CNN|access-date=12 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombs used military detonators and the explosives may have come from military stocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/dortmund-attack-explosive-from-german-military-media/a-38439498 "Dortmund attack explosive 'from German military' - media"].

At the time, the bus was on its way to the first leg of Borussia Dortmund's [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|2016–17 UEFA Champions League]] quarter-final against [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] at the [[Signal Iduna Park]]; the match was rescheduled for the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/explosionen-vor-champions-league-spiel-anschlag-auf-borussia-dortmund-gibt-ermittlern-raetsel-auf/19661954.html|title=Anschlag auf Borussia Dortmund gibt Ermittlern Rätsel auf|access-date=12 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The German police and state lawyers are treating it as attempted murder and a planned attack on [[Borussia Dortmund]]. There were three claims of responsibility: one left at the scene claiming an Islamist motive, one posted on the internet claiming an 'anti-fascist' motive&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/borussia-dortmund-ermittler-pruefen-zwei-bekennerschreiben-a-1143004.html|title=Anschlag auf BVB-Bus: Ermittler prüfen zwei Bekennerschreiben - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Panorama|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was deemed to be fake),&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and one later sent to a newspaper claiming a far-right motive. The German Federal Prosecutor's Office initially called the attack an act of terrorism with possible Islamist involvement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/bvb-anschlag-in-dortmund-zwei-verdaechtige-eine-festnahme-1.3462381|title=Anschlag in Dortmund: Zwei Verdächtige, eine Festnahme|date=11 April 2017|work=sueddeutsche.de|access-date=12 April 2017|language=de|issn=0174-4917}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interior Minister of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] called the attack "professional".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/keine-beweise-gegen-verdaechtigen-von-bvb-anschlag-gefunden-14970683.html|title=Anschlag auf Fußballmannschaft: NRW-Innenminister: Bomben auf BVB-Bus waren sehr professionell|date=13 April 2017|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|access-date=13 April 2017|language=de-DE|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police are investigating whether it was an attack by Islamists, by the far-left or by the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/dortmund-bombe-gegen-bvb-bus-laut-ralf-jaeger-professionell-gebaut-a-1143291.html|title=NRW-Innenminister Jäger über Anschlag in Dortmund: "Die Sprengkraft war enorm" - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Panorama|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to German media, investigators are also considering whether a foreign security service was behind the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/new-message-claims-responsibility-for-dortmund-blast/a-38433218 "New message claims responsibility for Dortmund blast"]. ''[[Die Welt]]''. 15 April 2017. Retrieved 17 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of responsibility===
There were three differing claims of responsibility. The first claim was found in three identical letters left at the scene. The letters said the attack was retaliation for [[German intervention against ISIL|German military intervention]] against [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] (ISIS) in [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]], accusing it of being responsible for killing Muslims. It demanded that the [[Ramstein Air Base|US military base in Ramstein]] be shut down and the German [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado jets]] be withdrawn from Syria. It threatened further attacks on non-Muslim celebrities in Germany unless the demands are met.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/12/borussia-dortmund-blasts-police-investigate-islamist-link-to-attack|title=Borussia Dortmund blasts: suspect 'from Islamist spectrum' detained|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|date=12 April 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=12 April 2017|last2=Connolly|first2=Kate|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were seen as unusual, as previous ISIS-linked attacks in Europe did not come with such confessions. Unlike previous video claims of responsibility, the letters directly addressed the German chancellor and had no religious justifications, ISIS logo, or signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/bvb-das-raetselhafte-bekennerschreiben-von-dortmund-a-1143121.html|title=Anschlag auf Mannschaftsbus: Das ungewöhnliche Bekennerschreiben von Dortmund - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Panorama|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; German newspapers later reported that investigators had "significant doubts" over the letters' authenticity, and suggested they may have been written to frame Islamists.&lt;ref name=letters&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39603467|title=Borussia Dortmund bombs: Letters at scene 'not from Islamists'|work=BBC News|date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/borussia-dortmund-football-attack-explosion-terrorism-islam-extremism-doubts-frauke-koehler-a7684651.html|title=Major doubts about letters claiming Islamist motive for Dortmund attack|last=Mortimer|first=Caroline|publisher=The Independent|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim was posted on the left-wing, open-publishing website [[IndyMedia]]. It said the attack was committed because Borussia Dortmund did not do enough against racists, Nazis, and right-wing populists within its fanbase.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The claim was removed as fake, and police also treated it as fake.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faktenfinder.tagesschau.de/bvb-fake-bekennerschreiben-101.html|title=Anschlag auf BVB: Ist Antifa-Bekennerschreiben ein Fake?|last=tagesschau.de|website=tagesschau.de|language=de-DE|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A few days later, a third claim of responsibility was sent to the newspaper ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', which hinted at a far-right motive. The anonymous e-mail praised [[Adolf Hitler]] and attacked [[multiculturalism]], adding that the attack was a "last warning".&lt;ref name=letters/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independentprosecutors&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dortmund-attack-bombing-borussia-team-bus-bvb-isis-terror-right-wing-extremists-claim-responsibility-a7685281.html|title=Prosecutors are investigating if Dortmund bombing could have been the work of right-wing extremists|date=15 April 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=15 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutors said the claim was being investigated.&lt;ref name=Localprobe/&gt; The letter also threatened another attack on protesters who plan to demonstrate against the [[Alternative for Germany]] party's conference in Cologne in 22 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/16/german-police-investigate-far-right-link-dortmund-bombing/|title=German police investigate far-Right link to Dortmund bombing|work=The Telegraph|access-date=19 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police also considered the possibility that the attack was carried out by the [[Far-right politics in Germany|far-right]] in order to incite backlash against Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pancevski|first1=Bojan|title=Dortmund attackers wanted to incite backlash against Muslims|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/66a34b32-21e6-11e7-84e8-86f619ed3761|website=The Times|accessdate=19 April 2017|date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspects===
{{wikinews|28-year-old suspect charged for attacking Borussia Dortmund's team bus}}
In the initial stage of the investigation, the police identified two suspects and arrested one of them. The apartments of both suspects were searched.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The arrested suspect was an [[Iraq]]i immigrant living in [[Wuppertal]] and was suspected of being an Islamist extremist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2017-04/anschlag-bvb-bus-dortmund-live|title=Anschlag auf BVB-Bus: Ein verdächtiger Islamist festgenommen|last=Gaul|first=Simone|date=12 April 2017|work=Die Zeit|access-date=12 April 2017|last2=Breitinger|first2=Matthias|issn=0044-2070|last3=Beyer|first3=Tim|last4=Fritsch|first4=Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/anschlag-auf-bvb-bus-polizei-nimmt-einen-verdaechtigen-fest-14969298.html|title=Nach Anschlag auf BVB-Bus: Festgenommener Tatverdächtiger soll Iraker aus Wuppertal sein|date=12 April 2017|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|access-date=12 April 2017|language=de-DE|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police believe he led an ISIS unit in [[Iraq]] involved in killings, kidnappings, smuggling, and extortion.&lt;ref name="ind1304"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Borussia Dortmund: German police call bombing suspect 'Isis member' as they issue arrest warrant|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/borussia-dortmund-latest-suspect-isis-member-germany-police-charge-bombing-bus-nails-football-team-a7681506.html|work=The Independent|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tel1304"&gt;{{Cite news|title= 'Isil terrorist' suspect held in connection with Borussia Dortmund bombing |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/13/borussia-dortmund-blastsgerman-prosecutors-say-no-evidence-sole/|work=The Telegraph|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, police later concluded he was not responsible for the Dortmund bombing.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/dortmund-haftbefehl-gegen-verdaechtigen-nach-bvb-anschlag-beantragt-a-1143219.html|title=Nach Anschlag in Dortmund: Haftbefehl gegen Verdächtigen erlassen - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Panorama|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Localprobe&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany probes new message claiming Dortmund attack|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20170415/germany-probes-new-letter-claiming-dortmund-attack|work=Agence-France Presse|date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April 2017, the federal prosecutor announced that it had arrested a 28-year-old German-Russian citizen, identified only as Sergej W., on suspicion of 20-fold attempted murder, bringing about an illegal detonation of explosives, and aggravated battery. The man had been staying at the Borussia team hotel. He planted explosives along the road where the team bus would later leave to the stadium. During check-in, he chose a room with a window facing the road so he would be able to remotely trigger the explosion when the bus passed by. It was revealed that on the day of the attack, he had bought [[Warrant (finance)|put warrants]] for €78,000 from an investment bank using the internet connection in his hotel room. These would have made him a large profit of up to €3.9&amp;nbsp;million if Dortmund's share price were to plummet after a successful attack, but it only dropped by 5% after the attack and later recovered. The unusual transaction raised suspicion of [[money laundering]] with bank employees, prompting them to alert authorities and pass to them the identity of Sergej W., which led to his arrest. Police also said Sergej W. left letters at the scene of the crime to frame Muslims for the attack.&lt;ref name="guardian-21apr" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The match was postponed until the following day at 18:45 [[Central European Summer Time|local time]] (16:45 UTC), which resulted in a 3–2 win for Monaco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uefa.org/about-uefa/news/newsid=2457177.html|title=UEFA statement on Dortmund incident|date=11 April 2017|work=UEFA|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both Monaco and Dortmund fans united in friendship after the bombing.

[[File:Bulls_Ishikawa,_Okinawa_2007.jpg|thumb|''Tōgyū'', or "Okinawan bullfighting", is a traditional sport of [[Japan]].]]
'''Bull wrestling''', '''cow fighting''' or '''bull fighting''' is a non-lethal [[bloodsport]] between [[bull]]s or [[cow]]s found in some parts of the world.

==Balkans==
[[File:Sanski Most Korida 2011 006.JPG|thumb|Korida in [[Sanski Most]], Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
''Korida'', from ''corrida'', or ''borbe bikova'' ("fights of bulls") is a traditional sport in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]]. 

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
[[Grmeč]], a mountain in the extreme west of [[Bosnia]], is the best-known site of bullfights in the [[Balkans]]. They are called the ''Korida of Grmeč'' (''Grmečka korida'') and have been organised on every first Sunday in August for over 200 years, attracting thousands of visitors. These are fights between bulls themselves and there is no death of a bull. Fights happen in an empty field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlasobscura.com/place/bullfights-of-grmec |title=Bullfights of Grmec |work=Atlas Obscura |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The korida of [[Grmeč]] was depicted by the sculptor [[Slobodan Pejić]]. The sculpture of two bulls in a fight, made in bronze in 2004, has been compared to a confrontation of the oppressor and the oppressed or of the Bosnian people and the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sl icon}} Vanda Mušič (ed).

===Croatia===
In Croatia, koridas are traditionally organized in [[Dalmatian Hinterland]] region. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=Nepoznata atrakcija u Hrvatskoj: Borbe bikova {{!}} Panorama {{!}} DW {{!}} 26.07.2017|url=http://www.dw.com/bs/nepoznata-atrakcija-u-hrvatskoj-borbe-bikova/a-39837182|website=DW.COM|language=bs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
Bull wrestling in Turkey is known as ''[[:tr:Boğa güreşi#T.C3.BCrkiye.27de bo.C4.9Fa g.C3.BCre.C5.9Fi|boğa güreşi]]'' (literally "bull wrestling"). Each year in the third week of June, the Kafkasör (Caucasus) festival takes place in the city of [[Artvin]]. At the beginning of the festival, certain rules are applied in order to save the bulls from injury. For example, if a bull retreats from the fight, it means defeat, etc.&lt;ref name="Darke2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diana Darke|title=Eastern Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9WwsQE6AJ4C&amp;pg=PA334|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=2011|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-339-9|pages=334–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Tōgyū]]'', or "Okinawan bullfighting", is the traditional sport of the [[Ryukyu Islands]], in which two bulls attempt, as in [[sumo wrestling]], to push one another out of a ring.&lt;ref name="University1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Sered Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology Bar-Ilan University|title=Women of the Sacred Groves : Divine Priestesses of Okinawa: Divine Priestesses of Okinawa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0wIW7d8G1sC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=15 September 2013|date=12 February 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-535233-7|pages=119–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Bullfighting is also observed by the ethnic Hmong/Miao minority in China, Vietnam and Laos. Bulls are selected by age, horn length and size. They are enticed to fight usually after new year's or summer events. They are usually non-lethal events and bulls that carry the opposing bulls will get the most points if it is a draw. The loser is usually the bull that flees first even if winning.

==South Asia==
''Dhiri'' or ''Dhirio'' ([[Konkani language|Konkani]]: धिरी,धिरयो) is a popular form of traditional bull wrestling in the state of [[Goa]], [[Coastal South West India]]. It was the weekend entertainment staple for most villages. Many families lived off the earnings made on appearance money and bets alone.&lt;ref name=dhiri&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamat Maad|first1=Govind|title=Dhirio: Bullish about a banned fight|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Dhirio-Bullish-about-a-banned-fight/articleshow/3625723.cms|accessdate=26 April 2015|agency=TNN|publisher=The times of India|date=Oct 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Panaji]] Bench of the high Court vide order dated 20.12.96 directed the State Government to take immediate steps to ban all types of animal fights including Dhiri organised in the State of Goa, which was finally banned in 1997.&lt;ref name=panaji&gt;{{cite book|last1=India.

House of the People|title=Lok Sabha Debates|date=1998|publisher=Lok Sabha Secretariat|page=152|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhiri bullfights are still very popular in Goa despite the ban. There have been demands for legalizing Dhiri.&lt;ref name=heraldo&gt;{{cite news|title=UGDP claims credit for legalising dhirios|url=http://www.heraldgoa.in/Goa/The-Sunday-Roundtable/ugdp-claims-credit-for-legalising-dhirios/25299.html|accessdate=26 April 2015|publisher=O Heraldo|date=26 Mar 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
On 17 October 1987, during its 10th session, the [[Muslim World League|Islamic Council]] discussed the practices of bullfighting and animal pits (where two or more animals are agitated and forced to fight each other for the sole purpose of entertainment), and issued a [[fatwa]] that both are considered [[haraam]] (forbidden by Allah) due to their cruel nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/134 حكم الملاكمة ومصارعة الثيران والمصارعة الحرة |&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written by [[Tommy Walker (events director)|Tommy Walker]] while a junior at the [[University of Southern California]] in the fall of 1946.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Paul Collins (American writer)|Paul Collins]] |coauthors= |title=You Say It's Your Birthday|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2298271/ |quote=Wikipedia entries since 2007 attributed the song to 1940s University of Southern California composer Tommy Walker—a contention bolstered by a link to Sports Illustrated's online archive, which featured Walker's own story of the tune's composition with co-writer Dick Winslow. |newspaper=[[Slate magazine]] |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fanfare consists of six notes followed by rooters shouting, "Charge!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136204/index.htm|title=Give Him Credit For The Charge|date=November 12, 1990|accessdate=April 12, 2011|last=Anderson|first=Bruce|journal=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally, the fanfare is repeated one or more times in the same key or in successively higher keys, or is preceded by a lead-in vamp.

In 1958 the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] moved to [[Los Angeles]] and in the spring of 1959 the Dodgers put on sale, at $1.50 apiece, 20,000 toy trumpets capable of playing the six notes of the "Charge" fanfare.  The fanfare was heard in NBC broadcasts of games 3, 4 and 5 of the [[1959 World Series]] between the Dodgers and the [[Chicago White Sox]].

It also appeared in the original ''[[The Flintstones]]'' 1960s television cartoon series (episode dates uncertain), followed by "Charge!" or "Charge it!", shouted by characters (typically [[Wilma Flintstone]] and [[Betty Rubble]]) on the way to a shopping spree.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; [[Scrappy-Doo]], a character that appeared in the 1980s incarnations of the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise, also regularly used the fanfare as a lead-in to his catchphrase, "puppy power!"{{or|date=August 2015}}  The fanfare was incorporated into the jingles used on ''[[Scott Shannon]]'s Rockin American Top 30 Countdown'' which ran from 1984 through 1992. In the [[first person shooter]] video game ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', the character Bastion makes a noise similar to this fanfare when it uses its ultimate ability.

Bobby Kent, former musical director of the [[San Diego Chargers]], has claimed he invented the "Charge" fanfare in 1978 while working for the Chargers.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia-Roberts|first=Gus|title=Bobby Kent Claims He Invented "Da Da Da Da Da Da Charge!" And Wants to Cash In|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2011/04/bobby_kent_claims_he_invented.php|publisher=Miami New Times|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kent filed suit against [[ASCAP]] for negotiating licenses with [[MLB]], [[NFL]], [[NBA]], [[NHL]], [[NCAA]] and [[NASCAR]] while failing to secure his consent. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] settled with Kent for $3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calcaterra|first=Craig|title=The guy who composed "da-da-da-da-da-da … Charge!" is suing everyone|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/04/19/the-guy-who-composed-da-da-da-da-da-da-charge-is-suing-everyone/|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kent's claim can be disproven by the fact that Frank Leahy, the Chargers' first general manager in 1960, chose the name "Chargers" after the already existing fanfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchise nicknames|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/franchise-nicknames/|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|date=January 1, 2005|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Concussion]]s and other types of repetitive play-related head blows in [[American football]] have been shown to be the cause of [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), which has led to player deaths and other debilitating symptoms after retirement, including memory loss, [[depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, headaches, and also sleep disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=concussions|last=Meehan III|first=William|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9781440838941|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of NFL players with chronic traumatic encephalopathy|list of ex-NFL players]] that have either been diagnosed ''post-mortem'' with [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE]] or have reported symptoms of CTE continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/article58501703.html|title=The grim list of football players with CTE continues to grow|work=kansascity|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/sports/football/ken-stabler-nfl-cte-brain-disease.html?nytmobile=0|title=Ken Stabler, a Magnetic NFL Star, Was Sapped of Spirit by C.T.E.|last=Branch|first=John|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Boston University CTE Center, CTE is a brain degenerative disease found in athletes, military veterans, and others with history of repetitive brain trauma. Although CTE is highly controversial and misunderstood; it is believed that a protein called Tau forms clumps that slowly spread throughout the brain, killing brain cells.

==Concussions in the National Football League==
{{see also|list of NFL players with post-concussion syndrome}}

=== History ===
A [[concussion]], from the Latin word [[wiktionary:concussio|''concussio'']], is a frequent injury among football players. Concussions occur when the head is subject to a large impact force, resulting in a minor brain injury.  There has been a growing concern about concussions since the early 1900s.  In 1906, a Harvard student athlete died from a head injury and the team doctors released a report titled "The Physical Aspect of American Football" in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal describing the type, severity, and number of injuries the team sustained in the 1905 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Emily|title=The First Concussion Crisis; Head Injury and Evidence in Early American Football|journal=Public Health Then and Now|date=May 2014|volume=104|issue=5|page=825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL first began to review the subject formally in 1994, then [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Paul Tagliabue]] approved the creation of the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee with the stated goal of studying the effects of concussions and sub-concussive injury in NFL players. Tagliabue appointed [[rheumatologist]] Elliot Pellman to chair the committee.&lt;ref name="Peter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peter|first=Peter|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3644940|title=Elliot Pellman, the NFL's top medical adviser, claims it's okay for players with concussions to get back in the game. Time for a second choice|publisher=ESPN Sports|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pellman's appointment was met with harsh criticism, because he is not a neurologist or [[neuropsychologist]] and often admitted ignorance about head injuries.&lt;ref name="Peter"/&gt; The concussion data collected by the league from 1996 to 2001 has been shown to understate the actual number of diagnosed concussions by ten percent. The league legal representation has been shown to have had ties to the tobacco industry legal defense.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Schwarz, Walt Bogdanich and Jacqueline Williams. (24 March 2016). "In NFL, Deeply Flawed Concussion Research and Ties to Big Tobacco " The New York Times. (New York). Retrieved 24 March 2016. [http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/in-nfl-deeply-flawed-concussion-research-and-ties-to-big-tobacco/ar-BBqRt5G?ocid=spartandhp MSN website]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Importance inline}}

The same year, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) reported a statistically significant increase in the risk of [[neurological]] disorders such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) in retired football players, which furthered public knowledge about the risk of long-term neurocognitive disease related to repeated head impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/1988-0085-letter.pdf|title=Concussion in professional football: helmet testing to assess impact performance – part 11|publisher=[[United States Public Health Service]] [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|date=2004-01-10|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the NIOSH study, Pellman and the MTBI Committee drew their own conclusions that continued to contradict these findings and those of other organizations. Biomechanical engineers and neurosurgeons informed the Committee that the helmet safety standard at that time was insufficient to minimize the risk of concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concussion in professional football: helmet testing to assess impact performance – part 11|date=January 2006|pmid=16385332|volume=58|vauthors=Pellman EJ, Viano DC, Withnall C, Shewchenko N, Bir CA, Halstead PD |pages=78–96; discussion 78–96|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000196265.35238.7c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MTBI Committee began studying the nature of [[Tackle (American football)|tackle]] plays resulting in concussive impacts and developing its own biomechanical analysis of the effect of these forces on the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Practice parameter: the management of concussion in sports (summary statement). Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee.|journal=Neurology|date=March 1997|volume=48|issue=3|pages=581–5|doi=10.1212/WNL.48.3.581|pmid=9065530}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started publishing study results in 2003 that stated there were no long-term negative health consequences associated with concussions sustained by NFL players. A six-year study by the Committee concluded that, "Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concussion in professional football: players returning to the same game – part 7 |pmid=15617589 | volume=56|vauthors=Pellman EJ, Viano DC, Casson IR, Arfken C, Feuer H |pages=79–90; discussion 90–92|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000150180.16552.8d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
Other organizations continued to publish study results that linked repeated concussions and long-term health problems contrary to reports by the MTBI Committee. A 2003 report by the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the [[University of North Carolina]], for example, found a connection between numerous concussions and depression among former professional football players. Further, the Center's follow-up study in 2005 associated both brain impairment and Alzheimer's disease with retired NFL players who had histories of concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Association between recurrent concussion and late-life cognitive impairment in retired professional football players. |pmid=16239884 | volume=57|date=Oct 2005|pages=719–26|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000175725.75780.DD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 doctoral dissertation by Don Brady examined NFL Players' knowledge of concussions, studying both active and retired National Football League Players' knowledge of concussions. Brady's findings concluded: that many NFL players lacked accurate and essential knowledge pertaining to various aspects of a concussion; that the preponderance of credible experimental and clinical evidence pertaining to the adverse effects of concussion indicates that the brain is injured as a result of a concussion; that the altered cell functioning and cell death along with subtle to more visible neurological, neurocognitive, psychological, and other medical problems reflect a diverse range of lifelong negative consequences of a concussion / brain injury; and that sports team health-care personnel need to focus primarily on the athletes' health and well-being, and not minimize an injury or primarily concentrate on the players' capacity to perform on the field. This expanded focus of health care is necessary in order to avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest emerging in the concussion research, concussion management and related return to play decision-making process.&lt;ref name=Brady04&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Don |last=Brady |title=A Preliminary Investigation of Active and Retired NFL Players' Knowledge of Concussions |publisher=The Union Institute and University |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During November 2014, Brady filed objections to the proposed NFL concussion settlement offer. Brady sent a cover letter and detailed objections on behalf of NFL retired players to the presiding US district court judge, Anita Brody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballvets.org/blog/2014/11/dr-don-brady-files-objection/|title= Dr. Don Brady Files Objection to NFL Concussion Settlement Offer|work=Footballvets.org|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the studies that continued to contradict the work of the MTBI Committee, renowned experts and sports journalists wrote critical reviews of the Committee's studies. Robert Cantu of the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] noted bias in the committee's extremely small sample size and held that no conclusions should be drawn from the NFL's studies. In an ESPN Magazine article titled "Doctor Yes," Peter Keating criticized Pellman and the MTBI Committee's work and argued that the "... Committee has drawn a number of important conclusions about head trauma and how to treat it that contradict the research and experiences of many other doctors who treat sports concussions, not to mention the players who have suffered them."&lt;ref name="Peter"/&gt;

More studies continued to associate repetitive head injuries with neurological problems later in life. [[Kevin Guskiewicz]], Director of the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes in the Department of Exercise and Sport Science at the University of North Carolina, analyzed data from a 2007 study of nearly 2,500 former NFL players. He found about 11 percent of the study participants suffered from [[clinical depression]], with a threefold increased risk in former players who had a history of three or four concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Associated Press|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/sports/football/31concussions.html?pagewanted=all|title = NFL Study Links Concussions, Depression|publisher = New York Times|date = 2007-05-31|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the NFL commissioned the [[University of Michigan Institute for Social Research]] to conduct a study involving more than 1,000 former NFL players. The results reported that Alzheimer's disease or similar diseases appear to have been diagnosed in former NFL players vastly more often than in the general population at a rate of 19 times the normal rate for men ages 30 through 49. The NFL responded to these results by claiming the study was incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Ken Belson|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/sports/football/actuarial-reports-in-nfl-concussion-deal-are-released.html|title = Dementia Risk Seen in Players in NFL Study|work = New York Times|date = 2014-09-12|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2014, researchers with [[Boston University]] announced that in autopsies of 79 brains of former NFL players, 76 had tested positive for CTE.&lt;ref name="Breslow"&gt;{{cite web|last=Breslow|first=Jason|date=30 September 2014|title=76 of 79 Deceased NFL Players Found to Have Brain Disease|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sports/concussion-watch/76-of-79-deceased-nfl-players-found-to-have-brain-disease/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2017, that number had grown to 90 out of 94.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/cte/our-research/case-studies/|title=Case Studies »  CTE Center  {{!}} Boston University|website=www.bu.edu|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in July 2017 showed that 110 of 111 former NFL players whose brains were examined were found to have suffered from CTE.&lt;ref name="110of111"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Joe|last2=Williams|first2=Josh|last3=Manchester|first3=Sam|title=111 NFL Brains.

With continued pressure to protect players, the NFL began preventing players knocked unconscious by a concussion from returning to a game or practice, a policy that applied to [[Detroit Lions]] running back [[Jahvid Best]] in {{NFL Year|2009}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=Associated Press|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2011-08-22/lions-rb-jahvid-best-misses-second-practice-with-concussion|title=Lions RB Jahvid Best misses second practice with concussion|work=The Sporting News|date=2011-08-22|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various players have filed lawsuits against the league for the concussions, accusing the league of hiding information that linked head trauma to permanent brain damage, [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[dementia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/nfl-concussion-brain-trauma-lawsuit-players_n_1577497.html|title=NFL Concussions Mega-Lawsuit Claims League Hid Brain Injury Links From Players|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=2012-06-27|date=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Mike|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/19085374/concussion-lawsuit-plaintiffs-an-eye-opening-cross-section-of-nfl-past|title=Concussion lawsuit plaintiffs an eye- opening cross section of NFL past|publisher=Cbssports.com|date=2012-05-18|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some teams chose not to draft certain players in the [[NFL Draft]] due to their past concussion history. According to an Outside the Lines report, the head impact telemetry system (HITS) was in question by the League, although Kevin Guskiewicz, a professor at the University of North Carolina, said the system is functional.&lt;ref name=HITS /&gt; The technology could detect and measure the impact of blows to the head in real time during a game, but no such measurement exists in the league at this time.&lt;ref name=ESPN12&gt;{{cite news|title=OTL: Football At A Crossroads: The Hit System|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=8085758|newspaper=[[ESPN]]|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Pittsburgh Steelers receiver and current NBC Sports analyst [[Hines Ward]] stated the use of the system would be "opening a Pandora's Box," and that the data recorded by the system could be used by team owners to give players lower salaries.&lt;ref name=HITS /&gt;

In November 2011, the Cleveland Clinic Center for Spine Health created an online study released by the ''[[Journal of Neurosurgery]]'' in which various [[football helmet]]s were compared with each other via [[crash test dummy|crash test dummies]]. It was also found that leather helmets provided similar results to modern helmets, and in some cases, the leather helmets proved to have superior protection against concussive blows. However, the leather helmets did not provide as much protection against skull fractures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/story/2011-11-03/leather-helmets-concussion-prevention/51070952/1 Study reveals leather helmets may help reduce concussions], ''USA Today'', Erik Brady, 11/4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2011/11/07/in-football-leather-helmets-could-provide-a-better-defense-against-concussion/#ixzz1u20uvfQf Why Leather Football Helmets Could Provide a Better Defense Against Concussion], ''Time'' magazine, Sean Gregory, November 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2011.9.JNS111059?prevSearch=helmets&amp;searchHistoryKey= Impact test comparisons of 20th and 21st century American football helmets], Abstract, ''Journal of Neurosurgery'', Adam Bartsch, Ph.D., Edward Benzel, M.D., Vincent Miele, M.D., and Vikas Prakash, Ph.D., Jan. 2012 (published online November 4, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concussion protocol process ===
When a [[American football|football]] player sustains a [[concussion]] in the NFL, he is required to go through the concussion protocol the league has in place by the NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2013/10/01/0ap2000000254002.pdf|title=NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee's Protocols Regarding Diagnosis and Management of Concussion|last=|first=|date=|website=NFL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Preseason evaluation ====
Before the NFL season starts, all players and coaching staff of an organization are required to be educated on concussions and the importance of promptly reporting any concussion symptoms. All players in the league are also mandated to take a baseline [[neurological]] and [[Physical examination|physical exam]]. The baseline neurological exam is either a computerized or paper and pencil exam that will test different brain functions. The exam tests attention span, memory, language, speech skills, reasoning, planning, and organizational skills. The results of this test are used as a baseline if a player suffers a head injury at any point throughout the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/neuropsychological-tests#1|title=Neuropsychological Tests|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preseason physical examination allows the team physician and athletic trainer the opportunity to review and answer any questions the player might have. This also gives the physician and athletic trainer the time to go over any previous concussions, discuss the importance of reporting any symptoms of a concussion, and explain the concussion protocol that is in place for the current season.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/nfl-concussion-protocol-policy-history|title=What is the NFL's concussion protocol?|last=Flynn|first=Erin|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In-game identification ====
Current NFL concussion protocol creates positions in each organization's medical staff who are specifically charged with identifying and diagnosing concussions. One of these roles involves an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant who work with other team physicians and [[athletic trainer]]s to conduct evaluations. Another position involves athletic trainers who are positioned in the booth at every game to spot potential concussions in players from both teams. These spotters review film throughout the game that could possibly result in concussions and are capable to call "medical timeouts" to relay that information to the medical personnel on the sidelines so that further evaluation can be conducted. These spotters have been in use since the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== In-game evaluation ====
If a player shows to have a concussion or concussion symptoms, it is mandatory that the individual be removed from the game. If the player is diagnosed with a concussion, they are prohibited from re-entering the game or practice that day. According to the league's protocol, signs of a concussion include: loss of consciousness, lack of balance, holding head after contact, absentmindedness, lethargy, confusion or a visible facial injury in combination with any of the other factors. If the medical staff rule the player clear from a concussion, then the video of that hit must be reviewed before the player can re-enter the game or practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Post-game ====
After a concussion has occurred, the player must be monitored and examined on a daily basis in a training room by the team medial staff until fully cleared from concussion. Along with the continuous examination prior to a concussion, the player must meet standards that are in place by the league in order to return a game or contact practice. The player may not return to football activities until he has returned to his baseline [[cognitive function]]. Next, the player must go through a graduated exercise challenge, followed by a gradual return to practice and play. If player is feeling any setback or post- concussion symptoms, evaluation then starts from the beginning. Finally, the team doctor and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant must both clear him for return to play.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== NFL litigation ==

===A league of denial===
The NFL spent years trying to deny and cover up any link that emerged connecting head injuries sustained while playing football with long-term brain disorders. The NFL Mild Traumatic Brain Committee, first formed in 1994, reported in December 1999 that the number of head injuries had remained "remarkably the same over the course of four years."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ezell, Lauren. "Timeline: The NFL's Concussion Crisis." PBS.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee went a step further in 2004 when it suggested in an article published in ''Neurosurgery'' that "NFL players have evolved to a state where their brains are less susceptible to injury." Two months after that, MTBI publishes another article that concludes "Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, when Dr. [[Bennet Omalu]] examined the brain of former Pittsburgh Steeler [[Mike Webster]], he discovered a new brain disease, which he called [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], or CTE. He outlined his findings in a scientific paper published in ''Neurosurgery'' in July 2005.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The NFL's MTBI committee wrote in May 2006 that the article be retracted. Dr. Omalu instead wrote a second paper in the same magazine, this time about former Pittsburgh Steeler [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Dr. Ira Casson, who was then co-chair of MTBI, denied in a televised interview that there was any link between head injuries sustained playing in the NFL and long-term brain damage. His repeated denials won him the nickname "Dr. No."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In September 2009, ''The New York Times'' published an article of an NFL-funded study stating that former players are 19 times more likely than the general population to have dementia, Alzheimer's or other memory-related diseases. The NFL's spokesperson, Greg Aiello, publicly said, "the study did not formally diagnose dementia, that it was subject to shortcomings of telephone surveys."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Two months later, Aiello told ''New York Times'' reporter [[Alan Schwarz]] that "it's quite obvious from the medical research that's been done that concussions can lead to long-term problems."&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Alan. "N.F.L Acknowledges Long-Term Concussion Effects." The New York Times, December 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time any League official had acknowledged a link between the two.

Things got worse for the NFL when investigative reporters [[Steve Fainaru]] and his brother [[Mike Fainaru-Wada]] learned from an anonymous source that the NFL Retirement Board had awarded "disability payments to at least three former players after concluding that football caused their crippling brain injuries - even as the league's top medical experts for years consistently denied any link between the sport and long-term brain damage."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Fainaru, Steve, and Mark Fainaru-Wada. "NFL Board Paid $2M to Players While League Denied Football-Concussion Link." PBS.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the cases was that of Mike Webster, who filed a claim in 1999. In 2005,  three years after his death, his family received $1.8 million from the Retirement Board. "That same year," write the Fainuru brothers, "the NFL published the 10th installment in its series on concussions research in the medical journal ''Neurosurgery.'' The paper, whose authors included three members of the League's [MTBI], asserted that chronic brain injury 'has never been reported in American football players.'"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Since Aiello's admittance, the link between head injuries in football and long-term brain damage have become more accepted in the NFL In a roundtable discussion with the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] Committee on Energy and Commerce, Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice-president for health and safety, admitted that "there is a link between football-related head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy."&lt;ref&gt;Fainuru, Steve. "NFL acknowledges, for first time, link between football, brain disease." ESPN.&lt;/ref&gt; However, public relations issues continue to plague the League. A report from the Democratic members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said that "the NFL rescinded a gift to the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) for concussion research when it learned the study's findings would be detrimental to the league's image."&lt;ref&gt;Vasilogambros, Matt. "The NFL's Concussion Cover-Up." The Atlantic, May 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The N.F.L had tried to funnel the funds it gave to the NIH towards its own studies. The League rejected the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Fainaru, Steve, and Mark Fainaru-Wada. "Congressional report says NFL waged improper campaign to influence government study." ESPN.&lt;/ref&gt;

To mitigate the public relations (PR) nightmare, the NFL has taken several steps to better assure player safety and bring awareness to head injuries in football players of all ages. Several rule changes took place between 2007 and 2014. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell issued a memo in December 2009 to all 32 teams stating that a player who sustains a concussion cannot return to play if he shows signs or symptoms, such as inability to remember assignments or plays, a gap in memory and persistent dizziness. This move changed the 2007 rule saying a player cannot return only if he has lost consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;NFL "Goodell issues memo changing return-to-play rules for concussions."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, new rules regarding "crown of the helmet" tackles have been installed where a runner or a tackler cannot initiate forcible contact with the crown of the helmet outside the tackle box so as to protect players' heads.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael David. "NFL officiating video stresses new "crown of the helmet" rule." NBC Sports.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the NFL and [[USA Football]] launched the [https://usafootball.com/programs/heads-up-football/ Heads Up Football] initiative, which "emphasizes a smarter and safer way to play and teach youth football, including proper tackling and taking the head out of the game."&lt;ref&gt;NFL "NFL celebrates USA Football Month with launch of USA Football's Heads Up Football initiative."&lt;/ref&gt; A mobile application was also launched with help from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] where information about concussion protocols and player health and safety can be easily reached by parents and coaches.

The PR issues surrounding the NFL's cover-up of concussions are far from over, and it is too early to tell how and to what extent these events will impact the NFL or football playing. Robert Boland, professor of sports management at [[New York University]] and former college football player says, "In the short-run, [the NFL] is still thriving," but downward trends in youth football players shows that future generations "might have less of an intimate attachment to the sport."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Drummond, Katie. "Can the NFL survive its concussion crisis?." The Verge.&lt;/ref&gt; Boland says this in light of [[Pop Warner]] football enrollment dropping by 9.5 percent between 2010 and 2012, likely linked to the high-profile concussion problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Federal NFL concussion litigation===
In April 2011, attorneys [[Sol H. Weiss]] and [[Larry E. Coben]] from the Philadelphia law firm of Anapol Weiss filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of [[Ray Easterling]], [[Jim McMahon]] and five other players. Thousands of former NFL players have since filed lawsuits against the League after suffering repeated concussions throughout their careers.

The multidistrict litigation (MDL) titled In re: National Football League Players' Concussion Injury Litigation (MDL 2323) was filed on January 31, 2012 in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]. Judge [[Anita B. Brody]] presides over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2012md02323/457890/|title=MDL-2323 IN RE: NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE PLAYERS' CONCUSSION INJURY LITIGATION|date=2012-01-31|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The master administrative long-form [[complaint]], filed by Plaintiff's Co-Lead Counsel Sol Weiss and [[Christopher A. Seeger|Christopher Seeger]] on June 7, 2012, alleges the League "... was aware of the evidence and the risks associated with repetitive traumatic brain injuries virtually at the inception, but deliberately ignored and actively concealed the information from the Plaintiffs and all others who participated in organized football at all levels." The master complaint argues the NFL knew or should have known players who sustain repetitive head injuries are at risk of suffering "... early-onset of Alzheimer's Disease, [[dementia]], depression, deficits in [[cognitive function]]ing, reduced processing speed, attention, and reasoning, loss of memory, sleeplessness, moods swings, personality changes, and the debilitating and latent disease known as [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] ('CTE')."

In April 2012, Easterling was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/five-nfl-players-whove-died-self-inflicted-gunshot-002000760--nfl.html|title=Five NFL Players Who've Died from a Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound|publisher=Yahoo Sports|date=2012-07-30|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy report concluded Easterling's brain had evidence of CTE, a degenerative brain disease associated with frequent blows to the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/sports/football/ray-easterling-autopsy-found-signs-of-brain-disease-cte.html|title=Football Player Who Killed Himself Had Brain Disease|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-07-26|accessdate=2013-09-03|first=Mike|last=Tierney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One month later, former [[San Diego Chargers]] player [[Junior Seau]] also died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and a brain autopsy showed he suffered from CTE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8830344/study-junior-seau-brain-shows-chronic-brain-damage-found-other-nfl-football-players|title=Doctors: Junior Seau's brain had CTE|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2013-01-13|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Easterling and Seau, an autopsy of Bears safety [[Dave Duerson]]'s brain after he committed [[suicide]] earlier that year revealed he also suffered from the same degenerative brain disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/sports/football/03duerson.html?_r=0|title=Duerson's Brain Trauma Diagnosed|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2011-05-13|accessdate=2013-09-03|first=Alan|last=Schwarz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autopsy results following these players' suicides heightened existing concerns regarding the connection between player deaths and concussions. Neuropathologist [[Bennet Omalu]] has identified CTE in the autopsies of former players [[Mike Webster]], [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]], [[Justin Strzelczyk]], [[Andre Waters]], and [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2012/05/neurosurgeon-junior-seaus-death-fuels-concussion-concerns/1#.T7RHJ1LjwnI|work=USA Today|title=Neurosurgeon: Junior Seau's death fuels concussion concerns|date=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Habib|first=Hal|url=http://www.canada.com/sports/football/nfl/Seau+death+heightens+concerns+over+concussions/6584370/story.html|title=Seau's death heightens concerns over concussions|publisher=Canada.com|date=2012-05-08|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the difficult issues facing doctors is attempting to identify mental health effects from concussions during the lives of former players rather than after their deaths.&lt;ref name=ESPNMay12&gt;{{cite news |title=Junior Seau dies at 43 |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7882750/junior-seau-former-san-diego-charger-found-dead- |work=[[ESPN]] |date=May 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, a group of former [[Dallas Cowboys]]—including [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] inductees [[Randy White (American football)|Randy White]], [[Bob Lilly]], and [[Rayfield Wright]] (among other retired players from around the league)—filed a lawsuit against the NFL, again accusing it of ignoring a link between concussions and brain injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/7851511/dallas-cowboy-greats-file-concussion-suit-nfl Ex-Cowboys sue over concussions], ESPN, Associated Press, April 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the number of players involved in suits against the NFL increased to 3,402, and the League sued three dozen insurance companies in an attempt to force them to cover the costs of defending claims of not protecting players. However, [[The Travelers Companies|Travelers]] ultimately sued the League on August 21 in a lawsuit called Discover Property &amp; Casualty Co. et al. vs. National Football League et al., [[New York State Supreme Court]], New York County, No. 652933/2012.

However, the proposal was met with criticism from players like running backs [[Matt Forte]], [[Emmitt Smith]] and [[Marshall Faulk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Matt-Forte-calls-proposed-new-rule-absurd/c120925a-70ee-44b5-8adb-e974e44af1b1|title=Matt Forte calls proposed new rule absurd|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=2013-03-18|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A federal hearing was held on April 9, 2013 in Philadelphia to discuss the League's motion to dismiss the lawsuits brought on behalf of more than 4,500 former players On July 8, 2013, Judge Brody ordered representatives of both sides of the litigation to explore a possible settlement in the litigation. Judge Brody ordered a report on or before September 3, 2013 regarding the results of the mediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflconcussionmdl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Order-on-mediation-7-8-13.pdf|title=Mediation Order|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposed settlement was reached in the litigation on August 29, 2013. Under the agreement, the NFL will contribute $765 million to provide medical help to more than 18,000 former players. Retired players who suffer severe neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diseases in the future will also be eligible to apply for medical help. In addition, $10 million will fund brain injury research as well as safety and education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=John|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-08-31/news/41622052_1_retired-players-former-players-ray-easterling|title=NFL ex-players reach $765 million deal in concussion case|publisher=[[Philly.com]]|date=2013-08-29|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement says it should not be interpreted as a statement of legal liability on the part of the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NFL, Retired Players Resolve Concussion Litigation; Court-Appointed Mediator Hails Historic Agreement|publisher=Alternative Dispute Resolution Center|date=August 29, 2013|url=http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/press-release-2.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement, which is projected to protect retired players for nearly 65 years, will compensate injured former players who need immediate help and will provide baseline assessments and medical benefits to those who are symptom-free or beginning to show signs of neurological problems.

"I think it's more important that the players have finality, that they're vindicated, and that as soon as the court approves the settlement they can begin to get screening, and those that are injured can get their compensation. I think that's more important than looking at some documents," attorney Weiss said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2013/08/29/nfl-players-reach-proposed-765m-settlement-concussion-related-lawsuits/|title=NFL players reach proposed $765M settlement of concussion-related lawsuits|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=2013-08-29|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement also allows a player diagnosed with CTE the eligibility to up to 4 million dollars in compensation. This has been met with criticism of the settlement's structure as it only applies to players diagnosed before the settlements preliminary agreement and disallows those diagnosed after the approval of the deal in July.&lt;ref name="Breslow"/&gt;

The NFL has paid nearly $1 billion in settlements from claims alleging long-term injuries from repeated blows to the head. Courts have examined these claims using a "Trigger" process. This trigger process includes 4 triggers: The "exposure" trigger, the "manifestation" trigger, the "injury-in-fact" trigger, and the "continuous" trigger. Reiter, Thomas M., and Lucas J. Tanglen.

===Kansas City Chiefs concussion lawsuit===
On December 3, 2013, five former NFL players filed a lawsuit against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] organization: former Chiefs players [[Alexander Cooper (American football)|Alexander Cooper]], [[Leonard Griffin (American football)|Leonard Griffin]], [[Christopher Martin (American football)|Christopher Martin]], [[Joe Phillips (American football)|Joe Phillips]], and [[Kevin Porter (American football)|Kevin Porter]]. They wish to know what the Chiefs knew about concussions and when they knew it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paylor|first=Terez|title=Five Former Players Sue Chiefs over Consusisons|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/12/03/4666316/five-former-players-suing-chiefs.html#storylink=cpy|publisher=The Kansas City Star|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This lawsuit is unique and different from the thousands of lawsuits previously filed against the NFL. These players are not suing the NFL, and are instead suing the Chiefs.

From 1987 to 1993 there was no [[Collective Bargaining Agreement]] established in the NFL. With no existence of a CBA in these years, players who played during this time for the Chiefs can sue the team for many of the same reasons the NFL has been sued. The $765 million settlement in August 2013 between the NFL and former players only protected the NFL. "I think all of our clients were disappointed," McClain said of his clients reaction to the settlement with the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paylor|first=Terez|title=Five Former Players Suing Chiefs over Concussions|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/12/03/4666316/five-former-players-suing-chiefs.html|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players currently suing the Chiefs have all opted-out of the settlement from the previous mediation with the NFL.

A law unique to Missouri allows certain former NFL players to sue the individual team. The current Missouri law states that employees can sue employers in civil court if the employees declined worker's compensation. The Independence attorney for the five ex-Chiefs, Ken McClain said, "The lawsuit is allowed in Missouri after a state workers' compensation statute was amended in 2005 to exclude cases of occupational injury that occur over an extended time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drapper|first=Bill|title=Five ex-Chiefs sue Kansas City over concussions|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/sports/20131203/five-ex-chiefs-sue-kansas-city-over-concussions|publisher=Daily Times|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment of the 2005 law is set to be changed at the end of December 2013. Martin and McClain have both encouraged former players who are eligible to join the lawsuit before their window of opportunity expires.

On December 1, 2012, [[Jovan Belcher]], current member of the Kansas City Chiefs, shot and killed his fiancée, Kassandra Perkins, before committing suicide in the Arrowhead practice facility parking lot. On behalf of Belcher's and Perkin's daughter, lawyers have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Chiefs. Belcher's mother has filed a similar suit accusing the Chiefs of ignoring Belcher's cries for help as he complained of concussion like symptoms. The first occurrence came against Jacksonville in 2009 where Belcher was knocked unconscious and failed to receive adequate treatment. The second occurrence was against the Bengals in November 2012. The lawsuits allege, Belcher "suffered what should have been recognized as an acute concussion." However, one lawsuit continues, "despite exhibiting obvious symptoms, Decedent was never removed from play for evaluation and recovery." The lawsuits also claims Belcher exhibited signs of CTE, including changes in his mood and behavior.&lt;ref name="Delsohn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Delsohn|first=Steve|title=OTL:Belcher's Brain Had CTE Signs|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11612386/jovan-belcher-brain-showed-signs-cte-doctor-says-report|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2014, it was announced that the brain of former Kansas City Chiefs player, Jovan Belcher, contained neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein; which is associated with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. The tangles were distributed throughout Belcher's hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with memory, learning and emotion. If the findings of CTE come to be true, Belcher's daughter and mother are eligible for up to $4 million under the National Football League's current Collective Bargaining Agreement.&lt;ref name="Delsohn"/&gt;

===Cook County, Illinois Riddell concussion litigation===
On March 11, 2016, the family of deceased San Diego Charger defensive back [[Paul Oliver (American football)|Paul Oliver]] sued helmet-maker [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] along with its related corporate entities, in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois.  Shortly thereafter, NFL hall of fame running back and Super Bowl champion [[Paul Hornung]], represented by [[The Brad Sohn Law Firm]] and [[Corboy &amp; Demetrio]], filed a related case against these defendants.  Now, some 100 former professional players have sued Riddell in the consolidated litigation in Cook County, which alleges Riddell to have conspired with the NFL in creating false science.  Riddell's attempt at the same federal labor preemption defense attempted by the NFL failed.  The NFL remains subject to discovery in this case, even though it is a non-party.

The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], like the NFL, has been criticized for its handling of concussions, with numerous players having retired from football due to concussions, or have filed lawsuits against the association for failing to protect student-athletes from concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Post Comment|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/09/04/former-football-players-sue-ncaa-over-concussions/2762575/|title = Former college football player sues NCAA in federal court over concussions|publisher = USA Today|date = 2013-09-04|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, former players Derek Owens and Alex Rucks filed lawsuits against the association for failing to cover the players' safety.

The panel also had recommended for an athlete to be sidelined after any concussion-related injury until he/she has been cleared by a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=4746679|title=NCAA recommends stricter rules on concussions|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-12-15|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new plan, all student-athletes must sign statements saying that they will report all signs and symptoms of concussions to their coaches.  In addition, all athletes must have baseline cognitive testing while the post-injury cognitive testing is strongly recommended.  The athletes diagnosed with concussions must be removed from sports for a minimum of one day and can only return when decided by a team physician.

==Concussions in other leagues==

===Canadian Football League===
In the [[2010 CFL season|2010 season]] for the [[Canadian Football League]], there have been 50 reported concussions; 44.8 percent of players reported having a concussion or concussion-like symptoms, 16.9 percent had confirmed that they had a concussion, and 69.6 percent of all players who suffered from concussions that year suffered from more than one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reactcanada.org/EN/resources/articles/sport_specific/CFL_DELANEY.pdf|title=Concussions During the 1997 Canadian Football League Season|work=[[Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine]]|format=PDF|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the average of 0.59 concussions per game is lower than the 0.67 recorded by the NFL in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/cfl/argos/article/971336--cfl-concussions-not-always-revealed-to-fans|title=CFL concussions not always revealed to fans|work=The Star|date=2011-04-07|accessdate=2012-06-27|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league eventually started a concussion-awareness program with the help of [[Football Canada]], [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] (CIS), the [[Canadian School Sport Federation]], the [[Canadian Football League Players Association]] (CFLPA), the [[Canadian Football League Alumni Association]] (CFLAA), and the [[ThinkFirst]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/article/985088--canadian-football-tackles-concussions-head-on|title=Canadian football tackles concussions head-on|work=The Star|date=2011-05-03|accessdate=2012-06-27|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league eventually pointed out eight protocols:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/article/working-to-promote-concussion-awareness|title=Official Site of the Canadian Football League|publisher=CFL.ca|date=2011-05-03|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Team physicians and therapists are to use a SCAT2 (a medical protocol), to diagnose concussions and preventing athletes from playing until they have been cleared to play.
* All players are to be submitted to IMPACT, which is a form of cognitive testing, during training camp.
* All player concussion assessments in the CFL are to only be used by team physicians and therapists.
* All coaches and players will receive educational items to aid in recognizing signs of a concussion.
* Administrators are to report a change from the expectation that a player returns to the game to one that encourages players to be honest about symptoms.
* The formation of certification programs that teach coaches how to recognize the symptoms of concussions.
* The formation of training programs for coaches that emphasize that players should never use their helmets to tackle.
* A new rule in the amateur football rulebook was implemented that requires officials to report suspected concussed players to the coaching or medical staff during games.

In 2012, ThinkFirst founder and [[Toronto Western Hospital]] neurosurgeon Charles Tator led a study that was conducted by the [[University of Toronto]], which examined the brains of 20 former players with a history of concussions, and compared them to 20 other players without a history of head injury. A separate group of 20 without football experience served as a control group. Also in 2012, the league and Tator announced a partnership to work in a study that would perform postmortem tests on former CFL players to look for signs of CTE.&lt;ref name="Study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cflaa.ca/2012/may-5-2012-former-cfl-players-to-be-studied-for-long-term-concussion-effects/|title=Former CFL players to be studied for long term concussion effects|publisher=Canadian Football League Alumni Association|date=May 5, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arena Football League===
In the [[Arena Football League]], despite the league's intense play, very few lawsuits have been filed for concussions. The most notable lawsuit against the league was a lawsuit filed by former [[Colorado Crush]] kicker [[Clay Rush]] in 2010, who claimed that he suffered from permanent brain damage due to repeated blows to the head during games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/sports/football/19concussions.html|title=Lawsuit Cites Mishandling of Football Concussions|author=Alan Schwarz|date=18 March 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the NFL, the AFL prohibits players who suffered from concussions from practicing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/more-sports/arena-football-league-adopts-strict-guidelines-on-concussions-296455/?p=0|title=Arena Football League adopts strict guidelines on concussions|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2012-03-29|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, during the original league's [[2008 Arena Football League season|final season]], the "Shockometer" made its debut at two season-opening games ([[Dallas Desperados]] vs. [[Georgia Force]]/[[San Jose SaberCats]] vs. [[Chicago Rush]]) on 40 player helmets. The device is projected to sell for $30 if it is to become available on the market.&lt;ref name=Shockometer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=3269214|title=Indicator on AFL helmets to warn of potentially dangerous hits|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2008-02-28|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players that were given the device play positions that are suspectible to hard hits, such as wide receivers, defensive backs, running backs, and linebackers. AFL Players Association regional director James Guidry stated that the red light doesn't mean that the player has a concussion, but as a warning for team examiners to inspect the player. Guidry also said that the device could be used to prevent players who do not want to show any signs of weakness after sustaining any concussion-like symptoms from continuing to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nflplayers.com/Articles/Public-News/AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt%e2%80%99s-Shockometer/|title=AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt's-Shockometer / News|publisher=NFLPlayers.com|date=2008-05-22|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth football===
Youth athletes make up 70% of football players in the United States. Every year there are 23,000 nonfatal traumatic brain injuries stemming from playing football that required an emergency visit to the hospital.  Of those visits, 90% of them are children between the ages of 5–18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=L. Syd|title=Return to Play Guidelines Cannot Solve the Football-Related Concussion Problem|journal=Journal of School Health|volume=82|pages=180–185|doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2011.00684.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted from 2010-2104 showed that of the 529 million emergency room visits; 819,000 were contact sport related. This accounted for 0.15% of all emergency visits. This number although small, may effect and cause ramifications in the American healthcare system. Theses figures are represented with nearly 80-90% of that of the youth population {ages 7-18).  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGinity|first=Michael|date=2018|title=The impact of tackle football injuries of the American healthcare system|url=http://link.galegroup.com.exproxy.jccc.edu/apps/doc/A5376681/AONE?u=jcl_jccc&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=5a1116f7|journal=Academic OneFile|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first studies of its kind was performed during the Fall 2011 football season when researchers from [[Virginia Tech]], receiving permission from parents, placed [[accelerometer]]s (which measure [[g force]]s) inside the helmets of seven youth players. These seven players were 7- and 8-year-old boys participating in a community youth league who were chosen because they were expected to have high participation and also because they wore at least a youth medium [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] Revolution helmet (enabling the accelerometers, [[battery (electricity)|battery]], and wireless transmitter to fit inside the helmet within the padding). That is, these seven were not a random selecting of players. Rather, the purpose of this study was to establish a baseline of what range of hits are generally expected.&lt;ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daniel | first1 = R.

As way of comparison, a collision of 80g is a big hit in a college football game of which there might be only six per game. And the range of 80, 90, or 100g is generally where risk of acute injury and [[concussion]] begins to occur (concussion being symptoms such as feeling foggy or woozy and not necessarily loss of consciousness). An example of a lesser force of 40g is heading a [[soccer ball]], and even with blows in this 30 to 40g range, it is not known whether these pose a cumulative risk of injury.&lt;ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy/&gt;

This 2011 study measured a total 753 impacts among these seven players with a median impact of 15g. It did, however, observe 38 impacts of 40g or greater, and six impacts of greater than 80g. Fortunately, none of these youth players experienced a concussion. There is also a concern that since many young players have less developed chest and neck muscles than older players, almost every impact potentially acts likes a surprise hit.&lt;ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy/&gt;

The Center for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC's) has developed the "Heads Up concussion in Youth Sports." It helps youth coaches, players, and parents be more aware of a concussion.

===Concussions in high school football===
Concussions are frequent in high school football. Football has the highest rate of concussion among high school sports, with about 11 concussions occurring per 10,000 athletic exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Breslow|first1=Jason|title=High School Football Players Face Bigger Concussion Risk|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sports/league-of-denial/high-school-football-players-face-bigger-concussion-risk/|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 50 high school or younger football players across the country were killed or sustained serious head injuries on the field since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/09/16/sports/20070916_CONCUSSION_GRAPHIC.html?ref=headinjuries&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=Young Players, Serious Injuries|work=New York Times|date=2007-09-16|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many concussions that occur during high school football often go untreated and are not monitored. This is a big concern because repeated trauma to the head, especially injuries with concussion like symptoms, puts a young athlete health at serious risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Unreported Concussion in High School Football Players: Impli... : Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|url=http://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Abstract/2004/01000/Unreported_Concussion_in_High_School_Football.3.aspx|journal=LWW|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2013 study by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center found that, despite knowing the risk of serious injury from continuing to play with a concussion, half of high school football players would still play if they had a headache from an injury sustained on the field. Researchers surveyed 120 high school football players. Of those students, 30 reported having suffered a concussion. More than 90 percent recognized the risk of serious injury if they returned to play too quickly, but more than half of those aware of the risks responded they would "always or sometimes continue to play with a headache sustained from an injury," and only 54 percent indicated they would "always or sometimes report symptoms of a concussion to their coach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-05/cchm-src050113.php|title=Study raises concerns that teen athletes continue to play with concussion symptoms|publisher=Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center|date=2013-05-06|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that 15.8% of football players who sustain a concussion severe enough to cause loss of consciousness return to play the same day. Due to the fact that only 42% of high schools have access to athletic training services, there has been a large debate regarding the risks that high school football players face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics on Youth Sports Safety|url=http://www.clearedtoplay.org/concussion-information/concussions-by-the-numbers|website=Cleared to Play|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven high schools in North Central Florida agreed to take a written questionnaire evaluating the varsity football teams knowledge about concussions. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Research Subjects by the University of Florida. The review consisted of three sections. First was to identify symptoms of a concussion, second what they believed were possible consequences from not getting the proper treatment of a concussion, and the last section was to indicate if they have ever received information about concussions. 25% of them had never received information about concussion and only 54% had talked about the issue of a concussion with a parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4208870/|title=Concussion Knowledge in High School Football Players|last=Janie Cournoyer, MSc, ATC, CAT(C) and Brady L.

==Prevention efforts==
Numerous efforts have attempted to identify potential concussions quickly. Helmet [[shock data logger]]s and [[impact sensor]]s help monitor impacts a player receives.  One example is a device created by [[Schutt Sports]] during the [[Arena Football League]]'s 2008 season known as the "Shockometer"—a triangle-shaped object with adhesive on its side that sticks to players' helmets. When a player gets hit by a [[g-force]] which exceeds 98, a capsule with a green light in it will change to a red light. Doctors have determined that a g-force of approximately 100 will increase the risk of a concussion, even though a quarterback that gets sacked would normally register a g-force of 150 g. A possible flaw to the Shockometer is that fan activity could accidentally trigger the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=3269214|title = Indicator on AFL helmets|work = ESPN|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to help record the frequency and severity of player impacts during practices and games. Every HITS helmet features MX Encoders, which would automatically record every hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riddell.com/innovation/hits-technology/|title=HITS™ Technology|publisher=Riddell|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight NFL teams had planned to use the system in the {{NFL Year|2010}} season, but it was ultimately not used.&lt;ref name=HITS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/06/24/failure-to-use-hit-system-exposes-league-to-future-concussion-liability/|title=Failure to use HIT system exposes league to future concussion liability|publisher=Profootballtalk.nbcsports.com|date=June 24, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Reebok]] developed the Head Impact Indicator, which is a [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]-sized device placed on a player's skull, which activates a red/yellow light if the player is hit too hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Sauser|first = Brittany|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/408643/a-helmet-that-detects-hard-hits/|title = A helmet that detects hard hits|publisher = [[National Football League]]|date = 2007-09-10|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Reebok's Impact Indicator, Battle Sport Science has released the Impact Indicator 2.0.

Vicis, a Seattle-based firm, has created a new unique type of helmet that is very flexible due to the many layers that make up this new intricate helmet. This helmet consists of four layers, beginning with the Lode Shell. This layer absorbs the shock from the hit, which then leads to the Core Layer contorting and bending in all directions. This technology alleviates stress from the impact, which consists of all the linear and rotational forces involved in the hit. The Arch Shell exists directly under the Core Layer and is precisely designed to fit a player's head shape. The last layer, the Form Liner, works with the Arch Shell to apportion pressure evenly around the perimeter of the head. Instead of measuring a player's head the conventional way by taking the circumference, Vicis measures the length and width of the head to get more accurate data. A better fit of the helmet allows for the technology to work more advantageously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/zero-1-football-helmet-helps-prevent-concussions/|title=Flexible football helmet absorbs hits like a car bumper, could put an end to concussions|author=|date=4 April 2017|website=digitaltrends.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several NFL players have tried this new helmet and have provided great feedback. Cliff Avril from the Seattle Seahawks said, "You don't feel the thuds as hard as they normally are." In the NFL's 2017 Helmet Laboratory Testing Performance Results, the Vicis helmet finished first out of the 33 helmets that could have been worn in 2017 NFL season. Concussion-preventing technology continues to improve the safety in the game of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geekwire.com/2017/seattle-seahawks-players-talk-experience-wearing-new-high-tech-vicis-helmet/|title=Seattle Seahawks players talk about their experience wearing new high-tech Vicis helmet|author=|date=28 August 2017|website=geekwire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NFL===

The National Football League has made numerous rule changes to reduce the number of concussions suffered by players while making the game safer.

In 2010, the NFL reworded the League's rules to prohibit a player from "launching himself off the ground and using his helmet to strike a player in a defenseless posture in the head or neck." Violations of this rule only result in the imposition of a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty. In the same season, the NFL mandated that once a player loses his helmet on the playing field, the current play must immediately be whistled dead.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Drysdale|date=13 December 2013|title=Helmet-to-Helmet Contact: Avoiding a Lifetime Penalty by Creating a Duty to Scan Active NFL Players for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy|journal=Journal of Legal Medicine|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis ltd|volume=34|issue=4|pages=425–452|doi=10.1080/01947648.2013.859969}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, the NFL mandated that during field goals or extra point attempts, defenders must line up with their entire bodies on the outside of the snapper's body to protect the snapper while he is in a position of vulnerability. Violations of this rule, however, result in only a five-yard penalty for illegal formation.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

The Competition Committee reviews all competitive aspects of the game, including playing rules, roster regulations, technology, game-day operations and player protection. The process for modifying or adopting rules and regulations is systematic and consensus-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;playsmartplaysafe.com Coaching For Change:Rule Changes Designed to Improve Health and Safety. website.&lt;/ref&gt;

To reinforce the seriousness of the rule changes, in the middle of the 2010 season, Commissioner Goodell issued a memo to all NFL teams stating that "more significant discipline, including suspensions, will be imposed on players that strike an opponent in the head or neck area in violation of the rules."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81b7b9ef/article/goodell-issues-memo-enforcing-player-safety-rules|title=Goodell issues memo enforcing player safety rules|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-07-26|accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most drastic step the NFL has taken to reduce head injuries was the 2010 change to the NFL kickoff rules. To reduce what has been referred to as one of the most violent plays in the game, the kickoff was moved up from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line. The NFL also outlawed the use of the three-man wedge on kickoffs, while allowing the two-man wedge to remain a legal play. Consequently, players on the kicking team must now line up closer to midfield, reducing the amount of space the players have in which to get a running start.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

In 2011, the NFL also mandated that certified athletic trainers be available in press boxes during all NFL games. These athletic trainers assist medical personnel located on the sidelines in identifying potential concussions because the symptoms are often difficult to spot and assess from the field level.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

On March 20, 2013, the NFL voted to introduce yet another new rule aimed at player safety. Starting in the 2013-2014 season, if a running back lowers the crown of his helmet while he is inside the tackle box or while he is less than three yards downfield and makes contact with a defender, the team will be given a 15-yard penalty.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

After three years of declines in reported cases, the 2015 regular season contained a spike in concussions even after making several improvements the previous year. The total cases reported for the practices, pre-season, and regular season was 271, a 31.6 percent spike. The 2015 cases reported for regular season games was 182, a 58.3 percent spike.&lt;ref&gt;Shpigel, Ben. (29 January 2016). Diagnoses of Concussions Increase by Nearly a Third Over Last Season.

In the 2016 offseason, the NFL implemented a new policy to their concussion protocol. The NFL can now punish teams that do not follow their concussion protocol by imposing a monetary fine or taking away their draft picks. The first violation can be a fine up to $150,000 and the second violation can be a fine no less than $100,000 and a possible removal of draft picks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/nfl-concussion-protocol-policy-history|title=What is the NFL's concussion protocol?|author=|date=|website=si.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Seattle Seahawks were under much scrutiny for violating the NFL's concussion protocol by allowing [[Russell Wilson]] to return to the game against the Arizona Cardinals without the proper treatment.

=== WFA ===
The Women's Football Alliance has come a long way when it comes to the guidelines on making the game safer for its players.

from 2012 to 2017 they have since made it illegal to send a player back into the game with suspicions of a concussion unless cleared by a certified health official.

===Youth football===

Return to play guidelines (RTPs), such as Washington State's  Lystedt Law, have been legally mandated since 2009.  All 50 states, including Washington D.C, have now passed legislation to help reduce the number of traumatic brain injuries in youth football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachynski|first1=Kathleen|title=Youth Sports &amp; Public Health:  Framing Risks of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in American Football and Ice Hockey|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine &amp;Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Dick Durbin, from Illinois, introduced the Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act on September 25, 2013 to the U.S. Senate.  This act would require athletes, parents, coaches and school officials to be informed of the risks of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and it would also require the "when in doubt, sit it out" policy to be used  with athletes that have been suspected of having a concussion and be removed from the field of play.  A press release from Senator Durbin stated that many major U.S. sports organizations, including the NFL and NHL, endorsed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachynski|first1=Kathleen|title=Youth Sports &amp; Public Health: Framing Risks of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in American Football and Ice Hockey|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics|issue=Fall 2014|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] league banned kickoffs in an attempt to reduce high-speed collisions that result in concussions.&lt;ref name=Belson&gt;{{cite news |last1=Belson |first1=Ken |title=Pop Warner Bans Kickoffs in Hopes of Protecting Its Youngest Players |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/sports/football/pop-warner-bans-kickoffs-concussions-nfl.html |accessdate=June 23, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Screening procedure==
{{Dubious|1=Screening procedures|reason= NPOV, dubious, hyperbole, promotional, FDA smackdown|date=April 2015}}

In September 2015, researchers with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] and [[Boston University]] announced that they had identified CTE in 96 percent of NFL players that they had examined and in 79 percent of all football players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breslow|first=Jason|title=New: 87 Deceased NFL Players Test Positive for Brain Disease|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/new-87-deceased-nfl-players-test-positive-for-brain-disease/|accessdate=9 January 2016|publisher=Frontline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2015, Gary Small and colleagues have been called into question by the [[FDA]] for their overzealous commercialization and promotion of clinically unproven screening that fellow peer researchers deem fit only for research and they have responded by withdrawing related materials from their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-brain-scan-warning-taumark-20150410-story.html|title= FDA forces UCLA researchers to stop touting experimental dementia scan|first= Alan |last= Zarembo|date= Apr 10, 2015|publisher= LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= Feb 15, 2015|url= http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM436520.pdf|title= Warning Letters and Notice of Violation Letters|publisher= FDA|quote= Restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, all screening procedures that examine football players for brain damage have been post mortem. In 2013, Gary Small and colleagues developed an in vivo chemical tracer that can detect tau protein build up in living players. Small and his team invented this new chemical tracer, 2-(1-&lt;nowiki/&gt;{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile, or FDDNP, that could be used in [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) scans.&lt;ref name="Small 2013 138-144"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=G.W.|title=PET Scanning of Brain Tau in Retired National League Football Players: Preliminary Findings|journal=American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry|year=2013|volume=21|issue=2|pages=138–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new tracer measures for tau protein and amyloid plaque accumulation in human brains; symptoms of repetitive brain trauma among other things. Although tracers have been developed to screen for the build-up of tau proteins in the human brain, FDDNP is the first PET tracer that can be used in vivo in human trials. FDDNP was originally developed in an effort to detect Alzheimer's in elderly individuals, thus the article was published in the [[The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry|journal]] of the [[American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry]]. However, because there are similarities between Alzheimer's and the effects of [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|Chronic Traumatic Encephelopathy]] (CTE), FDDNP was used to study the extent of brain trauma in consenting, retired NFL players.

Small and colleagues performed a controlled experiment on retired NFL players and an equal number of control participants. Unfortunately the sample size was very small as only 5 players of the 19 contacted were eligible for the study. Though the sample size was small, a good range of positions were represented (linebacker, quarterback, offensive lineman, defensive lineman, and a center) and all players had played in the league at least 10 years. The players had to be at least 45 years of age and currently exhibit symptoms of cognitive and mood disruption. Control participants had to meet certain criteria as well to ensure that they were as similar as possible to the NFL players in order to eliminate any biases or confounding variables. Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), years of education, and family history of dementia were all selected as the selection criteria for control participants. All participants received intravenous injections of the FDDNP tracer and were tested over 4 weeks using PET imaging technology.
	
The injection of the FDDNP tracer was successful, and the results of the study showed significant differences between the NFL players and control participants. The NFL players had significantly higher FDDNP signals than control participants, indicating a greater amount of tau protein accumulation. The cortical regions of all the participants studied showed no significant difference, but the NFL players had FDDNP levels that were significantly higher in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, sub thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar white matter regions of the brain as compared to the control participants.&lt;ref name="Small 2013 138-144"/&gt; In addition, a positive correlation was found between the number of head injuries the players sustained and the levels of FDDNP binding. This suggests that players with a more severe history of head trauma will likely have significantly more accumulation of tau protein. This, in turn, gives rise to the suggestion that a more severe history of head trauma will result in greater deterioration of the brain, cognitive functioning, and mood regulation.

The findings of the study were consistent with previous autopsy studies of individuals with CTE. The important distinction to make, however, is that the patients in Small's study were not on the slab and walked out after testing was completed. This is monumental in the field of brain trauma and concussion research.

Based on recent new blood tests; evidence is revealing no change in blood plasma tau and serum neurofilament light concentrations following sport related concussions. However these levels did rise in more severe concussion sport related injuries. This can can potentially suggest that a new blood test be developed and help aid in identifying the severity of concussion, and assist in concussion protocols. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2018|title=New Biomarkers Study Results Reported from University of British Columbia (No change in plasma tau and serum concentrations in adolescent athletes following sport-related concussions.|url=http://link.galegroup.com.ezproxy.jccc.edu/apps/doc/A561840507/AONE?u=jcl_jccc&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=811a449a|journal=Obesity, Fitness &amp; Wellness|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery efforts==
Concussions are proven to cause loss of brain function. This can lead to physical and emotional symptoms such as attention disorders, depression, headaches, nausea, and amnesia. These symptoms can last for days or week and even after the symptoms have gone, the brain still won't be completely normal. Players with multiple concussions can have drastically worsened symptoms and exponentially increased recovery time.

Researchers at UCLA used a brain-imaging tool to identify a certain protein found in five retired NFL players. The presence and accumulation of tau proteins found in the five living players, are associated with [[Alzheimer's]] disease. Previously, this type of exam could only be performed with an autopsy. Scientists at UCLA created a chemical marker that binds to the abnormal proteins and they are able to view this with [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) scan. Researcher at UCLA, Gary Small explains, "Providing a non-invasive method for early detection is a critical first step in developing interventions to prevent symptom onset and progression in [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Imaging Study of Concussion-Related Abnormal Brain Proteins In Retired NFL Players|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/255241.php|publisher=Medical News Today|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-Concussive Symptoms (PCS) is an area of recovery that is often not discussed. New evidence suggest that new recovery protocols have been recommended and designed to more adequately and efficiently recover from concussions. PCS is a concussion symptom lasting longer than 14 days. Current protocols suggest that the athlete refrain from any physical activity until symptoms free. However, according to the Journal of Athletic Training "A physiological approach to prolonged recovery from sport-related concussion" suggests some aerobic activity may be beneficial to more appropriate healing from concussion, and may lessen the reoccurrence of repeated concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leddy|first=John|date=no. 3, 2017|title=A physiological approach to prolonged recovery from sport-related concussion|url=|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume= 52|pages= 299+|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been promising evidence that blood flow restriction based exercises can be used to improve Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS). "The leading theory supporting this is that human growth hormone is released in response to increased lactate production from exercise, enhancing the brain function and recovery". This exercise based program could potentially be used in conjunction with aerobic therapy to better improve concussion symptoms during the recovery process. Wu, Yi-Ning, "Stable recovery after aerobic exercise with limb blood flow restriction and cooling in individuals with post-concussion syndrome", Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics of North America, p. 437-54. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7179">A [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) is a blow, jolt or penetration to the head that disrupts the function of the brain. Most TBIs are caused by falls, jumps, motor vehicle traffic crashes, being struck by a person or a blunt object, and assault. Student athletes may be put at risk in school sports, creating concern about [[concussion]]s and brain injury.&lt;ref name="mshsaa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interscholastic School Sports Brain Injury Report|url=http://www.mshsaa.org/resources/pdf/IYSBIPreventionReport_1213v2web.pdf|website=Missouri State High School Activities Association|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A concussion&lt;ref name="mayo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concussion|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/concussion/symptoms-causes/dxc-20273155|website=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be caused by
* a direct blow to the head,
* or an indirect blow to the body that causes reactions in the brain.
The result of a concussion is neurological impairment that may resolve spontaneously, but may also have long-term consequences.

== Background==
Many teens engage in [[Extracurricular activity|extracurricular activities]] including sports that can pose risk of injury. Some sports that create a more significant risk of a head injury or concussion include basketball, cheerleading, soccer, and football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=Z.Y.|title=Concussion Rates in U.S. Middle School Athletes, 2015-2016 School Year|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|date=17 May 2017|pmid=28739314|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2017.05.017|volume=53|pages=914–918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drew Brees says women's soccer, cheerleading pose concussion risks second only to football|url=http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/jul/15/drew-brees/drew-brees-says-womens-soccer-cheerleading-pose-co/|website=Politifact|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; High school football accounts for a significant percentage of head injuries that result from high school sports.&lt;ref name="mshsaa"/&gt;

== Prevention ==
Prevention efforts in high school athletics may include:
* Conditioning, teaching and practice of techniques that reduce the chance of injury. For example, a football player who learns the proper way to tackle, spends time in the weight room, and maintains overall good health choices is more likely to avoid situations which put them in harm’s way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concussion Resources for Coaches and Athletic Trainers|url=http://concussiontreatment.com/resources/concussion-resources-for-coaches-and-athletic-trainers/|website=Sports Concussion Institute|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Concussion response programs that take concussions seriously, limit the number of concussions a student may have while continuing to participate in a sport, and that monitor for recovery and residual effects of concussion.&lt;ref name="waekerle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waeckerle|first1=Joseph F.|title=Concussion Management: The Team Plan|url=http://health.mo.gov/living/families/shcn/pdf/ConcussionManagement.pdf|website=Missouri Department of Health &amp; Senior Services|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coaches, parents and students should educate themselves about concussions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Elaine|title=Parents, coaches and doctors learn ways to prevent concussion among young football players|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/parents-coaches-and-doctors-learn-ways-to-prevent-concussion-among-young-football-players|website=UCLA Newsroom|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including knowing the signs of a concussion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sports-Related Concussion: Understanding the Risks, Signs &amp; Symptoms|url=https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/sports-injuries/Pages/Sports-Related-Concussion-Understanding-the-Risks-Signs-Symptoms.aspx|website=healthychildren.org|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being prepared to respond appropriately to incidents of head trauma and concussion.

Schools should implement formal concussion plans that include elements of education, prevention, recognition, evaluation and management, so as to not only reduce the chance of concussion, but to ensure that concussions are promptly diagnosed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sport Concussion Assessment Tool – 3rd edition|url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/47/5/259.full.pdf|website=Sports Concussion Institute|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that concussed student athletes receive proper medical care and are not endangered by a premature return to sports.&lt;ref name="waekerle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Liability for Concussions in Youth Sports|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/psychology/protective_barrier.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduated Return to Play Protocol|url=http://www.concussiontreatment.com/images/SCI_RTP_Illustration.pdf|website=Sports Concussion Institute|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; School concussion plans should also have a formal system for tracking compliance, and for identifying and responding to any deviations from the plan's standards.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

== Signs==
The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] lists of possible signs of concussion that may appear in a student athlete after a jolt to the head or body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heads Up to School Sports|url=https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/highschoolsports/index.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mayo"/&gt; including:
*a dazed appearance,
*confusion,
*forgetfulness,
*lack of confidence in actions,
*clumsiness,
*slower than normal,
*loss of consciousness,
*changes in mood, behavior, or personality, and
*inability to remember events prior to, or after the hit.
An injured student may report any of these signs as well as sensitivity to light or sound, double vision, a headache, or other abnormal feelings. A student who has been diagnosed with a concussion may become frustrated, impatient, and angry about the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concussions: What to Do|url=http://m.kidshealth.org/en/teens/concussions.html|website=Teens Health|publisher=Nemours|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
A concussed player should receive proper medical treatment, and should be excluded from practices and games until cleared to play by a qualified medical professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=James P.|last2=Nichols|first2=John S.|last3=Filley|first3=Christopher M.|title=Concussion in Sports: Guidelines for the Prevention of Catastrophic Outcome|journal=JAMA|date=27 November 1991|volume=266|issue=20|page=2867|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/393493|doi=10.1001/jama.1991.03470200079039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EPODE International Network''' (EIN) is a not for profit, non-governmental organisation that seeks to support [[childhood obesity]]-prevention programmes across the world, via best practice sharing and capacity building.

The name EPODE comes from ‘Ensemble Prévenons l'ObésitéDes Enfants’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borys JM, Le Bodo Y, Jebb SA, Seidell JC, Summerbell C, Richard D, De Henauw S, Moreno LA, Romon M, Visscher TL, Raffin S, Swinburn B, ((EEN Study Group)) |title=EPODE approach for childhood obesity prevention: methods, progress and international development |journal=Obesity Reviews |date=April 2012 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=299–315 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00950.x |pmid=22106871 |pmc=3492853}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Together Let's Prevent Childhood Obesity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dalton|first=Matthew|title=Reporter|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703808904574525462710954426|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPODE International Network (EIN), is a [[Nonprofit organization]], and is a contribution to the response to the need and demand from the global community in the fight against '''childhood obesity''' and [[Non-communicable disease]]s (NCDs), through sustainable and large-sale Community Based Programmes (CBPs) for '''childhood obesity prevention'''.

In light of the encouraging experiences and results of the EPODE methodology&lt;ref name="pubmed_2009 Oct12"/&gt;  (Towns in Belgium that implemented the program saw a 22 per cent decrease in overweight children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tanaka|first=Phyllis|title=Registered Dietitian and Senior Advisor, Food and Nutrition|url=http://www.fcpc.ca/news/food-c|newspaper=Food &amp; Consumer Products of Canada|date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), the EPODE International Network, was created in 2011 as a response to the global demand for action concerning the increasing international prevalence of overweight and [[obesity]] and the related non-communicable diseases. The EPODE International Network works to promote and enhance the global movement to prevent childhood obesity by supporting Community Based Programmes (CBPs) for childhood obesity prevention through sustainable and large-sale strategies that mobilise a multi-stakeholder dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epode-international-network.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Organisation of EPODE International Network==

The EPODE International Network is an NGO, a network of community-based and school-based [[childhood obesity]]-prevention programmes as well as healthy active initiatives aimed at preventing childhood [[adiposity]] &amp; overweight in children. This NGO facilitates the  sharing of experiences, best practices and tools at the global level for continuous improvement and strengthening of its members. EIN also endeavours to ensure the sustainability of CBPs, SBPs &amp; HAIs over time, contributing to the global movement to reduce and prevent childhood overweight and obesity.

The network is coordinated by a dedicated unit and is supported by 3 platforms gathering a broad diversity of actors:

* A Scientific Board and Platform, with 18 internationally recognized experts in the fields of [[nutrition]] and physical activity to provide scientific guidance for the implementation and evaluation processes to prevent childhood obesity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epode-international-network.com/scientific-platform/about&lt;/ref&gt;
* A Ministers’ Club, gathering Ministers, State Secretaries, members of Parliament and Mayors to raise awareness on the childhood obesity issue and to advocate for a strong and sustainable political involvement in the development of CBPs, SBPs &amp; HAIs around the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.epode-international-network.com/minister-club/about&lt;/ref&gt;
* A Public-Private Partnership Platform, linking representatives of the civil society, corporate sector, NGOs and institutions to stimulate multistakeholder, concerted and coordinated partnerships supporting the implementation of CBPs around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epode-international-network.com/public-private-partnerships/about&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the EPODE International Network holds regional and global forums which represent a call for global perspectives, solutions and commitments to solve the obesity and NCDs crisis worldwide.&lt;ref name="epode-international-network.com"&gt;http://www.epode-international-network.com/gof&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives of EPODE International Network: childhood obesity prevention==

EPODE International Network’s overall objective is to build international capacity and capability for multi-partner community-based childhood obesity-prevention programmes (CBPs) in countries by:

# Facilitating best practice sharing between EIN member childhood obesity-prevention programmes
# Providing EIN members visibility at global level
# Gathering leading political representatives to place and maintain childhood obesity prevention at the top of agendas
# Gathering the leading global experts to build greater scientific and field evidence in preventing obesity in children and overweight kids
# Forging links for greater dialogue between all stakeholders from Public, Civic and Private Sectors (civil society, corporate sector, institutions)

The EPODE International Network has more than 30 childhood obesity-prevention programme members in over 20 countries. By 2015 EPODE International Network will involve more than 400,000,000 people worldwide.

==Activities of EPODE International Network==

In order to support its member childhood obesity-prevention programmes, the EIN organises regional and global meetings in order to facilitate best practice sharing and hold capacity building workshops, specific to the needs of its members. The EIN Scientific Advisory Board is also active in providing key support to members of the network in numerous ways and notably providing valuable evaluation support and assisting programme members with the publication of their results.&lt;ref name="epode-international-network.com"/&gt;

Some activities include attempts to curb fast-food outlets near schools.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/20/schools.health&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HS First XI 1907.JPG|thumb|[[Hale School]] First XI (plus schoolmaster) in 1907]]

The '''first XI''', '''first 11''' or '''starting XI''' are the 11 primary players in an organisation's leading team, particularly a [[cricket]] team or [[association football]] team. A player who is considered part of the starting XI is often the most proficient in his/her particular position - for example, a football club's leading goal scorer will almost always be selected due to his ability and the contribution he/she makes to the team.

'First eleven' is a reference to the fact that they are the first eleven players selected to play for the team - many sports state that clubs must have squads of no fewer than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; number of players, and this number is often higher than 11. For example, in the [[Premier League]], each club has to designate a squad of 25.

The '''Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports''' ('''FIRS'''; {{lang-en|'''International Federation of Roller Sports'''}}) was the world governing body for [[roller sport]]s, including [[skateboarding]], [[rink hockey]], [[inline hockey]], [[speed skating]], inline alpine, downhill, [[roller derby]], roller freestyle, inline freestyle and artistic roller skating. It was established in April 1924 in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]] by two Swiss sportsmen, [[Fred Renkewitz]] and [[Otto Myer]], who had close connections to the [[International Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollersports.org/content/about.html|title=Hystory of the Organization of FIRS|publisher=FIRS|accessdate=29 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301151208/http://www.rollersports.org/content/about.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arisf.org/fed-26-firs_f_d_ration_internationale_roller_sports|title=ARISF Association of IOC Recognised International Sport Federation|first=Immagica Comunicazione S.r.l. -|last=www.immagica.it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/fr/federation-internationale-de-roller-sports|title=FÉDÉRATION INTERNATIONALE DE ROLLER SPORTS - Sport Olympique|date=27 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FIRS gathered more than 100 national federations, including countries from every continent and they are affiliated with the [[International Skating Union]].  [[Park terrain skateboarding]] will become an Olympic sport in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shop-eat-surf.com/content/olympic-announcement-precedes-first-park-terrain-skateboarding-world-championships|title=Olympic Announcement Precedes First Park Terrain Skateboarding World Championships|first=Magda Liszewska|last=Hernandez|date=9 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposal to dissolve the federation and merge with the [[International Skateboarding Federation]] to form a new body known as [[World Skate]] was ratified in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://hoqueipt.com/artigo.aspx?id=1810&lt;/ref&gt;

==FIRS==
The FIRS aimed to foster the Roller Sports movement and participation on a global scale. Its areas of responsibility were as follows:
# Administration and Regulations
# Organizing international competitions
# Developing the movement worldwide
# Promoting

The authority of FIRS was recognized by the following organizations:
* [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC)
* [[General Association of International Sports Federations]] (GAISF)
* [[International World Games Association]] (IWGA)
* [[Pan American Sports Organization]] (PASO)

FIRS recognized the following continental confederations:
* Africa - [[African Confederation of Sports of Roller Skating]] (ACSRS)
* Europe - [[Confédération Européenne de Roller Skating]] (CERS)
* Asia - [[Confederation of Asia Roller Sports]] (CARS)
* Oceania - [[Oceania Confederation of Roller Sports]] (OCRS)
* The Americas - [[Confederación Panamericana de Roller Sports]] (CPRS)

Each continental confederation comprises or recognizes, in turn, various national governing bodies and associations.

Skating is considered to be one of the most complete physical exercises that exist and enjoys huge popularity on a world level. According to the latest estimations, there are more than 40 million habitual users of recreational skates throughout the world.

{{POV|date=August 2017}}
The '''Gokhale Method''' or '''Primal Posture''' method is a postural awareness technique developed by [[acupuncturist]] and yoga instructor Esther Gokhale.&lt;ref name="Khaleeli 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khaleeli|first1=Homa|title=A simple cure for back pain: grow up in the Ecuadorian mountains|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2015/jun/10/a-simple-cure-for-back-pain-grow-up-in-the-ecuadorian-mountains|accessdate=April 21, 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method proposes that certain patterns exist in the way people in pre-modern and less industrialized societies move and adopt posture. Gokhale claims that these patterns, which she calls ''{{dfn|primal posture}}'', can be learned through practice. The method became popular in the beginning of the 2010s among professionals in the [[Silicon Valley]], where Gokhale is located.&lt;ref name="Schoenfeld 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schoenfeld|first1=Amy|title=Soothing Back Pain by Learning How to Sit Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/business/soothing-back-pain-by-learning-how-to-sit-again.html|accessdate= February 11, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kriegman 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kriegman|first1=Mitchell|title=The Gokhale Method|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/may/13/gokhale-method/|accessdate=February 11, 2017|work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Esther Gokhale teaching at Ancestral Health Symposium 2013.png|thumb|Esther Gokhale teaching at the [[Ancestral Health Symposium]] in 2013.|200x200px]]
Gokhale started searching for a method to cope with her own back pain,&lt;ref name="Kriegman 2014" /&gt; including [[sciatica]] and [[spinal disc herniation]] which began with her first pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doucleff|first1=Michaeleen|title=Lost Posture: Why Some Indigenous Cultures May Not Have Back Pain|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/08/412314701/lost-posture-why-indigenous-cultures-dont-have-back-pain|accessdate=April 21, 2017|work=[[NPR]]|date=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She based the method on training in the [[Feldenkrais Method]] and from a French organization for postural awareness called the Aplomb Institute.&lt;ref name="Schoenfeld 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref
name="Wallace 2013" /&gt; Gokhale also spent ten years observing and photographing people's posture in less industrialized societies.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Charles|title=Exercises to tackle bad posture can avert back surgery|url=https://www.ft.com/content/92e767ea-6417-11e3-98e2-00144feabdc0|accessdate=April 21, 2017|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=December 16, 2013|archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.ft.com/content/92e767ea-6417-11e3-98e2-00144feabdc0|archivedate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaswani 2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/columns/you/sit-up-smart/articleshow/56721166.cms|title=Sit up smart|date=January 23, 2017|work=[[Bangalore Mirror]]|publisher=[[Bennett, Coleman and Co]]|last1=Vaswani|first1=Anjana|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gokhale started teaching in a studio at [[Palo Alto]], California.&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt;

The result of Esther Gokhale's observations was an eight-step method that emphasizes a posture with a J-shaped spine as the ideal form, created through repositioning the pelvis.&lt;ref name="Schoenfeld 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt; The method emphasizes training posture through everyday activities, rather than exercise,&lt;ref name="Kriegman 2014" /&gt; and involves as much {{em|unlearning}} former habits of [[poor posture]] as learning new habits of good posture.

The method quickly caught on in the [[Bay Area]], as she has been described as the "posture guru of Silicon Valley".&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt; Apart from the United States, the method has been taught in the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2013" /&gt;

However, one of the main assumptions of the Gokhale Method, that people in less industrialized societies have less back pain,&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt; is incorrect: mainstream science states back pain occurs to a similar extent in all cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Duthey B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4810">A '''golf course superintendent''' is a person who professionally manages the labor, time, materials and financial resources needed to care for the [[turfgrass]] and landscaped grounds on a [[golf course]]. Golf course superintendents have also been referred to as [[greenskeeper]]s and turf managers. Golf course superintendents are concerned with the environmental health of the golf course, the sporting needs of the players and the financial sustainability of the golf club or [[country club]] for which they work. Golf course superintendents communicate the status of the grounds and maintenance resources to members of the club’s management, owners or [[board of directors]], green chairs and committees, golfers, vendors, suppliers, golf professionals, golf course architects and others in the golf industry. Their management strategies must also align with the golf club business’ environmental and philanthropic role in the community. 

Golf course superintendents carefully monitor the natural weather patterns, environment and other influences that affect the playing areas and landscapes with which golfers interact. Golf course superintendents monitor the health of the golf course environment through careful study, diagnosis and treatment of disease and injury to the golf course’s turfgrass fairways, tees and greens areas, as well as bunkers, areas of [[water hazard]], naturalized areas and trees. Their skilled management of the course is accomplished through a detailed knowledge of biology, chemistry, [[plant pathology]] and [[entomology]]. Golf course superintendents can be officially certified by the [[Golf Course Superintendents Association of America]] '''(GCSAA)'''.

==Certified Golf Course Superintendent==
A Certified Golf Course Superintendent is one that has voluntarily met the requirements set forth by the GCSAA to receive the professional distinction of a CGCS.  The requirements to qualify for eligibility into the certification program vary depending on years of education, focus of the education, continuing education credits received, and the number of years as a class "A” Superintendent.   Once eligible, one must complete a portfolio of work samples, case studies, and skill statements.  This portfolio must be completed and approved by two existing Certified Superintendents.  In addition to the completed portfolio, a rigorous closed book exam must be passed.  Finally, the superintendents current facility must be inspected, evaluated, and "passed" by two current Certified Superintendents.  Once certified, superintendents must partake in a required amount of education classes and service activities as well as uphold a code of ethics, specific to those of the CGCS distinction.

== Job responsibilities ==
 {{see also|Turf management#Golf courses|Greenskeeper|Equipment manager}}
Golf course superintendents skillfully maintain a course’s [[turfgrass]], which is considered to be a manufactured product because it is specifically planted, raised and maintained to provide players with a surface on which to play golf. There is a science-based process behind the turfgrass they produce which involves various steps and stages throughout the year.  The average golf course superintendent makes between $70&amp;ndash;80,000 a year.  On more prestigious courses they can make over $150,000 a year. As of the year 2010, there were superintendents making over $400,000 a year, some of whom got that salary directly and others considering benefits such as, but not limited to: free house, free vehicle, free gasoline and holiday bonuses.

A '''modular stadium''' or the '''Legacy Modular Stadium'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycommercialnews.com/article/id38724|title= Daily Commercial News: Temporary BC Lions stadium the first of its kind in North America |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalofcommerce.com/article/id39401|title= Journal of Commerce: Overlay work wraps up Empire Field construction in Vancouver|date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vancouversun.com/sports/Welcome+Empire+Field+Lions+fans/3162075/story.html?tab=PHOT|title= Vancouver Sun: Welcome to Empire Field, Lions Fans |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_pictures/europe/germany/hessen/wiesbaden_brita.shtml|title= Modular Stadium: Brita-Arena, Germany|accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fussballtempel.net/caf/LBA/Hugo_Chavez.html|title= Modular Stadium: Hugo Chávez Stadium, Baninah|accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a sports facility that is constructed of modular components. In contrast to a temporary stadium, modular stadiums are not time-limited constructions, but rather permanent ones. The actual structure is thereby built without the use of concrete. The focus here is on the [[steel construction]]. Individual elements are used for modular construction, making it possible to enlarge or downsize even after actual completion. Due to this method, the structures remain flexible, reusable, and when necessary, can be adapted to new requirements with minimal effort – for instance, when a soccer club advances to the next highest league. 

For many years, permanently installed sports facilities and arenas were regarded as the measure of all things – not lastly for reasons of prestige. In the meantime, however, other values now take precedence: Events like the [[Olympic Games]] or World Cups can only be fully accepted today when they consider sustainability. This includes, on the one hand, efficient environmental management – beginning with traffic issues and culminating with the environmentally friendly disposal of consumables. Just as important, since it is of long-term significance, is the aspect of reusing sports facilities when the athletes have moved on. 

Even though modular stadiums are built for permanent, long-term use, they still unite the many advantages offered by temporary construction, because they are quickly and cost-efficiently built with prefabricated modules. The modular construction also has another great benefit, which will become even more significant in the future: Suppose that a modular, and therefore removable stadium with 45,000 seats is in planning for a World Cup - the modules of the stadium can be used afterward to build several small permanent facilities. 
This might be, for example, a stadium to seat 25,000 for a soccer club and a stadium with a capacity for 20,000 with track and field facilities, or several smaller facilities with seating for 5 to 10,000 to accommodate smaller clubs. In this manner, the original stadium can be transformed into a 100 percent constructively used, sustainable solution. A permanent stadium that relies on concrete construction is a candidate for nearly total demolition, in order to make it disappear. The components of a removable Stadium, however, are able to be comparatively easily taken apart and can be used again to a great extent for other building projects for the legacy. 

In connection with Qatar's successful bid to host the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], there have already been design concepts created for the construction of modular stadiums and even plans submitted for modular extensions of existing sports facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funzug.com/index.php/architecture/qatar-stadiums-for-fifa-2022-world-cup.html |title= Qatar Stadiums for Fifa 2022 World Cup |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockingfacts.com/qatars-2022-world-cup-stadium-concepts/ |title= Qatar’s 2022 World Cup Stadium Concepts |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also connected with Morocco's unsuccessful bid for the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]].

A '''mountain sport''' or '''Alpine sport''' is one of several types of [[sport]] that take place in [[hill]]y or [[mountain]]ous terrain.

All these sports require special equipment, carry a higher level of [[risk]] and require specialised [[training]] before they can be undertaken safely.

Because mountain [[sportsmen]] deliberately go into terrain that is not easily accessible where there are higher risks – dangers such as [[avalanche]]s, bad [[weather]], [[mudflow]]s, [[rockfall]]s and [[icefall]]s - special measures must be taken to mitigate these risks. This is generally known as [[risk management]].
Mountain sports include the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpenverein.de/Bergsport/aktiv-sein/ ''Bergsport für alle ...Seien Sie aktiv'']. Zusammenfassung der Bergsportarten, online auf alpenverein.de, retrieved 1 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mountaineering]]
*[[Climbing]]
*[[Klettersteig]] or [[via ferrata]] climbing
*[[Ski touring]], [[ski mountaineering]] and its [[freeriding]]
*[[Snowshoe]]ing
*[[Hiking]], especially [[Hillwalking]]
*[[Mountain biking]] (partly)
*[[Trekking]]
*[[Canyoning]]

The usual [[skiing]] on [[piste]]s is not generally counted as a mountain sport, because the use of prepared slopes and the corresponding legal standards reduce risks to a minimum, so that the skier or snowboarder does not have to take account of any significant risks.

== Mountain sport tourism ==
Many mountain schools offer the various mountain sports as guided tours. These enable beginners to try out the various activities under supervision. The leaders of these tours know the likely risks on their tour routes and accompany the party. Some of these tours are targeted at specific groups, such as guided Alpine crossings for beginners, intermediates, older people or singles.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Merhi: [http://blog.guiders.de/bergwanderung/erfahrungsbericht-einer-alpenuberquerung/#more-3979 ''Erfahrungsbericht einer Alpenüberquerung'']. Report dated 26 August 2013. Online at guiders.de, retrieved 1 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

These tours have adapted to the changes in travel behaviour of tourists observed in recent years. For example, studies by the University of Berne have found that travellers expect increasingly individualized and flexible travel deals. They are mainly looking for deals that provide varied and intense experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Hansruedi Müller: [http://www.fif.unibe.ch/unibe/wiso/fif/content/e6012/e6025/e6037/e6184/Alpentourismus_Montagna_ger.pdf ''Der Alpentourismus vor großen Herausforderungen''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150655/http://www.fif.unibe.ch/unibe/wiso/fif/content/e6012/e6025/e6037/e6184/Alpentourismus_Montagna_ger.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }} (PDF, 26 kB). Online at fif.unibe.ch, retrieved 1 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mountain sports and conservation ==
Because mountain sports usually take place in area of relatively unspoilt nature, it is important that participants ensure their activities are carried out in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly way. For this reason guidelines have been prepared by the various mountaineering and alpine clubs. These say, for example, that plants may be photographed but not picked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpenverein.de/natur-umwelt/bergsport-und-umwelt/bergsteigen-wandern-natur_aid_10289.html ''Naturverträglich unterwegs'']. Maßnahmen zum Naturschutz im Bergsport. Online at alpenverein.de, retrieved 1 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these measures the [[Alpine countries]] and the [[EU]] have agreed a framework programme for pan-Alpine policy. The agreement is also known as the [[Alpine Convention]] and, in addition to conservation, also covers planning, sustainable development, mountain farming, countryside conservation, mountain forests, tourism, soil protextion, energy and transport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/ius/alpen/ ''Alpenkonvention''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130901130357/http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/ius/alpen/ |date=2013-09-01 }}.

'''Muzeum Sportu i Turystyki w Warszawie''' is a museum in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. It was established in 1952 and is one of the oldest of its type in Europe.

The museum holds a permanent exhibition entitled “The history of Polish Sport and Olympic Movement” which covers the history of sport from Ancient Greece until the modern era.  Visitors can see sports gear, medals, trophies, antiques and other historic objects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muzeumsportu.waw.pl/en/exhibitions&lt;/ref&gt;

Accumulated collections contain over 46 thousand exhibits, sport trophies, like medals, cups and diplomas, as well as outfits and equipment. The museum also contains a big variety of books, pictures, newspapers, postcards as well as audio and video materials.

The '''National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing''' ('''NASCAR''') makes and enforces numerous rules and regulations that transcend all racing series.

[[NASCAR]] issues a different rule book for each racing series; however, rule books are published exclusively for NASCAR members and are not made available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/guides/customer_service/nascar_contact.html NASCAR.com] FAQ/Customer service Retrieved 1/29/07&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many of the rules, such as the scoring system, have been widely publicized both by NASCAR and the media.

==Car livery==
Each car is required to display its number on each door of the car and on its roof. The front of the car and bottom of the rear bumper are required to match the decal specifications of the car manufacturer. Each car is required to display a series of around 30 NASCAR sponsor decals just to the left of each door and on the front fenders. These [[Contingency sponsorship|contingency decals]] represent series sponsors and bonus money teams are eligible to earn during the race, but may be omitted in the event in which they conflict with the team's sponsors or moral beliefs.&lt;ref name="ESPN-Contingency-20083"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/icons/news/story?id=3315850|title=Contingency stickers fill front fenders and help with bottom line|last1=Borden|first1=Brett|date=April 11, 2008|website=[[ESPN|espn.go.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-20154"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|title=NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series &amp; Whelen Modified Tour Rulebook|date=2015|website=[[Waterford Speedbowl|speedbowlct.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623101256/http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series sponsor's logo is displayed on top of the windshield, called the windshield header or windshield banner.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-Xfinity-Trucks-20153"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/10/22/nascar-xfinity-camping-world-truck-series-2015-rules-enhancements-qualifying-logos.html|title=ENHANCEMENTS UNVEILED FOR XFINITY, TRUCK SERIES|author1=Staff report|date=October 22, 2014|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-20154" /&gt;

Beginning in 2013, the livery layout for the NASCAR Cup Series was altered, coinciding with the change to the [[Car of Tomorrow#Gen 6 era|Generation 6]] model car. In lieu of the series sponsor like in lower series, the windshield prominently features the last name of the driver (as well as first name or first initial in the case of siblings and family members, as is the case for both Busch brothers, or suffixes for drivers such as [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Martin Truex, Jr.]]) placed in the center of the windshield header. Logos of the manufacturer are placed on each corner of the upper windshield. Number and sponsor logos were barred from being placed on the headlights and taillights, as not to obstruct each car model's unique characteristics. A new location for a single sponsor logo, however, was added to the rear of the roof adjacent to the number.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-NewLook-Gen6-13"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Official Release|title=NEW LOOK READY FOR 2013 SPRINT CUP CAR|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2012/11/17/nascar-reveals-2013-sprint-cup-car.html|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Daytona Beach, Florida]]|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a new layout was created for participants in the [[NASCAR Chase for the Championship]], requiring the cars to feature yellow roof numbers, front splitters and front fascias. The background of the windshield header would also be colored yellow, with the driver's name displayed in black lettering. A new Chase for the Championship logo would replace the normal NASCAR Cup Series logo in the contingency group. A decal would also be placed next to the driver's name above the door to signify each win a driver earned that season.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-ChaseScheme-2014"&gt;{{cite web|author1=NASCAR Official Release|title=NASCAR TO USE SPECIAL PAINT SCHEME FOR CHASE CONTENDERS|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/7/15/nascar-special-paint-scheme-chase-for-nascar-sprint-cup-contenders.html|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Daytona Beach, Florida]]|date=July 15, 2014|authorlink1=NASCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2015, the liveries of the [[Xfinity Series|Xfinity]] and [[Camping World Truck Series]] would feature the driver's last name on the upper rear window.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-Xfinity-Trucks-2015"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Staff report|title=ENHANCEMENTS UNVEILED FOR XFINITY, TRUCK SERIES|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/10/22/nascar-xfinity-camping-world-truck-series-2015-rules-enhancements-qualifying-logos.html|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2017, the Monster Energy logo is now on the front windshield with the driver name moving to the rear windshield in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]].

Outside of these requirements, teams may design the car and place sponsor logos in NASCAR-approved locations, and must submit all paint and graphics schemes and all sponsor identity to NASCAR in advance for approval.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-2015"/&gt; One paint scheme requirement for example is that both the driver and passenger side of the car must share the same color pattern, though the front and rear may be different colors. This safety rule, to avoid confusion for spotters, NASCAR officials, and other drivers, was brought into light in October 2014 at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]], when [[Terry Labonte]]'s [[Go FAS Racing]] team painted his {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 32 car in two different color schemes as a tribute to the two-time champion, but prior to NASCAR approval. NASCAR allowed the team to retain the scheme for knock-out qualifying, but forced them to match the two sides for the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pockrass|first1=Bob|title=NASCAR won't OK tribute paint scheme for Terry Labonte|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2014-10-18/nascar-wont-ok-tribute-paint-scheme-for-terry-labonte|website=[[Sporting News]]|publisher=[[Sporting News]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Talladega, Alabama]]|date=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2016, it seems that NASCAR has either quietly removed this rule or allowed teams to race with a split-side scheme as long as they got the permission to do so, as seen with [[John Hunter Nemechek]]'s {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 8 truck in the [[2016 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series|2016]] [[American Ethanol E15 225]] and both the {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 3 and {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 31 cars of RDV Compétition during the [[2016 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series]].

Teams apply to NASCAR for the use of a car number, and pay for the rights to the number's likeness. NASCAR legally owns and controls all rights to car numbers.&lt;ref name=NASCAR-RCRDillon3Cup-Dec2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series &amp; Whelen Modified Tour Rulebook|url=http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|website=[[Waterford Speedbowl|speedbowlct.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623101256/http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When drivers change teams, the team owner usually retains the number. Unlike in other series, such as the [[International Race of Champions|former IROC Series]], there is no provision for the defending series champion or the points leader to adopt car number 1; it is available to any team. Only one number, No. 61, in the [[Whelen Modified Tour]], has been retired, in memory of nine-time series champion [[Richie Evans]], who was killed at [[Martinsville Speedway]] practicing for the final race of the 1985 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Albert|first1=Zach|title=RETIRING THE NO. 24?

The number 3 for example, used by [[Dale Earnhardt]] and his car owner [[Richard Childress]], has been unofficially retired for all teams and drivers except for an Earnhardt or Childress family member, with Childress paying a licensing fee while the number was out of circulation from 2001 to 2013.&lt;ref name=NASCAR-RCRDillon3Cup-Dec2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruce|first1=Kenny|title=DILLON TO DRIVE NO. 3 SPRINT CUP CAR FOR RCR|url=http://www.nascar.com/content/nascar/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/12/11/austin-dillon-driving-number-3-car-dale-earnhardt-sprint-cup-series.html|website=[[NASCAR]].com|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=August 21, 2014|location=[[Concord, North Carolina]]|date=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coble|first1=Don|title=NASCAR's numbers game: Names taking a backseat in big business of branding|url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/racing/2013-02-11/story/nascars-numbers-game#|accessdate=12 June 2016|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|date=February 11, 2013|location=[[Daytona Beach, Florida]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, a number has been relinquished due to a sponsor leaving a team. After the 2002 season, [[Robert Yates Racing]] switched from their longtime number 28 to 38 after sponsor [[Texaco]]-[[Havoline]] ceased their sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=[[Knight Ridder]]|title=The late Davey Allison made the No. 28 car famous.|url=http://billingsgazette.com/sports/the-late-davey-allison-made-the-no-car-famous/article_cc0b8d0b-8c59-5123-8e13-20a78ed9b896.html|accessdate=12 June 2016|work=[[Billings Gazette]]|date=January 18, 2003|location=[[Mooresville, North Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rudd, Sadler, put the "silly" into silly season|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/rudd-sadler-put-the-silly-into-silly-season/|accessdate=12 June 2016|work=[[Motorsport.com]]|date=August 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams can run numbers from 0 to 99 (as well as 00 to 09), but no two cars can display the same number during a race.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-2015"/&gt; Teams that run 00 to 09 are listed as 100 to 109 for NASCAR's scoring purposes. Except for those numbers (which have been used for full-time teams), part-time teams may be assigned a three-digit number for scoring purposes only (such as Nos. 141 and 241). If two such teams arrive with the same two digit number, the team higher in championship points prevails, and the other team will be forced to change their number for the race.

==Sponsorship==

===Tobacco===
Although NASCAR has a long history of tobacco sponsorship, following the [[2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2003 season]], longtime NASCAR partner [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]] declined to renew their [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] sponsorship of the Cup Series, replaced by Nextel Corporation.&lt;ref name=TobaccoFreeKids-NASCAR-03&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myers|first1=Matthew L.|title=NASCAR Choice of Non-Tobacco Sponsor Is A Victory for Kids, Health and Auto Racing|url=http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press_releases/post/id_0658|website=tobaccofreekids.org|publisher=Tobacco-Free Kids|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|date=June 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] passed new regulations preventing sponsorship for cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products in any sporting event, including auto racing events. The announcement affected two teams: the No. 33 Truck of [[Ron Hornaday, Jr.]] and [[Kevin Harvick, Inc.]] lost its [[Swedish Match|Longhorn Moist Snuff]] sponsorship, while the No. 27 Nationwide Series car of [[Baker Curb Racing]] lost its [[Red Man]] sponsorship.&lt;ref name=SportsBuisnessDigest-Tobacco-NASCAR-10&gt;{{cite web|title=Ending an era: Tobacco sponsorship in NASCAR|url=http://sportsbusinessdigest.com/2010/06/ending-an-era-tobacco-sponsorship-in-nascar/|website=Sports Business Digest|publisher=Sports Business Digest|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker Curb would shut its doors the next year due to lack of sponsorship.

In spite of the legislation, tobacco sponsorship continues in the sports through [[electronic cigarette]]s, with companies such as Green Smoke, [[blu eCigs|blu]] (owned by R.J. Reynolds), and Arrowhead sponsoring NASCAR teams. A brand of [[herbal smokeless tobacco]], Smokey Mountain, has also sponsored drivers such as Hornaday, [[Johnny Sauter]], [[Brian Scott]], and [[Daniel Hemric]].

===Viceroy rule===
Though [[NASCAR]] typically promotes competition between multiple brands, including those that sponsor the sport and individual races, the sanctioning body provides exclusive protection to its series title sponsors, such as [[Monster Energy]] in the Cup Series, as well as current fuel supplier [[Sunoco]].&lt;ref name=Savannah-Sprint-Sunoco-2007/&gt; This policy, known as the '''Viceroy rule''', prevents sponsorship from direct competitors within a certain series, although it does not prevent a company from moving to a different series within the sport, or advertising a product that does not directly conflict with the title sponsor. For example, [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Texaco]] and other oil companies have been allowed to promote their motor oil brands ([[Pennzoil]] and [[Havoline]] respectively) but not their gasoline products.&lt;ref name=Savannah-Sprint-Sunoco-2007/&gt; When a new title sponsor creates conflicts with existing team sponsors, NASCAR typically allows the team sponsors to remain under a [[grandfather clause]].&lt;ref name="Westmoreland-Viceroy-Sep2007"/&gt; The rule is named after the British cigarette brand [[Viceroy (cigarette)|Viceroy]], and is in reference to the [[1972 USAC Championship Car season]] during which title sponsor [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] renounced its branding when Viceroy entered the sport to sponsor entries.&lt;ref name=SBJ-NASCAR-Viceroy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yost|first1=Mark|title=History shows NASCAR the high stakes of sponsor conflict|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2007/04/20070402/Opinion/History-Shows-NASCAR-The-High-Stakes-Of-Sponsor-Conflict.aspx|website=[[Advance Publications|Sports Business Journal]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=April 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MassLive-NASCAR-Verizon&gt;{{cite web|author1=NASCAR|title=Verizon Wireless shifts its racing sponsorship from NASCAR to IndyCar|url=http://blog.masslive.com/racinwithjason/2010/12/verizon_wireless_shifts_its_racing_sponsorship_from_nascar_to_indycar.html|website=[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|MassLive.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publication]], [[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=December 10, 2010|authorlink1=NASCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special rules for combination races==
A combination race is a race run between multiple series that operate under compatible rules packages. During NASCAR's combination races (currently the two K&amp;N Pro Series ([[K&amp;N Pro Series East|East]] and [[K&amp;N Pro Series West|West]]), and formerly the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]]/[[K&amp;N Pro Series West|Winston West Series]] and [[Xfinity Series|Busch Series]]/[[K&amp;N Pro Series East|Busch North Series]]), there is one race, but points are scored for both series. In previous years, drivers were given points based on how they finished among competitors from the same series. For 2017, drivers will receive points in their series based on their actual finish in the race among all competitors. However, drivers who declare they are running for a championship in both series (East &amp; West) will be awarded points in both series, provided they have the appropriate license for both.

Special rules apply as two teams will have the same number. The fastest lap time in qualifying determines which team will have the number for the race, and which team must temporarily change the number for the race. For example, during the [[1991 NASCAR Busch Series|1991 Busch Series]] season, there were selected races in the Northeast ([[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|Loudon]], [[Nazareth Speedway|Nazareth]], [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]], [[Oxford Plains Speedway|Oxford]]) where both the Busch Grand National (now [[Xfinity Series|Xfinity]]) and Busch Grand National North (now K&amp;N Pro East) Series raced in combination races. North team [[Ricky Craven]] (also drove his car) and Grand National team Don Beverly Racing ([[Jimmy Hensley]] driving) both used No. 25. Whoever had the faster qualifying time in each race used No. 25. Craven used No. 28 at Oxford when Hensley had the faster time, while Hensley used No. 5 when Craven had the faster time at Loudon. Both teams, however, scored respective owner points for the No. 25 in their respective series.

==Car and driver changes==
Teams must use a single car from the start of the first practice session through the end of the race. Teams that crash a car in practice or qualifying may go to a backup car, but racing a different car from the one that qualified results in that car having to start at the rear of the field.

Engine and transmission changes are prohibited during a race weekend. Xfinity and Truck Series engines must last two race weekends, excluding restrictor plate races. Changing either will result in starting in the rear of the field. Transmission changes are allowed during road course weekends and during the race weekends at [[Pocono Raceway]]. In addition, during [[Speedweeks]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] teams are allowed one free engine change between the qualifying races and final practice session.

Driver changes are permitted, however starting the race with a different driver than whom qualified the car will result in the car starting at the rear of the field. Driver changes during the race are permitted as well, performed during pit stops, but a team must incur any loss in position due to time spent swapping drivers. The driver who starts the race earns all the points, statistics, and purse money.&lt;ref name=Motorsport-Substitute-SadlerBowyer-2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spivey|first1=Julian|title=NASCAR's substitute driver rule ...

==Caution flag and restart procedure==
When the yellow flag is displayed and the yellow caution lights around the track come on, the field is frozen immediately at the moment of caution. All scoring ends immediately and cars are to slow to [[Safety car|pace vehicle (safety car)]] speed. Cars will line up behind the pace vehicle in the order in which they passed the last scoring loop on track (there are as many as 18 loops around the track, although the one at the start/finish line is the only one that counts for official race statistics). The exception to this rule is if the yellow flag waves after the white flag is thrown (or, in the case of an overtime attempt, if the yellow flag waves after the race leader has crossed the overtime line) or if the race will not be restarted (typically for rain; but sometimes for darkness if a track does not have night lights), in which case NASCAR will use video evidence to determine the finishing order.

When the caution comes out, the pit lane is immediately closed, a rule first implemented following the 1989 [[Atlanta 500]]. This is shown by a flashing red light at the entrance to pit road. Entering pit road when it is closed (with certain exceptions) is a penalty of restarting at the rear of the field.  When pit road is open, a steady green light will appear at the entrance to pit road, and a green light will come on in the rear window of the pace vehicle.

During a "quickie yellow" all cars may enter pit road the first time by when it is opened. After the pit stops, the first car one lap down at the moment of caution (known as the free pass car) is permitted to go around the pace car and start the race at the rear of the field, but back on the lead lap.

During a full yellow, only lead lap cars may pit the first time by the pit road. Once the lead lap cars who have decided to pit have entered pit road, the free pass car will be sent around the pace car to earn their lap back. The next time by, all cars (including the free pass car) may pit.

Cars may pit as often as they wish at the expense of track position, but the free pass car is limited to taking fuel only at the first pit stop opportunity. If the free pass car is judged to have caused the caution (intentionally or not) there will be no free pass car.

At the one to go signal, the pace car will turn its lights off. At this point, any car that is ahead of the leader of the race will be waved around to the rear of the field. These cars are not permitted to pit until after the green flag comes back out and the race has resumed. The field will then line up double file for the restart. The leader of the race gets lane choice, but the third place car (and odd positions on back) will always start in the inside line, while the fourth place car (and even positions on back) will always start in the outside lane. The restart order is always this: Lead Lap Cars &gt; Cars 1 or more laps down &gt; Free Pass Car &gt; Wave Arounds &gt; Cars who have received a penalty.

Once the pace car has pulled into the pits, there is a restart "zone" consisting of lines painted on the outside wall of the track. The leader of the race is to begin accelerating inside this zone to resume the race. If they do not, the flagman controls the restart. The second place car may not be ahead of the leader at the moment of green flag, however either car on the front row may cross the start/finish line first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/09/15/nascar-drivers-meeting-restarts-chicagoland.html|title=NASCAR clarifies restart rules to drivers|last=Albert|first=Zack|publisher=NASCAR Media Group, LLC.|date=September 15, 2013|website=NASCAR.com|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing is not permitted until the leader of the race crosses the start-finish line. Lane changes are also not permitted until after a car clears the finish line.

Per the NASCAR rule book, a restart is official once the legal lead car crosses the start/finish line. If the green flag is waved, but NASCAR calls off the restart because of an incident before the leader crosses the start/finish line, the restart is deemed aborted.

==Flags==
{{main article|Racing flags}}
Like most other sanctioning bodies, NASCAR will use flags to provide the drivers with information regarding track conditions. NASCAR, not adhering to the [[FIA]] rules (despite NASCAR being a member club of [[Automobile Competition Committee for the United States|ACCUS]], the U.S. motor racing sporting authority and representative to the [[FIA World Motor Sport Council]]), does not use the flag system outlined in the FIA International Sporting Code. Major differences include that in NASCAR (and other championships in [[North America]]) the white flag is used to signal that the leader is on the last lap, in FIA ISC regulated events (such as [[Formula One]] and most European championships) it is used to signal that a slower car is on track. Also, the blue flag specified in the FIA ISC does not have a diagonal stripe, and the black flag means that a driver is disqualified.

|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Green.svg|left|40px|Green Flag]]|| The '''green flag''' indicates that the race has started or restarted. It is shown by the official in the flag stand when the leader enters the designated restart zone, which is located a short distance before the start/finish line.
|-
|[[File:Green-white checkered flag.png|left|40px|Green and White Checkered Flag]]
|The '''green and white checkered flag''' is shown to indicate the end of a race stage. After the top 10 drivers cross the start/finish line, the caution flag is displayed.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Yellow.svg|left|40px|Yellow Flag]]
|The '''yellow flag''', or '''caution flag''', indicates a hazard on the track&amp;nbsp;— most often an accident, but sometimes also for debris, light rain, emergency vehicles entering (usually on short tracks with no tunnel) or a scheduled competition caution (usually used for races that have been postponed due to inclement weather). All cars must slow down and follow the [[pace car]]. Passing is not allowed under the yellow flag. NASCAR experimented the "local yellow" flag in road courses; cautions apply to the entire circuit, including road courses.
|-
|[[File:F1 red flag.svg|left|40px|Red Flag]]
|The '''red flag''' indicates that the race has been stopped. This may happen due to a large accident (such as a multi-car wreck like [[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]], inclement weather),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nascar.speedtv.com/article/cup-rain-pounds-pocono-raceway/ |title=CUP: Pocono Race Under Red Flag |publisher=Nascar.speedtv.com |date=2012-08-01 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; track repair (such as damaged catch fencing), or for severe track cleaning (such as the final laps, when NASCAR may clean the entire track to ensure the race can finish under green flag conditions, and to do so with the track clean of oil from engine failure or crashes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nascar.about.com/b/2012/02/27/red-flag-for-flaming-jet-dryer.htm |title=Red Flag For Flaming Jet Dryer |publisher=Nascar.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cars may be ordered into the pits or on the track depending on conditions; red flags for inclement weather generally result in all cars parking in the pits. Race teams are not permitted to repair or adjust cars during red flag conditions. However, drivers may exit their cars, and they may be provided with water, food or other necessities. This flag is also used with the black flag to signal the end of a practice or qualifying session. 
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing White.svg|left|40px|White Flag]]
|The '''white flag''' indicates one lap remaining in the race. More specifically, it indicates that all drivers will be scored for at most 1 more lap after passing the white flag.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Chequered.svg|left|40px|Checkered Flag]]
|The '''checkered flag''' indicates that the race is over.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Black.svg|left|40px|Black Flag]]
|The '''black flag''' indicates that a driver must pit immediately. This flag is shown if the driver or pit crew violates a rule (e.g., speeding through the pits), if the vehicle has sufficient mechanical damage that it is a hazard to other drivers, if the vehicle cannot maintain the minimum required speed (varies by track; typically disclosed in the pre-race drivers' meeting), or if a driver has been driving overly aggressively. In the event of a failure of the in-car radio, NASCAR will, at the team's request, display the black flag to signal a driver to pit, one time only.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing White Cross.svg|left|40px|Black Flag with a White Cross]]
|The '''black flag with a white cross''' indicates that a driver is no longer being scored. This is normally shown if a driver does not respond to a black flag within three laps.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Blue.svg|left|40px|Blue Flag with a Yellow Stripe]]
|The '''blue flag with a yellow stripe''' is shown to warn slow drivers of faster cars approaching. NASCAR rarely black-flags drivers for not obeying this flag; however, it is frequently displayed and warnings may be given if it is blatant (such as a lapped driver blocking for a teammate). NASCAR uses the yellow diagonal stripe on the blue flag because the flag is usually displayed on top of the starter's stand, and not at eye-level to the driver from the track.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Plain Blue.svg|left|40px|Blue Flag]]
|The '''blue flag''' is used to indicate an area on a road course where drivers should be careful due to slow or stopped cars or a partially blocked track. It is not used on ovals. If a full-course caution is required, NASCAR will use the yellow flag to indicate this.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2004-06-24-infineon-preview_x.htm] Article on blue flag&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the local caution commonly used in other racing series, the blue flag is not a "local caution" and does not prohibit overtaking; rather, it merely tells drivers to be careful. Safety workers will not leave their designated spots and enter the track under this flag. In the wake of a fatal corner worker crash at Daytona International Speedway in 2004 in a non-NASCAR sanctioned race (but using track workers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newberry |first=Paul |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/2004-02-08-dash-accident_x.htm |title=Track worker killed during Dash race at Daytona |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2004-02-10 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASCAR has become reluctant in recent years to use local cautions, opting to use the full-course yellow caution flag instead if any safety team members have to approach the track in an attempt to give safety workers a safer environment to inspect debris by forcing all cars under pace car speed, instead of race speed, to remove debris. The rationale is most of the field will be packed together while cleanup is happening, instead of being spread over the entire track.
|}

==Qualifying procedure==

===Standard procedure===
A knockout system similar to [[Formula One]] is used. During the time allotted, teams are allowed unlimited attempts to qualify with their fastest lap of each round counting as their official time.

Between attempts, cars are parked on pit road, where teams may hook up a cooling system through the cal flap in front of the windshield to cool the engine. However, teams are not permitted to raise the hood or make other significant adjustments during qualifying. Also, tires may not be changed without approval from NASCAR, who will only grant approval in cases of flat tires or safety issues.

On all open engine ovals in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, tracks shorter than 2 miles in the Xfinity Series, and tracks shorter than 1.5 miles in the Camping World Truck Series, round 1 is 15 minutes long. The fastest 24 advance to round 2 which is 10 minutes long. The fastest 12 advance to round 3 which determines pole position. In addition to determine who advances to round 2, round 1 also determines who will and will not qualify for the race and starting positions 25–40 (Cup Series), 25–40 (Xfinity), or 25–32 (Camping World Truck). Similarly, round 2 will determine starting positions 13–24, with round 3 determining positions 1–12.

On road courses, there are only two sessions: Round 1 is 25 minutes with the top 12 advancing to Round 2 which is 10 minutes.

In the event rain falls between rounds, NASCAR has the option of declaring the session over and the speeds from the previous round will count for all remaining starting positions.

===Restrictor plate tracks, ovals longer than 2 miles in Xfinity, and ovals longer than 1.5 miles in Trucks===
Due to how the draft works in restrictor plate racing, and a series of crashes in qualifying during 2015 Speedweeks, a single car qualifying format is used for restrictor plate racetracks. In July 2015, after making rules changes to the cars designed to increase drag and drafting, NASCAR used the format at Indianapolis and Michigan (but discontinued its use at both tracks for 2016). The single car system will only be used at the plate tracks, ovals 2 miles and longer in the Xfinity series, and ovals 1.5 miles or longer in the Truck series.

In round 1, cars are sent out one at a time at the direction of a NASCAR official. Each car has one warm-up lap, one timed lap, and one cool down lap. NASCAR will release cars roughly half a lap apart to prevent any aerodynamic advantage from being gained from a competitor's car. The order in which cars go on track is the inverse of practice speeds.  As with the road course format, the top 12 cars advance to the final round.

After the final car has returned to pit road in the first round, all 12 qualifying teams may hook up the cooling system to the car for 10 minutes. Round 2 cars will qualify from slowest to fastest based off their speeds from round 1. The fastest car will win the pole.

===Daytona 500 provisions===
The session results from single car qualifying set the starting lineups for the [[Can-Am Duel]] races on Thursday.
The duel races are two 60 lap/150 mile races. The first race consists of those who finished qualifying in odd-numbered positions and sets the lineup for odd-numbered positions in the 500. The second race does the same for even-numbered positions. However, there must be an equal number of "open" or "non-chartered" teams in each Duel race. After the Duel races, the lineup is set as follows:

* Positions 1–2: Fastest two qualifiers in Sunday's single car qualifying.
* Positions 3–38: Duel race results, consisting of all chartered teams and the highest finishing non-chartered team in each Duel.
* Positions 39-40: The fastest two cars of non-chartered teams that are not already qualified, based on Sunday's qualifying session.

===Provisional rule===
All three NASCAR national series will set a specific number of starting positions by timed laps and have a specific number of starting positions based on owner points of vehicles that have not already qualified.

*  Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series:  36 / 4
*  Xfinity Series: 33 / 6 / 1
*  Camping World Truck Series (except Eldora):  27 / 4 / 1

In the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series four positions are awarded to the fastest qualifying open teams. In the Xfinity Series, six positions are awarded based on owner points to cars not already qualified. In the Camping World Truck Series, four positions are awarded based on owner points to trucks not already qualified.

The final position in the Xfinity Series and Camping World Truck Series is reserved for a past series champion. Each past champion can use this past champions' provisional up to six times per season. If the past champions' provisional is not needed, then the position goes to the first team in owner points not already qualified for the race. If a former champion driver's team is one of the top six or four teams, respectively, highest in owner points, not already qualified, then that does not count against usage of the provisional. 
If there are 40 or less (or 32 or less) vehicles entered in the respective races, no provisionals are charged and the field will be determined by timed laps only.

After these positions are awarded, the cars are arranged by lap times.

====Past champion's provisional====
In 1991, NASCAR introduced the past champion's provisional (sometimes known as the "Petty rule") after [[Richard Petty]] failed to qualify in four races in 1989, which resulted in a viewership ratings drop that season. This special provisional allowed a former Cup champion to claim the final starting position if he was too low in the points standings and was unable to qualify by speed. The past champion's provisional worked perfectly until 1997, when [[Darrell Waltrip]] failed to make the [[Bank of America Roval 400|UAW-GM Quality 500]] lineup because [[Terry Labonte]] was the more recent champion and was higher in points. NASCAR considered revising the guidelines to the past champion's provisional after Waltrip used it to enter 20 races in 1998. In 2004, NASCAR gave past Cup champions a maximum of 10 past champion's provisionals per season; this number was reduced to six in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/racing/news/story?id=2740483&amp;seriesId=2 |title=Past champion's provisional entry limited to six |author=Newton, David |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=eVi3hg7Y6ZkC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=NASCAR+past+champions+provisional&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VXmxstGUul&amp;sig=LMhoMulSUmrddPk6R5FTkJN4avk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig6bDixLTaAhWKbbwKHWrpABkQ6AEIYTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=NASCAR%20past%20champions%20provisional&amp;f=false |title=''NASCAR for Dummies'' |author=[[Mark Martin|Martin, Mark]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] via [[Google Books]] |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved disastrous for [[Dale Jarrett]] in 2007, as he moved to a fledgling [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] with no owner points and failed to qualify in 12 races after being forced to use all of his past champion's provisionals at the start of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/news/dale-jarrett-hall-of-fame-2014-ned-daytona-500-joe-gibbs-robert-yates/1fdor8jjodtgn106lwxvy4rzy0 |title=Dale Jarrett relishes joining father Ned in NASCAR Hall of Fame |author=Pockrass, Bob |publisher=[[Sporting News]] |date=January 27, 2014 |accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The past champion's provisional was discontinued from the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series as part of the new Charter system and qualifying system in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jayski.com/news/stats/2016/story/_/page/2016-NASCAR-Past-Champions-Provisional |title=2016 Past Champions Provisional |publisher=Jayski's NASCAR Silly Season Site/[[ESPN]] |date=February 12, 2016 |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===All-Star Weekend qualifying===
The Open uses the standard procedure, but with only 8 cars advancing to the final round. All-Star race qualifying consists of the combined time of 3 laps with a 4-tire pit stop. The fastest 5 drivers in the opening round advance to the final round.

===Eldora===
The [[Eldora Dirt Derby]] has a unique qualifying format. Each truck will take two timed laps, with the faster lap counting as that truck's official time. The trucks are assigned to one of five heat races where the top five trucks from each will advance to the feature. Those that fail to qualify will have one last chance race, where the top two trucks will also advance. Provisionals will be determined after the last chance race.

===Daytona Clash===
The [[Advance Auto Parts Clash]] is an annual invitation-only race held the weekend before the Daytona 500, and sets its lineup via a random draw.

==Penalties==
The following is a list of NASCAR penalties. Penalties listed as "NASCAR Discretion" can result in a simple restart at the tail of the field, a multiple lap penalty, or disqualification.

===One Lap Penalty===
# Car/truck pitting out of the assigned pit box (9-15F) (NASCAR may relax the rule at tracks with shorter pit boxes)
# Passing the [[safety car]] (10-4D) (except for cars being subjected to the wave-around, or at some tracks where the radius of pit road is shorter than track, as in Martinsville and Bristol, where the pit road speed limit applies, and the safety car may be passed.)
# Pulling up to pit (9-15A) -- (drivers must maintain position in relation to field or face penalty, again rule differs at Martinsville and Bristol)
# Refueling car before race start OR when before the designated race distance, as in a competition caution called because of weather, passes (9-6D and 9-6E). Additional laps may be added to penalty.

====Penalties assessed at NASCAR's discretion====
# Running over/under equipment (9-15O)
# Running the stop and go sign/light (10-4C) (must be blatant;  crossing the plane of the line or pole but stopping is not a penalty)
# Disobeying NASCAR request (9-11)
# Intentionally causing a caution (9-11)
# Verbal abuse to a NASCAR official (9-11)
# Disobeying Black Flag (10-6A)
# Safety violation

NASCAR conducts a complete technical inspection prior to the first practice session, before and after qualifying, and before the race. A quick safety inspection is also completed prior to each practice session after the first. Penalties for car violations are typically announced the Wednesday after a race, and can range from a simple fine to a suspension (typically a maximum of 12 races) and loss of points. After a race, the top 5 finishers, one other random car, and the first car failing to finish the race not due to an accident will have their cars inspected. The winner, random car, and first car out also have their cars and engines taken by NASCAR for further inspection at the NASCAR Research and Development Center. Further, there is one random race per year where NASCAR confiscates 15-20 engines and takes them to NASCAR's Research and Development Center for evaluation, comparison, and to help decide on future rule changes.

Starting in 2017, NASCAR will attempt to issue more penalties during a race weekend instead of waiting until Wednesday. There will now be L1 and L2 penalties:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2017/2/16/nascar-announces-new-deterrence-penalty-policy.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* L1 penalties concern areas of minimum heights and weights, the Laser Inspection Station (LIS), gear ratios, and flagrant lug nut violations where 17 or fewer are properly secured. Penalties will be a 10-40 point deduction, suspension for 1-3 races, plus a fine up to $75,000.
* L2 penalties involve more egregious infractions concerning tampering with the three "no man's land" technical areas of tires, engine and fuel. Major safety violations, the use of telemetry or traction control, plus breaches of the testing policy also fall under the L2 designation. These penalties will be a 75-point deduction, a 4-6 race suspension, and a fine up to $200,000.
* "Encumbered" finishes: The rules allow a victory to stand in the event of an infraction, but a winning team will be stripped of the benefits associated with the win.
* The list of pre-race penalties within a race weekend at the series directors' disposal, in order of increasing severity: Loss of annual "hard card" credential, loss of practice time, loss of pit selection position, tail of the field penalty, a green-flag pass-through on pit road after the initial start, a green-flag stop-and-go in the pits after the start, and lap(s) penalty.

As a member of ACCUS/FIA, NASCAR has a [[substance abuse]] policy requiring random testing of drivers, crew members, and officials. Those who have violated the policy (including suspensions for [[domestic violence]]) are suspended indefinitely immediately and given the opportunity to enroll in NASCAR's Road to Recovery program to be re-instated into NASCAR.

==Pit road==
[[File:Nascar Pit Road photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|NASCAR officials on pit road at [[Sonoma Raceway]]]]
During a race, teams must pit several times for refueling and new tires. Teams are permitted five crew members over the wall at the start of the race; that consists of two tire changers, one tire carrier, a jackman, and a gas man. Once NASCAR gives the OK (usually once the leader begins lapping cars), a 6th crew member is permitted only to service the driver/windshield. With the 2018 NASCAR rule changes, the gas man is now not allowed to make any adjustments to the car when refueling it.

There is an established pit road speed limit for each race. Since NASCAR cars do not have speedometers, the first [[Parade lap|pace lap]] of each race is run at pit road speed so drivers can get a tachometer reading for pit speed. There are a variety of other safety rules (see penalties above) that must be followed.

At the moment of caution or when there are two laps to go in the stage, pit road is immediately closed. NASCAR uses both a light at the end of pit road and a series of cameras to help determine the moment pit road is closed. The pits are opened once the field is under control of the pace/safety car unless there is an accident near the entrance/exit or on pit road, in which case the pits will remain closed until NASCAR deems the pits are safe to open.

After an incident at the June 2015 Chicagoland Xfinity race where the pit flagman waved a green flag but the light at the end of pit road was red, NASCAR added a light to the rear of the pace/safety car to help inform drivers and teams when pit road will be open, and thus removed the flagman from the entrance of pit road. NASCAR's official policy is that in the event of a discrepancy, the light at the end of pit road is official.

Starting in 2017, cars sustaining accident damage that cannot be repaired on pit road within 5 minutes will automatically be removed from the rest of the race. Speeding on pit road will see that time reduced by 15 seconds per infraction. Further, teams are not allowed to replace bodywork once the race begins. Teams using more than 5 crew members will also have their car removed from the race.

==Crew rosters==
For the 2018 season, NASCAR created a new roster system. This system would standardize the number of at-track team members. Rosters are split into three categories: Organizational, Road Crew, and Pit Crew. 

Examples of Organizational roster spots include competition director, team managers, technical director, IT specialists. In the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, teams are allotted three organizational roster spots for one- and two-car operations, and four spots for three- and four-car outfits. XFINITY and Camping World Truck Series teams are allowed one organizational roster spot each.

Examples of Road Crew include crew chief, car chief, mechanics, engine tuners, engineers, specialists (for areas such as tires, aerodynamics and shocks) and spotters. The limits for these personnel by series: Monster Energy Series, 12; XFINITY, 7; Camping World Trucks, 6. 

Pit Crews are the same in all series, with the maximum number being 5. 

The exceptions to these numbers are slight. Monster Energy Series teams are allowed one extra road crew position at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the three road courses (Sonoma, Watkins Glen, Charlotte), where teams often use multiple spotters. Also, an additional road crew roster spot will be allowed for XFINITY teams at 10 races and Truck Series teams at five. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2017/11/22/nascar-to-standardize-at-track-rosters-beginning-in-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race procedure==
Starting in 2017, NASCAR announced they may reserve the right to move up the start of the race one hour to beat inclement weather (heavy rain and lighting on road courses).

Two hours before the race, drivers and crew chiefs attend a mandatory driver's meeting.  They are required to attend in person, and no exceptions are allowed (which has caused trouble with drivers attempting the Memorial Day Double). Failure to attend the meeting will force drivers to start at the rear of the field. In August 2015, NASCAR announced they would experiment moving the driver's meeting to only one hour before the race since meetings at most races take less than 15 minutes.

Roughly a 30 to 45 minutes before the race start time, driver introductions will be held. Failure to attend these will also require the driver to start at the rear of the field as well.

At the designated start time, a pre-race invocation is given, followed by the singing of the national anthem. Once the anthem is complete, drivers have exactly five minutes to get in their cars with all the safety equipment fastened and ready to go. At the end of those five minutes, the grand marshal for the race will deliver the command "Drivers, start your engines!", at which point each car must start its engine. With the engines running, the cars sit on pit road for approximately three minutes before heading on the track for some warm-up laps before the pace car. The average number of pace laps is three, but there can be more or less depending on a wide variety of circumstances and conditions, including but not limited to track length, track drying efforts after rain, or if a car has a problem and stops on the track during those pace laps. At the end of the pace laps, the field will partake in a rolling start.

If the last lap of the race is started under caution, the race will be extended per [[Green–white–checker finish|NASCAR Overtime]]. Once the track is clear, the field will be given the green flag with two laps remaining. If there is another crash/caution before the leader reaches the "overtime line," usually located on the backstretch, then the race will continue to be extended until the leader reaches the line. However, when the leader of the race reaches the overtime line, the next flag (caution or checkered) will end the race (although competitors are required to cross the start/finish line at pace car speed to be scored in their position at the moment of caution).

After the race, the winning driver (and, if at the end of the season, championship winning driver) will usually complete a series of burnouts in celebration of their victory, before heading to victory lane for more celebrations and post-race interviews.

==Safety==
{{main article|Safety in NASCAR}}
Since late 2001, a head and neck restraint has been required for usage of all drivers. Since 2005 the [[HANS Device]] (Head and Neck Support Device) has been the only such approved device. Since 2003, helmets have been required for pit crew members as well. Drivers and pit crew members must also wear firesuits. Drivers are required to use carbon fiber seats and headrests for strength and durability. Cars have also been redesigned since the 2001 [[death of Dale Earnhardt]] and after spectacular crashes to reflect new discoveries and developments in safety.

All oval tracks in any of NASCAR's National Series (except Eldora) use the [[SAFER Barrier]] and other soft wall technology to lessen impacts.

After a series of flips and dangerous crashes in the 1980s, NASCAR began requiring all cars to run a [[restrictor plate]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] and [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. The restrictor plate limits air into the engine, reducing horsepower and speed at these tracks from 230-240&amp;nbsp;mph to 195-200&amp;nbsp;mph. At these races, in addition to the restrictor plate, there are a variety of other technical rules and regulations to keep the cars stable and on the track. In addition to these technical rules, restrictor plate races are the only races where drivers are prohibited from using the apron of the track to execute a pass. A double yellow line separates the track from the racing surface, leading many to call the rule the "Yellow Line Rule." Driving under the line to advance one's position is subject to a drive-through penalty, or if the foul occurs on the last lap that car will be relegated to the last car on the lead lap in official race results.

==Testing==
NASCAR previously sanctioned an annual 4-day pre-season test at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in January for all teams until 2015, when all private testing was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://racing.ap.org/article/nascar-sets-testing-ban-includes-daytona-500-0|title=NASCAR sets testing ban that includes Daytona 500|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|date=2014-09-23|website=Associated Press|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that test, each organization was allowed four 2-day tests. Each test was required to be at a different race track. Rookie drivers were allocated an additional test. Beginning in 2016, each team is eligible to participate in five open tests that will occur at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Watkins Glen International, Chicagoland Speedway, and Homestead-Miami Speedway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/1/12/goodyear-tire-test-dates-set-for-2016-season.html|title=Testing schedule for 2016 set|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|date=2016-01-12|publisher=NASCAR|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tire supplier [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] is allowed unlimited testing and can ask whichever teams it wants to complete the test. Usually Goodyear chooses the top three finishers from the previous year's event to run the test. However, Goodyear formerly staged a full-field tire test at Indianapolis in late June/early July in preparations for the [[Brickyard 400]].

==Weekend schedule==
The [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] usually runs one day of practice and qualifying on Friday, followed by a second day of practice on Saturday morning, followed by the race on Sunday. If running a Saturday night race, the second day of practice is not held. During impound races, the three-day schedule is maintained, with qualifying taking place of Saturday practice.

The [[Xfinity Series]] will run practice on Friday, followed by qualifying a few hours before the race on Saturday. If a race is on Friday (or the schedule is otherwise compacted for other reasons), it is not uncommon for practice, qualifying, and the race to all be held on the same day. The [[Camping World Truck Series]] usually does this.

Rain can and often does affect the weekend schedule. When it does, qualifying is routinely cancelled and the starting lineup is set by owners points (previous year's points for the first 3 races). Whenever a race is postponed due to rain, then the race is usually scheduled for the following day (i.e., a Saturday night race postponed to Sunday afternoon or a Sunday afternoon race postponed to Monday afternoon).

In [[free climbing]], a '''first ascent''' ('''FA'''), or '''first free ascent''' ('''FFA''') is the first successful, documented climb of a [[Climbing route|route]] or [[boulder]] performed without using equipment such as [[Anchor (climbing)|anchors]], [[quickdraw]]s or [[Dynamic rope|ropes]] for aiding progression or resting. In this article, notable first free ascents of hard routes and boulders are listed.

[[Grade (climbing)|Ratings]] on the hardest climbs tend to be speculative, until other climbers have had a chance to complete the routes and a consensus can be reached on the precise [[Grade (climbing)|grade]]. This becomes increasingly difficult as the grade increases, because fewer climbers are capable of repeating the route and passing judgment on its grade.
[[File:Adam Ondra climbing Silence, 9c by PAVEL BLAZEK 1-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|[[Adam Ondra]] climbing [[#Redpointed|''Silence'']], {{Climbing grade|9c}}, in 2017]]

== Overview ==
As of November 2017:
* The hardest ascended route ([[#Redpointed|''Silence'']]) has a proposed grade of {{climbing grade|9c}}. It was first ascended by [[Adam Ondra]] in 2017&lt;ref name=first9c /&gt; and no one else has yet repeated it.
* The hardest route ever ascended by a woman is [[#PlantaShiva|''La Planta de Shiva'']], graded {{climbing grade|9b}}. [[Angela Eiter]] claimed its first female ascent in 2017&lt;ref name=PlantadeShiva1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PlantadeShiva2 /&gt; and no other woman has yet repeated it. 
* The hardest ascended [[Bouldering|boulder problem]] ([[#Boulder problems|''Burden of dreams'']]) has a proposed grade of {{Boulder grade|9A}}. It was first ascended by [[Nalle Hukkataival]] in 2016&lt;ref name=first9Aboulder /&gt; and no one else has yet repeated it.
* The hardest routes ever successfully climbed [[on-sight]] are graded {{Climbing grade|9a}}. The first [[on-sight]] ascent of a {{Climbing grade|9a}} route ([[#Onsighted|''Estado Critico'']]) was claimed by [[Alex Megos]] in March 2013.&lt;ref name=EstadoCritico /&gt; The second ([[#Onsighted|''Cabane au Canada'']]) by Adam Ondra in July 2013.&lt;ref name=ukc68197 /&gt; No one else has yet onsighted this grade.

The route is about 45 m long. The first 20 m are about {{climbing grade|8B}}, followed by three distinct boulder problems: an extremely hard 8C, a "burly 4-move" 8B and a 7C+ with slippery feet. The first one was described by Ondra as the hardest {{Boulder grade|8C}} he ever climbed. It consists of 10 incredibly hard and unusual moves, including single-[[Glossary of climbing terms#finger_jam|finger locks]], climbing upside down and a variation of a [[Glossary of climbing terms#figure four|figure four]] move.&lt;ref name=first9c&gt;

He used a [[Glossary of climbing terms#heel hook|heel-hook]] to make the brutal start sequence easier, and downgraded the problem to easy 8b+.

The '''Olympic Diploma of Merit''' (not to be confused with the [[Olympic diploma|Olympic Diploma]] awarded to athletes) was an award given by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) to recognise outstanding services to sports or a notable contribution to the [[Olympic Games]]. By 1974, the last time the awards were granted, just 58 people had received the award.&lt;ref name="Three Diplomas of Merit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1974/ore85/ore85n.pdf|title=Three Olympic Diplomas of Merit|last1=1974 Olympic Awards|website=la84.org|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Olympic Diploma of Merit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1969/ore20/ore20u.pdf|title=Vernon Morgan|last1=The Olympic Diploma of Merit|website=la84.org|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Pierre de Coubertin]], the originator of the modern Olympic Games, created the honour during the Brussels Olympic Congress of 1905 for those who had made outstanding services to sports or to those who had a major contribution in promoting the Olympic ideals. Strangely, at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London, where red, blue and yellow vouchers were exchanged by the first three athletes for gold, silver and bronze medals respectively, a non-winning competitor's blue voucher could be exchanged for a 'Diploma of Merit' (equivalent of the Olympic Diploma). &lt;ref name="BBC Sport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/7362712.stm|title=Photos of 1908 memorabilia |last1=Olympics|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports people who have won the award include Englishman [[Jack Beresford]], winner of medals at five successive Olympics, Dane [[Ivan Joseph Martin Osiier|Ivan Osiier]] who took part in seven Olympic Games over 28 years, missing the 1936 Games as a protest against Nazism&lt;ref name="Osiier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsports.net/BioPages/IvanOsiier.htm|title=Ivan Osiier|last1=International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame|website=www.jewishsports.net|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Frenchman [[Jean Borotra]], Olympic bronze medallist in the Men's Doubles in 1924, winner of four different tennis [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles and founder of the [[International Fair Play Committee]].&lt;ref name="Three Diplomas of Merit"/&gt;

Sports administrators and promoters who have received the award include Sir [[Herbert Macdonald]], four-time team manager for the Jamaican Olympic Team, and Sir [[Stanley Rous]], former Secretary of [[The Football Association]] and the 6th President of [[FIFA]] (and one of the last three winners along with Jean Borotra).&lt;ref name="Three Diplomas of Merit"/&gt;  The award has also gone to those working in the arts: architect [[Kenzō Tange]] received the award for his design of the Japanese National Gymnasium for the 1964 Olympics, and film director [[Kon Ichikawa]] received one for his celebrated, athlete-focused 1965 documentary film ''[[Tokyo Olympiad]] ((Tōkyō Orinpikku))''.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Modern Olympic Movement|page=172|
last1=Findling|first1=John E.|last2=Pelle|first2=Kimberly D.|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC discontinued the Olympic Diploma of Merit, and three other awards, at the 75th IOC session in 1974. The two extant awards are the [[Olympic Order]], created in 1975 for distinguished contributions to the Olympic movement, and the [[Olympic Cup]], instituted in 1906 by Coubertin for organisations with a record of support for the Olympics and presented annually.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="92534">A '''perfect season''' is a sports [[season (sports)|season]] including any requisite playoff portion, in which a team remains and finishes undefeated and untied. The feat is extremely rare at the professional level of any team sport, and has occurred more commonly at the collegiate and scholastic levels in the United States. A '''perfect regular season''' (known by other names outside the United States of America) is a season ''excluding'' any playoffs, where a team remains undefeated and untied; it is less rare than a complete perfect season but still exceptional.

A perfect season may be part of a multi-season [[winning streak (sports)|winning streak]].

[[Exhibition game]]s are generally not counted toward standings, for or against. For example, the 1972 Miami Dolphins (below) lost three of their preseason ("exhibition" games in 1972 NFL vernacular) games but are considered to have had a perfect season.

==American football==

===National Football League===
{{Main|1972 Miami Dolphins season}}
Since the [[National Football League]] began in [[1920 NFL season|1920]], only one team has played a complete perfect season (both regular season and playoffs): [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|the 1972 Miami Dolphins]], who won all fourteen of their regular season games and three postseason games, including [[Super Bowl VII]], to finish the season 17–0–0.

The Dolphins briefly extended their winning streak before losing to [[1973 Oakland Raiders season|the Oakland Raiders]] on September 23, 1973. It has often been reported that the surviving members of the 1972 Dolphins would, every season, either gather to drink champagne when the final undefeated team earned its first loss of the year, or send a case of champagne to the team who beat this final undefeated team. The head coach of the 1972 Dolphins, [[Don Shula]], denied this in a 2007 interview with ESPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wojciechowski|first=Gene|title=Shoes ... The Jaw ... by any name, Shula still the king|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&amp;id=2750571|publisher=ESPN|date=February 1, 2007|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 20, 2013, four decades after their accomplishment, President [[Barack Obama]] hosted the 1972 Dolphins noting that they "never got their [[White House]] visit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er3z00blcec&amp;t=1m |title=President Obama Honors the 1973 Super Bowl Champion Miami Dolphins  |publisher=YouTube.com/user/whitehouse |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NFL undefeated seasons (with ties) prior to 1932====
Prior to the development of a playoff system in the NFL in [[1932 NFL season|1932]], there were four teams who completed seasons undefeated, but with one or more tied games: [[1920 Akron Pros season|the 1920 Akron Pros]], [[1922 Canton Bulldogs season|the 1922 Canton Bulldogs]], [[1923 Canton Bulldogs season|the 1923 Canton Bulldogs]], and [[1929 Green Bay Packers season|the 1929 Green Bay Packers]]. According to the 2012 NFL Record &amp; Fact Book, under NFL practices at the time, from 1920 to 1971 tie games were not included in winning percentage (there was also no [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] to settle ties in the regular season until 1974) so, these four teams were recorded with perfect win percentages of 1.000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Past_Standings_2011.pdf | title=2012 NFL Record &amp; Fact Book | publisher=NFL | accessdate=18 September 2013 | pages=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1921 Buffalo All-Americans season|The 1921 Buffalo All-Americans]] were controversially denied a similar type of near-undefeated season, when they believed that their final game, [[Staley Swindle|a 10-7 loss to the Chicago Staleys]], was an exhibition game which would not count in the final standings; the NFL records that game as official, and Buffalo's record as 9–1–2.

====Other NFL perfect regular seasons====
{{Main|1934 Chicago Bears season|1942 Chicago Bears season|2007 New England Patriots season}}
Apart from the 1972 Dolphins, three NFL teams have completed undefeated and untied regular seasons: [[1934 Chicago Bears season|the 1934 Chicago Bears]], [[1942 Chicago Bears season|the 1942 Chicago Bears]], and [[2007 New England Patriots season|the 2007 New England Patriots]].

In 1934, the Bears played a 13–0–0 regular season and became the first NFL team to complete an undefeated regular season without tied games, but lost the [[1934 NFL Championship Game]] against [[1934 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]]. Despite losing several players and head coach [[George Halas]] to military service in World War II, the 1942 Bears finished 11–0–0 but again lost the [[1942 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]], this time against [[1942 Washington Redskins season|the Washington Redskins]].

The 2007 Patriots became the first team after the NFL expanded its regular season to sixteen games in [[1978 NFL season|1978]] to finish the regular season undefeated. The Patriots then won their divisional and conference playoff games, but were upset by [[2007 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]] in [[Super Bowl XLII]], giving them a final record of 18–1.

===Pre-NFL era and competing leagues===
NFL predecessors such as the [[Ohio League]], [[New York Pro Football League]] and [[Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit]]  had many perfect seasons. In Ohio, the [[Massillon Tigers]] (1904, 1905), [[Akron Indians]] (1909), [[Shelby Blues]] (1911), and [[Dayton Triangles]] (1918) all had perfect seasons during this era. In New York, the [[Buffalo (NFL)|Buffalo Niagaras]] went 5–0–0 (6–0–0 including a forfeit) in a league that consisted of teams entirely from the city of Buffalo in 1918. In 1920, the [[Union Club of Phoenixville]], located in eastern Pennsylvania, played in a league mostly consisting of local teams and earned a perfect season, claiming for itself a [[mythical national championship]]. In western Pennsylvania, the [[1900 Homestead Library &amp; Athletic Club football team|1900]] and [[1901 Homestead Library &amp; Athletic Club football team|1901]] Homestead Library and Athletic Club teams, as well as the 1903 [[Franklin Athletic Club]], all had perfect seasons.

The caliber of talent was neither as high nor as consistent between teams at the time, the seasons were generally shorter (7 to 11 games), and it was not uncommon for top teams to play all their games at home while lesser teams played all of their games on the road. In 1918, Dayton and Buffalo had the additional advantage of having its strongest competitors suspend operations due to the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]] and the [[World War I|First World War]], restrictions that also prevented the two teams from playing each other. Thus, it was much easier to earn a perfect season than it would become in the NFL.

====1937 Los Angeles Bulldogs====
The [[Los Angeles Bulldogs]] were a member of the [[American Football League (1936)|second American Football League]], who joined the league in 1937 after the [[Cleveland Rams]] defected to the NFL. Playing a combination of AFL teams and independent franchises (such as the [[Providence Steam Roller]] and the [[Salinas Packers]]), the team went 16–0, with 8 of those wins coming against AFL teams. The Bulldogs’ dominance is cited as one of the key factors in the AFL's demise,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and the next season as an independent with a 10–2–2 record including a 2–1–2 record against NFL teams, several of the team's players were invited to play on the "Pro All Stars" team in the NFL's first [[Pro Bowl|Pro All-Star Game]] in Los Angeles. The Bulldogs are considered to be one of the few independent teams to have ever achieved parity with the NFL.

====1948 Cleveland Browns====
The [[Cleveland Browns|Browns]] were a member of the [[All-America Football Conference]], a professional football league that played from 1946 to 1949.  In 1948, the Browns won all fourteen regular season games and the [[All-America Football Conference#1948|1948 AAFC championship]] to post a 15–0–0 record. Cleveland's perfect 1948 season was part of a longer string of 29 straight wins, which stretched from 1947 to 1949 and included both the 1947 and 1948 title games.  Overall, the Browns won all four AAFC championship games and were accepted into the NFL when the two leagues merged after the 1949 season.

Neither the NFL nor the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] recognizes the Bulldogs’ perfect season; the Hall of Fame recognizes the Browns’ perfect season but the NFL does not.

===Close to perfect===
Since the NFL expanded to a fourteen-game regular season in [[1961 NFL season|1961]], eleven teams have had regular seasons with one loss and no ties (or better) while failing to achieve a perfect season:

|}

Most of these teams suffered their regular-season loss early in the year and, other than the 2007 Patriots (finished regular season 16–0), only the 1962 Packers (10–0), 1985 Bears (12–0),  2011 Packers (13–0), and 2015 Panthers (14–0) were on track for a perfect season when they lost. Coincidentally, the 1985 Bears’ lone loss came to the Miami Dolphins.

The best start from an NFL team who failed to complete a perfect regular season is shared by two teams: the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|2009 Indianapolis Colts]], who started 14–0 before losing their final two regular season games to the [[2009 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] and the [[2009 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] to finish 14–2, and the [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|2015 Carolina Panthers]], who went 14–0 before losing to the [[2015 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] and going on to finish the regular season 15–1. The 2009 Colts, having clinched the top seed in the AFC, sacrificed their chances at a perfect regular season and instead [[resting the starters|rested their starters]] the final two games to protect them for the playoffs. The Colts would go on to [[Super Bowl XLIV]] but lost to the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. The 2015 Panthers were not resting their starters at the time of their loss (at the time, the [[2015 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] were 13–2 and still had an opportunity to surpass the Panthers for the top seed in the NFC).

Four other teams have started 13–0 before losing their fourteenth game: the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|1998 Denver Broncos]], [[2005 Indianapolis Colts season|2005 Indianapolis Colts]], [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009 New Orleans Saints]] and [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011 Green Bay Packers]] (Of those near-perfect seasons, the 2011 Packers are the only team that did not win a single playoff game). The 1998 Broncos, 2005 Colts and 2009 Saints lost at least two of their final three games but the Broncos and Saints recovered to win the Super Bowl. The [[1953 Cleveland Browns season|1953 Cleveland Browns]] and [[1969 Los Angeles Rams season|1969 Los Angeles Rams]] started 11–0 in twelve- and fourteen-game seasons respectively; both lost their only playoff game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballgeography.com/?p=3190|title=Last Undefeated NFL Team(s) in Each Season » FootballGeography.com|website=www.footballgeography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other leagues===
The following is a list of teams in minor or alternate leagues that compiled perfect seasons of six games or more, including postseason games, with no ties:

*The Hollywood Bears, a member of the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]], went 8–0–0 in 1941.
*The Hollywood Rangers were a member of the [[American Football League (1944)|American Football League of 1944]] (formerly the Northwest War Industries League), a short-lived competitor to the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]] on the West Coast. In their 1944 season, they went 11–0–0 and defeated the PCPFL champion San Diego Bombers (who had also had a perfect season in their league, going 9–0–0) in a two-game series.
*The Charleston Rockets of the [[Continental Football League]] won all 14 games of the league's inaugural season in 1965, going on to defeat the [[Toronto Rifles]] in the league's championship.
*The Hartford Knights went 17–0–0 in 1972 as a member of the [[Seaboard Football League]], including a victory over the [[Chambersburg Cardinals]] in the league's championship. The Knights, unhappy with the level of competition (many of the Knights games had margins of victory of 40 points or more), quit the league the following year.

In [[indoor American football|indoor football]], the following teams have had perfect seasons:

*The [[Quad City Steamwheelers]] went undefeated in the [[2000 AF2 season|inaugural season]] of [[AF2|arenafootball2]], accruing a record of 19–0–0 including playoffs and an [[ArenaCup I]] win.
*The [[Ohio Valley Greyhounds]] of the [[National Indoor Football League]] accrued a perfect season in 2003.
*The [[Sioux Falls Storm]] of [[United Indoor Football]] won back-to-back perfect seasons in 2006 and 2007, winning the United Bowl championship both years.
*The [[Fayetteville Guard]] won a perfect season in 2007 in the NIFL.
*The [[Rochester Raiders]] won a perfect season in [[2008 Continental Indoor Football League season|2008]] in the [[Continental Indoor Football League]], but withdrew from that league during the playoffs in a dispute.
*The [[Baltimore Mariners]] won a perfect season in [[2010 American Indoor Football Association season|2010]] in the [[American Indoor Football Association]].
*The [[Erie Explosion]] won a perfect season in [[2013 Erie Explosion season|2013]] in the Continental Indoor Football league, winning all ten regular season games, a semifinal playoff, and the CIFL Championship.

At least twenty-three other semi-professional football teams have had perfect seasons, seven of them being at least 17 games long. The [[Chambersburg Cardinals]] won a record 72 straight games between 1977 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Brainerd (2010). [http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teamgame.htm Minor league football records - Winning streaks].&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been no perfect seasons (or even perfect regular seasons) in the [[American Association (football)|American Association]], [[World Football League]], [[United States Football League]], [[XFL]], or, to date, the [[Arena Football League]]. The [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] has had two perfect regular seasons, but neither qualify for the list: [[2009 Florida Tuskers season|the 2009 Florida Tuskers]] finished 6–0, but that team lost the subsequent [[2009 UFL Championship Game|championship game]]; the [[2012 Las Vegas Locomotives season|2012 Las Vegas Locomotives]] had a record of 4–0 when the league abruptly suspended operations halfway through the season.

The 1933 [[Providence Huskies]] (possibly a successor to the [[Providence Steam Roller]]) played arguably the most perfect season ever recorded by a professional or semi-professional team: a ten-game season in which they won every game and did not concede a single point during any game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teampnts.htm |title=Semi-pro Football / Minor League Football – Team Points Records |publisher=Semiprofootball.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leagues outside North America===
In the [[2014 German Football League]] the [[Braunschweig Lions]] compiled a perfect season (12–0 postseason 3–0), losing only in the [[BIG6 European Football League]] which is a different competition. They crowned the season with another German Bowl triumph. Similarly in the [[2016 German Football League]] the [[Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns]] achieved a perfect regular season with a 14–0 record, similarly their lone defeat came in the [[BIG6 European Football League]] which is not considered for league standings. However, unlike Braunschweig before them, Schwäbisch Hall ultimately lost the [[German Bowl]], in this case to Braunschweig. In the [[2017 German Football League]] season, Schwäbisch Hall once more compiled a perfect season (14-0) but this time also won the [[German Bowl]], again against Braunschweig. Interestingly, their opponent in the final had also entered the game with a 14-0 regular season record.

==Canadian football==
A true perfect season (no losses and no ties through the regular season and playoffs) has never been achieved in professional Canadian football. Only one team, the 1948 [[Calgary Stampeders]], has completed a perfect regular season.

The current [[Canadian Football League]] schedule would require a team to win 20 games (18 regular season, 1 playoff after bye week, and the Grey Cup championship) to post a perfect record.

===1948 Calgary Stampeders===
Under head coach [[Les Lear]], the 1948 [[Calgary Stampeders]] completed a perfect regular season with a record of 12–0; they had two wins and a tie during the playoffs to finish with a record of 14–0–1, the only undefeated complete season in Canadian pro history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&amp;id=208] Grey Cup History (CFL.ca), Accessed December 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Interprovincial Football Union]] championship (a home-and-home [[Playoff format#Total points series (aggregate)|aggregate]] series decided on total points) against the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders|Regina Roughriders]], the first leg was tied 4–4, and the Stampeders won the second 21–10, to win the aggregate 25–14. The Stampeders then defeated the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 12–7 for the [[36th Grey Cup]].

Despite the Stampeders' title, their achievement was only lightly regarded in the East. At the time, the Eastern and Western unions played separate regular seasons and only met in the Grey Cup. The Western union was openly regarded to be a weaker competition in the East, and Calgary's win (only the third for a Western team up to that time) was dismissed as a fluke.

==Lacrosse==
In professional [[lacrosse]], the [[1993 MILL season|1993]] [[Buffalo Bandits]] are the only team to have won a perfect season in the [[National Lacrosse League]]. The Bandits won all ten of their regular season games and won the championship in a two-round tournament; the season was the continuation of a multi-season winning streak that dated to the Bandits’ successful run for the [[1992 MILL season|previous year's]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.buffalonews.com/sports_ink/2011/07/three-former-bandits-among-six-nominated-for-nll-hall.html |title=Three former Bandits among six nominated for NLL Hall – Sports, Ink &amp;#124; The Buffalo News |publisher=Blogs.buffalonews.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Major League Lacrosse]], which began play in 2001, [[2013 Denver Outlaws season|the 2013 Denver Outlaws]] were the first team to complete a perfect regular season, winning all fourteen of their games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/lacrosse/ci_23837209/denver-outlaws-beat-hamilton-finish-season-undefeated-at ‘Denver Outlaws beat Hamilton, finish season undefeated at 14–0’]; ''[[Denver Post]]'', 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After beating [[2013 Hamilton Nationals season|the Hamilton Nationals]], the Outlaws had a sequence of twenty consecutive regular season wins despite losing [[2012 MLL season|the 2012 championship]]. However, the Outlaws lost in the first round of the playoffs [[2013 Charlotte Hounds season|to the Charlotte Hounds]], who had only gone 7–7 in the regular season.

==Other North American professional sports leagues==
In North America's three other major professional sports leagues ([[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[National Hockey League]]) it is almost impossible for a team to play a “perfect” season, primarily because there are substantially more games in the regular season (82 in the NBA and NHL, and 162 in Major League Baseball). The [[Women's National Basketball Association]]‘s season has been between 28 and 34 games long, and it too has never produced a perfect season.

It is possible for a baseball [[pitcher]] to achieve a perfect season, taking at least one win and any number of no-decisions throughout the year. This has happened 1813 times in baseball's history, though the majority (1171) were 1–0 seasons, mostly by [[relief pitcher]]s. The best perfect season belongs to [[Tom Zachary]] of the 1929 [[New York Yankees]], who posted a 12–0 record in 119.2 innings. No pitcher has ever achieved a perfect season while qualifying for the [[Earned run average|ERA]] title.

In the NBA, the [[1985–86 NBA season|1985–86]] [[1985–86 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] played a nearly perfect home season. During the regular season, they were 40–1 (.976) in front of their home crowd. The [[Boston Celtics|Celtics']] only regular-season home loss occurred on December 6, 1985, to [[1985–86 Portland Trail Blazers season|the Portland Trail Blazers]], by the score of 121–103. The Celtics would also win all 10 of their home games in the postseason, to finish 50–1 at home. The [[2015–16 NBA season|2015–16]] [[2015–16 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]] also played a nearly perfect home regular-season with a 40-1 (.976) record in front of their home crowd, with their only home loss occurring on April 10, 2016 vs. the [[Golden State Warriors]] by the score of 92-86. The Spurs were eliminated in the Western Conference Semi-Finals by the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the [[2016 NBA Playoffs]].  The Spurs played a total of 5 home games in the post season, finishing 43-3 at home, losing twice to the Thunder. The three-on-three basketball league [[BIG3]], which featured an eight-game regular season and two-round playoff, had a perfect team in its inaugural season when [[Trilogy (basketball)|Trilogy]] swept all ten games on their schedule.

===Individual professional sports===
For other sports leagues for individuals, such as the [[PGA Tour]] or [[NASCAR]], a perfect season would represent winning every event in a season. Considering the number of tournaments or races in those leagues, and the fact that each individual faces over 40 opponents as opposed to one, a perfect season is almost impossible.

Golf instead considers the [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]], a sweep of the four [[men's major golf championships]] deemed to be the most difficult contests in professional golf, to be analogous to perfection. The only time the Grand Slam has been swept in any given year was 1930, when [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] won all four majors (at the time, [[The Amateur Championship|The (British) Amateur Championship]] and [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] were still considered majors); since 1934, when [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] was added as a major, no player has won all four in one year. [[Tiger Woods]] is the only professional golfer to win four consecutive professional majors; he did so over two years in 2000 and 2001. The record for most consecutive wins in professional golf is 11, set [[Byron Nelson]] in 1945; Nelson would win 18 tournaments overall that year, a year when wartime manpower shortages were still limiting the number and quality of professional golfers for Nelson to compete against.

In [[Formula One]], [[Michael Schumacher]] was the 2004 champion with 13 wins in 18 races. In IndyCar, [[A. J. Foyt]] won 10 out of 13 races. In [[NASCAR]], [[Richard Petty|Richard "The King" Petty]] holds most of the records for most wins in a season; he won 27 races out of 48 appearances in 1967, 10 of them consecutive. Since a format change in 1972, Petty also holds the modern-era record for most wins in a season, with 13, a record he shares with [[Jeff Gordon]].&lt;ref name=Daytona&gt;{{cite book|title=Daytona: From the Birth of Speed to the Death of the Man in Black|last=Hinton|first=Ed|year=2001|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-52677-0|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional motorcycle racer [[Ricky Carmichael]] had perfect seasons in 2002 and 2004. In 1997, [[road racing|road racer]] [[Tommy Kendall]] started the 13-race [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] [[Trans-Am Series]] season 11–0, the longest documentable win streak in worldwide professional road racing.&lt;ref name="Deepthrottle"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th race, he was battling for the lead on the final lap, but spun out and finished second. The feat would be extremely difficult in NASCAR, because of the length of the season (currently 36 races).

==American collegiate sports==

=== NAIA Football ===
In 1966 Waynesburg College went 11–0 after a 9–0 regular season record.
In December 1966 Waynesburg defeated New Mexico Highlands in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the playoff game, 
and, defeated Whitewater Wisconsin in the NAIA Champion Bowl at Tulsa Oklahoma.
This was, and still is a college football rarity. 
Very few college football teams have won a College National Football Championship (including playoff games)
with an undefeated  record.

===NCAA Football===
{{Main|List of undefeated NCAA Division I football teams}}
Due to relatively short seasons through most of [[college football]] history, the [[List of undefeated NCAA Division I football teams|list of undefeated Division I football teams]] includes dozens of teams.&lt;ref name=Dolphin&gt;[http://www.dolphinsim.com/ratings/ Dolphin Historical Football Rankings] Retrieved December 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest level of college football, the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (introduced as Division I-A in 1978), did not use a playoff to determine a champion prior to the introduction of the four-team [[College Football Playoff]] (CFP) in [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014]]. The system replaced by the CFP relied on a combination of polls and computer rankings to choose two teams to play one [[BCS National Championship Game|title game]] in a system known as the [[Bowl Championship Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcsfootball.org/ Home page of the Bowl Championship Series]

The record for most wins in an undefeated FBS season is 14–0, accomplished in 2002 by [[2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], twice in [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009]] by [[2009 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] and [[2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], in [[2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2010]] by [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], and in [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013]] by [[2013 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]].

===NCAA Division I Basketball===

====Men====
Before the establishment of the [[National Invitation Tournament]] in 1938 and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] in 1939, perfect seasons were more common; each season consisted of fewer games and top teams from different parts of the country might never meet.

Eight teams have completed perfect seasons, including postseason tournament victories, since the tournament era began in 1938:
* [[LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds men's basketball|1939 LIU Blackbirds]] (24–0) — [[1939 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] champion, which at the time was more prestigious than the NCAA tournament
* [[1955–56 San Francisco Dons men's basketball team|1956 San Francisco Dons]] (29–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1956–57 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|1957 North Carolina Tar Heels]] (32–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1963–64 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1964 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1966–67 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1967 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1971–72 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1972 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1972–73 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1973 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1975–76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1976 Indiana Hoosiers]] (32–0) – NCAA champion

In addition, four other teams in the tournament era had unbeaten records, but did not play in any postseason tournament:
* 1940 [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]] (19–0) — not invited to either the NCAA Tournament or NIT.
* 1944 [[Army Black Knights men's basketball|Army Cadets]] (15–0) — not invited to either the NCAA Tournament or NIT. (Given that this season was during World War II, it is also possible that Army chose to turn down tournament invitations.)
* [[1953–54 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|1954 Kentucky Wildcats]] (25–0) — declined a bid to the NCAA Tournament due to an NCAA ruling that graduate students could not compete.
* 1973 [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|NC State Wolfpack]] (27–0) — ineligible for postseason competition due to rule violations earlier that season.

The UCLA Bruins are the only team to have back-to-back perfect seasons (1971–1972, 1972–1973), and all four of the college’s perfect seasons were under Hall of Fame head coach [[John Wooden]].

The following teams completed a perfect regular season, but lost in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] or other postseason action:
*[[1939 National Invitation Tournament|1939]] [[Loyola Ramblers men's basketball|Loyola Ramblers]] (finished regular season 20–0 and lost in the NIT final to LIU to finish 21–1)
*[[1941 National Invitation Tournament|1941]] [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]] (finished regular season 19–0; lost in the NIT semifinals to LIU and third-place game to CCNY to finish 20–2)
*[[1951 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1951]] [[Columbia Lions men's basketball|Columbia Lions]] (finished 21–1 after losing in the first round)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourneytravel.com/history/schoolstats.htm |title=NCAA Tournament School Statistics |publisher=TourneyTravel.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[1960–61 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|1961 Ohio State Buckeyes]] (finished 27–1 after losing in the [[1961 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|championship game]] to [[1960–61 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team|Cincinnati]])
*[[1967–68 Houston Cougars men's basketball team|1968 Houston Cougars]] (finished regular season 28–0, then lost the semifinal and consolation games at the [[1968 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|Final Four]])
*1968 [[St. Bonaventure Bonnies men's basketball|St. Bonaventure Bonnies]] (finished regular season 22–0, lost in regional semifinals)
*1971 [[Penn Quakers men's basketball|Penn Quakers]] (finished the regular season 26–0, lost in the regional finals)
*1971 [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette Warriors]] (finished regular season 26–0, lost in regional semifinals)
*[[1974–75 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1975 Indiana Hoosiers]] (finished regular season 29–0, but lost to [[1974–75 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in the [[1975 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|Mideast Regional final]])
*[[1976 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1976]] [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights]] (finished regular season 28–0, won 3 more games in the NCAA Tournament to go to 31–0, but lost in the Final Four to [[1975–76 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] and in the consolation game to [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]])
*[[1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball team|1979 Indiana State Sycamores]] (finished regular season 29–0, but lost in the [[1979 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|championship game]] to [[1978–79 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]]. Finished 33–1.)
*1979 [[Alcorn State Braves basketball|Alcorn State Braves]] finished the regular season with a perfect 27–0 record, but were not invited to the NCAA Tournament.

====Women====
In the women’s game, the following national championship teams have had perfect records since the [[AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament|AIAW]] began sponsoring a championship tournament in 1972 (which was followed by the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship|NCAA]] tournament in 1982):
* 1973 [[Immaculata University#Women's basketball|Immaculata Mighty Macs]] (20–0)

===NCAA Ice Hockey===
Among schools in the top level of men’s ice hockey, the 1969–70 [[Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey|Cornell Big Red]] went 29–0–0 in the University Division (the predecessor to today’s Division I) en route to a national championship.

Since Cornell’s 29–0–0 season in 1969–70, the closest Division I Men’s Ice Hockey Team to having a perfect season was the 1992–93 [[Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey|Maine Black Bears]], who finished that year at 42–1–2, including a national title game victory against [[Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey|Lake Superior State]]. Their only loss came on February 19, 1993, against [[Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey|Boston University]], where they lost 7-6 in overtime, and their only ties were on October 24 against [[Providence Friars men's ice hockey|Providence]], 3-3, and on January 15 against [[Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey|Clarkson]], 4-4.

The last men’s team to finish unbeaten and untied and be national champions was the 1983–84 [[Bemidji State Beavers men's ice hockey|Bemidji State Beavers]] (31–0–0), who were then competing in [[NCAA Division II|Division II]], a level of competition that no longer conducts a championship.

The 1955–56 Clarkson Golden Knights were undefeated and untied (23–0–0), but skipped the NCAA tournament because as the team had seniors with four years of college play which was against NCAA tournament rules at the time (not regular season rules).

The 1967–68 [[Iona Gaels men's ice hockey|Iona Gaels]] went 16–0–0 in their inaugural season as an independent in Division III, but did not participate in a national championship as none existed for Division III at that time.

The most recent unbeaten and untied season in NCAA ice hockey at the highest level was in [[2012–13 Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey season|2012–13]] when [[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|the Minnesota Golden Gophers]] became the first NCAA women’s team ever to accomplish the feat (41–0–0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/9094220/minnesota-golden-gophers-get-first-ever-perfect-season-ncaa-women-hockey-title |title=Gophers get first perfect season |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=March 24, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian rules football==
===Australian Football League (AFL)/Victorian Football League (VFL) ===
The [[Australian Football League|VFL]] began in 1897. Based entirely in the state of Victoria, before it expanded through the 1980s, and 1990s to become the top level national league (AFL) in the sport of Australian rules football. The length of a complete season (including finals matches) has typically been between 18 and 26 games. Throughout the history of the league, no team has ever completed a perfect season. One team, {{AFL Col}} in [[1929 VFL season|1929]], completed a perfect home-and-away season, finishing with a record of 18–0; the club won the premiership, but did not complete a perfect season after losing the [[Second amended Argus system|second semi-final]] against {{AFL Ric}}.

===South Australian National Football League (SANFL)===
{{main|1914 Port Adelaide Football Club season}}
The SANFL has existed since 1877 within South Australia, and until the latter part of the twentieth century was of equivalent standard to the VFL. The only perfect season to be completed was by the 1914 [[Port Adelaide Magpies|Port Adelaide]] team, known as the "Invincibles". Port won all four of its pre season matches. It finished the minor round with a 12–0 record, before winning both finals to finish with a 14–0 record and a perfect season. They also won the Championship of Australia against VFL premiers [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], to extend that record to 15–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/clubs/stats/Port+Adelaide+Magpies/318/1914|first=John|last=Devaney|publisher=Australian Football|title=Port Adelaide Magpies 1914 results|accessdate=28 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this the club played a combined team from all the other SAFL clubs and won to extend the record to 16–0. The closest any team got to Port Adelaide was [[North Adelaide Football Club|North Adelaide]], losing by 21 points in Round 10. This is the only instance in [[The Big Three (Australian football)|The Big Three]] Australian football leagues (VFL/SANFL/WAFL) where a club has gone undefeated in the pre-season, season main and post season.

In 1912, Port Adelaide had a perfect minor round and then beat [[West Torrens Football Club|West Torrens]] in its semi-final but lost both the final and Grand Final to [[West Adelaide Football Club|West Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/clubs/stats/Port+Adelaide+Magpies/318/1912|first=John|last=Devaney|publisher=Australian Football|title=Port Adelaide Magpies 1912 results|accessdate=28 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Australian Football League (WAFL)===
The [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] has existed since 1885 within Western Australia, and until the latter part of the 20th century was of equivalent standard to either the VFL or SANFL. The [[1946 WANFL season|1946]] [[East Fremantle Football Club|East Fremantle]] team was the first club in senior WAFL football{{efn| In the [[1944 WANFL season|1944 under-19 wartime competition]] that replaced the senior competition between [[1942 WANFL season|1942]] and that season due to the player drain of World War II, [[East Perth Football Club|East Perth]] managed a perfect season, winning all nineteen home-and-away games plus two finals.}} to have managed a perfect season or even a perfect home-and-away season, winning all twenty-one of its games; it is noted that the playing lists of many of its opponents had been seriously depleted by World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Devaney, John; ''Full Points Footy's WA Football Companion''; pp. 69-70. {{ISBN|9780955689710}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only loss for the season came against Collingwood in a post season match. The [[2018 WAFL season|2018]] [[Subiaco Football Club|Subiaco]] team won all of it's 18 games in the minor round before winning both their second-semi-final against [[South Fremantle Football Club|South Fremantle]] and the Grand Final against [[West Perth Football Club|West Perth.]]

===Victorian Football Association (VFA/VFL)===
The Victorian Football League, known until 1996 as the Victorian Football Association, began in 1877 and was Victoria's premier football league until 1897, and has been the second-tier league in the state since. Perfect seasons have been completed on four occasions in VFA/VFL history:
#by [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] during a war-shortened [[1915 VFA season|1915]], with a record of 15–0
#by North Melbourne in [[1918 VFA season|1918]], which was also shortened by the war, with a record of 12–0;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/clubs/bio/North+Melbourne/13 |title=North Melbourne Football Club |publisher=Australianfootball.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also cases of teams going undefeated through the season in the nineteenth century, but none completed perfect seasons because some of their matches were drawn. Of those, {{AFL Gee}} could be interpreted as having been perfect in [[1879 VFA season|1879]]; it had a record of 15–0–1, and the draw came by agreement when a match was abandoned due to inclement weather.&lt;ref name="review1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|date=18 October 1879|title=The Football Season of 1879 – Part 1|author=Peter Pindar|publication-place=Melbourne|page=493|issue=707|volume=XXVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four other teams have completed perfect home-and-away seasons, but subsequently lost finals matches:&lt;ref&gt;Fiddian, Marc; ''The VFA: a history of the Victoria Football Association 1877–1995''; pp. 226-299. Published 2004 by On-Demand Pty Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby league==
===National Rugby League===
The [[National Rugby League]] has existed since 1908, being originally known as the New South Wales Rugby League and before the [[Super League]] war of 1995 as the Australian Rugby League. In its history, only one team has completed a perfect season: the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] in [[1925 NSWRFL season|1925]], who won all twelve games contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1925|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1925.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417012749/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1925.html|archivedate=2011-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brisbane Rugby League===
The [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership]] began in 1909 and continued in varying forms until 1996, after which it was superseded by the [[Queensland Cup]]. Between the 1930s and the 1960s it was of comparable standard to the New South Wales Rugby Football League, but subsequently a huge drain of players to Sydney eroded the standard of play. Before [[World War II]] seasons were typically no more than twelve games long; however as the competition grew it was expanded to 21 games by 1960. The only BRL teams to manage a perfect season were:

===British Rugby League===
Whilst no rugby league team in Britain has completed the perfect season in the top flight, this has been achieved on two occasions in lower divisions, once in the 2nd division and once in the 3rd. [[Hull F.C.]] achieved this feat in the [[1978–79 Northern Rugby Football League season|1978–79 Season]], where they won 26 from 26 games, gaining promotion to the top division for the second time in three seasons. This was also achieved by the [[Dewsbury Rams]] in [[2009 Championship 1|2009]] during their [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship 1]] (third division) season where they won all 18 games from a possible 18, winning promotion immediately after being relegated the previous season where they won just two games. Since their 2009 promotion, the Rams have so far stayed in the sports' second division, including two play off finishes.

In [[2017 League 1|2017]], the [[Toronto Wolfpack]] completed the regular reason with a perfect 15–0 record, however after the [[2017 League 1 results#Super 8s|Super 8s]] finished with a 22-1-1 record.

===International Rugby===
The [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand All Blacks]] were the first professional rugby team to produce a perfect rugby test season in 2013. They successfully defeated {{nrut|France}} four times, {{nrut|Australia}} three times, {{nrut|South Africa}} and {{nrut|Argentina}} twice and also beat {{nrut|Japan}}, {{nrut|England}} and {{nrut|Ireland}} in their incredible winning run. They produced a record of 14–0–0, defeating the top 5 ranked teams below them in the IRB world rankings. {{nrut|England}} have matched this feat after producing a perfect test season in 2016 after recovering from getting knocked out of their own [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] in [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]].

===Super Rugby===
The Southern Hemisphere's principal team competition, [[Super Rugby]], established as Super 12 in 1996 and later known as Super 14 before adopting its current name in 2011, has seen only one perfect season. The [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]], based in [[Christchurch]] and representing a large portion of the [[South Island]] of New Zealand, finished the [[2002 Super 12 season]] with an 11–0–0 record and went on to win both of their finals matches to claim the season crown unbeaten.

One other team has won a championship unbeaten: in [[1997 Super 12 season|1997]], the [[Blues (Super Rugby)|Auckland Blues]] (known simply as "Blues" since 2000), which at the time represented the central and southern parts of the [[Auckland]] area plus some adjacent regions to the south, finished the regular season with one draw from 11 matches. They also won both of their finals matches to claim the title.

==Association football==

===Domestic teams===
Many [[association football]] teams have also had perfect seasons, however doing so in a season of 20 or more matches is very rare. Clubs to have achieved this include: [[Dresdner SC]] of Germany in 1942–43 (23 wins out of 23), [[Ferencvárosi TC|Ferencvárosi]] of Hungary in 1931–32 (22), [[Sunrise Flacq United]] of [[Mauritius]] in 1995–96 (22), and [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] of [[Uruguay]] in 1941 (20).&lt;ref name="rsssf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/unbeaten.html |title=Unbeaten |publisher=Rsssf.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ahly]] (of Egypt) hold the record of going a whole season being unbeaten, in all possible competitions they were involved in (46 matches in total played in: Egyptian Premier League, Egyptian Cup, Egyptian Super Cup and CAF Champions League between 2005 and 2006). The longest winning streak of any team over multiple seasons was [[Sparta Prague]]'s run of at least 51 wins in a row, between 1920 and 1923.&lt;ref name="rsssf"/&gt;

Teams finishing a season unbeaten (i.e. having won or drawn every match) are more common. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[2003–04 FA Premier League|2003–04 English Premier League season]], finished with no losses from 38 games over 100 years after [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] unbeaten streak in 22 league games and all of its FA Cup games in [[1888–89 in English football|1888–89]]. At the same time, AFC Wimbledon finished with a [[2003–04 AFC Wimbledon season|record]] of 42 wins, 4 draws and 0 defeats out of 46 games in their [[Combined Counties League Premier Division]] season. In Belgium, From 1933 to 1935  [[Royale Union Saint-Gilloise]]  played 60 consecutive matches undefeated, setting a still unbeaten record in Belgium. In Italy, [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] ([[1978–79 Serie A|1978–79]]), [[A.C. Milan]] ([[1991–92 Serie A|1991–92]]), and [[Juventus F.C.]] ([[2011–12 Serie A|2011–12]]) have been undefeated. In Turkish soccer, [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in the [[1985–86 1.Lig|1985–86]] season completed the season unbeaten but finished as runners-up, although having the same points as [[Beşiktaş J.K.]], who won, but had an inferior goal difference to their rival. [[Beşiktaş J.K.]] in [[1991–92 1.Lig|1991–92]] completed the season unbeaten and became Turkish League's only ever champions without defeat. In Portugal, [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] ([[1972–73 Primeira Liga|1972–73]]) was the first club to do so and won 28 matches – 23 consecutively – out of 30, and drew two. They also went undefeated in [[1977–78 Primeira Liga|1977–78]] but finished second to [[F.C. Porto|Porto]], who lost once that season. Porto finished the [[2010–11 Primeira Liga|2010–11]] and [[2012–13 Primeira Liga|2012–13]] seasons unbeaten, with a respective win–draw record of 27–3 and 24–6. In Saudi Arabia, [[Al-Hilal FC]] finished a 26-game season in the [[2010–11 Saudi Professional League|2010–11]] with 19 wins and 7 draws, whilst in [[Iraq]], [[Al-Shorta FC]] went the entire [[1980–81 Iraqi League]] season undefeated. Greek club [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] finished the [[1963–64 Alpha Ethniki|1963–64 season]], Hungarian club [[Debreceni VSC]] finished the [[2011–12 Nemzeti Bajnokság I|2011–12 season]], Norwegian club [[Rosenborg BK]] finished the [[2010 Norwegian Premier League|2010 season]] undefeated. The only unbeaten champion in [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brazil]] was [[Sport Club Internacional|SC Internacional]], who won the [[1979 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|1979 season]] with 16 victories and 7 ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colunas.globoesporte.com/memoriaec/2008/12/23/inter-79-unico-campeao-brasileiro-invicto/|title=Internacional 1979: único campeão brasileiro invicto|language=Portuguese|publisher=[[Rede Globo|Globo Esporte]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] finished the [[1993–94 Maccabi Haifa F.C. season|1993–1994]] season (a 39-game season) in the Israeli Premier League with 28 wins and 11 draws.

[[Egyptian Premier League]] giants [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]] are the only African club to have ever completed an entire domestic season unbeaten, let alone twice, having won their 30th league title in the [[2004–05 Egyptian Premier League|2004–05 season]] with a record of 24 wins and 2 draws and their 31st league title the [[2005–06 Egyptian Premier League|following season]] with a slightly worse record of 23 wins and 3 draws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahly surrender unbeaten record in Egypt |url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/109/374/index.html |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, [[2014 Úrvalsdeild|2014]] eventual Icelandic champions [[Stjarnan men's football|Stjarnan]] who were unbeaten faced an [[FH Hafnarfjördur|FH]] side in an away game which was the last game of the season, coincidentally before the match, FH were also unbeaten. In a closely fought match Stjarnan emerged victorious courtesy of a 94th-minute penalty from [[Ólafur Karl Finsen]] to knock FH out of first place and secure Stjarnan's first Icelandic championship.

[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] went domestically unbeaten across the [[2016–17 Celtic F.C. season|2016–17 season]] over all 38 league games in [[Football in Scotland|Scotland]], finishing 30 points clear of second-place [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] with 34 wins and 4 draws. Celtic also won the [[2016–17 Scottish League Cup]] and the [[2016–17 Scottish Cup]], giving them the accolade of being the only club to win a domestic treble unbeaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Forsyth|first=Roddy|title=Brendan Rodgers salutes Celtic's 'Invincibles' after they dig deep against Hearts|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/05/21/brendan-rodgers-salutes-celtics-invincibles-dig-deep-against/|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pattullo|first=Alan|title=Gordon Strachan: Celtic "invincibles" will boost Scotland|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/gordon-strachan-celtic-invincibles-will-boost-scotland-1-4453829|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=The Scotsman|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FIFA World Cup===

The likelihood of a national team in the [[FIFA World Cup]] to win all of its matches in regulation time to become the champion is much higher than most clubs in their domestic league, as the finals tournament in its current format only lasts seven games — although this feat has only happened twice, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on both instances in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. This is not counting the [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying round]] of the tournament, which lasts over a year and has had a varied format since [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]. Only the Brazilian team of 1970 has won every game in the qualification and final rounds of a single tournament, a total of 13 games.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/results/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/preliminaries/preliminary=28/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] came very close achieving the same feat as Brazil did in 1970. The Netherlands won 8 out of 8 qualifying games and went on to win the next 6 [[FIFA World Cup 2010|World Cup]] matches in regulation time only to lose in [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the final, ending with a 14–0–1 record.

===FIFA Women's World Cup===
Through [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011]], the likelihood of a national team winning all of its matches in the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] was slightly greater than in the men's version. The Women's World Cup began in [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]] with 12 teams and expanded to 16 effective in [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]]. Under both structures, the winning team only had to win six games (three in group play and three in the knockout stage) to win the title unbeaten. The tournament expanded to 24 teams in [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015]], at which time the number of games that the champion must play increased to seven (the same total as in the men's World Cup).

The 2011 event, won by [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]], was the first in which the champion lost in group play; the other finalist, the [[United States women's national soccer team|USA]], had also lost in group play. Each previous team to have won the title — the USA in 1991 and 1999, [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] in [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup|1995]], and [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]] in [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup|2003]] and [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup|2007]] — won all of its group stage matches. In fact, only one of these teams, the USA in 1999, had a knockout match go to extra time—specifically the final against [[China women's national football team|China]], which ultimately went to a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Germany won all of its matches in the 2007 final tournament without giving up a goal, becoming the first team in either the men's or women's World Cup to accomplish this feat. The USA's third championship team in 2015 had one draw in the group stage.

Three Women's World Cup champions also went through their qualifying stage without a loss or draw:
* USA, 1991 ([[1991 CONCACAF Women's Championship|5 wins]])
* Germany, 2003 ([[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|6 wins]])
* Germany, 2007 ([[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|8 wins]])

Of the other two teams to win the Women's World Cup without a loss or draw in the finals:
* Norway went through their 1995 qualification campaign with 8 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss.
* The USA automatically qualified for the 1999 edition as host.

==Handball==
===Germany===
In 2011/2012, German handball champion [[THW Kiel]] achieved a perfect season of as many as 34 matches. Additionally, the team also won the national DHB Cup and the international [[EHF Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyota-handball-bundesliga.de/handball/tabelle.php?liga=1&amp;menuid=215&amp;topmenu=214 Toyota Handball Bundesliga - final table] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609080844/http://www.toyota-handball-bundesliga.de/handball/tabelle.php?liga=1&amp;menuid=215&amp;topmenu=214 |date=June 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
In the [[Liga ASOBAL]] the [[FC Barcelona Handbol]] had 4 consecutive perfect seasons from the [[Liga ASOBAL 2013–14|2013-14]] season to the [[Liga ASOBAL 2016–17|2016-17]] season.

===Croatia===
In the [[Premijer liga]] the [[RK Zagreb]] is unbeaten for 11 years, they won 190 consecutive games, last time they lost against [[Osijek Motormodul]] (38:39) on 14.4.2007. In that 190 games they just have one tie with [[RK Poreč]] (31:31), after that game they won 178 games in a row and that row is still active.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080812031321/http://sport.hrt.hr:80/htvsport/rukomet/06_07/m_IIdio.html]

*[[2012–13 CEV Women's Champions League]],
*2013 Turkish Women's Volleyball Super Cup and
*[[2013 FIVB Women's Club World Championship]].

Vakıfbank İstanbul won 6 games in [[Turkish Women's Volleyball Cup]], 12 games in [[CEV Women's Champions League]], 29 games (22 league, 7 play-off games) in [[Turkish Women's Volleyball League]], 1 game in Turkish Women's Volleyball Super Cup and 4 games in [[FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship]], and never lost in the 2012–13 Season. In addition, they won all 51 games they played in year 2013.

Having started Turkish Women's Volleyball League's 2013–14 Season with 13 wins and [[2013–14 CEV Women's Champions League]] with 8 wins, they extended their winning streak to 73 games as of January 23, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fanatik.com.tr/vakifbank-73-yapti-ceyrek-finale-kaldi_3_Detail_29_352567.htm |website=[[Fanatik]] |title=Vakıfbank 73 yaptı çeyrek finale kaldı |date=2014-01-23 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2014-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Netball==

===Commonwealth Bank Trophy===
The Commonwealth Bank Trophy was the main national netball competition in Australia from 1997 to 2007. There were eight teams in a double round robin format and finals.

The Sydney Swifts were the only team to achieve a perfect season, winning all fourteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 16–0.

===ANZ Championship===
The ANZ Championship, the principal netball competition for Australia and New Zealand was established in 2008 to replace the Commonwealth Bank Trophy. Comprising ten teams (five from Australia and five from New Zealand) there has so far been one perfect season, by the Mission Queensland Firebirds, based in [[Brisbane, Queensland]] in 2011. The Firebirds won thirteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 15–0. In 2010, the New South Wales Swifts managed to win all thirteen regular season games, but lost both of their finals matches and ended with a 13–2 for that year.

==Cricket==
===County cricket===
English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[county cricket]] has existed as the top tier of domestic cricket in England since the middle nineteenth century, and until the 1950s it was up to the highest standard of the game. Seasons have varied in length: before the 1880s, they were generally less than ten matches in length and some "first-class" counties played only against one or two different opponents, so that a team winning all its games was not implausible. Between [[1887 English cricket season|1887]] and [[1929 English cricket season|1929]], seasons were gradually increased in length to a standard twenty-eight matches for all counties. However, because of the development and popularity of one-day cricket, seasons have been reduced to twenty-four games in [[1969 English cricket season|1969]] and twenty in [[1972 English cricket season|1972]], though this was increased by two in [[1977 English cricket season|1977]] and [[1983 English cricket season|1983]]. With an increase to four days for all games, sixteen or seventeen games have been played since [[1993 English cricket season|1993]].

Also, because of improvements to pitches via the [[heavy roller]] and covering to protect from rain, the proportion of games "drawn" (not finished) has steadily risen since the 1870s.

Since tables of results have been kept in [[1864 English cricket season|1864]],&lt;ref name="rigby"&gt;Wynne-Thomas, Peter; ''The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records''; pp. 53 to 67. {{ISBN|072701868X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only team to have competed a true perfect season – winning outright every game – was [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] in [[1867 English cricket season|1867]] when led by [[George Freeman (cricketer)|George Freeman's]] and [[Tom Emmett]]'s deadly fast bowling on uncovered and unrolled pitches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1867_f_Bowling_by_Average.html |title=First-Class bowling for Yorkshire in 1867 |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; they won all seven county games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/1867_f.html |title=Yorkshire 1867 season summary |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essex CCC achieved the feat in the Summer of 2017, with the bowling combination of Simon Harmer and Jamie Porter doing most of the damage. Ryan Ten Doeschate captained the side,

Since 1868 numerous county teams in longer schedules have finished a season unbeaten,&lt;ref name="rigby"/&gt; but none have managed to win every single game outright:

==Tennis==
In 2011 and 2012, the [[Washington Kastles]] of [[World Team Tennis]] completed back-to-back perfect seasons, the first major sports franchise in the United States to do so. The Kastles swept each of the 2011 and 2012 regular seasons with a perfect 14–0 record, then in each season went on to win their two postseason games and league's championship, amassing a 32-game winning streak in the process. This streak stands one short of the all-time professional sports record in the United States by [[1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers season|the 1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1234">A '''personal record''' or '''personal best''' (frequently abbreviated to PR or PB) is an individual's best performance in a given [[sport]]ing discipline. It is most commonly found in [[athletic sports]], such as [[track and field]], other forms of [[running]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]].

The term "PR" came from the world of running, referring to a person's best time in a race of a specific distance. So, if someone runs their first 5K race in 28:45, that's their PR for the 5K distance. If they run faster than 28:45 in a subsequent 5K race, then they have a new PR for that distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kuehls | first1 = Dave | title = How to Run a Personal Record: Cover the Ground in Front of You Faster Than Ever Before | publisher = Penguin | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1440661877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, "PR" came to mean any new record in a sport that could be performed by a single person. [[Crossfit]] and [[powerlifting]] have popularized the term because a person's PR is used to measure their current level for a given exercise.

'''Plogging''' is a combination of [[jogging]] with picking up [[litter]] (Swedish: ''plocka upp''). It started as an organised activity in [[Sweden]] around 2016 and spread to other countries in 2018, following increased concern about [[plastic pollution]]. As a workout, it provides variation in body movements by adding bending, squatting and stretching to the main action of running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/237c63d4-0a54-406a-ae51-ad677a872456|title=Plogging is the latest Scandinavian lifestyle trend to rock your world|last=Frymorgen|first=Tomasz|date=January 30, 2018|work=BBC|access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/19/a-rubbish-way-to-get-fit-why-i-loved-going-plogging|title=A rubbish way to get fit – why I loved going ‘plogging’|last=Ross|first=Peter|date=February 19, 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/plogging-2018-fitness-trend-yet/|title=Is 'plogging' the most 2018 fitness trend yet?|last=Morrissy-Swan|first=Tomé|date=February 1, 2018|work=The Telegraph|access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3257">'''Proposition 48''' is LIT regulation that stipulates minimum [[high school]] [[Grade (education)|grades]] and [[standardized test]] scores that [[Student athlete|student-athletes]] must meet in order to participate in college athletic competition.

The NCAA enacted Proposition 48 in 1986.&lt;ref name="HistoryOfProp48"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fastweb.com/student-life/articles/347-ncaa-s-clearinghouse-rules-who-s-looking-out-for-the-student-athlete|title = NCAA's Clearinghouse Rules - Who's Looking Out for the Student-Athlete?| author = Richard Pound| date = 21 April 2009 | accessdate = 1 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, the regulation is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Before a high school student can be eligible to play [[Division I sports]], he or she must meet academic requirements in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Seamless Eligibility Model|url=http://www.jsutigers.com/pdf9/2577007.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=29000|work=Tiger Patrol Compliance Newsletter|publisher=Jackson State University|accessdate=7 February 2014|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those standards include:

* The successful completion of 16 core courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Deborah|title=NCAA Considers New Standards for Initial and Continuing Eligibility|url=http://www4.aacrao.org/semsource/sem/indexe992.html?fa=view&amp;id=2349|work=Strategic Enrollment Management|publisher=American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A sliding-scale combination of grades in high school core courses and standardized-test scores. For example, if a student-athlete earns a 3.0 grade-point average in core courses, that individual must score at least 620 on the [[SAT]] or a sumscore of 52 on the [[ACT (test)|ACT]]. As the [[GPA]] increases, the required test score decreases, and vice versa.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==New Regulations==
Beginning August 1, 2016, NCAA Division I will require 10 core courses to be completed prior to the seventh semester (seven of the 10 must be a combination of English, math or natural or [[physical science]] that meet the [[distribution requirements]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divisions I and II Initial-Eligibility Requirements|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/eligigfdghdhضضصنننشششbility_center/Quick_Reference_Sheet.pdf|work=NCAA ELIGIBILITY CENTER QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These 10 courses become "locked in" at the start of the seventh semester and cannot be retaken for grade improvement.

Beginning August 1, 2016, it will be possible for a Division I college-bound student-athlete to still receive athletics aid and the ability to practice with the team if he or she fails to meet the 10 course requirement, but would not be able to compete.

In sports, a '''revival''' is a new club or franchise is using a name or colours of a previously active team. The previously active team may be defunct, temporarily suspended or may have transferred its operations to another city. The new team may be a new team or franchise, or it may be a transferred team taking over a previous team's colours and/or name. Sports teams names or [[nicknames]] are copyrighted in North America and elsewhere. Therefore, permission often must be granted from the owner or family of the defunct team.

==Description==
Sports teams are organized in various ways and the term is used differently in different situations. A team can be simply not fielded for a season, but the parent organization still exists. A team and franchise can relocate to another city, and adopt a new nickname. At some point, sometimes decades later, a new team, with a new organization, then revives the team, name or colours in the original city. It may or may not be granted possession of the original team's history (team records, championships and the like)

===Simple suspension===
A team can be members of a sports association that fields several teams. A team at one level may be discontinued, then 'revived' in another year, such as the Central Plains Junior hockey team in 2012, after the team did not field a team in the AAA midget bracket the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Portage Daily Graphic |title=Jr. Caps revived  |last=Falloon |first=Dan |date=September 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival in name only===
In professional sports in North America, there are several examples whereby a team relocated, taking its franchise and franchise history with it to the new city. The teams were renamed and used a new nickname. The ''revived'' teams were not granted possession of the old team's history.

;Major League Baseball
The [[Milwaukee Brewers]] are named after an earlier club, which relocated to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and eventually became the [[Baltimore Orioles]], and a minor-league club named the Brewers. The [[Baltimore Orioles]] are named after an earlier club, which relocated to [[New York, New York]] and became the [[New York Yankees]]. The [[Washington Nationals]] are named after an earlier club, which relocated to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and became the [[Minnesota Twins]].

;National Hockey League (NHL)
The [[Ottawa Senators]] [[ice hockey]] team is named after an earlier [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Senators]] ice hockey team. Founded in 1883, the team was a member of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) from 1917 to 1934. After the 1933–34 season, the NHL franchise relocated to [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The Ottawa Senators continued as a senior amateur, and later a professional, team until 1954. The founders of the current franchise received permission from the descendents of [[Tommy Gorman]], who owned the Senators in 1954, to use the name. The new Senators also adopted the colours of the original franchise.

In 2011, the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] were sold and relocated to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], where the team was renamed the [[Winnipeg Jets]]. The 'original' [[Winnipeg Jets (1972-96)|Winnipeg Jets]] team existed from 1972 to 1996 until it moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in 1996 to become the [[Phoenix Coyotes]]. The Jets' team name and trademarks had reverted to the possession of the NHL after the move, although the franchise history (retired jerseys, team statistics) is continued by the Coyotes. While the new team revived the Jets name, new jerseys and team colours were developed.

===Franchise history reversions===
In two cases, a newly granted franchise has revived a team that was inactive, and has been granted the rights to the previous team's history:

The [[Cleveland Browns]] were a professional football team from 1946 until owner [[Art Modell]] moved the club to Baltimore in 1995. However, in a deal with the [[NFL]] and the City of Cleveland, the team was declared inactive for three years until a new expansion club, under the old name and colors, was established in 1999. The new Browns are considered a continuation of the old franchise.&lt;ref name="BAL-CLE_Deal"&gt;Morgan, Jon. [http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-modell020996,1,1050941.story Deal clears NFL path to Baltimore], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', February 9, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Montreal Alouettes]] are named after an earlier franchise which became defunct in 1981. The [[Baltimore Stallions]], which were formed through expansion, relocated to Montreal after playing in Baltimore from 1994 until 1996. The CFL considers all clubs that have played in Montreal since [[1946 Montreal Alouettes season|1946]] as one franchise in their league records, including those of the original Alouettes (1946–1981), Montreal Concordes (1982–1985) and Montreal Alouettes (1986). The Alouettes and the CFL, however, do not recognize the Baltimore franchise, or its records, as part of the official team history.&lt;ref name="Grey Cup stats"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cfl.ca/article/by-the-numbers-grey-cup-glory |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419014653/http://www.cfl.ca/article/by-the-numbers-grey-cup-glory |archivedate=2015-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ring announcer''' is an in-ring (and sometimes on-camera) employee or contractor for a [[boxing]], [[professional wrestling]] or [[mixed martial arts]] event or promotion, who introduces the competitors to the audience.

In boxing and mixed martial arts bouts, introductions occur after both fighters have entered the ring or cage. Along with each fighter's name, the announcer typically also announces their height, weight, town, nickname, win/loss record and any current or past titles the fighter has won. In MMA, the fighting discipline is usually announced. In professional wrestling, wrestlers are similarly introduced, though usually before or as they come to the ring. In-ring introductions are sometimes used for title matches or other major bouts, to add a "big fight feel".

The ring announcer often states the rules of the match. In boxing and MMA, this is usually limited to the number of scheduled rounds and the length of each round. In professional wrestling, the [[Professional wrestling match types|variations are much more numerous]] and so the announcer may have to explain significantly more to the audience.

When an MMA or boxing bout concludes, the ring announcer announces the winner, time of finish and method. If the fight lasts all scheduled rounds, the announcer will read the fight judges' scorecard totals, before announcing a unanimous, majority, or split decision victory for one of the fighters, or a draw. This is typically done from inside the ring or cage.

In professional wrestling, the announcement is usually performed outside the ring, and typically doesn't mention the time or method of victory; however, as professional wrestling shows do incorporate an official timekeeper at ringside, much like boxing and MMA, some ring announcers may be informed of the time of the fall at the match's conclusion and will relay that information to the audience as well.

Even further to this, some professional wrestling matches will stipulate a time limit, the confines within which a wrestler must win if he wishes to avoid a time-limit draw. In cases like this, the ring announcer may inform the audience of how much time has passed (and will ordinarily do so every five minutes) and how much time remains.

In a championship match, the announcer specifies that the winner is either still the champion or the new champion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2322">The '''short course prevention factor''' ('''SCPF''') is a multiplicative factor or [[coefficient]] used in the sport of [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], specifically [[road running]], to ensure that the measured length of a course is at least as long as the desired length of the course. The [[International Association of Athletics Federations]], the international [[sport governing body|governing body]] for athletics, as well as [[USA Track &amp; Field]], the national governing body for the [[United States]], specify the numerical factor of the SCPF to be 1.001. The SCPF has important implications when verifying [[world record]] performances.

However, just because the SCPF has been added to the measurement calculation, that does not mean that a 10k course is 10,010 meters in length.  The SCPF is designed to make sure that, in spite of wobble of the bicycle used for measuring, or small curves to avoid potholes or other obstructions, the course will still be at least as long as the advertised distance.  All certified 10k courses should be longer than 10,000 meters, but will normally be less than 10,010 meters,{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} depending on the measurer, and obstructions/hazards present during measurement.

The SCPF applies to courses measured by a bicycle and does not apply to measurements made with a steel tape or with an electronic measuring device.

A '''sports agent''' is a legal representative (hence [[agent (law)|agent]]) for professional sports figures such as athletes and coaches. They procure and negotiate employment and [[Testimonial|endorsement]] contracts for the [[principal (commercial law)|athlete or coach]] whom they represent.
Because of the unique characteristics of the [[sports industry]], sports agents are responsible for communications with team owners, managers, and other individuals.  Also, they are responsible for making recommendations in regard . In addition to finding income sources, agents often handle [[public relations]] matters for their clients. In some large sports agencies, such as [[International Management Group|IMG]], [[Creative Artists Agency]], Roc Nation Sports and [[Octagon (Sports Agency)|Octagon]], agents deal with all aspects of a client's finances, from investment to filing taxes.

Sports agents may be relied upon by their clients for guidance in all business aspects, and sometimes even more broadly.  For example, hockey agents start recruiting clients as young as 15, allowing the agent to guide the athlete's career before the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[NHL Entry Draft|draft]], which happens usually at 18 years of age.

Due to the length and complexity of contracts, many sports agents are lawyers or have a background in contract law. Agents are expected to be knowledgeable about finance, business management, and financial and risk analysis, as well as sports. It is important for a sports agent to follow trends in sports. Other skills an agent must possess are excellent communication and negotiation skills. Agents must be highly motivated, willing to work long hours, and capable of multitasking. It is very common for agents to be in negotiations on behalf of several clients at one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm Job Profiles.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109035912/http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm |date=2010-01-09 }} – description of roles of sports agent and some educational programs to prepare for the field&lt;/ref&gt;

Some agents are part of large companies, and some are on their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2007/07/16/an-industry-of-conglomerates/ An Industry Of Conglomerates] Sports Agent Blog, July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The number of clients an individual agent can handle and how many clients his or her employing agency can handle in total are interdependent variables.

Before the 1990s, most [[association football|football]] players did not use agents. In some cases, they used their fathers as agents. Because of most parents' naivete about the football business, these young footballers were often given less-than-stellar contracts by football clubs, which yielded lower salaries than they thought they deserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article396507.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 "The Big Interview: Neil Webb"] ''Sunday Times'', Nov. 28, 2004, interview with soccer/football player&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, there were only three licensed agents in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html "Market Saturation of Agents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810181903/http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html |date=2011-08-10 }}, May 23, 2002, note: source can be translated into English on the website&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2002, there were 33.  According to [[FIFA]], there were 5,187 licensed association football agents worldwide, with 600 agents in Italy alone.&lt;ref&gt;[ FIFA – Players' agents list – by country]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2001, agents have not been licensed by FIFA. Instead, agents are now licensed directly by each association.

Sports agents generally receive between 4 and 10% of the athlete's playing contract, and 10 to 20% of the athlete's endorsement contract, although these figures vary. [[NFL]] agents are not permitted to receive more than 3%, and [[NBA]] agents not more than 4%, of their client's playing contracts.

==Media depictions==
The popularity of television shows such as ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', which stars a [[talent agent]] named [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]], and ''[[Arliss]]'', have helped glamorize the profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2008/12/04/so-you-want-to-be-an-agent-the-entourage-effect/ "So, You Want To Be An Agent? The Entourage Effect"] Sports Agent Blog, Dec. 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to that, movies such as ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', ''[[Two for the Money (2005 film)|Two for the Money]]'', and ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' depicted sports agents. In England, ITV's ''[[Footballers' Wives]]'' put a new spin on sports agents by casting a no-holds-barred female agent [[Hazel Bailey]]. The television show ''[[Ballers]]'', which started in 2015, also shows a strong depiction of sports agents.

Due to the popularity of these works, there has been increase of attention in the profession. Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s son decided to become a football agent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/blairs-son-to-become-a-football-agent-1829864.html "Blair's son to become a football agent"] Nov. 28, 2009, ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and development of sports ==
Historically many sports have developed their sporting equipment over time. For instance, the use of a football dates back to ancient China, between 225 BC and 220 AD.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerballworld.com/History.htm|title=History|website=www.soccerballworld.com|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As football remains the most popular sport in the [[21st century]], the material of the ball has completely changed over the centuries; from being made out of animal skin, to being lined with multiple layers of polyester or cotton.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As the sporting equipment industry improves, so does the athletes performance. This is due to the fact that the equipment is more efficient, lighter and stronger it forming a bio-mechanical system, interacting with the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s12283-015-0183-5 | volume=18| issue=4|journal=Sports Engineering|pages=191–202| title=Biomechanics research and sport equipment development| year=2015| last1=Stefanyshyn| first1=Darren J.| last2=Wannop| first2=John W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the massive adoption of wearable, new sport equipment tend to be electronics and connected to deliver data performances.

The '''Summit Series''', or '''Super Series'''{{sfn|Gray|1998|p=263}} (in [[Russian language|Russian]] ''Суперсерия СССР — Канада''; ''Superseriya SSSR — Canada''), known at the time simply as the '''Canada–USSR Series''', was an eight-game series of [[ice hockey]] between the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Canada]], held in September 1972. It was the first competition between the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet national team]] and a Canadian team represented by professional players of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), known as ''Team Canada''. It was the first international ice hockey competition for Canada after Canada had withdrawn from international ice hockey competitions in a dispute with the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF). The series was organized with the intention to create a true best-on-best competition in the sport of ice hockey. The Soviets had become the dominant team in international competitions, which disallowed the professional players of Canada. Canada had had a long history of dominance of the sport prior to the Soviets' rise.

The first four games of the series were held in Canada and the final four in Moscow. The Soviet Union surprised the Canadian team and most of the Canadian hockey media with an opening game victory, 7–3. Many Canadian sportswriters had predicted an overwhelming victory for Canada in the series. Canada won the next game 4–1; the third game was a tie and the Soviets won game four to take a two games to one lead after the Canadian segment. The series resumed two weeks later in Moscow. The Soviets won game five to take a three games to one series lead. The Canadians won the final three games in Moscow to win the series four games to three, with one tie. The final game was won in dramatic fashion, with the Canadians overcoming a two-goal Soviet lead after two periods. The Canadians scored three in the third, the final one scored with 34 seconds left, by [[Paul Henderson]].
&lt;!-- needs some supporting text:
"Summit Series" has become the most popular name for the event, but the popular name in the other official languages of the competing countries varies: in [[French language|French]] it is known as ''La Série du Siècle''—The Series of the Century—and in [[Russian language|Russian]] ''Суперсерия СССР — Канада''—USSR-Canada Superseries. The event was also originally named the "Friendship Series", quickly forgotten by most.
--&gt;

The series was played during the [[Cold War]], and intense feelings of nationalism were aroused in both Canada and the Soviet Union, as well as on the ice. The games introduced several talented Soviet players to North America, such as [[Alexander Yakushev]], [[Valeri Kharlamov]] and goaltender [[Vladislav Tretiak]]; the latter two are [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] inductees, with Yakushev being inducted in November 2018. Team Canada, the first NHL and professional all-star team formed for international play, was led by [[Phil Esposito]], who led the series in scoring, as well as contributing in other roles. The Canadian [[Line (ice hockey)|line]] of [[Bobby Clarke]], [[Ron Ellis]] and Henderson, which was not expected to start for the team, as none were yet stars, played a surprisingly large role in the Canadian win with Henderson scoring the game-winning goal in each of games six through eight. The series was filled with controversy, starting with the exclusion of top Canadian player [[Bobby Hull]] because he had signed a contract to play in the new World Hockey Association, and disputes over officiating, dirty play on the part of both teams, and the deliberate injury of Kharlamov by Clarke in game six.  Hull had been the second leading goal-scorer in the NHL the previous season (and had led the league in goal-scoring seven times), and with a knee injury forcing superstar defenceman [[Bobby Orr]], the second leading point scorer in the league the previous season (and scoring champion two years prior) to sit out, Canada was arguably playing without two of its best three players (the other being Esposito, the three-time and defending league scoring champion).

==Background==
From the beginning of the IIHF [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] in 1920, Canada would send a senior amateur club team, usually the previous year's [[Allan Cup]] champion, to compete as the Canadian entry.{{sfn|Podnieks|2012|p=1}} These teams were often university players, or unpaid players playing ice hockey while being employed in some other profession full-time. From the 1920s until the 1950s, Canadian amateur club teams won most of the World Championship and Olympic titles.{{sfn|Podnieks|2012|p=1}} As a career, Canadian players would play instead in the various professional hockey leagues, the best reaching the NHL. Their professional status made them ineligible to play in the World Championships or Olympics under the rules of the time. The last Canadian amateur club to win the world championship was the [[Trail Smoke Eaters]] in the [[1961 Ice Hockey World Championships|1961 championship]].

In the earliest days of the Soviet Union, [[bandy]] or "Russian hockey" was played, not "Canadian hockey", and the Soviets did not compete in the Olympics or World Championships, which played the Canadian game. Post-[[World War II]], a goal of the Central Committee of the Soviet Union was world supremacy in sport. The decision was made to transfer resources to the Canadian game.{{sfn|Martin|1990|p=23}} Starting in the 1940s, the Soviet Union started a Soviet hockey league playing the Canadian game.{{sfn|Martin|1990|p=23}} The elite sports societies of the Soviet Union, such as [[CSKA Moscow]] (Central Sports Club Army), [[Dynamo Sports Club|Dynamo]] and [[Spartak (sports society)|Spartak]], soon became the elite teams of the hockey league and supplied the players for the national team. Ostensibly amateurs, the players played hockey full-time, paid by the government.{{sfn|Martin|1990|p=6}} The players had other titular professions; for example Moscow Dynamo players became officers of the [[KGB]]; CSKA Moscow players became officers in the [[Red Army|army]].{{sfn|Martin|1990|p=20}} This preserved a player's amateur status for Olympic and World Championship eligibility and the players would have a career after their hockey playing days ended.{{sfn|Martin|1990|pp=20–21}}

Entering international play in 1954, the Soviet national team under the tutelage of [[Anatoly Tarasov]] started to dominate the international competitions, and won nine consecutive championships in the 1960s. Canada, in response, developed a national team of its own.{{sfn|MacSkimming|1996|p=7}} But Canada's best players usually became professionals and the national team featured mostly university players. The Canadian team did not win any championships and was looked upon as a failure.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=65}} By 1969, the [[Government of Canada]] had formed [[Hockey Canada]], an organization to co-ordinate Canadian international play with its amateur organizations and the NHL. In July 1969, on a trial basis, the inclusion of nine professional players for any event for one year was agreed to by the IIHF.{{sfn|Podnieks|2012|p=3}} Canada entered a team with five professionals in the [[Channel One Cup (ice hockey)|Izvestia tournament]] at Christmas in 1969, and nearly won the tournament. The IIHF then convened an emergency meeting in January 1970, and the rule allowing professionals was rescinded. In response, Canada withdrew from IIHF play.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=23}} The [[1970 World Ice Hockey Championships|1970 IIHF World Championships]], scheduled to be held in Canada for the first time, were transferred to [[Sweden]] after Canada refused to host the event.{{sfn|Podnieks|2012|p=4}}

==Organization==
The Canadian embassy in [[Moscow]] learned of the Soviets' interest in a series initially through reading an article in the Soviet ''[[Izvestia]]'' newspaper in the winter of 1971–1972. Diplomat Gary Smith, responsible for sport and cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union, read that the Soviets were looking for a new challenge in ice hockey. Smith met with ''Izvestia'' sports editor Boris Fedosov initially, then followed up with a meeting with Soviet hockey boss Andrei Starovoitov. The Soviets divulged that they were ready to play in a series between its national team and Canadian professionals. After the meetings, Canadian ambassador [[Robert Ford (poet)|Robert Ford]] passed the matter to Ottawa to negotiate a series and Hockey Canada was given the task to nail down the terms for a series.{{sfn|MacSkimming|1996|pp=7–8}}

The negotiations for the series were finalized at the [[Hotel International Prague]] during the [[1972 World Ice Hockey Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Houston|first=William|last2=Shoalts|first2=David|title=Eagleson: The Fall of a Hockey Czar|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson Ltd.|date=1993|location=Whitby, Ontario|isbn=0-07-551706-X|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed on April 18, 1972, by [[Joe Kryczka]] as the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA) president, [[Andrey Starovoytov]] as the [[Ice Hockey Federation of Russia|Soviet Union Ice Hockey Federation]] general secretary, [[Bunny Ahearne]] as the president of the IIHF, and former CAHA president [[Fred Page]] as the vice-president of the IIHF.&lt;ref name="Maki"&gt;{{cite web|title=Man who helped set up games is erased from tournament lore|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/man-who-helped-set-up-games-is-erased-from-tournament-lore/article25305354/|last=Maki|first=Allan|date=2002-09-20|website=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two sides agreed on the terms: four games in Canada, to be held in [[Montreal]] ([[Montreal Forum]]), [[Toronto]] ([[Maple Leaf Gardens]]), [[Winnipeg]] ([[Winnipeg Arena]]), and [[Vancouver]] ([[Pacific Coliseum]]) and four games in the Soviet Union, all of them to be held in Moscow at the [[Luzhniki Palace of Sports|Luzhniki Ice Palace]]. The Canadians agreed to hold the series in September and play the games under international rules. The Canadians agreed to IIHF amateur referees in the Canada part of the series, and European referees in the Moscow games. The refereeing would use the international two referee system, not the one referee, two linemen system in place in the NHL, and, at the time, being introduced into international play. The Canadian side agreed to the terms under the belief that the Canadians would have no difficulty winning under any set of conditions. Kryczka felt that the Soviets had demanded the concessions for their own benefit, believing that their team was already equal to any NHL team.{{sfn|MacSkimming|1996|pp=8–10}} The NHL later requested dates in October or November but the idea was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |title=Russia may fight switch |date=June 8, 1972 |page=44 |last=Cauz |first=Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHL players' union president and Hockey Canada director [[Alan Eagleson]], while not involved in the initial negotiations, became a central figure in the organization of the series.{{sfn|Hoppener|1972|p=2}} Eagleson, who could call on a personal network of players, NHL owners, Hockey Canada executives and Canadian business, would be involved in most arrangements for the Canadian team.{{sfn|Hoppener|1972|p=2}} Eagleson would confide to ''Toronto Star'' reporter Alexander Ross, that he "un-negotiated" much of what had been negotiated between the governments.{{sfn|Ross|1972|p=10}} Eagleson placated the NHL owners by arranging that part of the series' proceeds would go to the NHL player's pension fund, reducing payments from the owners, and threatening to have his player clients play without NHL co-operation.{{sfn|Ross|1972|p=11}} Before the first game, Eagleson personally paid to settle a lawsuit won by a Montreal man, whose car had been destroyed in the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. The court had ordered the Soviet team's hockey equipment seized to guarantee payment, threatening the start of the series.{{sfn|McKinley|2006|p=211}}

Former [[Boston Bruins]]' coach [[Harry Sinden]], who had been out of hockey since leaving the Bruins in 1970, was suggested by the media as a good candidate for the job of Team Canada's coach. Ron Brown, a sportswriter from [[Kingston, Ontario]] called Sinden and in the interview, Sinden admitted that he was available and willing to take the position. After a phone call from Sinden to Alan Eagleson, it was arranged for Sinden to have an interview with Hockey Canada's steering committee for the series in June. After the one interview, Hockey Canada selected Sinden for the position.{{sfn |Sinden |1972 |pp=51–53}} Sinden selected former player [[John Ferguson Sr.|John Ferguson]] as his [[assistant coach]], after initially trying to recruit Ferguson as a player.

The Soviets selected [[Vsevolod Bobrov]] as the coach for the series. Bobrov was a former player who had played against Team Canada in the 1950s{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=12}} and later managed the Soviet national soccer team and the [[HC Spartak Moscow|Moscow Spartak ice hockey team]].{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=105}} Bobrov had been given the job as the Soviets' national ice hockey team coach, replacing long-time coach Anatoly Tarasov after the 1972 Winter Olympics.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=105}} This was his second international assignment; his first was the [[1972 World Ice Hockey Championships|1972 World Championship]], where [[Czechoslovakia]] had defeated the Soviet Union, ending a run of nine consecutive championships by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="Page 199"&gt;{{harvnb|Szemberg|Podnieks|2007|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian team would be known as ''Team Canada'' for the first time. The name and sweater design was done by advertising agency Vickers and Benson. Eagleson wanted to call the team the "NHL All-Stars", but the agency convinced Eagleson otherwise, as the teams were from the USSR and Canada. The name Team Canada was inspired by the contemporary auto-racing team ''[[Team McLaren]]''. The name is attributed to copy writer Terry Hill, whose first choice "The Dream Team" was rejected. The design of the sweater by designer John Lloyd utilized an enormous stylized maple leaf, like the Canadian flag, that covers the front. No numbers were on the sleeves, only on the back with the wording "CANADA" above the number. The sweater used only two colours: red and white, the maple leaf, numbers and letters in one colour and the rest of the sweater the other. The name, sweater design and a team song were all prepared in 24 hours, in time for a previously scheduled news conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=National Post|url=http://life.nationalpost.com/2012/09/29/team-canadas-design-win/|title=Team Canada's design win |last=Smith |first=Nigel |date=September 29, 2012 |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series itself was simply known at the time as the Canada-USSR Series, although the name "Friendship Series" had been suggested by the Government of Canada Ministry of Foreign Affairs.{{sfn|Henderson|Prime|2011|p=89}}

==Preparation==
Along with coaching, Harry Sinden was given the task of selecting Team Canada, which would be the first true "team" composed of NHL all-stars.{{sfn|Conacher|2007|p=17}} When Sinden announced the list of 35 Canadian players on July 12, one of the conditions of playing was revealed; that players would have to have a signed NHL contract by August 13.&lt;ref name="gz-jul13-72"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |last=Blackman |first=Ted |date=July 13, 1972 |page=1 |title=NHL brass blocks Hull's shot at Russia |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dh4rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=raEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=794%2C2382883}}&lt;/ref&gt; His list of players included Bobby Hull, who by that time had already signed with the rival [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) league.&lt;ref name="gz-jul13-72"/&gt; Three other players Sinden named: [[Gerry Cheevers]], [[Derek Sanderson]] and [[J. C. Tremblay]]&lt;ref name="gz-jul13-72"/&gt; had not yet signed with the WHA, but would do so and become ineligible. The condition had been negotiated between the NHL and Hockey Canada, and the NHL would not relent. The condition was widely criticized, including by the NHL's own [[Harold Ballard]], the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] owner and a harsh opponent of the WHA. Ballard felt that the series was the "unofficial world series of hockey and we want to win".&lt;ref name="gz-jul14-72"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Ballard raps rule, says Hull should play |pages=17–18 |date=July 14, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phil Reimer, a governor of Hockey Canada, resigned over the matter.&lt;ref name="gz-jul14-72"/&gt; Prime Minister Trudeau made a personal appeal, but [[Doug Fisher (politician)|Doug Fisher]], chairman of Hockey Canada refused to re-open the agreement between the NHL and Hockey Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=PM hopeful Hull will play |page=17 |date=July 14, 1972 |last=Blakely |first=Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to training camp, there were several changes in the roster. [[Jacques Laperrière|Jacques Laperriere]] withdrew and [[Guy Lapointe]] was selected as his replacement. [[Dennis Hull]], brother of Bobby, considered turning down his invitation, but accepted because Bobby wished him to. Cheevers was replaced by his Boston teammate [[Eddie Johnston]].&lt;ref name="gaz-081472"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=August 14, 1972 |title=Fergy off ice, Russians: Laperierre off Team-Canada |page=15 |last=Blackman |first=Ted |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DgsyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w6EFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5431%2C3026106}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stan Mikita]] replaced Sanderson.&lt;ref name="gz-081972"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Mikita, Big M and Yvan: Best line ever? |date=August 19, 1972 |page=35 |last=Blackman |first=Ted |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EwsyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w6EFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2583%2C4269891}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rick Martin]] replaced Bobby Hull.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=92}} [[Bobby Orr]], who was selected to the team although he was injured, remained with the team during the series and practiced with the team, but did not play in any games.

Team Canada assembled in Toronto and started training camp on August 13. Sinden named four co-captains: Phil Esposito, [[Frank Mahovlich]], Stan Mikita and [[Jean Ratelle]].&lt;ref name="gaz-081472"/&gt; The team trained for three weeks in Toronto, and arrived in Montreal on August 31 for the first game. The team held a practice on September 1 at the Forum. The unheralded line of Bobby Clarke, Ron Ellis and Paul Henderson impressed in camp, enough to earn a place in the starting lineup for game one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Russia-Canada: This is the night! |date=September 2, 1972 |page=27 |last=Burke |first=Tim |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EYs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1878%2C353581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets named 31 players for its roster on August 11. The roster included four goaltenders led by 20-year-old Vladislav Tretiak, Olympic and two-time world champion. The defence was led by [[Alexander Ragulin]], who had played in three Olympics and nine world championships. The team was a veteran team with only a handful of players to make their national team debut. Several players were named provisionally, depending on their performance in the Sovietsky Sport tournament being held during August. [[Boris Kulagin]], coach of [[Krylya Sovetov Moscow|Krylia Sovietov]], was named the assistant coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |title=Russian National Team loaded with winners |date=August 12, 1972 |last=Yeliseyev |first=Yevgeni |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the forwards, the team did not name [[Anatoli Firsov]], regarded as the "Bobby Hull" of the Soviets, who had reportedly spoken out against his new coach.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=106}} Most of the players named were from the Soviet "Red Army" team HC CSKA Moscow, the team managed by former national coach Tarasov.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=105}}

Along with their regular training, Bobrov had the Soviet players take boxing lessons in preparation for the series.{{sfn|MacSkimming|1996 |p=106}} The Soviets arrived in Montreal not long before the series, on August 30. Staying at Montreal's [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]], the team began two-a-day workouts at the St. Laurent Arena the next day. They were already acclimatized to the time zone as the team had been training on Montreal time for two weeks before travelling there. They brought 15 forwards, nine defencemen and three goaltenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Hockey at 3 a.m?

The reason given was injury, but the media questioned if Davydov had fallen out of favour with Bobrov. Firsov was reported as having a knee injury to explain his omission from the team.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=45}}

During the pre-series period, two observers of the opposing team were allowed to scout the teams. Toronto Maple Leafs' coach [[John McLellan]] and Bob Davidson, the Leafs' head scout went to the Soviet Union to observe the Soviets in the Sovietsky Sport tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |title=Leafs' McLellan, Davidson draw spy mission to Moscow |date=August 12, 1972 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLellan and Davidson observed two games, while Kulagin, along with Arkadi Chernyshev, a former assistant to Tarasov, observed all of the Canadians' practices in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |title=Russian scouts disappointed by lack of hitting |date=August 18, 1972 |page=34 |last=Proudfoot |first=Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Soviet team was in Canada, [[Rick Noonan]], a trainer for the [[University of British Columbia]]’s sports teams, was assigned by Hockey Canada to assist the Soviets. Noonan, who would be later be named general manager of Team Canada for the [[1980 Winter Olympics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubcsportshalloffame.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?person_id=119&amp;searchall=1 |title=Inductees |publisher=UBC Sports Hall of Fame |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the only Canadian to have regular access to the Soviet's locker room, and he was behind the Soviet's bench during the first four games of the Summit Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/hockey-the-kgb-and-ill-fitting-suits/article4555468/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Hockey, the KGB and ill-fitting suits | date=September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expectations==
At the time, the National Hockey League was considered to be where the best hockey players played, and its best players consisted largely of Canadians. The public consensus of hockey pundits and fans in [[North America]] was that other countries, the Soviets in this case, were simply no match for Canada's best. The Soviets were not expected to even give the Canadians a challenge, and Canada was going into this series expected to win handily. According to Team Canada Coach Harry Sinden: "Canada is first in the world in two things: hockey and wheat." Alan Eagleson said "We gotta win in eight games. Anything less than an unblemished sweep of the Russians would bring shame down on the heads of the players and the national pride."{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=27}} The Soviets downplayed themselves, stating that they were in the series to learn.

In a poll of experts conducted by ''The Hockey News'', not one expected the Soviets to win a single game.{{sfn |McFarlane |2001 |p=9}} Journalist [[Dick Beddoes]] of Toronto's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' offered to eat his words "shredded at high noon in a bowl of borscht on the steps of the Russian Embassy" if the Soviets won one game.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=57}} Canadian journalists Milt Dunnell (''Toronto Star''), Jim Coleman (''Southam'') and Claude Larochelle (''Le Soleil'') predicted results of seven wins to one for the Soviets. American journalists Gerald Eskenazi (''New York Times'') and Fran Rosa (''Boston Globe'') predicted eight wins to none, while Mark Mulvoy (''Sports Illustrated'') predicted seven wins to one for Canada.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=27}}

Before the first game, former Canadiens' star goaltender [[Jacques Plante]] gave Soviet goaltender Tretiak advice on how to play the NHL forwards. Plante did this because he was "thinking of the humiliation he was almost certain to suffer."{{sfn|McFarlane|2001|p=10}} Plante himself predicted Canada would win "eight straight."{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=27}} In a game scouted by Team Canada, Tretiak had given up eight goals in a game played the day before his wedding.{{sfn|McFarlane|2001|p=11}}

A few Canadians gave a dissenting prognosis of the series. John Robertson of the ''Montreal Star'' warned that Team Canada was too poorly prepared and out of shape to win the series. He blamed the NHL: "This, the most important hockey event of our time, has been tacked onto the front of the NHL season as something only tolerated by the owners, and endorsed by the players as a means of enriching their pension plan."{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=58}} Former professional player [[Billy Harris (ice hockey b. 1935)|Billy Harris]] who had coached Sweden's national team earlier in the year, predicted a Soviets' win, largely on the strength of Tretiak's goaltending.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=27}}

Prior to the series, Bobrov held a press luncheon in Moscow. He refused to consider that either team would sweep the series. To him, Team Canada had "the fire power, know-how and goaltending", but how would it adapt to international rules, two-referee system and amateur officials? He conceded that Phil Esposito would "be difficult to move from the front of the net. I expect there will be some surprises for us when we meet your Canadian stars." He also predicted that Valeri Kharlamov "will stand out, even against your best Canadians. By North American standards, he is small but he has an excellent shot. I think he will be effective."{{sfn|Dunnell|1972|p=29}} Sinden was aware of Kharlamov and he selected Ron Ellis to the Team Canada roster especially to cover Kharlamov.{{sfn|Hoppener|1972|p=20}}

==The series==
===Game one===
Game one was held in Montreal in a very warm Montreal Forum on September 2 before 18,818 fans.&lt;ref name="gz-09021972-g1"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=They beat us almost everywhere – Sinden |page=14 |date=September 4, 1972 |last=Burke |first=Tim |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Eos0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1016%2C897699}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gamesmanship between the teams started before the first faceoff. Canada was assigned the home team for all games in Canada, while the Soviets would be the home team in Moscow. The Soviets would not release their lineup until they had seen their opponents', the opposite order, considering they were the visitors. The official scorer had to return to the Soviets' dressing room and demand the lineup.{{sfn |Sinden |1972 |p=13}} To Sinden, he wanted to put the Ellis-Clarke-Henderson line on against Valeri Kharlamov's line. The Soviets did not start Kharlamov's line and Sinden named Phil Esposito's line for the opening face-off.{{sfn |Sinden |1972 |p=13}}

The move paid off as Phil Esposito scored for Canada after just 30 seconds of play, knocking a puck out of the air behind the Soviets' goaltender Vladislav Tretiak.{{sfn |Sinden |1972 |p=14}} But even after a few minutes, Sinden felt the Soviets were coming on and having no difficulty getting through Canada's defence.{{sfn |Sinden |1972 |p=14}} Henderson scored after six minutes to give Canada a two-goal lead on a face-off win by Clarke, the only advantage that Team Canada had, in Sinden's estimation. To Canadian spectators and the media, the second goal gave the appearance that the pre-series predictions of a rout had been proven correct. But the Soviets got over any awe of the NHLers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Russians may change, too |page=13 |date=September 4, 1972 |author=Gazette staff |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Eos0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1484%2C892790}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored two goals to tie the score before the end of the first period. [[Yevgeni Zimin]] scored on a pass from behind the net, and [[Vladimir Petrov (ice hockey)|Vladimir Petrov]] scored a short-handed goal on a Soviet two-on-one break, with Petrov potting the rebound.{{sfn |Sinden |1972 |p=17}} According to Sinden, the Canadian players had lost their poise, "running all over the ice" to establish their hitting game, while the Soviets used an unexpected tactic, that of the long pass, to break a man out of their defensive zone.{{sfn |Sinden |1972 |p=17}} The Canadian defence was also dropping to the ice to block shots, while the Soviets only skated around the defence to get a good shot.{{sfn |Sinden |1972 |p=18}} Although Tretiak had given up the two Canada goals on the first two shots, he recovered later in the period to make a couple of critical saves off Esposito at point-blank range.&lt;ref name="gz-09021972-g1"/&gt; According to Esposito, "at Christmas time, it would have been 4–0 for us."&lt;ref name="gz-09021972-g1"/&gt;

In the second period, Kharlamov scored on a great individual effort to put the Soviets ahead. Kharlamov deked [[Don Awrey]], skated around him, faked a back-hand shot on Dryden, but scored on the fore-hand.{{sfn |Sinden |1972 |p=18}} Kharlamov then scored a second goal to give the Soviets a two-goal lead at the end of the second period. During the period, the air temperature in the Forum increased. By the end of the second period, the temperature in the Forum had reached {{convert|115|F}}.&lt;ref name="gz-09021972-g1"/&gt;

Sinden made changes for the third period. He benched Awrey and the Jean Ratelle line, going with three lines. In the third, Clarke scored to bring Canada within one. The Canadians attempted to get the equalizer, and [[Yvan Cournoyer]] put a puck off the post, but the Soviets broke out afterwards and [[Boris Mikhailov (ice hockey)|Boris Mikhailov]] scored on the counter-attack to restore the two-goal lead with six minutes to play. Mikhailov skated across the Canadian net about 20 feet out, lured Dryden away from the net, then back-handed the puck into the net between his legs.&lt;ref name="gz-09021972-g1"/&gt; The strategy of three lines, combined with the heat in the arena, had left the Canadians exhausted by then and the Soviets scored twice in the final minutes to finish with a 7–3 victory.{{sfn |Sinden |1972 |p=20}}

"I was stunned by their performance" was Sinden's assessment.&lt;ref name="gz-09021972-g1"/&gt; Former [[Montreal Canadiens]]' coach [[Claude Ruel]] commented that the Soviets' forwards were one of the most finely honed units he had ever seen. "They are always moving, never standing around, they head-man the puck as well as anyone has ever done — and they always seem to be in the right place."&lt;ref name="gz-09021972-g1"/&gt; According to Canada's goaltender [[Ken Dryden]]: "We didn't play our game at all. After they tied it up, we started playing a panic type of game. Sometimes there were five men going for the puck at once."&lt;ref name="gz-09021972-g1"/&gt; At the end of the game, Team Canada accidentally snubbed the Soviets by returning to the dressing room directly without shaking hands with the Soviets after the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=September 4, 1972 |page=13 |title=Game-end incident 'mistake' |author=Gazette staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The win by the Soviets was celebrated into the early hours back home, and many took the next day off work. Valeri Kharlamov's father Boris held an impromptu party at his Moscow apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Toronto Sun |date=September 17, 2012 |title=40 things you don't know about the Summit Series |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/09/17/40-things-you-dont-know-about-the-summit-series |accessdate=February 27, 2014 |first=Lance |last=Hornby }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game two===
The second game was played at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto. Sinden sat out several players from the first game, including Don Awrey, [[Red Berenson]], Ken Dryden, [[Rod Gilbert]], [[Vic Hadfield]], Jean Ratelle, [[Mickey Redmond]] and [[Rod Seiling]]. Hadfield took the benching hard, as he was from the Toronto area and felt he was being embarrassed in front of his home town.{{sfn|Sears|Park|2012|p=88}} On defence, [[Serge Savard]], [[Pat Stapleton (ice hockey)|Pat Stapleton]] and [[Bill White (ice hockey)|Bill White]] were added. On offence, Stan Mikita, [[Wayne Cashman]] and [[J. P. Parisé|J. P. Parise]] were added. [[Tony Esposito]] took over goaltending duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Sinden tries a new formula: keep the bear in his cage |date=September 4, 1972 |page=13 |last=Blackman |first=Ted |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Eos0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1104%2C893605}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinden's changes were to get "the diggers into the game and try to grind the Russians down. We had went for speed and quickness in our first lineup, yet the Russians were still faster and quicker."{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=22}}

Team Canada responded to their previous defeat with strong play in this game. The first period was scoreless, but the Canadians used the period to intimidate the Soviets with hard body checking, especially from Cashman, Bergman, [[Peter Mahovlich]] and Parise, to throw the Soviets off their game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Russians make new discovery: footsteps |page=37 |last=Blackman |first=Ted |date=September 5, 1972 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E4s0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1207%2C1176025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second period, the first goal of the match was again scored by Esposito, this time from a feed from his regular Bruins' linemate Cashman, who had retrieved the puck deep in the Soviets' zone after colliding with the Soviets' defenceman [[Vladimir Lutchenko]]. In the third period, Yvan Cournoyer wheeled around Alexander Ragulin and beat Tretiak. Yakushev got the Soviets on the board after teammate Yevgeni Zimin missed on a break-away. Lyapkin pounced on the rebound and fed it out front for Yakushev to bury the puck behind Esposito. Peter Mahovlich then scored a critical goal while Canada was short-handed, deking out the Soviet defender one-on-one, then Tretiak, to give Canada a two-goal lead. His brother Frank then finished the scoring on a feed from Mikita, who had circled around a Soviets' defenceman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |page=1,37 |title=Hey! We're not so red-faced now |last=Blackman |first=Ted |date=September 5, 1972|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E4s0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1604%2C984953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team Canada won the game 4–1 and tied the series.

The Soviet coaches blamed the loss on the refereeing. Bobrov complained that the pair of American referees, Frank Larsen and Steve Dowling, let the Canadians get away with everything. After the game, the head of the USSR Hockey Federation, Andrei Starovoitov, charged the door of the officials' dressing room and kicked chairs over.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=77}} The pair of referees, scheduled to referee game four in Vancouver, were replaced by the pair who had refereed game one and game three, Gord Lee and Len Gagnon. Team Canada agreed to the request by the Soviets to change referees, apparently not aware of Starovoitov's tantrum after game two.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |pp=85–86}}

===Game three===
Game three was played in the Winnipeg Arena in Winnipeg on September 6. After the second game, the Soviets said that they had strayed into playing too much of the Canadian style, as individuals, and promised to return to their team style for the third game. Canada went with the same lineup as game two, with the exception of Ratelle replacing [[Bill Goldsworthy]].{{sfn |Conacher |2007 |p=29}} Team Canada held leads of 3–1 and 4–2, but the Soviet side responded and the game ended in a 4–4 tie.

Canada took the lead only 1:54 into the game on a goal by J. P. Parise, but Petrov replied short-handed at 3:16 to tie the game. Petrov stole the puck from Frank Mahovlich and broke away and deked Tony Esposito to score. After a strong fore-check by the Canadians on the Soviets in their zone, Ratelle scored to put Canada ahead 2–1 after the first. Wayne Cashman dug the puck out of a scrum in the corner to feed the puck to Phil Esposito who scored to put Canada ahead 3–1. On another Canadian power play, Kharlamov was circling behind the Canadian defence and received a pass to put himself on a breakaway. Kharlamov deked Tony Esposito to score the Soviets' second short-handed goal. Paul Henderson scored seconds later to restore the two-goal lead, on an individual effort. The Soviets' "Youngster's Line" of [[Yuri Lebedev]], [[Vyacheslav Anisin]] and [[Alexander Bodunov]] then scored two goals to tie the game at 4–4 after two periods.&lt;ref name="gaz-090772"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Game 3 a saw-off! Them 4, Us 4 in Winnipeg |date=September 7, 1972 |page=1 |last=Burke |first=Tim |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FYs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=854%2C1506853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team Canada assistant coach Ferguson felt that the Canadians had gotten over-confident. "I was fooled again. I felt that after we had taken a 3–1 lead, the final score might be something like 7–1. But those two short-handed goals. When you score one short-handed goal it can turn it all around. But two? That's almost fatal." According to Tim Burke of the ''Montreal Gazette'', both goaltenders, Tony Esposito and Vladislav Tretiak, reached great heights, or the outcome could have been 10–10.&lt;ref name="gaz-090772"/&gt; Tretiak was making an unexpected start for the Soviets. The Soviets had planned to start [[Viktor Zinger]], but he was reported to be ill before the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=September 8, 1972 |page=38 |title=Russia's Tretiak earns ultimate – praise from NHL goalies |last=Proudfoot |first=Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets coach Bobrov complained about the refereeing and the play of Wayne Cashman, stating that "if that game had been played in Europe, he would have spent the whole game in the penalty box."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Canadian Press |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=September 7, 1972 |page=38 |title=Bobrov hits refs |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FYs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6162%2C1682907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game four===
Game four was played in Vancouver at the Pacific Coliseum. Team Canada was surprised to find that the crowd booed Canada during the warm-up{{sfn |Conacher |2007 |p=32}} and cheered louder for the Soviets during the game's introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Esposito booed, raps ungrateful fans |date=September 9, 1972 |page=25 |last=Blackman |first=Ted |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game started with two consecutive penalties by Bill Goldsworthy and Boris Mikhailov scored power play goals on both penalties to give the Soviets a 2–0 lead. Goldsworthy, who had started in place of Wayne Cashman, wanted to replace Cashman's truculence, but only hurt his team and was criticized privately by Sinden.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=34}} In the second, Gilbert Perreault scored on a Soviet own-goal to get Canada within one goal, but Blinov scored less than a minute later to restore the two-goal lead. Rod Gilbert scored a questionable goal that was disallowed and Canada's protests went unheeded.{{sfn |Conacher |2007 |p=33}} To Sinden, that was the turning point of the game, and the result could have been different had the goal been allowed, although Sinden admitted that it was "a beating."{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=35}} Vikulov scored to put the Soviets ahead 4–1 after two periods. In the third, Goldsworthy made partial amends to get Canada to 4–2, but Shadrin scored to put the game out of reach. Dennis Hull scored in the final minute to make it closer, but it was too late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Team Canada bitter in defeat |pages=1, 26 |date=September 9, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinden had changed the lineup and the Canadian goals were all scored by players Sinden had inserted in place of players who had played in Winnipeg. Still, Sinden felt that changing the lineup had been a mistake. According to Sinden, Ken Dryden, who had replaced Tony Esposito, did not have a good game; he was shaky and Tretiak was great.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|pp=34–35}} According to Conacher, the Soviets used cross-ice passing in the attacking zone, a tactic that caused problems for Dryden.{{sfn |Conacher |2007 |p=33}} Serge Savard missed the game after fracturing his ankle in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Savard comes home with cracked ankle |date=September 9, 1972 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team Canada was booed off the ice at game's end. Responding to the negative public and media reaction in light of the expectation for an overwhelming Team Canada sweep of the series, Phil Esposito made an emotional outburst in a post-game interview:

{{Cquote|To the people across Canada, we tried, we gave it our best, and to the people that boo us, geez, I'm really, all of us guys are really disheartened and we're disillusioned, and we're disappointed at some of the people. We cannot believe the bad press we've got, the booing we've gotten in our own buildings. If the Russians boo their players, the fans&amp;nbsp;... Russians boo their players&amp;nbsp;... Some of the Canadian fans—I'm not saying all of them, some of them booed us, then I'll come back and I'll apologize to each one of the Canadians, but I don't think they will. I'm really, really&amp;nbsp;... I'm really disappointed. I am completely disappointed. I cannot believe it. Some of our guys are really, really down in the dumps, we know, we're trying like hell. I mean, we're doing the best we can, and they got a good team, and let's face facts. But it doesn't mean that we're not giving it our 150%, because we certainly are.

I mean, the more – everyone of us guys, 35 guys that came out and played for Team Canada. We did it because we love our country, and not for any other reason, no other reason. They can throw the money, uh, for the pension fund out the window. They can throw anything they want out the window. We came because we love Canada. And even though we play in the [[United States]], and we earn money in the United States, Canada is still our home, and that's the only reason we come. And I don't think it's fair that we should be booed.|author=[[Phil Esposito]]|source=in a post-game interview on national television&lt;ref name="gz-09091972-booing"/&gt;{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |pp=117–118}}}}

Brad Park and Frank Mahovlich also criticized the booing. According to Park: "We get nothing — not a dime for this. Brother, I'm sick". Other players were more sanguine. Dryden didn't lash out at the fans. "I'm disappointed, but I can understand it. The fans wanted us to do real good, and they're frustrated we didn't. I didn't think I deserved to be booed. Tretiak frustrated us, but I guess I didn't frustrate them enough."&lt;ref name="gz-09091972-booing"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Esposito booed; raps ungrateful fans |page=25 |date=September 9, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fourth game, the series went on a two-week hiatus. The Soviets returned to the Soviet Union and continued playing in an ice hockey tournament. The Canadians took a few days off, then travelled to Sweden for a pair of exhibition games before arriving in Moscow.

===Game five===
Team Canada arrived in Moscow for the final four games at the Luzhniki Ice Palace, accompanied by 3,000 Canadian fans. Not long after starting practices in Moscow, Team Canada players Vic Hadfield, Rick Martin and [[Jocelyn Guevremont]] left the team and went home for what they felt was a lack of playing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Hadfield, Martin, Guevremont return home |date=September 22, 1972 |page=13 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ios0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=824%2C6035496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team Canada used its practice-time in the Dvoretz Sporta to learn the differences of the Soviet rinks. While there had been concern about the wider ice surface, what was most strange to the Canadian players was the fish-netting draped at the ends of the rink above the boards instead of glass. Considered "in play", the netting was strung tight, and a slap shot to the netting could catapult the puck back as fast as the original shot.{{sfn|Ludwig|1972|p=95}}

Game five was held on September 22. Luzhniki was filled to its 14,000 capacity, including Communist Party Secretary [[Leonid Brezhnev]], Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] and Soviet President [[Nikolai Podgorny]] and a large contingent of the military in dress uniform.{{sfn|Ludwig|1972|p=104}} The 3,000 Canadian fans were given seats, but a second group, of 150 Canadian sports figures, were unable to get seats.&lt;ref name="cp-5-report"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |author=Canadian Press |title=Fergy: We played 50 minutes |page=27 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I4s0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2070%2C6347756}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players marched out to the rink for the game to loud cheers, and accompanied by the song "Cowards Don't Play Hockey". During the pre-game introductions, Jean Ratelle, captain for the night, was given the traditional gift of bread. The players were all given red and white [[carnation]]s.{{sfn|Ludwig|1972|p=104}} Phil Esposito was given flowers, but he slipped and fell on a flower stem, landing on his back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |first=Ted |last=Blackman |page=27 |title=Esposito keeps on doing it all |date=September 23, 1972 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I4s0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2237%2C6345535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esposito recovered to laugh at his pratfall, and bowed to the delight of all of the spectators.&lt;ref name="gz-report"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=September 23, 1972 |page=1 |title=Undone by Super Soviet Rush |last=Blackman |first=Ted |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I4s0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1857%2C6207971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game, Parise scored the only goal of the first period, and Clarke and Henderson scored in the second to give Canada a 3–0 lead into the third period.&lt;ref name="cp-5-report"/&gt; Blinov scored for the Soviets at 3:34 and Henderson scored at 4:56 to restore Canada's lead. Anisin scored on a deflection at 9:05 to start a run of four straight goals by the Soviets, who won 5–4.&lt;ref name="gz-report"/&gt; According to Bobby Clarke, "we're not a defensive club, yet we tried to play defensively."&lt;ref name="gz-report"/&gt;

Despite the loss, all Canadian fans present sang "[[O Canada]]" as Team Canada left the ice. The cheering of the Canadian fans was unknown at Soviet hockey games. The Russian newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' noted wryly that the roof of the arena had withstood the loudness of the cheering and had remained in place.{{sfn|Ludwig|1972|p=102}}

Team Canada was now faced with the daunting task of having to win all three remaining games to win the series. To add to the Canadian struggles, Gilbert Perreault left Team Canada for home to focus on getting into shape for the upcoming NHL season. Perreault had played in game five, practiced with the team the day after, and then asked to return home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Perreault fourth to leave Team Canada and head for home |page=September 25, 1972 |agency=Associated Press |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JIs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=814%2C7103943 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game six===
Game six was a Canadian 3–2 victory. There was no scoring during the first period. Lyapkin scored the first goal at 1:12 of the second period, but the Canadians' confidence did not waver.{{sfn |Morrison |1989 |p=155}} The Canadians caught the Soviets in a lapse and scored three goals in a one-and-a-half-minute span to take a 3–1 lead.&lt;ref name="gaz-092572"/&gt; Hull flipped a rebound over Tretiak to tie the score after Gilbert had capitalized on a Soviet giveaway. Cournoyer scored on a set-up from behind the net by Berenson. Fifteen seconds later, Henderson scored what turned out to be the winning third goal on a thirty-foot slap shot.{{sfn |Morrison |1989 |p=155}} Yakushev scored late in the second on a power play to finish the scoring.

According to ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' sports editor Ted Blackman, Canadian players Ken Dryden and [[Brad Park]] turned in their first big games of the series. Dryden ended a personal losing streak to Soviet teams dating back to his amateur career and two previous games in the series. In his opinion, the Canadian penalty-killing unit of Serge Savard, Peter Mahovlich, Bill White and Pat Stapleton was "brilliant" as it held the Soviets to one power play goal despite the disadvantage in penalty minutes.&lt;ref name="gaz-092572"/&gt; Savard himself was recovering from a fractured ankle during the series.&lt;ref name="gaz-092572"/&gt; According to commentator [[Brian Conacher]], Team Canada had adjusted its game to not play "dump and chase" but instead retain possession in the offensive zone. The strategy led directly to Henderson's winning goal on an interception of an errant Soviet pass. According to Conacher, "for the first time, the Soviets had opened the door a crack and Team Canada had rushed through like a freight train."{{sfn |Conacher |2007 |p=50}}

Following the game, the Canadians complained that [[Josef Kompalla]] and [[Franz Baader (ice hockey)|Franz Baader]], the German referees of the match (the same ones who refereed a controversial Canada-Sweden game), were biased, since Canada was handed 31 minutes in penalties during the game, while the Soviets only received four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = 1972summitseries.com |title = game 6 recap |url=http://www.1972summitseries.com/game6recap.html | accessdate = April 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phil Esposito complained that one goal by the Soviets was directly the result of the referee dropping the puck while he was talking to a teammate.&lt;ref name="gaz-092572"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |last=Blackman |first=Ted |title=Canada edges Russia, refs: "Never gonna beat us again" |date=September 25, 1972 |page=21 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JIs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1006%2C7065723}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadians gave the pair the nickname of "Badder and Worse."{{sfn|McKinley|2006|p=222}}

; "The Slash"
During game six, Valeri Kharlamov was targeted by Team Canada for attention. According to Conacher, "every time they get a chance, they're taking him for a rough ride along the boards." Kharlamov was the target of numerous bodychecks by Brad Park.&lt;ref name="gaz-092572"/&gt; Things started to heat up in the second period. Kharlamov had knocked down Bobby Clarke, who in retaliation, rubbed Kharlamov's face with his glove to raise Kharlamov's temper and the two exchanged punches. Bergman then stepped in and bumped into Kharlamov and harassed him all the way back to the bench.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=175}} Peter Mahovlich later elbowed Kharlamov, who retaliated by dumping Mahovlich to the ice.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=175}} Later, Clarke raced down the ice to catch a streaking Kharlamov and deliberately slashed Kharlamov's already sore ankle, injuring it and according to reports, [[Bone fracture|fracturing]] it.&lt;ref name="burnside-2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&amp;id=2213576 |last=Burnside |first=Scott |publisher=ESPN |title=Kharlamov's life one of talent and tragedy |date=November 4, 2005 |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=New York Post |publisher=nypost.com |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/islanders/enshrine_shero_already_ax7OstToM3NjEwummlpi5J |title=Enshrine Shero already! |last=Brooks |first=Larry |date=June 24, 2012 |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kharlamov skated over to the Canadian bench and yelled at the Canadians, before limping off the ice to the dressing room. The referees handed Clarke a minor penalty for slashing and an additional 10-minute misconduct penalty. Later, with Clarke still stuck in the box serving the misconduct, the referees also gave Dennis Hull a slashing penalty, during which Yakushev scored.{{sfn |Conacher |2007 |p=50}} On his injured ankle, Kharlamov returned to play and very nearly scored on Dryden during a power play later in the second period.{{sfn|Conacher|2007 |p=52}}

The incident was widely reported and condemned by the Soviet press.{{sfn |Morrison |1989 |p=166}} Kharlamov himself believed that "Bobby Clarke was given the job of taking me out of the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=#17 Kharlamov |url=http://www.1972summitseries.com/kharlamov.html |publisher=1972summitseries.com |accessdate=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slash was apparently done at the instigation of assistant coach John Ferguson. "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle was hurting pretty bad.{{sfn |Morrison |1989 |p=166}} I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gare |last=Joyce |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=John Ferguson, 1938–2007 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=obits/ferguson/071227 |publisher=ESPN |date=December 28, 2007 |accessdate=May 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian journalist Dick Beddoes asked Clarke about it later at a team reunion, calling it a "wicked two-hander", to which Clarke replied "Dick, if I hadn't learned how to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left [[Flin Flon]]."{{sfn|McFarlane|2002|p=34}}{{sfn |Morrison |1989 |p=166}}

In a 2006 interview with the Russian ''Sport Express'' magazine, Clarke states that he was unaware of Kharlamov's sore ankle at the time and does not recall Ferguson telling him to target the ankle. Further, he recalled that Kharlamov had used stick work on him, and Clarke's slash was in retribution for Kharlamov's actions:

{{Cquote|We were going for the puck together, he pushed me with the stick, then turned around and skated away. I caught up with him and hit him on the leg, not thinking at all where and how I hit. I could hit them on the leg, but don't forget that they did the same things to me. I am all for fairness, so the players who play tough hockey have to be prepared to get the same thing back. And I was ready for that. Soviet hockey had no fights so the players used other methods to get the point across. Like a little bit of 'stick work' here and there, you know. And I personally don't mind this. I am a tough player and I respect toughness in others. But if I am poked with a stick I will do the same. We just had to adapt to the new ways of doing things, that's all.|author=[[Bobby Clarke]] |source=in a 2006 interview with ''Sport Express'' magazine&lt;ref name="sport-express-2006"/&gt; }}

On the thirtieth anniversary of the series, Henderson called the incident "the low point of the series", but would later apologize to Clarke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CBC |date=October 7, 2002 |title=Paul Henderson sorry for criticizing Clarke slash |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/09/19/clarke-henderson020919.html |accessdate=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2007 book, Conacher wrote that "from the broadcast booth I was shocked and disgusted when I saw Clarke viciously chop at Kharlamov's left ankle." He noted "that emotionally these games had clearly gone beyond sport for Team Canada and had truly become unrestricted war on ice."{{sfn |Conacher |2007 |pp=50–51}} Media opinion is divided on the effect it had on the outcome of the series. The controversy and admissions that have come forth throughout the years have led some to the belief that the incident could be considered a form of cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crooked: A History of Cheating in Sports |first=Fran |last=Zimniuch |page=xvii |year=2009 |publisher=Taylor Trade Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kharlamov, who had been one of the Soviets' best forwards, missed game seven, when the Soviets could have clinched the series and while he did play in game eight, he was not at 100% and did not score.&lt;ref name="burnside-2005"/&gt; In Clarke's opinion, there were other factors for Team Canada's turnaround in Moscow: "In Moscow we played much better than in Canada. We were almost equal to the Soviet team physically by then, we passed much better, we shot the puck much better, we became faster and played better on defence. Besides, when you have nothing to lose, it is easier to play. And after the fifth game we had nothing to lose."&lt;ref name="sport-express-2006"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Sport Express Daily |last=Malamud |first=Slava |date=July 24, 2006 |url=http://english.portal.sport-express.ru/articles/9_68/ |title=Bobby Clarke: I was no fighter&amp;nbsp;... |accessdate=August 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201201037/http://english.portal.sport-express.ru/articles/9_68/ |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game seven===
Canada won game seven by the score of 4–3. In the first period Phil Esposito scored two goals around a pair by Yakushev and Petrov, ending the first period tied 2–2. The second period was scoreless. In the third, Gilbert put Canada ahead, but Yakushev scored again to tie the score at three. At 17:54, Henderson fooled Soviet defender Tsygankov with a pass through Tsygankov's feet, then skated around Tsygankov to pick up the puck and break in on Tretiak. As Henderson shot and scored, Tsygankov tripped Henderson and Henderson did not see his shot go in. The goal light went on and off quickly and Team Canada rushed onto the ice to congratulate Henderson before there was any doubt raised about the goal. The Soviet coach Bobrov publicly blamed the loss on Tsygankov.&lt;ref name="gz092712-b"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=September 27, 1972 |pages=17–18 |last=Blackman |first=Ted |title=Canada-Russia series: Down to the wire |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Jos0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3137%2C7571080}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game, Henderson commented about the goal as the "one that gave him his most personal satisfaction ever."&lt;ref name="gz092712-b"/&gt;

The game also featured a controversial incident: At 16:26 of the third period, a scuffle broke out between Canada's [[Gary Bergman]], and the USSR's Boris Mikhailov, in which Mikhailov kicked Bergman two times before the fight ended.&lt;ref name="gz092712-b"/&gt; Czech referee Rudolf Baťa and Swede referee Ove Dahlberg officiated the match, and it was announced that the German referee pair of Josef Kompalla and Franz Baader had been sent home and Baťa and Dahlberg would referee the final game, in exchange for a promise that Bergman would not publicly berate Bobrov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |date=September 27, 1972 |title=Soviets agree to new ref if Bergman gagged |last=Blackman |first=Ted |page=17 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Jos0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4193%2C7571665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game eight===
Controversy ensued when the Soviets wanted to back out of the refereeing agreement. The Soviets wanted to include the German pair of referees, originally scheduled for the game. Eagleson threatened to pull Team Canada from playing the eighth game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |date=September 28, 1972 |page=1 |last=Blackman |first=Ted |title=Great referee battle goes on, and on, and on |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J4s0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2193%2C7779213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a compromise, Kompalla refereed along with Bata instead of Baader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |title=Peter to rescue, makes friend for life |page=13 |date=September 29, 1972|last=Blackman |first=Ted |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KIs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4978%2C8095390}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sinden|1972|pp=110–111}} The ill will spilled over into the presentation of a [[totem pole]] as a gift from Team Canada. The pre-game presentation was cancelled by the Soviets, but restored on the insistence of Team Canada. According to Coach Sinden, Eagleson stated that they "were going to take this totem pole and bring it to centre ice and they'll have to take it or skate around it the whole game."{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=112}}

Heading into the eighth and final game, each team had three wins and three losses and one tie, but the Soviets were ahead in goal differential by two goals. In Canada, much of the country enjoyed an unofficial 'half a day' holiday, with many students in Toronto being sent home the afternoon of the game (which began at 1pm Eastern Time), while many others watched the game at work or school.&lt;ref name="gz-0929-janigan"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Hockey sidetracked city for three hours as fans all over stayed riveted to screens |last=Janigan |first=Mary |page=1 |date=September 29, 1972 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KIs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3803%2C8031462}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Montreal's Central Station, 5,000 fans gathered around ten TV sets to watch the game,&lt;ref name="gz-0929-janigan"/&gt; which was simulcast in English on [[CBC Television]] and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], and in French by [[Radio-Canada]]. Until the men's hockey gold-medal game of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], it was the most-watched sporting event in the history of Canadian television.

Team Canada took a number of questionable early penalties. With two Canadians (White and Peter Mahovlich) off, Yakushev scored to give the Soviets the lead 1–0. The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he was called for interference, but Parise admitted later he was guilty of cross-checking)&lt;ref name="gaz-parise"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=September 29, 1972 |title=Parise points to pressure explaining loss of temper |page=14 |author=Gazette staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotions boiled over. Parise was called for a misconduct for banging his stick on the ice, and when he saw the misconduct called, he dashed across the ice with his stick raised.&lt;ref name="gaz-parise"/&gt; Parise nearly swung his stick at Kompalla and got a match penalty. Sinden threw a chair on the ice.&lt;ref name="gaz-parise"/&gt; Some writers have commented that the incidents resulted in the rest of the game being refereed capably.{{sfn|Bidini|2012|p=46}}

After Parise's penalty was served, it was Canada's turn to go on the power play, and Esposito scored his sixth goal of the series to tie it at 1–1. The teams exchanged power plays before Lutchenko scored a power play goal on a slap shot to put the Soviets ahead 2–1. Brad Park then scored his only goal of the series at even strength to complete some pretty passing between Dennis Hull and the Rangers' teammates of Ratelle, Gilbert and Park to tie the score. The period ended with the teams tied 2–2.

In the second, the Soviets started with a quick goal by Shadrin after 21 seconds. The last ten minutes saw two goals from the Soviets: Yakushev scoring his seventh of the series followed by Vasiliev on the power play to put the Soviets ahead 5–3 after two periods. White had countered for Canada midway through the period. It was one of few moments for Canada to cheer as the Soviets played an excellent period. The other was a goal-saving play by Esposito who stopped a shot by Yury Blinov who had faked goaltender Dryden out of position and had an empty net to shoot at. Blinov was denied by Esposito who stopped the puck with his stick on the goal line. Blinov and the crowd had prematurely celebrated the apparent goal, and Blinov shook his head in disbelief.{{sfn|Bidini|2012|pp=74–75}}&lt;!--- unsupported: During the second intermission, goalie [[Ken Dryden]] was reported to have thought, "If we lose this one, I'll be the most hated man in Canada."{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} --&gt;

Sinden told the players to try to get one back quickly, but play tight defensively and not allow the game to get out of hand. Don't gamble until after the half-way point if need be.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=114}} Esposito scored to put the Canadians within one. The tension rose at the rink, and extra soldiers were dispatched for security. It was matched on the ice as Gilbert and Yevgeni Mishakov had a fight. Foster Hewitt noticed: "You can feel the tension almost everywhere!"{{sfn|Bidini|2012|p=92}}

At the ten-minute mark, Sinden noticed that the Soviets had changed their style, playing defence to protect the lead, rather than pressing.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=114}} However, the strategy back-fired on the Soviets. The change in tactics gave the Canadians more chances to score{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=114}} and Cournoyer scored to even it up.

After the Cournoyer goal, the goal judge refused to put the goal light on despite the fact that it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) attempted to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=115}} As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave [[the finger]] to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=youtube.com |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lXDMA_bZZw |title=1972 summit series Game 8 and aftermath }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|pp=115–116}}

; "The Goal"
[[File:Paul Henderson 1972.jpg|thumb|upright|The famous photograph of [[Paul Henderson]] by [[Frank Lennon]]]]
In the final minute of play, with Phil Esposito, Yvan Cournoyer and Peter Mahovlich out on the ice, Paul Henderson stood up at the bench and called Mahovlich off the ice as he was skating by. "I jumped on the ice and rushed straight for their net. I had this strange feeling that I could score the winning goal", recalls Henderson.{{sfn |McFarlane |2001 |p=105}} Bobby Clarke was supposed to replace Esposito, but Phil didn't come off ("There was no way I was coming off the ice in that situation" Esposito said). Cournoyer picked up a puck that had been passed around the boards by the Soviets in a clearing attempt. He missed Henderson with a pass, but two Soviets mishandled the puck in the corner and Esposito shot the puck on Tretiak.

Henderson, who had fallen behind the net, got up and went to the front of the net where he was uncovered. Henderson recovered the rebound of Esposito's shot, shot the puck and was stopped, but recovered the rebound. With Tretiak down, he put the puck past Tretiak with only 34 seconds to play. Foster Hewitt's voice rose in excitement as he called the winning goal:&lt;ref name="hewitt-obit"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Montreal Gazette |title=Foster Hewitt, 81, was voice of hockey |date=April 22, 1985 |page=C1 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ikYwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=saUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2775%2C115416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene was captured on film by cameraman [[Frank Lennon]].

[[Pat Stapleton (ice hockey)|Pat Stapleton]] picked up the puck after the game.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |pp=39–40}}

Somewhat overshadowed by Henderson's winning goal, was a four-point game by Phil Esposito, two goals and two assists, and a hand in all three goals of the third period. Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series. According to Ron Ellis, he had "never seen another player have a period where there was so much pressure and was still able to accomplish what he did." Sinden considered it to be Esposito's "finest hour."{{sfn|Podnieks|2012|p=210}} Esposito describes it as "there was no stopping me. And I think some of the guys got a little angry with me. If we had lost, I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith in myself, that I was going to get it done, one way or another."{{sfn|Podnieks|2012|p=210}}

===Aftermath===
Team Canada arrived back in Canada on October 1. The team was mobbed by an estimated crowd of 10,000 at Montreal's Dorval Airport. Also greeting the team was Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] and City of Montreal Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]]. Montrealers Ken Dryden, Serge Savard, Yvan Cournoyer, Jean Ratelle and coach John Ferguson stayed in Montreal, while the rest of the team travelled on to Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |page=13 |title=PM, mayor, fans hail Team Canada |last=Moss |first=Marv |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qRMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7KEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=923%2C69540}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Toronto, an estimated crowd of 80,000 attended a ceremony at [[Nathan Phillips Square]] to salute the players. The players were welcomed by Ontario Premier [[Bill Davis]] and Toronto Mayor [[William Dennison (Canadian politician)|William Dennison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Toronto gives warm welcome |page=1 |url= |author=Canadian Press |date=October 2, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the series, it was reported that NHL president [[Clarence Campbell]] and Chicago Black Hawks' owner [[Bill Wirtz]] had concluded an agreement with the Soviets for the Soviet national team to play an exhibition series in January 1973 against the Boston Bruins, New York Rangers and Chicago Black Hawks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=3 games planned with NHL |last=Blackman |first=Ted |date=September 30, 1972 | page=1 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KYs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2093%2C8290816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell characterized the reports as "presumptuous". The NHL and the Soviets had held talks during the Moscow games, during which the Soviets had requested further games, but Campbell stated "we don't even know if we could schedule such a series" and "we're a long way from any arrangement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=October 2, 1972 |title=A request for more by Soviets |page=13 |author=UPI |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qRMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7KEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1953%2C73929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 1973 exhibition series did not take place, exhibition series would take place a few years later.

Kompalla gave an interview with newspaper ''[[General-Anzeiger]]'' after the series. "When I recall these matches, my flesh creeps. Ten more such games and I would age several years. I am very glad that I got back home uninjured." He went on to state that the Canadians played "very crudely, purposely using foul methods that endanger the lives of their rivals." He complained that the Canadian team threw "cucumbers and other leftovers" at his colleague Franz Baader on the flight from Moscow to Prague and harassed visitors in hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=German ref: 'flesh creeps' |date=October 5, 1972 |page=28 |author=Canadian Press |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rBMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7KEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3992%2C998939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby Hull also criticized Team Canada, stating that the fighting and gestures of the Canadian players "were a bad example to young players and diplomatically harmful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |author=Canadian Press |title=Hull raps demeanor of Team Canada |date=October 6, 1972 |page=16 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rRMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7KEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3904%2C1208298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet coaches Bobrov and Kulagin were interviewed after the series in ''Sovietsky Sport''. They accused Team Canada of "trying several methods to intimidate their players, though this war of nerves did not bring them success." The coaches said they were astonished that the Canadians argued with the referees. They singled out Team Canada Assistant Coach John Ferguson for his "pugnacity". They did compliment Team Canada on their defensive skills but felt that the Soviets were technically superior, and, but for some deplorable mistakes by their players, the Soviets would have won the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |author=Reuters |title=Russian coaches rap Team Canada |page=16 |date=October 9, 1972 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Eagleson was not repentant for his actions during game eight. Eagleson was not the only one jostled by police; Eagleson's wife and the Canadian ambassador's wife were also jostled. Eagleson woke up with bruises from his treatment. Eagleson was not sorry, but he regretted the incident and planned to not get involved in further series. He did get a letter of support from Robert Ford, the ambassador, who basically agreed with Eagleson's actions. Mail and messages about the incident was mostly in favour of Eagleson. According to Ted Blackman, Canadian fans were basically understanding of Team Canada's actions as being provoked while the team was under duress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Maybe I wouldn't do it again, but I'm not sorry – Eagleson |date=October 11, 1972 |page=33 |last=Blackman |first=Ted |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sRMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7KEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2536%2C2688663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviets' gamesmanship===
As well as the disputes over the refereeing, the goal judges on several occasions did not turn on the red light indicating a goal after a Canadian score.{{sfn|Sears|Park|p=99}} After Henderson's goal in game seven, Sinden sent the entire team off the bench to ensure the goal was counted.{{sfn|Sears|Park|p=99}} A similar incident during game eight led to the melee that Eagleson was involved in.{{sfn|Sears|Park|p=102}}

During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's treatment was the source of numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel.{{sfn|Sears|Park|p=94}} The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to their wives.{{sfn|Sears|Park|p=98}} The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half.{{sfn|Sears|Park|p=98}} At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.{{sfn|Sears|Park|pp=97–98}}

==Other Team Canada games==
===Sweden===
During the two-week hiatus between games four and five, the Canadians visited [[Sweden]] and played two exhibition games versus the [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Swedish national team]]. The Team Canada management had arranged for the visit to Sweden to get used to the bigger ice surfaces in Europe, and stopping in Sweden would provide some rest for Team Canada before resuming the series in Moscow.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=64}} The games took place on September 16 and 17 at the [[Hovet|Johanneshovs Isstadion]] arena in [[Stockholm]]. Canada won game one 4–1; the second game was a 4–4 tie. The first exhibition game introduced Canada to the two West German referees, Josef Kompalla and Franz Baader. These two referees would figure prominently in games six and eight of the Canada-Russia series.

Sinden considered the first period of the first Swedish game the team's worst since the team was put together, but the team improved and started to take command. Henderson, Clarke, Cashman and Parise scored. Sinden criticized the German referees: "...&amp;nbsp;they were absolutely terrible. They couldn't even skate. They were miles behind the play all night and don't know the damn rules. Their incompetence helped the game become very bitter." The players were also introduced to the style of play of the Swedes, who were well used to using stick work to throw off their opponents. "They were spearing, holding, interfering, and most of all, backstabbing." The Canadian players would retaliate and be penalized for their retribution.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|pp=64–65}} As an example of the referees' incompetence, Sinden pointed out that Esposito had been penalized for cross-checking, and given a misconduct for it. Sinden, who had played international ice hockey, knew that under international rules at the time, you could not give a misconduct for cross-checking.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=66}}

A dirty incident marred the second game. Cashman was cut in the mouth by Sweden's [[Ulf Sterner]]'s stick.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=67}} The cut to his tongue required nearly 50 stitches and forced him to miss the rest of the Summit Series, although he stayed with the team. Sterner was not penalized on the play. During the second intermission, Team Canada and Team Sweden scuffled in the runway to their dressing rooms before being separated by police.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=67}} Canada took a 2–1 lead in the game, but the Swedes were not in awe of Canada like they had been at the beginning of game one. The Swedish tactics were effective; Canada took 31 minutes in penalties to Sweden's two. Sweden led the game 4–3 before Esposito scored on a 35-foot shot in the final minute. The Swedish defenceman had actually backed into their goaltender, allowing Esposito an easy shot for goal. Sinden also admitted that the tying goal was off-side but the referees had missed the call. Sinden was "thrilled with the tie. I wouldn't be able to stomach their gloating if they beat us."{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=70}}

Team Canada was heavily criticized by the Swedish media for its "criminal"-style play during the two games.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=69}} Pictures in the newspapers highlighted the blood from a two-stitch cut the Swedish captain [[Lars-Erik Sjöberg]] had received on a cross-check from Vic Hadfield.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|pp=67,72}} Reports of the games led to criticism from back home in Canada, which incensed Sinden.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=71}} The team cooled off the next day with a session in [[Södertälje]] playing for the employees of a Volkswagen plant. The team played mock games against local teams of youngsters 12 and 13 years in age.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=72}} The practice improved the mood of the players. The team drank beer on the bus, and started "singing songs like a bunch of kids."{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=73}} Several of the players then went out drinking, impressing Sinden the next day with their best practice session to date.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=74}} The time in Sweden helped bring Team Canada together as a team and focused them for the final four games.

===Czechoslovakia===
After the series, Team Canada played an exhibition game against the [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovak national team]]; at the time, the world champions. The game took place on September 30 at the [[Sportovní hala]] in [[Prague]] and ended in a 3–3 tie. Canada took the lead in the first period on goals by Serge Savard and Peter Mahovlich. The Czechoslovakian team tied it with two goals in the second by [[Bohuslav Stastny]]. [[Jiri Kochta]] scored at 2:28 of the third and the lead nearly held up until the end. Canada pulled its goalie and Savard scored his second goal with four seconds left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Tie with Czechs' gratifying says relieved Fergy |date=October 2, 1972 |page= |author=CP-UPI |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qRMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7KEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4716%2C69518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the game, Stan Mikita was named captain of the Canadian team. Mikita had left Czechoslovakia at age eight to live in Canada with an aunt and uncle, leaving behind his mother.{{sfn|Sears|Park|2012|p=105}} During player introductions, Mikita received the largest ovation of any player. He took the opening faceoff and very nearly scored during the game.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=122}}

==Broadcasting==
The games' broadcasts were produced by Hockey Canada, using experienced hockey commentators from Canadian television networks. In English, [[CBC Television]] (CBC) and [[CTV Television Network]] (CTV) split the coverage, with CTV carrying games one, three, five, seven and eight, while CBC aired games two, four, six and eight. [[Foster Hewitt]] called the plays and former player [[Brian Conacher]] was the commentator for all of the games. At the request of the broadcasters, Hewitt came out of semi-retirement to be part of the broadcast. In French, all games were broadcast on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|SRC]] and the broadcast team was [[Rene Lecavalier]] and former player [[Gilles Tremblay (ice hockey)|Gilles Tremblay]]. For the eighth game, it was estimated that 16 million Canadians watched the match.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=photo insert}}{{sfn |Willes |2008 |p=76}} (A year earlier, the national census had counted 21,963,000 Canadians.)

A partnership between Bobby Orr Enterprises and Harold Ballard bought the broadcast rights from Hockey Canada for $750,000. The bid, negotiated by Alan Eagleson, who, at the time, was both Orr's agent and a Hockey Canada director, outbid McLaren Advertising, producers of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'', which had offered $500,000.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1996 |p=22}} Ballard-Orr realized a profit on the series of $1.2 million.{{sfn |Willes |2008 |p=76}}

The series was picked up by some U.S. television stations, such as [[WSNS]] (Channel 44) in Chicago. The telecasts of games one through four were produced by [[WSBK-TV|WSBK]] (Channel 38) in Boston and called by Bruins' announcers [[Fred Cusick]] and [[John Peirson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cusick |first=Fred |title=Fred Cusick: Voice of the Bruins: 60 Years in Boston Sports |publisher= |year=2006 |page=118 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGOkrNrrOfwC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=fred+cusick+summit+series#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781582619811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After efforts by WSBK to get rights to the four games in Moscow broke down, a last-minute deal by Boston public television station [[WGBH-TV]] allowed it to broadcast the CBC/CTV feed of games five through eight and to make the telecast available to PBS stations in several American cities, mostly those who had NHL, minor-league, or major college hockey teams. WGBH fed the Canadian telecasts; games six, seven, and eight were seen on WGBH and PBS on a tape-delay in prime-time.

The Soviet play-by-play was done by Nikolai Ozerov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |last=White |first=Peter |location=Toronto |date=January 9, 1976 |title=One way to span language gap |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the style of that time, the Soviets did not televise anything during the pre-game, intermissions or post-game. During the intermission, the screen went black, with classical music playing quietly. After the games, the broadcast simply ended and Soviet television networks returned to regular programming.{{sfn|Bidini|2012|p=76}}

==Legacy==
[[File:E7174-NN-Hertz.jpg|thumb|A quarter century later, ''Great Hockey'' (Большой Хоккей) videos of Soviet-Canada games remain popular with Russian sports fans. In this photo, they are advertised among top hits at a DVD shop in [[Nizhny Novgorod]].]]

While Canada formally won the series, there was no winning title, and both teams could claim victory. The Soviets earned the respect of fans and players alike; the Canadians went from scoffing at their antiquated equipment and strange training methods and practices to admiration for their talent and conditioning. [[Frank Mahovlich]] said, "give the Russians a football and they'd win the Super Bowl in two years."{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=44}}

Many Soviet citizens believed that the outcome may have been different if Anatoli Firsov and Vitaly Davydov had not sat out the series to protest a coaching change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/canadavsrussia/1972.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026133026/http://geocities.com/canadavsrussia/1972.html |archivedate=October 26, 2009 |title=1972 and 1974 Summit Series: The Beginning of the Rivalry}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, some offer that Canada was without [[Bobby Orr]] due to his knee injury as well as Bobby Hull (due to his departure from the NHL to the newly formed WHA league). These were arguably the best Canadian players at the time (along with Phil Esposito), so neither team had all of its greatest talent on the ice. The Soviet team had an obvious advantage of playing together year-round. Meanwhile, the Canadian team was picked and prepared in only a few weeks and most players were not yet in top shape when the series began. At the time, NHL players did not regularly train during the summer months, using the period for a holiday or other activities.{{sfn |MacSkimming |1989 |p=39}}

In the end, the Summit Series conclusively proved that the gap between the best Canadian NHL players and the top national teams of Europe (USSR, Czechoslovakia, Sweden) was much narrower than most observers on both sides of the Atlantic had anticipated. The Swedish national team coach [[Billy Harris (ice hockey b. 1935)|Billy Harris]] (a former NHL pro with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]) later recalled that "the (Swedish) media would ask me, 'do you see even one Swedish player who could possibly have a chance in the National Hockey League?' I answered, 'No, I see 14 of them!'"&lt;ref&gt;1981 Canada Cup / Coupe Canada. p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the 1972 Summit Series would lead to the development of the [[Canada Cup (hockey)|Canada Cup]] ice hockey world championship tournament open to both pros and amateurs, starting in 1976. It also led to regular series of games between Soviet and NHL clubs, known as the [[Super Series]]. By the 1980s, an increasing number of players were former members of the Swedish or Czechoslovak national teams. The top Soviet players were finally allowed to sign contracts with NHL clubs in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the USSR crumbled.

In North America, the Series (particularly the first few games) exposed the need for better preparation and off-season training. [[Philadelphia Flyers]] coach [[Fred Shero]] became an avid student of the Soviet style and was one of the first to bring the Soviet training techniques to the NHL as the Flyers won two [[Stanley Cup]] championships in 1974 and 1975.{{sfn|Hubbard|Fischler|1997|p=113}} [[Tom Mellor]] (who joined the small but rapidly growing group of American-born NHL players after the 1972 Olympics) lamented that the NHL training methods of the early 1970s were vastly inferior to those of the Soviets. "When I went to play for [[Detroit Red Wings|Detroit]] after the Olympics, [[Alex Delvecchio]] was the coach.&amp;nbsp;... When he would coach, we would do a couple of one-on-ones, two-on-twos, three-on-twos, we'd scrimmage, and he would scrimmage with us. At the end of the scrimmage, we'd do a couple of figure eights and then go to the bar. That was the NHL and pro mentality."{{sfn|Caraccioli|2006|p=128}} [[Mark Howe]] commented that the Soviet national team must have trained six hours on the day of a game in the [[1972 Winter Olympics]].{{sfn |Caraccioli |2006 |p=115}} On the other hand, Swedish sports journalists were extremely impressed by the toughness and "never say die" fighting spirit of the Canadians, who lost only one game out of seven on European ice despite often trailing in the third period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Hockeyns tio i topp |first=Ulf |last=Jansson |publisher=CEWE Förlaget |year=1973 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Soviet player Boris Mikhailov, who later became a coach, "it was a meeting between two schools of hockey and we have since continued this great exchange and we have learned from each other, taking the best of both styles."{{sfn|MacSkimming|1989 |p=21}}

As time passed, the significance of the series grew in the public consciousness, and the term "Summit Series" became its unofficial accepted name. In Canada, the Summit Series is a source of national pride, and is seen by many as a landmark event in Canadian cultural history.{{sfn|Henderson|Prime|2011|p=106}} In Canada, Paul Henderson's goal is considered to be one of the most famous in the history of the game.{{sfn|Deacon|1998|p=257}} The series is also seen by many Canadians as an important win in the Cold War.{{sfn|Henderson|Prime|2011|p=106}}

===Legacy events===
Many of the players would face each other again in subsequent international contests. Henderson would play the Soviets in the [[1974 Summit Series]] organized by the WHA. Eleven of the Soviet 1972 team players would play against the Montreal Canadiens in the December 31, 1975 game of the ''[[Super Series '76]]''. Five players of Team Canada 1972 would play for Montreal (Awrey, Cournoyer, Dryden, Lapointe and Savard).{{sfn|Leonetti|1972|p=34}} Many of the players would also play in the [[1976 Canada Cup]], including Bobby Orr, making his first appearance against the Soviets as a professional. He had the missed the chance in the Super Series '76, also due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |last=Blatchford |first=Christie |title=Good to his word, Cherry gracious loser |date=January 9, 1976 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, fifteen years after the series, a 60-minute commemorative video was directed and produced by Tom McKee and published by Labatt Brewing Company Limited, Toronto. The video includes interviews with Alan Eagleson and former players Bobby Clarke, Yvan Cournoyer, Paul Henderson, and Serge Savard in the studio. Every goal from the series is included as is a mention of the Soviets' "shenanigans," as they try to interfere with one of the Canadians' practices in Moscow. Eagleson would later be barred from public appearances with Team Canada members after his [[fraud]] convictions related to his hockey business dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto, Ontario |title=Alan Eagleson shut out by Summit Series players |date=September 1, 2012 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/alan-eagleson-shut-out-by-summit-series-players/article4514039/ |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |last=White |first=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Marcel Dionne]] retired as a member of the [[New York Rangers]]. He was the last active player from the Canadian roster. That same year, [[Sergei Priakin]] became the first Soviet to be given permission to play in the NHL, for the [[Calgary Flames]].{{sfn|Henderson|Prime|2011|p=109}}

In 1997, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] released a commemorative silver dollar coin to mark the 25th anniversary.{{sfn|Gray|1998|p=264}}

On November 2, 2005, the team was honoured, en masse, as members of the [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame|Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="cp-ss-induction"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Sudbury Star |title=Team Canada '72 inducted into Hall |page=B2 |author=Canadian Press |date=November 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the induction ceremony, Phil Esposito spoke: "A lot of people will go back and say 1972 changed the face of the game and actually I believe it did. I'm not so sure it changed for the better, by the way. But it did change the way we think and look at hockey in this country."&lt;ref name="cp-ss-induction"/&gt;

In 2006, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] aired a two-part mini-series called ''[[Canada Russia '72]]'', directed by [[T. W. Peacocke]]. The film is a dramatization of the series. The film was later made available on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.ca/Canada-Russia-72-DVD/dp/B000HBK052 |publisher=Amazon |title=Canada Russia '72 |accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, for the 35th anniversary of the series, Canadian and Russian national junior teams competed in the [[2007 Super Series]]. Four games were played in Russia, followed by four in Canada. Canada won seven of eight games and game seven was a tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/Team-Canada/Men/Junior/2007-Super-Series/Home |title=2007-Super-Series IIHF World Junior Championship |publisher=Hockey Canada |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the sweater Henderson wore while scoring the decisive final goal of the series was put up for auction by an anonymous American collector. The 42nd and winning bid of US$1,067,538 ($1,275,000 with auction fees, confirmed as the world record for hockey memorabilia by Guinness World Book of Records in March 2012.) was placed by [[Mitchell Goldhar]], a Canadian shopping mall mogul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Henderson-jersey-auction-destroys-records-sells;_ylt=AwrBTzEFew5TUkIARXPrFAx.;_ylu=X3oDMTE1ZzFtbHY0BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMwRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkA01TWUNBQzFfNzY-?urn=nhl,250657 |title=Henderson jersey auction destroys records, sells for over $1 million |publisher=Yahoo!

In 2012, the 40th anniversary, several events took place. The [[2012 Canada–Russia Challenge]], a series between Canadian and Russian players took place in August. In September, two books were published to mark the anniversary. That month, in Russia, members of Team Canada went on a tour of Russian cities to celebrate the anniversary. A reciprocal tour of Canada was planned but no funding was available from the Government of Canada to sponsor the tour. Nevertheless, the anniversary was marked with several events in Canada. Team Canada received a star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/paul-henderson-72-team-join-canada-s-walk-of-fame-1.1228185 |title=Paul Henderson, '72 team join Canada's Walk of Fame |author=The Canadian Press |date=September 23, 2012 |accessdate=February 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was replayed that month on Canadian television, and the Canadian team was honoured with a dinner at the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. The players again refused to appear with Alan Eagleson.

===Cultural references===
Henderson's goal in 1972 has been described as the "goal that everyone remembers" by the Canadian rockers [[The Tragically Hip]] in their song "[[Fireworks (The Tragically Hip song)|Fireworks]]" from their album ''[[Phantom Power (The Tragically Hip album)|Phantom Power]]''. The song describes the national eruption of celebration over the goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1972summitseries.com/fireworks.html |title=Fireworks |publisher=1972summitseries.com |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1994 film ''[[Anna: 6 – 18]]'', director [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] observes that to be a great nation, "Russia needed great enemies". The film then shows Phil Esposito in the penalty box from video of the series. Esposito is "performing a menacing pantomime" in the words of author Dave Bidini.{{sfn|Bidini|2012|p=32}} The term "Esposito" also was added as a derogatory term to street slang in Russia.{{sfn|Bidini|2012|p=32}}

The ''[[Corner Gas]]'' episode "The Good Old Table Hockey Game" featured an eight-game [[table hockey games|table hockey]] series based on the Summit Series. It referenced events such as the fans booing and Esposito's speech after game four, Esposito falling on the ice before game six, and Henderson's winning goal in game eight.

Protests during the playing of the [[United States national anthem]] have had many causes, including civil rights, anti-conscription and anti-war, anti-nationalism, and religious reservations. "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" was adopted as the official national anthem by U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931. Before that time, protests also occurred when a number of songs were used as unofficial national anthems, including "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]" and "[[Hail, Columbia]]".

==Early examples==
In 1892, three men, including a friend of [[Ida B. Wells]], were [[lynching|lynched]] by a white mob while in police custody in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in an event known as the [[Peoples Grocery|Peoples Grocery lynching]]. The act sparked a national outcry. At a meeting of one thousand people at Bethel A. M. E. Church, Reverend W. Gaines' call for the crowd to sing the then ''de facto'' national anthem, "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", but the call was refused, one member of the audience declaring, "I don't want to sing that song until this country is what it claims to be, 'sweet land of liberty'".&lt;ref name=sing/&gt; The Reverend substituted the Civil War-era song about the abolitionist martyr, "[[John Brown's Body]]". Well's husband, [[Ferdinand Lee Barnett (Chicago)|Ferdinand L. Barnett]], closed the meeting appealing for calm and a careful response, but also expressing great frustration and concern that the violence against blacks may one day lead to reprisals.&lt;ref name=sing&gt;Wouldn't Sing America," ''The Evening World'' (New York, New York) March 28, 1892, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6654115/wouldnt_sing_america_the_evening/, Not Their Country, ''The Decatur Herald'' (Decatur, Illinois) March 29, 1892, page 1, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6657652/not_their_country_the_decatur_herald/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
[[File:Goldman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emma Goldman]] was imprisoned for two years after opposing conscription in the US during World War I.]]
Refusal to stand during the national anthem became a widespread form of protest during [[World War I]]. In some cases, this was related to protest of [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;YMCA Boys Force A Slacker to Salute, The St. Louis Star and Times (St. Louis, Missouri) June 1, 1917, page 3, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116016//&lt;/ref&gt; It was also associated with support for [[Socialism]],&lt;ref&gt;Asked to Resign, The Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles, California) October 30, 1917, page 13, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116078/asked_to_resign_the_los_angeles_times/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Men who Sat While Anthem was Played Escape Fines, Jail, The Oregon Daily Journal (Portland, Oregon) June 18, 1918, page 4, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116139//&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolshevism]],&lt;ref&gt;Disturbers Cheer the Bolshevists and Show Contempt For Anthem, Harrisburg Telegraph (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) December 9, 1918, page 16, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116158//&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Communism]]. In one case, supporters of the Communism refused to stand during the song at a trial of [[Emma Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Reds Turned Out at Trial of Emma, The Sun (New York, New York) July 7, 1917, page 4, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116037/reds_turned_out_at_trial_of_emma_the/&lt;/ref&gt; The act of protest was very controversial, and many people were highly offended, so that even accidentally remaining seated could result in violence.&lt;ref&gt;Labor Delegates Strike Man who Spurns Anthem, The St. Louis Star and Times (St. Louis, Missouri) December 10, 1917, page 3, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116113//&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests during the anthem continued after World War I. For example, during the build-up towards [[World War II]], a group of students at [[Haverford College]] in [[Philadelphia]] refused to stand because they felt the custom was leading to "rabid nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Students Refuse to Stand While Anthem is Sung, Wilkes=Barre Evening News (Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania) May 31, 1934, page 21, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116195//&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 in [[Arizona]] a federal judge ruled that members of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] cannot be suspended from school for refusing to stand during the national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;Judge Rules for Religious Sect in Fight Over National Anthem, The San Bernardino County Sun, (San Bernardino, California) August 30, 1963, page 11, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116227//&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s and 1970s==

[[File:Jane Fonda 1975d.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jane Fonda]] at an anti-Vietnam War conference in The Hague in January 1975]]
In the 1960s, refusal to stand during the anthem took place for a number of reasons. In the late 1960s, the protest became increasingly common among athletes and at schools, both as a protest of the [[Vietnam War]] and as a protest of nationalism. In December 1968, Chris Wood, co-captain of the [[Adelbert College]] basketball team was removed from the team for not standing, saying, "We believe in the fellowship of man. We don't believe in nationalism."&lt;ref&gt;Didn't Stand For Anthem, Is Dismissed, El Paso Herald-Post (el Paso, Texas) December 11, 1968, page 24, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116260//&lt;/ref&gt; Five white high school students were suspended in [[Cumberland, Maryland]] in February 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Suspend Students Refusing to Stand for Pledge, Anthem, The Daily Courier (Connellsville, Pennsylvania) February 25, 1970, page 19, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116277//&lt;/ref&gt; A federal judge [[Joseph P. Kinneary]] ordered reinstatement of a pair of students in Columbus, Ohio, saying that forcing anyone to participate in "symbolic patriotic ceremonies" against their will was a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the US Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthem Protest Pair Reinstated, Lubbuck Avalanche-Journal (Lubbock, Texas (July 8, 1970), page 75, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116307/anthem_protest_pair_reinstated_lubbuck/&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1970, [[Kaye Stevens]] refused to sing the national anthem before a [[NFL]] game between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs]], although she had sung the previous week when the Steelers played the [[New York Jets]]. She said she was protesting the Steelers planned expenditure of $37 million on the new [[Three Rivers Stadium]] when local officials were underfunding treatment for drug users.&lt;ref&gt;Refuses to Sing Anthem, Traverse City Record-Eagle (Traverse City, Michigan) November 14, 1970, page 13, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116365//&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1968 onwards, [[Jimi Hendrix]] performed an instrumental version using feedback, distortion and other effects to deconstruct the music with the sonic images of rockets and bombs. Common interpretations link this to a protest against the [[Vietnam War]], opposed to Hendrix own explanation: "We're all Americans&amp;nbsp;... it was like 'Go America!'...&amp;nbsp;We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static, see".{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=271}}

[[Donald Sutherland]], [[Gary Goodrow]], [[Peter Boyle]], and [[Jane Fonda]] developed an anti-war comedy show which featured a skit about people refusing to stand during the anthem which toured about 20 cities in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-War Show has SRO Crowd, The Troy Record (Troy, New York) March 15, 1927, page 1, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116407/antiwar_show_has_sro_crowd_the_troy/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights movement===
At the same time, Civil Rights became an important cause which led to anthem protests. The [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]] was a political demonstration conducted by [[African-American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] during their medal ceremony at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in the [[Estadio Olímpico Universitario|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Mexico City]]. After having won gold and bronze medals, respectively, in the [[200 metres at the Olympics|200 meter]] running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]". Each athlete [[Raised fist|raised a black-gloved fist]], and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist [[Peter Norman]] all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, ''Silent Gesture'', Smith stated that the gesture was not a "[[Black Power]]" salute, but a "human rights salute". The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |last=Lewis |first=Richard |date=8 October 2006 |title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[University of Wyoming]] coach [[Lloyd Eaton]] dismissed 14 black football players who requested to wear black armbands to protest the racial slurs they faced during games, particularly against [[BYU]]. When the two teams played in 1971, about 50 students at UW refused to stand during the national anthem and wore black armbands during the game.&lt;ref&gt;Wyoming President Says Black 14 Issues Remain, The Daily Herald (Provo, Utah) October 21, 1971, page 19, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116500//&lt;/ref&gt; Another place where African Americans refused to stand during the anthem in 1971 was at [[Northern Illinois University]] basketball games, which led to widespread criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Banning Anthem Discraceful Action, Belvidere Daily Republican (Belvidere, Illinois) December 20, 1971, page 6, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116534//&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests became widespread, and in some cases, arrangements were made for the anthem to be played before athletes left the locker room. Lew Alcindor, later known as [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], began to refuse to stand at [[UCLA]] basketball games, and in response the anthem was played before the players left the locker room in the UCLA-[[University of Washington]] game.&lt;ref&gt;Walt Brown, Athletes, Celebrities Personal Moments: The 60s and 70s, AuthorHouse, Mar 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The same was done when the five starters of [[Florida State University]]'s basketball team, all African American, played [[Tulane University]] in 1971 in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;FSU Starters Refuse to Stand for Anthem, Albuquerque Journal (Albuquerque, New Mexico) January 14, 1971, page 25, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116445//&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vincent_Matthews_1968.jpg|thumb|[[Vincent Matthews (athlete)|Vincent Matthews]] in 1968]]

==Turn of the millennium==
On August 24, 1990, Irish pop singer [[Sinead O'Connor]] threatened to boycott her scheduled performance that night at the [[Garden State Arts Center]] in [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey]], if the U.S. national anthem were played. In her own words, she explained,

{{blockquote|I sincerely harbor no disrespect for America or Americans, but I have a policy of not having any national anthems played before my concerts in any country, including my own, because they have nothing to do with music in general...I am concerned though, because today, we're seeing other artists arrested at their own concerts...There is a disturbing trend towards censorship of music and art in this country and people should be alarmed over that far more than my actions...}}

The Center gave in to her demands, but not without controversy. [[Frank Sinatra]] criticized her the following evening while performing at the same venue, stating that he wished that he could "kick her in the ass." [[New York state]] Senator Nicholas Spano urged people to boycott O'Connor's subsequent show in [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]], saying "I'm sure Ms. O'Connor would be the first to complain if someone tried to censor her performance, yet she is trying to censor the national anthem by refusing to perform where it is played."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legislator Urges Boycott Over Sinead's Anthem Ban|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-28/entertainment/ca-409_1_national-anthem|accessdate=September 28, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Times Wire Services|publisher=Times-Mirror Co.|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, there was protest in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], when [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf]], guard for the [[Denver Nuggets]], refused to stand during the anthem before games in protest of [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] rhetoric. He was suspended for his actions and received hostile responses and death threats, but the issue receiving widespread attention.&lt;ref name=Hostile&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/sports/rodriguez-yankees-home-hostile-home.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ref=sports&amp;pagewanted=all Home, Hostile Home], ''[[New York Times]]'' (August 8, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jim Hodges|title=NBA Sits Abdul-Rauf for Stance on Anthem|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-13/sports/sp-46409_1_mahmoud-abdul-rauf|date=March 13, 1996|accessdate=December 6, 2016|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Sarah J.

In 2003, two women's basketball players, Toni Smith of [[Manhattanville College]] and Deidra Chatman of the [[Virginia Cavaliers women's basketball|University of Virginia]], made headlines for refusing to face the flag during the national anthem. Chatman, a Jehovah's Witness, protested for one game in March 2003 due to her anti-war views in light of the then-current tensions between the U.S. and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reedy|first1=Jim|title=U-Va.

During one of her team's games on February 23, 2003, a fan named Jerry Kiley, a self-described [[Vietnam conflict|Vietnam]] veteran, ran onto the court and confronted her with an American flag, saying, "She has not earned the right to disrespect the flag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pennington|first1=Bill|title=Player's Protest Over the Flag Divides Fans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/26/sports/college-basketball-player-s-protest-over-the-flag-divides-fans.html|accessdate=September 28, 2017|work=New York Times|publisher=NY Times Company|date=February 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Carlos Delgado]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] [[Major League Baseball]] team decided he would no longer stand during the song, "God Bless America" out of protest at America's wars in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Abrams2013"/&gt;

==2016–present==
{{main|U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)}}
[[File:Colin Kaepernick in 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Colin Kaepernick]] in 2013]]
During 2016, several professional athletes protested [[police brutality]] during the [[United States]] (U.S.) [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]]. The protests began in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) after [[San Francisco 49ers]] [[quarterback]] (QB) [[Colin Kaepernick]] sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third [[National Football League preseason|preseason]] game of [[2016 NFL season|2016]]. Kaepernick also sat during the first two preseason games, but he went unnoticed.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sandritter|first1=Mark|title=A timeline of Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest and the NFL players who joined him|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/9/11/12869726/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-seahawks-brandon-marshall-nfl|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests have generated mixed reactions and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.

Stemming from the Kaepernick controversy, before the beginning of the [[2016 World Cup of Hockey]] tournament in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]], Team USA coach [[John Tortorella]] told in an interview that if any one of his players were to sit out during the anthem, they would sit on the bench for the entire duration of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/world-cup-of-hockey/tortorella-will-sit-anthem-protests-team-usa/|title=Tortorella 'will sit' any Team USA player who protests anthem - Sportsnet.ca|newspaper=Sportsnet.ca|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3996">[[Image:Gesprungene beinschere vovinam.jpg|right|thumbnail|Vovinam practitioners wearing typical blue/indigo colored ''võ phục'' of Vovinam while practicing Vietnamese martial arts.]]
A '''võ phục''' ([[chu Han|Sino-Vietnamese]]: 武服) is a Vietnamese term that refers to a martial arts uniform (which may include a ranking belt), mainly associated with [[Vietnamese martial arts]] (Việt Võ Đạo, 越武道), particularly [[Vovinam]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lawler Martial Arts For Dummies 2011 "vo phuc (Vietnamese): Traditional uniform."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The term ''võ phục'' may be used alone in the context of Vietnamese [[martial arts]] (Việt Võ Đạo, 越武道) or '''often''' to refer to the martial arts suit worn by practitioners of Vovinam. The [[Vietnamese alphabet]] pronunciation (and writing) of the word ''võ phục'' differs from another common Vietnamese term ''vô phúc'' (無福) "bad luck."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taylor -Social Inequality in Vietnam and the Challenges to Reform - 2004 Page 316 "I was at home, my mother sighed all the time. She told me: "It is not important to me whether you get married or not but I cannot stand it when the neighbours say that we are unfortunate (vo phuc). "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Confucianism and the Family: A Study of Indo-Tibetan Walter H. Slote, George A. De Vos - 1998  Page 322 "Based on the manner in which one lives one's life, it can be a force for evil (vo phuc) as well as good."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage with Other Martial Art Forms===
Võ phục may be used before the accepted name of another martial art in order to refer to the uniform of that particular martial art. For example, ''võ phục Judo'' refers to the martial arts uniform used in Judo, known in Japanese as a Jūdōgi'' ([[:wikt:柔道着]]). The term functions in the same way as "martial arts uniform of," in English: ''võ phục'' (martial arts uniform of) Judo.''

===History===
From 1938 to 1964, there was no official coloration associated with ''võ phục''. However, after a meeting between Vietnamese martial arts masters in 1964, indigo/deep blue was chosen to be the official color of Vietnamese martial arts uniforms.

The official color was not necessarily adopted by all practitioners, as evidenced throughout 1973-1990 when many practitioners under a separate development of Vovinam, the "Viet Vo Dao Federation," wore black uniforms. By 1990, however, after further meetings between councils, indigo had been adopted by the majority of Vovinam practitioners in and outside of [[Vietnam]]. Deep blue/indigo (Vietnamese: Lam) is now the internationally accepted color of Vo Phuc for Vietnamese martial arts.

==Construction==
The ''võ phục'' of Vovinam are very similar, if not nearly identical, to the ''[[keikogi]]'' of Japanese martial arts. Both top and bottom of the uniform are constructed in much the same way as ''keikogi'', and the two are likely interchangeable if not for obvious differences in coloration.

The thickness of ''võ phục'' varies by school, preference, or size of a practitioner.

==Wearing==
As with the Japanese ''[[keikogi]]'', the ''võ phục'' top should be worn with the left front panel tied over the right. Pants are worn the same way as Japanese ''keikogi'' pants, and are adjusted according to the preference of the practitioner by loosening or tightening the appropriate fitting cords provided.

==Belt==
The ''võ phục'' is often worn with the corresponding ranking belt (Vietnamese [[:wikt:đai]], [[:wikt:帶]]) of the practitioner around the waist. Belts worn with ''võ phục'' for Vovinam are similar to those of Japanese martial arts in that they are constructed using the same techniques and materials.

[[File:Wyndham Halswelle.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Wyndham Halswelle]] won the 1908 [[Olympic Gold medal]] for men's 400 metres in a walkover. American [[John Carpenter (athlete)|John Carpenter]] was disqualified, and teammates [[John Taylor (athlete)|John Baxter Taylor]] and [[William Robbins (athlete)|William Robbins]] refused to race in protest.]]
A '''walkover''', also '''W.O.''' or '''w/o''' (originally two words: "walk over") is the awarding of a victory to a contestant because there are no other contestants or the other contestants have been disqualified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PAP team points out error in RP form, averting possible walkover in West Coast GRC|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/pap-team-points-out-error-in-rp-form-averting-possible-walkover-in-west-coast-grc|accessdate=29 March 2017|work=The Straits Times|date=1 September 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or have [[forfeit (sport)|forfeited]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; The term can apply in [[sport]] but also to [[election]]s, when it is also referred to as winning "by default". The word is used more generally by extension, particularly in politics, for a contest in which the winner is not the only participant but has little or no competition.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.: walkover&lt;/ref&gt; The narrow and extended meanings of "walkover" as a single word are both found from 1829.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

==Sports==
{{see also|Forfeit (sport)}}
The word originates from [[Horseracing in Great Britain|horseracing]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where an entrant in a one-horse race run under [[Jockey Club]] rules has at least to "walk over" the course before being awarded victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=2nd |at=walk 16e, walk over}}&lt;/ref&gt; This outcome was quite common at a time when there was no guaranteed prize money for horses finishing second or third, so there was no incentive to run a horse in a race it could not win. The eighteenth century champion racehorse [[Eclipse (horse)|Eclipse]] was so dominant over his contemporaries that he was allowed to walk over on nine occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Bios/Eclipse.htm|title=Eclipse|website=www.bloodlines.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1828 [[Epsom Derby]] winner [[Cadland]] walked over on at least six occasions.

The term is also used in [[tennis]], in reference to a player's unopposed victory as a result of the opponent's failing to start the match for any reason, such as injury.

The only Olympic Games walkover for a gold medal was at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]]: [[Wyndham Halswelle]] won a rerun of [[Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Men's 400 metres|the 400 m race]] as the two other athletes refused to take part in the rerun. The only time it has happened at the [[FIFA World Cup]] was in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 edition]], when [[Austria national football team|Austria]] was [[Anschluss|annexed]] by [[Nazi Germany]] before the former was scheduled to play [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. After the [[England national football team|England team]] declined to take Austria's entry, FIFA gave Sweden a walkover.

==Use in elections==
A walkover is usually the sign of a very strong [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] or [[unanimity|unanimous support]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teh|first1=Shi Ning|title=Chan Chun Sing: The practical politician|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/chan-chun-sing-practical-politician|accessdate=29 March 2017|work=AsiaOne|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can, however, be interpreted by critics of the faction the walkover is awarded to as a suspicious sign of [[electoral fraud]] or [[gerrymandering]] to prevent other candidates from participating. The circumstances of such an interpretation are usually controversial. Walkovers can thus often be a sign of an [[illiberal democracy]].

In civic organisations and civic societies, where personal charisma and personal politics often dominate, while parties or factions are often interested in a seat, they may not contest a seat that is being held by a long-standing or very popular individual, for fear of being seen as "rocking the boat". In elections for these societies, there is often "pre-election politics" where candidates attempt to figure out who is running for which positions; in this cat and mouse game, elected positions are thus often effectively decided by internal politics before a single vote is cast.

Many [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] in history, including the [[history of United States|United States]], have had uncontested elections because support for one candidate was so strong. In the [[United States presidential election, 1788–89|United States presidential elections of 1789]] and [[United States presidential election, 1792|1792]], [[George Washington]] ran uncontested for [[President of the United States|President]], although in the latter election the ballot for the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] was contested by both [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] and [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republicans]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1820|1820 election]], [[James Monroe]] also ran unopposed, though
New Hampshire elector [[William Plumer]] cast a vote for [[John Quincy Adams]] as a symbolic measure.

Election walkovers are called [[acclamation]] in [[Canada]].

Other multi-party systems that have held uncontested presidential elections include [[Germany]], [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ong|first1=Justin|title=Melvin Yong, Joan Pereira join PAP’s Tanjong Pagar GRC team|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/melvin-yong-joan-pereira/2052302.html|accessdate=29 March 2017|work=Channel NewsAsia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Algeria]], [[Iceland]], and [[Zimbabwe]].

Running without opponents is not always a guarantee of winning. Many elections require that the winner has not only the most votes of all candidates but a defined fraction of all votes cast, or of the electorate. In this case electors may be able to cast a [[blank vote]] or [[none of the above]] vote, [[spoiled vote|spoil their papers]], or [[Abstention|abstain from voting]], preventing the one candidate from winning and forcing a new election. In the [[Philippines]], the sole candidate in an uncontested election must have at least one vote in order to win the seat; this is also true in general elections in the United States, and there are cases in local government races where the sole candidate on the ballot finished with zero votes (as almost all U.S. government seats require candidates to reside in the municipality they seek to represent, this means the candidate themselves must, usually out of forgetfulness or lack of time on election day, fail to vote for themselves) and thus lose an uncontested election. In such cases, the other members of the body usually appoint someone to the vacant seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2015/09/10/man-loses-election-when-nobody-votes-including-himself/72008048/|title=Man loses election when nobody votes, including himself|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is not true in primary elections.) In theory, if a candidate is unopposed on the ballot but lacks support of their constituency, a [[draft campaign]] could outvote the unopposed candidate with any [[write-in candidate]], regardless of whether that write-in name is actively seeking the seat.

”Winning by default” can also happen when there are less candidates than what is required. For example, if a group requires 7 people, and only 4 people go for the role, the candidates may be elected by default.

==Use in poker==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
In [[poker]] games that use [[blind bet|blinds]], a hand is considered a walkover (usually shortened to ''walk'') when no other players call or raise the big blind, resulting in the player who posted the big blind winning the hand by default. Walks are most often seen in tournament play. [[Cash games]] often allow the players to "split the blinds" (i.e. take back their blind bets in case there are no callers or raisers by the time the action gets to the small blind), but this is usually not permitted in tournaments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5435">{{Other uses|Water boy (disambiguation)}}
In the United States, a '''water boy''' or '''water girl''' (sometimes spelled '''waterboy''' or '''watergirl''') was someone who worked in the field, providing water to the farm workers. Today, they work on the sidelines at sports events to provide water for athletes. The phrase has also been used to describe diminutive figures who serve another team or person in the business and political worlds, in a slightly derogatory manner (ex. "Bill is the CEO's water boy").

The position has a long history in athletics. In the [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game]], one of the earliest [[American football]] games, an unnamed water boy is documented giving aid to a Rutgers player.&lt;ref&gt;Princeton Alumni Weekly 1968- Volume 69 - Page 6 "1869... J.E. "Big Mike" Michael... Princeton's first football hero... Not only did the Knights fall, a bleacher stand toppled to the ground after Big Mike ran into it while chasing a loose ball. Big Mike was responsible for football's first waterboy because underneath the pile of spectators was a Rutgers man, G. H. Large who had been foolish enough to get in Big Mike's way. The water boy helped a groggy Large off the field.."&lt;/ref&gt;

Among notable people who served as water boys was President [[Herbert Hoover]], who was the [[Stanford Cardinal football]]'s first water boy.&lt;ref&gt;Sweetland Karen E. ''Super Bowl by the Bay'' 1984 Page 80 "A noteworthy graduate of the first class was Herbert Hoover (the football team's first water boy), for whom Stanford's Hoover Institution is named. Since 1891, the private university has grown and prospered in all respects, with a 1983 ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the term in modern American usage is now associated with sports, traditionally a '''water boy''' was a boy employed in traditional farming or industry to provide water for farm workers or machinery. In the [[cotton plantation]]s, just as the modern manual harvesting or picking, the water carrier is in constant demand. This is documented in the [[folk music|folk song]] [[Waterboy (song)|Waterboy]] "Water boy, where are you hidin'?" which is only the best known of many folk and plantation water-call songs.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Tully Boyle, Andrew Buni Paul Robeson: The Years of Promise And Achievement - 2005 Page 147 "The work song, "Water Boy," is built around the cry for water of a gang of condemned and laboring men. Robeson sang the refrain ( the water cry itself, "Water boy, where are you hidin'?") a cappella and very softly, and the verses themselves ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Courlander -  Negro Folk Music U.S.A. 1963 - Page 86 "In the cotton fields and the cornfields of the present time, as on the old plantations, the water carrier is in constant demand. The call for the water boy (or girl), in one or another of ... Some water calls such as "Water Boy, Where Are You Hidin'?" have come to be regarded as true songs, and may be heard on phonograph recordings. The water call given here (Example 14) was recorded In Alabama in 1950."&lt;/ref&gt;

Early agricultural machinery also needed a water boy to supply water for cooling. The introduction of steam threshing engines required large amounts of water to produce steam, and steam threshing engine teams would employ water boys to go from farm to farm with the engine team.&lt;ref&gt;Verdi Gilbertson  Verdi - Page 65 2010 "One year I was fortunate enough to get a job with a steam threshing outfit as a water boy. The steam engine that powered the threshing machine used a lot of water and burned coal. This steam outfit was owned by Gust Goulson. The steam ..."&lt;/ref&gt; This probably was behind the name "boy" on Waterloo Boy tractors from 1896, later products of Deere and Company. Waterloo Gasoline engines having recently introduced water pumps to replace the traditional farm water boy.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Leffingwell John Deere: A History of the Tractor - Page 70  - 2006  "It's likely the makers of this nearly self-sufficient machine used the name to parody the "water boy" who was still needed to fetch and deliver cooling water to the older-style large tractors around the farm. While Deere's own tractor had four ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The railroads also employed water boys.&lt;ref&gt;George Newman Fuller - Local histories of several Michigan counties - Page 380
1926 "At fourteen he was the first water boy employed by the Detroit, Lansing &amp; Northern railroad, now a part of the Pere Marquette system. He then became deeply interested in railroad construction and was determined to learn all he could acquire ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Official proceedings of the New York Railroad Club New York Railroad Club - 1922 - - Volume 33 - Page 6899 "As for your Toastmaster, he was the first water boy on the Long Island Railroad, and I believe that road was opened up in 1844 or thereabouts."&lt;/ref&gt;

In India the water boy, ''pani-wallah'' or ''bhisti'', was an occupation. The title character in [[Gunga Din]] (poem 1892, film 1939) is a water boy.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Dancyger ''The Director's Idea: The Path to Great Directing'' 2012  "The waterboy, Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe), wants to be a soldier. His transformation from waterboy to posthumous military hero gives the film its emotional arc.  "&lt;/ref&gt;
