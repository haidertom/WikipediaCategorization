'''Asia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ʒ|ə|,_|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə|audio=En-us-Asia.ogg}}) is [[Earth]]'s largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. It shares the continental landmass of [[Eurasia]] with the continent of [[Europe]] and the continental landmass of [[Afro-Eurasia]] with both Europe and [[Africa]]. Asia covers an area of {{convert|44,579,000|km2|sqmi}}, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the [[human population]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World at Six Billion |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbillion.htm |publisher=UN Population Division |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305042434/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbillion.htm |archivedate=5 March 2016 |deadurl=no}}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160101220025/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbilpart1.pdf Table 2]&lt;/ref&gt; was the site of many of the [[first civilization]]s. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely populated regions. Its 4.5 billion people ({{as of|2018|09}}) constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationof.net/asia/|title=Population of Asia. 2018 demographics: density, ratios, growth rate, clock, rate of men to women.|website=www.populationof.net|accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and [[cultural construct]], as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]]. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] separating it from Africa; and to the east of the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Ural River]], and to the south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s, separating it from Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title=National Geographic Atlas of the World |edition=7th |year=1999 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |isbn=978-0792275282}} "Europe" (pp. 68–69); "Asia" (pp. 90–91): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt;

The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination. The [[Silk Road]] became the main East-West trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the [[Straits of Malacca]] stood as a major sea route. Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=346605 |title=Like herrings in a barrel |journal=The Economist |date=23 December 1999 |issue=Millennium issue: Population |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104100155/http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=346605 |archivedate=4 January 2010  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], as well as many other religions.

Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a [[toponymy|name]] dating back to [[classical antiquity]]—may actually have more to do with [[human geography]] than [[physical geography]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Asia varies greatly across and within [[Regions of Asia|its regions]] with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the [[Middle East]], temperate areas in the east and the &lt;!-- extremely --&gt; continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in [[Siberia]].

{{details|topic=Asian borders|Geography of Asia#Boundary|Boundaries between continents|List of transcontinental countries#Asia and Europe|Copenhagen criteria}}

===Asia–Africa boundary===
The boundary between Asia and Africa is the [[Red Sea]], the [[Gulf of Suez]], and the [[Suez Canal]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This makes Egypt a [[transcontinental country]], with the [[Sinai peninsula]] in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa.

===Asia–Europe boundary===
[[File:Palazzo_Ferreria_statue.jpeg|thumb|right|Statue representing Asia at [[Palazzo Ferreria]], in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]]]
The border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/09/geography-in-the-news-eurasias-boundaries/ |title=Geography in the News: Eurasia's Boundaries |author=Neal Lineback |publisher=National Geographic |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508224947/http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/09/geography-in-the-news-eurasias-boundaries/ |archivedate=8 May 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when [[Peter the Great]], king of the [[Tsardom of Russia]], defeating rival claims of [[Sweden]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of [[Siberia]], synthesized a new [[Russian Empire]] extending to the [[Ural Mountains]] and beyond, founded in 1721. The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709 and assigned to [[Tobolsk]], where he associated with Peter's Siberian official, [[Vasily Tatishchev]], and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia. The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept, which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the [[Emba River]] as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the [[Ural River]] prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the [[Caucasus Mountains]], although it is sometimes placed further north.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;

===Asia–Oceania boundary===
The border between Asia and the region of [[Oceania]] is usually placed somewhere in the [[Malay Archipelago]]. The [[Maluku Islands]] in Indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with [[New Guinea]], to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, "The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process."&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{harvnb | Lewis | Wigen | 1997 | pp=170–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing definition===
[[File:Afro-Eurasia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|left|[[Afro-Eurasia]] shown in green]]
Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world, beginning with the [[Ancient Greeks]], being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia is larger and more culturally diverse than Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Herodotus]] a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them.&lt;ref name=McG-H&gt;{{cite web |title=Asia |url=http://accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=054800&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2faccessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d054800 |work=AccessScience |publisher=McGraw-Hill |accessdate=26 July 2011 |archivedate=27 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127141127/http://accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=054800&amp;referURL=http%3A%2F%2Faccessscience.com%2Fcontent.aspx%3Fid%3D054800 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Sir [[Barry Cunliffe]], the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely "the western excrescence of the continent of Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200812/editors-choice |title=Geography Is Destiny |first=Benjamin |last=Schwartz |journal=The Atlantic |date=December 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930211221/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200812/editors-choice |archivedate=30 September 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of [[Eurasia]] with Europe being a northwestern [[peninsula]] of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass – [[Afro-Eurasia]] (except for the Suez Canal) – and share a common [[continental shelf]]. Almost all of Europe and the better part of Asia sit atop the [[Eurasian Plate]], adjoined on the south by the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]] and [[Indian Plate]] and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the [[Chersky Range]]) on the [[North American Plate]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Gulf5..JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Ptolemy's Asia]]
The idea of a place called "Asia" was originally a concept of [[Greek civilization]],&lt;ref name="reid"&gt;[[T.R. Reid|Reid, T.R.]] ''[[Confucius Lives Next Door: What living in the East teaches us about living in the west]]'' Vintage Books(1999).&lt;/ref&gt; though this might not correspond to the entire continent currently known by that name. The English word comes from Latin literature, where it has the same form, "Asia". Whether "Asia" in other languages comes from Latin of the [[Roman Empire]] is much less certain, and the ultimate source of the Latin word is uncertain, though several theories have been published. One of the first classical writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Asia&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Asia – Origin and meaning of Asia by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=Etymonline.com|accessdate=9 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525113914/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Asia&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|archivedate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[metonymy|metonymical]] change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names, such as [[Skandinavia]] (from [[Scania]]).

===Bronze Age===
Before Greek poetry, the [[Aegean Sea]] area was in a [[Greek Dark Age]], at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun. Prior to then in the [[Bronze Age]] the records of the [[Assyrian Empire]], the [[Hittite Empire]] and the various [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia. These records are administrative and do not include poetry.

The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 BCE by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the [[Dorian invasion]] to this time. The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called [[Linear B]], deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, [[Michael Ventris]], subsequently assisted by the scholar, [[John Chadwick]]. A major cache discovered by [[Carl Blegen]] at the site of ancient [[Pylos]] included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.

Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals). They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children. The epithet ''lawiaiai'', "captives", associated with some of them identifies their origin. Some are ethnic names. One in particular, aswiai, identifies "women of Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of [[Miletus]], a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks. Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it. There is a masculine form, aswios. This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or "Roman Asia". This name, ''Assuwa'', has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent "Asia".&lt;ref&gt;Bossert, Helmut T., ''Asia'', Istanbul, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assuwa league]] was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the [[Hittites]] under [[Tudhaliya I]] around 1400 BCE.

Alternatively, the [[etymology]] of the term may be from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''(w)aṣû(m)'', which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word ''asa'' meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from Akkadian ''erēbu(m)'' 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).

[[T.R. Reid]] supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from ''asu'', meaning 'east' in [[Assyria]]n (''ereb'' for ''Europe'' meaning 'west').&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt; The ideas of ''Occidental'' (form [[Latin]] ''Occidens'' 'setting') and ''Oriental'' (from Latin ''Oriens'' for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with ''Western'' and ''Eastern''.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt; Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern civilizations]] on the [[Eurasia]]n continent.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt; Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt;

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Roman Empire - Asia (125 AD).svg|thumb|The province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] highlighted (in red) within the Roman Empire.]]
Latin Asia and Greek Ἀσία appear to be the same word. Roman authors translated Ἀσία as Asia. The Romans named a province [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], located in western Anatolia (in modern-day Turkey). There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day [[Iraq]]. As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act. The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as [[Herodotus]], who were all Greek. [[Ancient Greek]] certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa |title=Ἀσία |author=Henry George Liddell |author2=Robert Scott |author3=Henry Stuart Jones |author4=Roderick McKenzie |encyclopedia=A Greek-English Lexicon |year=2007 |location=Medford |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |origyear=1940 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427042823/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa |archivedate=27 April 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus (about 440 BCE), not because he innovated it, but because his ''Histories'' are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail. He defines it carefully,&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Articles 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read, but whose works are now missing. By it he means [[Anatolia]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], in contrast to [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]].

Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names were "given to a tract which is in reality one" ([[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]], and [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of [[Prometheus]] (i.e. [[Hesione]]), but that the [[Lydia]]ns say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at [[Sardis]].&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Article 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], "[[Asia (mythology)|Asia]]" (''Ἀσία'') or "Asie" (''Ἀσίη'') was the name of a "[[Nymph]] or [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] goddess of Lydia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheAsie.html |title=Asie |work=Encyclopedia: Greek Gods, Spirits, Monsters |publisher=Theoi Greek Mythology, Exploring Mythology in Classical Literature and Art |date=2000–2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604045105/http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheAsie.html |archivedate=4 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Greek religion, places were under the care of female divinities, parallel to guardian angels. The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became "Greek mythology". For example, [[Hesiod]] mentions the daughters of [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and [[Oceanus|Ocean]], among whom are a "holy company", "who with the Lord [[Apollo]] and the Rivers have youths in their keeping".&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'', Line 345 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these are geographic: Doris, Rhodea, Europa, Asia. Hesiod explains:&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'', Line 364ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For there are three-thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Iliad]] (attributed by the ancient Greeks to [[Homer]]) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the [[Luvians]] in Lydia) in the [[Trojan War]] named [[Asius (mythology)|Asios]] (an adjective meaning "Asian");&lt;ref&gt;Μ95, Π717.&lt;/ref&gt; and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as {{lang|grc|ασιος}}.&lt;ref&gt;Β461.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian [[steppe]]s.

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Yellow River]] shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the [[steppe]]s. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the [[Tocharians]] resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and [[tundra]]. These areas remained very sparsely populated.

The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the [[nomad]]s who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

The Islamic [[Caliphate]]'s defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during [[Early Muslim conquests|its conquests]] of the 7th century. The [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, [[Song dynasty]] reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Ping-ti Ho. "An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China", in ''Études Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970). pp. 33–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]], one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml |title=History – Black Death |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605000815/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml |archivedate=5 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing dynasty]]. The Islamic [[Mughal Empire]] and the Hindu [[Maratha Empire]] controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sen |first1=Sailendra Nath |title=An Advanced History of Modern India |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&amp;pg=PA1941-IA82&amp;lpg=PA1941-IA82 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011162115/https://books.google.com/books?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&amp;pg=PA1941-IA82&amp;lpg=PA1941-IA82 |archivedate=11 October 2017  |isbn=978-0230328853 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Himalayas.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.]]
Asia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the largest coastline, at {{convert|62800|km|mi|0}}. Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of [[Eurasia]]. It is located to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]]) and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Asia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online |year=2006 |location=Chicago |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118141016/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia |archivedate=18 November 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 48 countries, three of them (Russia, [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkey]]) having part of their land in Europe.

Asia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan. The [[Gobi Desert]] is in [[Mongolia]] and the [[Arabian Desert]] stretches across much of the Middle East. The [[Yangtze River]] in China is the longest river in the continent. The [[Himalayas]] between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.

===Climate change===

A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm [[Maplecroft]] identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of [[Bangladesh]], India, [[Vietnam]], Thailand, Pakistan and [[Sri Lanka]] were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change. Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a [[semi-arid climate]], the temperature increased by 0.4&amp;nbsp;°C between 1901 and 2003.
A 2013 study by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf ''Vulnerability to Climate Change: Adaptation Strategies and layers of Resilience''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226173957/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf |date=26 February 2014 }}, [[ICRISAT]], Policy Brief No. 23, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Several trade blocs exist, with the most developed being the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]].

Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, [[Taiwan]], South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of [[multinational corporation]]s, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.

East Asia had by far the strongest overall [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report's analysis of health, education and income data. China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since
1970, is the only country on the "Top 10 Movers" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.&lt;ref name="UNDP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/PR6-HDR10-RegRBAP-E-rev5-sm.pdf |title=2010 Human Development Report: Asian countries lead development progress over 40 years |publisher=UNDP |accessdate=22 December 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121161015/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/PR6-HDR10-RegRBAP-E-rev5-sm.pdf |archivedate=21 November 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;[[Nepal]], a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present [[life expectancy]] is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Japan and South Korea ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 11 and 12 in the world, which are in the "very high human development" category), followed by Hong Kong (21) and Singapore (27). [[Afghanistan]] (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Asia}}
Asia is home to several [[language family|language families]] and many [[language isolate]]s. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to [[Ethnologue]], more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

Many of the world's [[major religious groups|major religions]] have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding [[irreligion]]), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism respectively. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]] for example, as presented to Jews in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the narrative of [[Noah]]—and later to Christians in the [[Old Testament]], and to [[Islam|Muslims]] in the [[Quran]]—is earliest found in [[Mesopotamian mythology]], in the [[Enûma Eliš]] and ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. [[Hindu mythology]] similarly tells about an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in the form of a [[Matsya|fish]] who warned [[Sraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] of a terrible flood. Ancient [[Chinese mythology]] also tells of a [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]] spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control.

====Abrahamic====
The [[Abrahamic religions]] including Judaism, Christianity, Islam and [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in West Asia.

Judaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in [[Israel]], the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] homeland and historical birthplace of the [[Jews|Hebrew nation]]: which today consists both of those [[Jews|Israelites]] who remained in [[Mizrahi Jews|Asia/North Africa]] and those who returned from [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] in [[Ashkenazi Jews|Europe]], [[American Jews|North America]], and other regions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html |title=The Jewish Population of the World |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=1 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621102211/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html |archivedate=21 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; though various diaspora communities persist worldwide.

In the Middle East, such as in the [[Levant]], [[Syriac Christianity]] ([[Church of the East]]) and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] are prevalent minority denominations, which are both [[Eastern Christian]] sects mainly adhered to [[Assyrian people]] or Syriac Christians. [[Saint Thomas Christians]] in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of [[Thomas the Apostle]] in the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'', Volume 5 by Erwin Fahlbusch. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. 2008, p. 285. {{ISBN|978-0802824172}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam, which originated in the [[Hejaz]] located in modern-day Saudi Arabia, is the second largest and most widely-spread religion in Asia with at least 1 billion Muslims constituting around 23.8% of the total population of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-regional-asia/|title=Region: Asia-Pacific|date=27 January 2011|website=Pewforum.org|accessdate=9 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010061404/http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-regional-asia/|archivedate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia, followed by Pakistan (11.5%), India (10%), [[Bangladesh]], Iran and [[Turkey]].

The [[Hajj]] and [[Umrah]] attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina. Iran is the largest [[Shi'a]] country.

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Bahá'í activities in many Muslim countries has been severely [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|suppressed]] by authorities.

Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. [[Indian philosophy]] includes [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, [[Cārvāka]], preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] took shape.

{{as of|2012}}, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and [[Bali]], Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.

Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia.

[[File:Continental models-Australia.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Animated, colour-coded map showing the various continents and regions. [[Boundaries between the continents of Earth|Depending on the convention and model]], some continents may be consolidated or subdivided: for example, [[Eurasia]] is most often subdivided into [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] (red shades), while [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] are sometimes recognised as [[Americas|one American continent]] (green shades).]]

A '''continent''' is one of several very large [[Land#Land mass|landmasses]] of the [[world]]. Generally identified by [[convention (norm)|convention]] rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in area to smallest, they are: [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Antarctica]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/continents/|title=Continents: What is a Continent?|publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|archivedate=2009-06-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629180448/http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/continents/}} "Most people recognize seven continents—Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia, from largest to smallest—although sometimes Asia and Europe are considered a single continent, Eurasia."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geology|Geologically]], the continents largely correspond to areas of [[continental crust]] that are found on the [[plate tectonics|continental plates]]. However, some areas of continental crust are [[submerged continent|regions covered with water]] not usually included in the list of continents.  [[Zealandia]] is one such area (see [[#Submerged continents|submerged continents]] below).

Islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] regions. Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the [[Pacific Ocean]] are grouped together with the [[Australia (continent)|continent of Australia]] to form a geopolitical region called ''[[Oceania]]''.

== Definitions and application ==
[[File:Dymaxion map unfolded-no-ocean.png|thumb|right|A [[Dymaxion map]] shows land masses with minimal shape distortion.]]

By convention, "continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water."{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=21}}  Several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water. The criterion "large" leads to arbitrary classification: [[Greenland]], with a surface area of {{convert|2166086|sqkm}} is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at {{convert|7617930|sqkm}} is deemed the smallest continent.

[[Earth]]'s major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous [[World Ocean]], which is divided into a number of principal [[ocean]]ic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' (2006). New York: [[Columbia University Press]]. Retrieved 20 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html |date=31 May 2008 }}." ''[http://www.oceansatlas.com/ UN Atlas of the Oceans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915105349/http://www.oceansatlas.com/ |date=15 September 2008 }}'' (2004). Retrieved 20 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extent ===
The most restricted meaning of ''continent'' is that of a continuous&lt;ref&gt;"continent n. 5. a." (1989) ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition. [[Oxford University Press]] ; "continent&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; n." (2006) ''The [[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 11th edition revised. (Ed.) Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson. Oxford University Press; "continent&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; n." (2005) ''The [[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition. (Ed.) [[Erin McKean]]. Oxford University Press; "continent [2, n] 4 a" (1996) ''[[Webster's Dictionary#WebsThird New International|Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged]]''. [[ProQuest|ProQuest Information and Learning]] ; "continent" (2007) ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved 14 January 2007, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt; area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term ''[[continental Europe]]'' (sometimes referred to in Britain as "the Continent") is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding [[island]]s such as [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Malta]] and [[Iceland]], and the term ''continent of Australia'' may refer to the [[Australia (continent)|mainland of Australia]], excluding [[Tasmania]] and [[New Guinea]]. Similarly, the ''[[contiguous United States|continental United States]]'' refers to the 48 contiguous states and the [[District of Columbia]] in central North America and may include [[Alaska]] in the northwest of the continent (the two being separated by [[Canada]]), while excluding [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Guam]] in the oceans.

From the perspective of [[geology]] or [[physical geography]], ''continent'' may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the [[continental shelf]])&lt;ref&gt;"continent [2, n] 6" (1996) ''[[Webster's Dictionary#Webster's Third New International|Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged]]''. [[ProQuest|ProQuest Information and Learning]]. "a large segment of the earth's outer shell including a [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] continent and the adjacent continental shelf"&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[island]]s on the shelf ([[Island#Continental islands|continental islands]]), as they are structurally part of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monkhouse |first=F. J. |author2=John Small |title=A Dictionary of the Natural Environment |year=1978 |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |id= |pages= 67–68 |quote=structurally it includes shallowly submerged adjacent areas (continental shelf) and neighbouring islands }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this perspective, the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.&lt;ref name=Ollier&gt;[[Cliff Ollier|Ollier, Cliff D.]] (1996). Planet Earth. In Ian Douglas (Ed.), ''Companion Encyclopedia of Geography: The Environment and Humankind''. London: Routledge, p. 30. "Ocean waters extend onto continental [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] at continental shelves, and the true edges of the continents are the steeper continental slopes. The actual shorelines are rather accidental, depending on the height of sea-level on the sloping shelves."&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.

[[File:Island nations.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of [[island country|island countries]]: these states are often grouped geographically with a neighboring continental landmass.]]

As a [[social constructionism|cultural construct]], the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]] and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and [[Madagascar]] part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the [[Australian Plate|Australian continental plate]] with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called [[Oceania]]. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997 |page=40 |ps=: "The joining of Australia with various Pacific islands to form the quasi continent of Oceania ... "}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Separation ===
{{Main|Boundaries between the continents of Earth}}
{{See also|List of transcontinental countries}}

The ideal criterion that each continent is a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by the ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as "''more or less'' discrete masses of land".{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=35}} Asia and Africa are joined by the [[Isthmus of Suez]], and North and South America by the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Panama Canal]], which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these [[isthmus]]es are very narrow compared to the bulk of the landmasses they unite.

North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the [[Americas]]. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997 |loc=Chapter 1 |ps=: "While it might seem surprising to find North and South America still joined into a single continent in a book published in the United States in 1937, such a notion remained fairly common until World War II. [...] By the 1950s, however, virtually all American geographers had come to insist that the visually distinct landmasses of North and South America deserved separate designations."}}&lt;/ref&gt; This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.

The criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of {{convert|10180000|sqkm}}, while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view—in geology and geography—that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of [[Eurocentrism]]: "In physical, cultural and historical diversity, [[China]] and [[India]] are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...]."{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=? }} However, for historical and cultural reasons,{{which|date=May 2017}} the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

If continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as [[Afro-Eurasia]]. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.

When sea levels were lower during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]s, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming [[land bridge]]s. At those times [[Australia (continent)|Australia–New Guinea]] was a single, continuous continent. Likewise, the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]]. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.

== Other divisions ==

=== Supercontinents ===
Aside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term ''continent'' varies. [[Supercontinent]]s, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one [[craton]] or continental core. These have included [[Laurasia]], [[Gondwana]], [[Vaalbara]], [[Kenorland]], [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]], [[Rodinia]], and [[Pangaea]].

=== Subcontinents ===
Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{citation |last=Baldwin |first=James A. |chapter=Continents |editor=R. W. McColl |title=Encyclopedia of World Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJgnebGbAB8C&amp;pg=PA215 |date=14 May 2014 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-7229-3 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Cone]] of South America and [[Alaska|Alaskan peninsula]] of North America are other examples.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"/&gt;

In many of these cases, the "subcontinents" concerned are on different [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology.&lt;ref name="Molnar2015"&gt;{{citation|last=Molnar|first=Peter|title=Plate Tectonics: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbuUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116|date=26 March 2015|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-104396-3}}

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greenland]], generally reckoned as the [[List of islands by area|world's largest island]] on the northeastern periphery of the [[North American Plate]], is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nares Strait and the drift of Greenland: a conflict in plate tectonics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9prkteX0EdsC&amp;pg=PA32|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn=978-87-635-1150-6|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FarmerCook2013"&gt;{{citation|last1=Farmer|first1=G.

=== Submerged continents ===
Some areas of [[continental crust]] are largely covered by the sea and may be considered [[submerged continent]]s. Notable examples are [[Zealandia]], emerging from the sea primarily in [[New Zealand]] and [[New Caledonia]], and the almost completely submerged [[Kerguelen Plateau]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]].

=== Microcontinents ===
Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered [[continental fragment|microcontinents]]. [[Madagascar]], the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as "the eighth continent" from a {{clarify|text=biological perspective|date=March 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hillstrom | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Collier Hillstrom | first2 =Laurie | title = Africa and the Middle East: a continental overview of environmental issues | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, CA | year = 2003 | page = 50 | isbn = 978-1-57607-688-0 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XxIk9zTm_e8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Botanical continents ===
[[File:WGSRPD World.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|"Botanical continents" defined by the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]].]]

"Continents" may be defined differently for specific purposes. The [[Biodiversity Information Standards]] organization has developed the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]], used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine "botanical continents". Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America (Mexico northwards) and Southern America (Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brummitt |first=R.K. |year=2001 |title=World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions: Edition 2 |publisher=International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases For Plant Sciences (TDWG) |url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/tdwg/TDWG_geo2.pdf |accessdate = 2006-11-27 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Strabo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|The Ancient Greek geographer [[Strabo]] holding a globe showing ''Europa'' and ''Asia'']]

=== Early concepts of the Old World continents ===
The term "continent" translates Greek {{lang|grc|ἤπειρος}}, properly   "landmass, terra firma", the proper name of [[Epirus]] and later especially used of Asia (i.e. [[Asia Minor]]),&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, Henry Stuart Jones, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (1940), s.v. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=h)/peiros ἤπειρος]. The English noun was introduced in the mid-16th century, shortened from ''continent land'' (15th century), adapted from Latin ''terra continens'' "continuous landmass".&lt;/ref&gt;
The first distinction between continents was made by [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Dardanelles]] strait, the [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Bosporus]] strait and the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name=Toynbee&gt;[[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee, Arnold J.]] (1954). ''A Study of History''. London: Oxford University Press, v. 8, pp. 711–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tozer |first=H. F. |title=A History of Ancient Geography |year=1897 |publisher=University Press |location=Cambridge |page= 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and "...&amp;nbsp;beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ..."&lt;ref name=Toynbee/&gt;

Ancient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called ''Libya'') should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world.

"I cannot conceive why three names ... should ever have been given to a tract which is in reality one,"&lt;/ref&gt; a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.

[[Eratosthenes]], in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile and the Don), thus considering them "islands". Others divided the continents by [[isthmus]]es, calling the continents "peninsulas". These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the [[Caspian Sea]], and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the [[Red Sea]] and the mouth of [[Lake Bardawil]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]].

Through the Roman period and the [[Middle Ages]], a few writers took the [[Isthmus of Suez]] as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt (Gibbon){{citation needed|date=October 2014}}. In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on [[T and O map]]s, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, "the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus [the boundary between Egypt and [[Libya]]] farther west, had even then scarcely passed away".&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Farley Brewer (1884).

=== European arrival in the Americas ===
[[Christopher Columbus]] sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] in 1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the [[Americas]]. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continent—he always thought it was part of Asia.

In 1501, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Gonçalo Coelho]] attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the [[Indian Ocean]], passing through [[Fernando de Noronha]]. After reaching the coast of [[Brazil]], they sailed a long way further south along the coast of [[South America]], confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to.&lt;ref name=OGorman&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Gorman | first = Edmundo | authorlink = Edmundo O'Gorman | title = The Invention of America | publisher = Indiana University Press | year= 1961 | pages = 106–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called ''Mundus Novus'' ("New World"), was published under Vespucci's name in 1502 or 1503,&lt;ref name=formisano1&gt;Formisano, Luciano (Ed.) (1992). ''Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America''.

''Terra Cognita: The Mental Discovery of America''. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, pp. 77–79. {{ISBN|0-7658-0987-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of who penned the words, ''Mundus Novus'' credited Vespucci with saying, "I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa",&lt;ref name=formisano2&gt;Formisano, Luciano (Ed.) (1992). ''Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America''. New York: Marsilio, p. 45. {{ISBN|0-941419-62-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.

Within a few years, the name "New World" began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504–1505. Maps of this time though, still showed [[North America]] connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.&lt;ref name=Zerubavel1/&gt;

[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.7|''Universalis Cosmographia'', Waldseemüller's 1507 world map—the first to show the Americas separate from Asia]]

In 1507 [[Martin Waldseemüller]] published a world map, ''[[Waldseemüller map|Universalis Cosmographia]]'', which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'', Waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named "America" after Amerigo Vespucci's first name.&lt;ref name=Zerubavel2&gt;Zerubavel, Eviatar (2003). ''Terra Cognita: The Mental Discovery of America''. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, pp. 80–82. {{ISBN|0-7658-0987-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the map, the word "America" was placed on part of South America.

=== The word ''continent'' ===
From the 16th century the English noun ''continent'' was derived from the term ''continent land'', meaning continuous or connected land&lt;ref name=oed&gt;"continent n." (1989) ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; and translated from the Latin ''terra continens''.&lt;ref&gt;"continent&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; n." (2006) ''The [[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 11th edition revised. (Ed.) Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The noun was used to mean "a connected or continuous tract of land" or [[mainland]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It was not applied only to very large areas of land—in the 17th century, references were made to the ''continents'' (or mainlands) of [[Isle of Man]], [[Ireland]] and [[Wales]] and in 1745 to [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; The word ''continent'' was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three "parts" of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as ''continent'' was used.{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=29}}

While ''continent'' was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, [[Peter Heylin]] wrote in his ''Cosmographie'' that "A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa." In 1727, [[Ephraim Chambers]] wrote in his ''Cyclopædia,'' "The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the [[Old World|old]] and the [[New World|new]]." And in his 1752 atlas, [[Emanuel Bowen]] defined a continent as "a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another."&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, Emanuel. (1752). ''A Complete Atlas, or Distinct View of the Known World''. London, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as "parts" of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.

=== Beyond four continents ===
From the late 18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th century.&lt;ref name=lewis30&gt;{{harvp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeans discovered [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] in 1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent).&lt;ref name=lewis30/&gt; In 1813, [[Samuel Butler (schoolmaster)|Samuel Butler]] wrote of Australia as "[[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent" and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was just as equivocal some decades later.&lt;ref&gt;"continent n. 5. a." (1989) ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition. [[Oxford University Press]]. "the great island of Australia is sometimes reckoned as another [continent]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antarctica]] was sighted in 1820 during the [[First Russian Antarctic Expedition]] and described as a continent by [[Charles Wilkes]] on the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] in 1838, the last continent identified, although a great "Antarctic" (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |author2=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-20743-2 |chapter= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.&lt;ref name=lewis32&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |author2=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |id={{ISBN|0-520-20742-4}}, {{ISBN|0-520-20743-2}} |page=32 |chapter= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents.&lt;ref name=lewis32/&gt; With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to [[Latin America]]ns, who saw their region spanning an {{lang|es|América}} as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains dominant, as it does in scattered other countries.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed ''[[Eurasia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Some geographers list only six continents, combining Europe and Asia into Eurasia. In parts of the world, students learn that there are just five continents: Eurasia, Australia, Africa, Antarctica, and the Americas.''{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/faq/geography.html#continents|title=How many continents are there?|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.

== Geology ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
{{further|Continental crust|Plate tectonics}}
Geologists use the term ''continent'' in a different manner from geographers. In geology a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous rock]], largely of [[granite|granitic]] composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable [[Precambrian]] "shield", typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a [[craton]]. The craton itself is an [[accretion (geology)|accretionary]] complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of [[subduction]], [[continental collision]] and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger minimally deformed [[sedimentary rock]] covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or [[river delta|deltaic]] [[sediment]]s. Beyond the margin, there is either a [[continental shelf]] and drop off to the [[basalt]]ic [[oceanic basin|ocean basin]] or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are "high and dry"; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Ocean Sciences|last = Kominz|first = Michelle A.|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2001|isbn = |location = San Diego|pages = 2609|chapter = Sea level variations over geologic time|url = http://www.curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter10/Ency_Oceans/Sea_Level_Variations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans]]

Some argue that continents are accretionary crustal "rafts" that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. [[East European craton]] and [[Indian craton]]). Younger mobile belts (such as the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Himalayas]]) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.

There are many [[Continental fragment|microcontinents, or continental fragments]], that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of [[Gondwana]] or other ancient cratonic continents: [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], which includes [[Geography of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]]; [[Geography of Madagascar|Madagascar]]; the northern [[Mascarene Plateau]], which includes the [[Seychelles]]. Other islands, such as several in the [[Caribbean Sea]], are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The [[Kerguelen Plateau]], for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/99newsreleases/nr_199905/nr_continent990528.html |title=UT Austin scientist plays major rule in study of underwater "micro-continent" |publisher=Utexas.edu |accessdate=2012-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103165732/http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/99newsreleases/nr_199905/nr_continent990528.html |archivedate= 3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/353277.stm |title=Sci/Tech &amp;#124; 'Lost continent' discovered |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-05-27 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas volcanic [[Geography of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]] are not. The [[British Isles]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Borneo]], and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] are margins of the [[Laurasia]]n continent—only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.

[[Plate tectonics]] offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified [[Eurasian Plate]], which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent [[Himalaya]] mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting [[isthmus]] being largely the result of [[volcano|volcanism]] from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the [[Canadian Shield]]), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian landmass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions ("continental rocks," "plate boundaries") are used as appropriate.

The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0–1.8 billion years ago and broke up about 1.5–1.3 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Zhao1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Guochun |last2=Cawood |first2=Peter A. |last3=Wilde |first3=Simon A. |last4=Sun |first4=M. |date=November 2002 |title=Review of global 2.1–1.8 Ga orogens: implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=59 |pages=125–162 |doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00073-9 |bibcode=2002ESRv...59..125Z |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825202000739 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao2"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |author2=Sun, M. |author3=Wilde, Simon A. |author4= Li, S.Z.  |date=November 2004 |title=A Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent: assembly, growth and breakup |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=67 |pages=91–123 |accessdate=2013-01-08 |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.02.003 |bibcode=2004ESRv...67...91Z|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825204000182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supercontinent [[Rodinia]] is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago.

'''Cristina Possas de Albuquerque''' (born 5 June 1948) is a [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] and [[emerging infectious disease]]s from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, N., "Epidemiology and the web of causation: has anyone seen the spider?" Social Science and Medicine 1994; 39:887–903&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KriegerNancy"&gt;Krieger, Nancy (2011). Epidemiology and the People's Health : Theory and Context. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199750351}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, her approach to social ecosystem complexity is quite different from the four-fold eco-social approach of Harvard's Nancy Krieger in that she has proposed in a 2001 English-language article in the ''Brazilian Journal of Public Health Reports'' the concept of "social ecosystem health" where ecosystems are increasingly changed by social human activity, favoring the emergence of diseases, so the term "social" should precede the prefix "eco".&lt;ref&gt;Possas, C. 2001. Social ecosystem health: confronting the complexity and emergence of infectious diseases. Cadernos de Saúde Pública (Brazilian Journal pf Public Health Reports) 17.1: 30-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Possas, C. 2001 Debate on the paper by David Waltner-Toews.

&lt;ref&gt;Levins, R. and Lopez C. "Toward an ecosocial view of health", ''International Journal of Health Services'' 29(2):261-293, 1999.  Her mentor and former colleague, Dr. [[Richard Levins]], had used the phrase "ecosocial view of health."&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, she is known for (a) developing her new conceptual approach to [[social epidemiology]], incorporating the economic concept of structural heterogeneity into an epidemiological model to identify the epidemiological profiles of heterogeneous populations in different social and economic strata and the conditions for emergence of diseases; (b) contributions of health policy and health reform in Brazil; and research on health transition, ecological change, complex systems, and emergence of new diseases.

She is a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University in Boston,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/fellowships/takemi-fellowship-program/ Takemi Program], [[Harvard T.H.

As a Brazilian Brazilian [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cristina Possas de Albuquerque (Cristina Possas) has as a policymaker long worked closely with public health and environmental scientists and with human rights and social justice civil organizations.

She also is a full professor at [[FIOCRUZ]] in Brazil, where in 1998 she had earned a PhD in [[public health]], and where she now does research on infectious diseases and teaches a course named "Scientific Methodology" in the Masters and Doctoral Programs.

She has been also a Professor of Health Policy at the National School of Public Health at the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]], Brazil.  She was nominated in 1987 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health/Fiocruz to be the National Technical Coordinator of seven Groups supporting the Health Reform in Brazil, whose contributions were later incorporated into the new Brazilian 1988 Constitution.

For a decade, she also has been a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University, a Visiting Scientist and [[Fulbright Fellowship|Fulbright Fellow]], and a member of the Harvard New Diseases Group, coordinated by the late [[Richard Levins]] and by [[Tamara Awerbuch-Friedlander]], collaborating with them and other outstanding members of the group in the organizing committee of the Woods Hole Conference on New Diseases, with articles with the group later published in a special supplement of the ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' on this conference and in other journals. She had held for 10 years a national position as the Head of the Research and Development Unit of the Brazilian National AIDS Program.

She has worked for more than five decades in several national and international positions with the scientific community and civil society organizations.  For ten years, she had been National Director of the Research and Technological Development Unit at the Brazilian [[AIDS]] Program in the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which has been recognized globally as an outstanding public health initiative with innovative approaches to the pandemics, always centering on free and universal access to prevention and treatment.  She was invited by the Director of the National AIDS Program to conceive and create a new and innovative Research and Technological Development Unit in the Program’s structure.

She has given interviews on [[AIDS]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqG-W1Xyoac Entrevista, Dr. Cristina Possas discusses AIDS, Dec 16, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[dengue fever|dengue]], and [[zika fever|zika]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''David Vanderpool''' (born February 18, 1960) is an American medical missionary and the CEO and founder of Live Beyond, which has provided medical, spiritual and logistical support to disaster ridden countries.

Vanderpool's work is unusual in that he combines his medical training with an explicit effort to convert his patients to Christianity.

==Early life and education==
Vanderpool was born in [[Dallas, Texas]], graduated from [[St. Mark's School of Texas]], and received his undergraduate degree from [[Abilene Christian University]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[https://smtexas.myschoolapp.com/ftpimages/73/download/The_Pride_2011_Winter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended the [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] at [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]]. After medical school, Vanderpool completed two surgical residencies at [[Baylor University Medical Center]] where he trained as a vascular surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmdr.org/Staff.html |title=Staff |publisher=Mmdr.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126081445/http://www.mmdr.org/staff.html |archivedate=2014-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Vanderpool wife, Laurie, is a speaker for Women's Retreats and [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible Studies]], and speaks frequently for Down Syndrome organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Staff.html |title=Staff |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203173807/http://www.livebeyond.org/Staff.html |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Vanderpool remained in Texas after residency and practiced as a vascular surgeon before moving to Brentwood, Tennessee in 2001 and opening his private practice Lave MD in 2003.

Dr. Vanderpool created Lave MD to act as both a medical facility and a spa. 
After the establishment of his international organization in 2005, Dr. Vanderpool used much of Lave MD's proceeds to fund the organization's efforts abroad.

==Medical missionary work==
In 2005, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit the southeastern part of the United States, Dr. Vanderpool delivered healthcare across the Mississippi Coast out of a trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler |first=Joanne |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20358101,00.html |title=Hope Out of the Rubble |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal was to provide as much free healthcare as possible while the medical infrastructure could recover. Months later, Dr. Vanderpool established his organization, Medical Mobile Disaster Relief, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with goals to provide disaster relief through medical clinics, clean water projects, and micro-finance projects to areas hit by disasters. 
Vanderpool and the Mobile Medical Disaster Relief team began working in Mozambique in 2006. His goal was to provide healthcare to the indigenous people of the country in addition to enhancing the economy by implementing micro-finance projects among widows living in the communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Mozambique.html |title=Mozambique |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085936/http://www.livebeyond.org/Mozambique.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, Dr. Vanderpool teamed up with the [[Belmont University|Belmont School of Nursing]] to construct a nursing curriculum that could teach the Mozambique women to be self-sufficient in caring for themselves and their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nashville.medicalnewsinc.com/physician-spotlight-david-vanderpool-md-cms-1943 |title=Physician Spotlight: David Vanderpool, MD on Nashville Medical News |publisher=Nashville.medicalnewsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanderpool and his Mobile Medical Disaster Relief partnered with PACODEP (Partners in Community Development) in Ghana in order to provide medical care, educate the locals on water purification and distribute water purifiers. PACODEP works to free enslaved children who are trafficked through Ghana for purposes of fishing work. Dr. Vanderpool has also partnered with local hospitals in Ghana in order to provide free invasive surgeries to these rescued children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Ghana.html |title=Ghana |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110090632/http://www.livebeyond.org/Ghana.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Vanderpool partnered with Mission Lazarus in 2009 to build a sustainable medical clinic in [[Cedeño, Honduras]]. Given sufficient medical supplies and equipment, Vanderpool allowed Mission Lazarus to take over the clinic and provision of healthcare for the people of Cedeño.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Honduras.html |title=Honduras |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085736/http://www.livebeyond.org/Honduras.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live Beyond in Haiti===
Dr. Vanderpool shifted his focus in the aftermath of the [[Haiti earthquake 2010|earthquake]] that devastated the entire country of Haiti in 2010. In 2010, Vanderpool officially changed the name of his organization from Mobile Medical Disaster Relief to Live Beyond with a stated mission to be "an organization that chooses to Live Beyond...ourselves, our culture, our borders and this life so that others can Live Beyond…disease, hunger, poverty and despair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti.html |title=Haiti |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085813/http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial aid Vanderpool and his team brought to Haiti was primarily mobile medical care to relieve the thousands devastated and injured by the earthquake. Since then however, Vanderpool has grounded his missionary work in Thomazeau, Haiti where his organization began building a base. Vanderpool continued to provide free medical care, establishing a surgical hospital and clinic. In addition, clean water projects, orphanages, and other widow and orphan advocacy projects were begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti-Base.html |title=Haiti Base |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110090459/http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti-Base.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Dr. Vanderpool is a Christian, who combines religion and the spread of his faith with his medical work. In Haiti, he has made it one of his objectives to bring Haiti away from its traditional voodoo culture and provide "spiritual guidance" to the Haitians in the role of Christianity, with the belief that Christianity will lead to a better Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acuoptimist.com/2010/11/alumni-join-fight-against-cholera-in-haiti/ |title=Alumni join fight against Haiti cholera outbreak &amp;#124; The Optimist |publisher=Acuoptimist.com |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085616/http://www.acuoptimist.com/2010/11/alumni-join-fight-against-cholera-in-haiti/ |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to moving to Haiti, each medical outreach trip made by Vanderpool and other Live Beyond participants included prayer and Christian ministry along with healthcare to the voodoo priests, island chiefs, idol worshipers and the sick and dying in Haiti. On the Live Beyond site, Vanderpool's religious impact since being in Haiti has been characterized as leading to the baptism of dozens, the saving of tribes through "Bibles being read in their own languages" and "the Kingdom is being expanded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Our-Mission.html |title=Our-Mission |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085458/http://www.livebeyond.org/Our-Mission.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Dr. Vanderpool promotes religious missionary work in tandem with his medical relief and sustainable development efforts.

'''Digital Radio Mondiale''' ('''DRM'''; ''mondiale'' being [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] for "worldwide") is a set of [[digital radio|digital audio broadcasting]] technologies designed to work over the bands currently used for analogue radio broadcasting including [[AM broadcasting]], particularly [[shortwave]], and [[FM broadcasting]]. DRM is more spectrally efficient than AM and FM, allowing more stations, at higher quality, into a given amount of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], using various [[MPEG-4]] [[audio coding format]]s.

Digital Radio Mondiale is also the name of the international [[non-profit]] [[consortium]] that has designed the platform and is now promoting its introduction. [[Radio France Internationale]], [[TéléDiffusion de France]], [[BBC World Service]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Voice of America]], [[Telefunken]] (now [[Transradio]]) and Thomcast (now [[Ampegon]]) took part at the formation of the DRM consortium.

The principle of DRM is that bandwidth is the limited element, and computer processing power is cheap; modern [[Central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive audio compression techniques enable more efficient use of available bandwidth, at the expense of processing resources.

==Features==

DRM can deliver up to [[frequency modulation|FM]]-comparable sound quality{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} on frequencies below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[long wave]], [[medium wave]] and [[short wave]]), which allow for very-long-distance signal propagation. The modes for these lower frequencies are often collectively known under the term "DRM30". In the VHF bands, the term "DRM+" is used. DRM+ is able to use available broadcast spectra between 30 and 300&amp;nbsp;MHz; generally this means band I (47 to 68&amp;nbsp;MHz), band II (87.5 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz) and band III (174 to 230&amp;nbsp;MHz). DRM has been designed to be able to re-use portions of existing analogue [[transmitter]] facilities such as antennas, feeders, and, especially for DRM30, the transmitters themselves, avoiding major new investment. DRM is robust against the fading and interference which often plague conventional broadcasting in these frequency ranges.

The encoding and decoding can be performed with [[digital signal processing]], so that a cheap [[embedded system|embedded]] computer with a conventional transmitter and receiver can perform the rather complex encoding and decoding.

As a digital medium, DRM can transmit other data besides the audio channels ([[datacasting]]) &amp;mdash; as well as [[RBDS|RDS]]-type [[metadata]] or [[program-associated data]] as [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) does. DRM services can be operated in many different network configurations, from a traditional AM one-service one-transmitter model to a multi-service (up to four) multi-transmitter model, either as a [[single-frequency network]] (SFN) or [[multi-frequency network]] (MFN). Hybrid operation, where the same transmitter delivers both analogue and DRM services simultaneously is also possible.

DRM incorporates technology known as Emergency Warning Features that can override other programming and activates radios which are in standby in order to receive emergency broadcasts.

==Status==
The technical standard is available free-of-charge from the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/201900_201999/201980/04.01.01_60/es_201980v040101p.pdf|title=DRM System specification|author=|date=|website=etsi.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] has approved its use in most of the world. Approval for [[ITU region|ITU region 2]] is pending amendments to existing international agreements. The inaugural broadcast took place on June 16, 2003, in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], at the ITU's [[World Radio Conference]].

Current broadcasters include [[All India Radio]], [[BBC World Service]], [[BitExpress]], [[Radio Exterior de España]], [[Radio New Zealand International]], [[Vatican Radio]], [[Radio Romania International]] and Radio Kuweit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm.org/?page_id=151|title=Digital Radio Mondiale -   Broadcast Schedule|author=|date=|website=www.drm.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until now DRM receivers have typically used a [[personal computer]]. A few manufacturers have introduced DRM receivers which have thus far remained niche products due to limited choice of broadcasts. It is expected that the transition of national broadcasters to digital services on DRM, notably All India Radio, will stimulate the production of a new generation of affordable, and efficient receivers.

[[Chengdu NewStar Electronics]] is offering the DR111 from May 2012 on which meets the minimum requirements for DRM receivers specified by the DRM consortium and is sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DR111 DRM Radio |publisher=Chengdu NewStar Electronics &amp;#124; 成都纽斯达电子公司: |year=2014 |url=http://www.cdnse.com/products/dr111 |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Overseas Service of [[All India Radio]] broadcasts daily in DRM to Western Europe on 9.95&amp;nbsp;MHz at 17:45 to 22:30 UTC.&lt;ref&gt;http://allindiaradio.gov.in/Services/Digital%20Transmission/Pages/simple.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  [[All India Radio]] is in the process of replacing and refurbishing many of its domestic AM transmitters with DRM. The project which began in 2012 is scheduled to complete during 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm.org/?page_id=2494|title=Digital Radio Mondiale -   DRM India Page|author=|date=|website=www.drm.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Broadcasting Corporation [[BBC]] has trialed the technology in the [[United Kingdom]] by broadcasting [[BBC Radio Devon]] in the Plymouth area in the MF band. The [http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/digitalmediumwave/faqs_feature.shtml trial] lasted for a year (April 2007 – April 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2009/05/11/digital_medium_wave_report_feature.shtml|title=Digital medium wave trial report|first=|last=BBC|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[BBC]] also trialed DRM+ in the FM band in 2010 from the [[Craigkelly transmitting station]] in [[Fife]], Scotland, over an area which included the city of [[Edinburgh]]. In this trial, a previously used 10&amp;nbsp;kW (ERP) FM transmitter was replaced with a 1&amp;nbsp;kW DRM+ transmitter in two different modes and the coverage compared with FM &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP199.pdf|title=BBC Research White Paper WHP199|author=|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Digital Radio Mondiale was included in the 2007 [[Ofcom]] consultation on the future of radio in the [[United Kingdom]] for the AM medium wave band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/futureradio/ The Future of Radio (Ofcom, 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043938/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/futureradio/ |date=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTÉ has also run single and multiple programme overnight tests during a similar period on the 252&amp;nbsp;kHz LW transmitter in Trim, Co.Meath, Ireland which was upgraded to support DRM after [[Atlantic 252]] closed.

The Fraunhofer Institute for integrated circuits IIS offers a package for software defined radios which can be licensed to radio manufacturers. [http://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en/pr/2016/20160310_KS_Software_DRM.html]

===International regulation===
On 28 September 2006, the [[Australia]]n spectrum regulator, the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]], announced that it had "placed an embargo on frequency bands potentially suitable for use by broadcasting services using Digital Radio Mondiale until spectrum planning can be completed" "those bands being "5,950–6,200; 7,100–7,300; 9,500–9,900; 11,650–12,050; 13,600–13,800; 15,100–15,600; 17,550–17,900; 21,450–21,850 and 25,670–26,100&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]]: [http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/radcomm/frequency_planning/spectrum_embargoes/embargo44.pdf Embargo on new frequency assignments to support domestic broadcasting services using DRM tecxhnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] [[Federal Communications Commission]] states in {{CodeFedReg|47|73|758}} that:  "For digitally modulated emissions, the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) standard shall be employed."  Part 73, section 758 is for [[high frequency|HF]] broadcasting only.

==Technological Overview==

===Audio source coding===
Useful bitrates for DRM30 range from 6.1 kbit/s (Mode D) to 34.8 kbit/s (Mode A) for a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth (±5&amp;nbsp;kHz around the central frequency). It is possible to achieve bit rates up to 72 kbit/s (Mode A) by using a standard 20&amp;nbsp;kHz (±10&amp;nbsp;kHz) wide channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.drm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DRM-guide-artwork-9-2013-1.pdf
|format=PDF; 6.7&amp;nbsp;MB
|title=DRM Introduction and Implementation Guide
|page=22
|publisher=DRM
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, pure digital [[HD Radio]] can broadcast 20 kbit/s using channels 10&amp;nbsp;kHz wide and up to 60 kbit/s using 20&amp;nbsp;kHz channels.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiquity.com/i/pdfs/Waveforms_AM.pdf |title=The Structure and Generation of Robust Waveforms for AM In-Band On-Channel Digital Broadcasting |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206042040/http://www.ibiquity.com/i/pdfs/Waveforms_AM.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Useful bitrate depends also on other parameters, such as:
* desired robustness to errors ([[Forward error correction|error coding]])
* power needed ([[modulation]] scheme)
* robustness in regard to propagation conditions ([[multipath propagation]], [[doppler effect]]), etc.

When DRM was originally designed, it was clear that the most robust modes offered insufficient capacity for the then state-of-the-art audio coding format [[MPEG-4]] [[HE-AAC]] (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). Therefore, the standard launched with a choice of three different audio coding systems (source coding) depending on the bitrate:
*[[MPEG-4]]  [[HE-AAC]] (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). AAC is a perceptual coder suited for voice and music and the High Efficiency is an optional extension for reconstruction of high frequencies (SBR: spectral bandwidth replication) and stereo image (PS: Parametric Stereo). 24&amp;nbsp;kHz or 12&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling frequencies can be used for core AAC (no SBR) which correspond respectively to 48&amp;nbsp;kHz and 24&amp;nbsp;kHz when using SBR oversampling.
*[[MPEG-4]] [[CELP]] which is a parametric coder suited for voice only (vocoder) but that is robust to errors and needs a small bit rate.
*[[MPEG-4]] [[HVXC]] which is also a parametric coder for speech programs that uses an even smaller bitrate than CELP.

However, with the development of [[MPEG-4]] [[xHE-AAC]], which is an implementation of MPEG [[Unified Speech and Audio Coding]], the DRM standard was updated and the two speech-only coding formats, CELP and HVXC, were replaced. USAC is designed to combine the properties of a speech and a general audio coding according to bandwidth constraints and so is able to handle all kinds of programme material. Given that there were few CELP and HVXC broadcasts on-air, the decision to drop the speech-only coding formats has passed without issue.

Many broadcasters still use the [[HE-AAC]] coding format because it still offers an acceptable audio quality, somewhat comparable to [[FM broadcasting|FM broadcast]] at bitrates above about 15 kbit/s. However, it is anticipated that in future, most broadcasters will adopt [[xHE-AAC]].

Additionally, as of v2.1, the popular Dream software can broadcast using the [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] coding format. Whilst not within the current DRM standard the inclusion of this codec is provided for experimentation. Aside from perceived technical advantages over the MPEG family such as low latency (delay between coding and decoding), this codec provides an open source (therefore free to use) alternative to the proprietary MPEG family whose use is permitted at the discretion of the patent holders, unfortunately it has a substantially lower audio quality than xHE-AAC on low bitrates, which are a key to conserve bandwidth. In fact, at 8Kbps Opus actually sounds worse than analog shortwave radio. A video showing the comparison between Opus and xHE-AAC is available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEUwScTX-R4 here]. Equipment manufacturers currently pay royalties for incorporating the MPEG codecs.

===Bandwidth===
DRM broadcasting can be done using a choice of different bandwidths:

*4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a [[simulcast]] and use the lower-sideband area of a 9&amp;nbsp;kHz raster channel for [[amplitude modulation|AM]], with a 4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102500_102599/102509/01.01.01_60/ts_102509v010101p.pdf |title=See section 5: "DRM/AM single channel simulcast"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is not good.
*5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a [[simulcast]] and use the lower-sideband area of a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz raster channel for AM, with a 5&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband. However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is marginal (7.1–16.7&amp;nbsp;kbit/s for 5&amp;nbsp;kHz). This technique could be used on the [[short wave]] bands throughout the world. 
*9&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region&amp;nbsp;1 long wave or medium wave broadcast channel.
*10&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region&amp;nbsp;2 broadcast channel. could be used to simulcast with analogue audio channel restricted to NRSC5. Occupies a full worldwide short wave broadcast channel (giving 14.8–34.8 kbit/s)
*18&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region&amp;nbsp;1 long wave or medium wave channels according to the existing frequency plan. This offers better audio quality.
*20&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region&amp;nbsp;2 or region 3 AM channel according to the existing frequency plan. This offers highest audio quality of the DRM30 standard (giving 30.6–72&amp;nbsp;kbit/s).
* 100&amp;nbsp;kHz for DRM+. This bandwidth can be used in band I, II, and III and DRM+ can transmit four different programs in this bandwidth or even one low definition digital video channel.

===Modulation===
The modulation used for DRM is coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ([[COFDM]]), where every carrier is modulated with quadrature amplitude modulation ([[QAM]]) with a selectable error coding.

The choice of transmission parameters depends on signal robustness wanted and propagation conditions. Transmission signal is affected by noise, interference, multipath wave propagation and [[Doppler effect]].

It is possible to choose among several error coding schemes and several modulation patterns: 64-QAM, 16-QAM and 4-QAM. OFDM modulation has some parameters that must be adjusted depending on propagation conditions. This is the carrier spacing which will determine the robustness against Doppler effect (which cause frequencies offsets, spread: Doppler spread) and OFDM guard interval which determine robustness against multipath propagation (which cause delay offsets, spread: delay spread). The DRM consortium has determined four different profiles corresponding to typical propagation conditions:
*A: Gaussian channel with very little multipath propagation and Doppler effect. This profile is suited for local or regional broadcasting.
*B: multipath propagation channel. This mode is suited for medium range transmission. It is nowadays frequently used.
*C: similar to mode B, but with better robustness to Doppler (more carrier spacing). This mode is suited for long distance transmission.
*D: similar to mode B, but with a resistance to large delay spread and Doppler spread. This case exists with adverse propagation conditions on very long distance transmissions. The useful bit rate for this profile is decreased.

The trade-off between these profiles stands between robustness, resistance in regards to propagation conditions and useful bit rates for the service. This table presents some values depending on these profiles. The larger the carrier spacing, the more the system is resistant to Doppler effect (Doppler spread). The larger the guard interval, the greater the resistance to long multipath propagation errors (delay spread).

The resulting low-[[bit rate]] digital information is [[modulation|modulated]] using [[COFDM]]. It can run in [[simulcast]] mode by switching between DRM and AM, and it is also prepared for linking to other alternatives (e.g., [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] or FM services).

DRM has been tested successfully on [[shortwave]], [[mediumwave]] (with 9 as well as 10 [[kHz]] [[channel spacing]]) and [[longwave]].

There is also a lower bandwidth two-way communication version of DRM as a replacement for SSB communications on HF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://n1su.com/windrm/|title=WinDRM] - software for Audio and Fast Data over HF SSB |author=|date=|website=n1su.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - note that it is ''not'' compatible with the official DRM specification. It may be possible in some future time for the 4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth DRM version used by the Amateur Radio community to be merged with the existing DRM specification.

The Dream software will receive the commercial versions and also limited transmission mode using the FAAC AAC encoder.

===Error coding===
Error coding can be chosen to be more or less robust.

The lower the protection class the higher the level of error correction.

==DRM+ ==
While the initial DRM standard covered the broadcasting bands below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz, the DRM consortium voted in March 2005 to begin the process of extending the system to the VHF bands up to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151234/http://www.drm.org/uploads/files/drm_plus_pres.pdf DRM+ Presentation], DRM.org, accessed 2009-02-02&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2009, DRM+ (Mode E) became an official broadcasting standard with the publication of the technical specification by the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]; this is effectively a new release of the whole DRM spec with the additional mode permitting operation above 30&amp;nbsp;MHz up to 174&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;ETSI ES 201 980 V3.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Wider bandwidth channels are used, which allows radio stations to use higher bit rates, thus providing higher audio quality. A 100&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM+ channel has sufficient capacity to carry one low-definition 0.7 megabit/s wide mobile TV channel: it would be feasible to distribute [[mobile TV]] over DRM+ rather than [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]] or [[DVB-H]]. However, DRM+ (DRM Mode E) as designed and standardized only provides bitrates between 37.2 and 186.3&amp;nbsp;kbit/s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= DRM Introduction and Implementation Guide | publisher=DRM Consortium | date=13 September 2013 | url=http://www.drm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DRM-guide-artwork-9-2013-1.pdf | pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://drm-forum.de/images/drm-forum/drm-workshop-2016/Use_of_DRMplus_in_the_FM_Band.pdf | title=Use of DRM+ in the FM Band 87.5-108MHz | pages=6 | first=Jens | last=Schroeder | date=April 2016 | publisher=Deutsches DRM-Forum }}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on robustness level, using 4-QAM or 16-QAM modulations and 100&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth.

DRM+ has been successfully tested in all the VHF bands, and this gives the DRM system the widest frequency usage; it can be used in band I, II and III. DRM+ can coexist with DAB in band III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm-radio-kl.eu/symposium2010/symposium2010en.htm|title=Symposium DRM+ im VHF-Band III in Kaiserslautern|author=|date=|website=www.drm-radio-kl.eu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also the present FM-band can be utilized. The ITU has published three recommendations on DRM+, known in the documents as Digital System G. This indicate  the introduction of the full DRM system (DRM 30 and DRM+).
ITU-R Rec. BS.1114 is the ITU recommendation for sound broadcasting in the frequency range 30&amp;nbsp;MHz to 3&amp;nbsp;GHz. DAB, HD-Radio and ISDB-T were already recommended in this document as Digital Systems A, C and F respectively.

In 2011, the paneuropean organisation Community Media Forum Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmfe.eu|title=Community Media Forum Europe - Information and Lobbying for the Community Media Sector|author=|date=|website=cmfe.eu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has recommended to the European Commission that DRM+ should rather be used for small scale broadcasting (local radio, community radio) than DAB/DAB+.

'''Disease burden''' is the impact of a [[health problem]] as measured by [[financial cost]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], [[morbidity]], or other indicators. It is often quantified in terms of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs) or [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALYs), both of which quantify the number of years lost due to disease (YLDs). One DALY can be thought of as one year of healthy life lost, and the overall disease burden can be thought of as a measure of the gap between current health status and the ideal health status (where the individual lives to [[old age]] free from disease and [[disability]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease.pdf | last1=Prüss-Üstün | first1=Annette | last2 = Corvalán | first2=Carlos|year =2006 |title=Preventing disease through healthy environments: Towards an estimate of the environmental burden of disease | publisher =World Health Organization | work = Quantifying environmental health impacts }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kay00"&gt;{{cite conference| first1=David |last1=Kay | first2=Annette |last2=Prüss |first3=Carlos |last3=Corvalán |title=Methodology for assessment of Environmental burden of disease |booktitle=ISEE session on environmental burden of disease |location=Buffalo |date=23–24 August 2000 |url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/methods/en/wsh0007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546204|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in June 2015, low back pain and major depressive disorder were among the top ten causes of YLDs and were the cause of more health loss than diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma combined.

==History==

The first study on the [[global burden of disease]], conducted in 1990, quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the DALY as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s.&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutgbd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;

==Modifiable risk factors==

In 2006, the WHO released a report which addressed the amount of global disease that could be prevented by reducing environmental risk factors.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt; The report found that approximately one fourth of the global disease burden and more than one third of the burden among children was due to modifiable environmental factors. The "environmentally-mediated" disease burden is much higher in developing countries, with the exception of certain [[non-communicable disease]]s, such as [[cardiovascular disease]]s and cancers, where the [[per capita]] disease burden is larger in [[developed countries]]. Children have the highest death toll, with more than 4 million environmentally-caused deaths yearly, mostly in [[developing countries]]. The [[infant death rate]] attributed to environmental causes is also 12 times higher in developing countries. 85 out of the 102 major diseases and injuries classified by WHO were due to environmental factors.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt;

To measure the environmental health impact, ''environment'' was defined as "all the physical, chemical and biological factors external to a person, and all the related behaviours".&lt;ref name="whatisenv"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease2.pdf|title=What is the environment in the context of health?|work=Environmental burden of disease series|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of ''modifiable environment'' included:
*Air, soil, and water pollution with [[chemical]]s or [[biological agent]]s
*[[Ultraviolet]] and [[ionizing radiation]]
*[[Noise pollution|Noise]] and [[electromagnetic field]]s
*[[Built environment]]
* Agricultural methods and [[irrigation]] schemes
*[[Human impact on the environment|Man-made climate change]] and ecosystem degradation
*[[Occupational hazard|Occupational risks]]
*Individual behaviors, such as hand-washing and [[food contamination]] due to unsafe water or dirty hands&lt;ref name="whatisenv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quantification"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantification of the disease burden attributable to environmental risk factors|year=2010|work=Programme on quantifying environmental health impacts|author=Department of Public Health and Environment|publisher=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/summaryEBD_updated.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain environmental factors were excluded from this definition:
*Indoor smoke from [[solid fuel]] use
*Lead
*[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]&lt;ref name="oberg10"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Öberg, M.|author2=Jaakkola, M.S.|author3=Prüss-Üstün, A.|author4=Schweizer, C.|author5=Woodward, A.|year=2010|title=Second-hand smoke: Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels|publisher=World Health Organization|work=Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Natural climate change (as opposed to man-made climate change)
*Occupational [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate]]s or [[carcinogen]]s
*Outdoor air pollution

*[[Second-hand smoke]]
*Solar [[ultraviolet radiation]]

==Estimation==

The WHO developed a methodology to quantify the health of a population using summary measures, which combine information on mortality and non-fatal health outcomes. The measures quantify either health gaps or health expectancies; the most commonly used health summary measure is the DALY.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quantification" /&gt;

The exposure-based approach, which measures exposure via [[pollutant]] levels, is used to calculate the environmental burden of disease.&lt;ref name="knol05"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knol|first1=A.B.|last2=Staatsen|first2=B.A.M.|title=Trends in the environmental burden of disease in the Netherlands, 1980–2020|date=8 August 2005|publisher=National Institute of Public Health and the Environment|url=http://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/500029001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires knowledge of the outcomes associated with the relevant risk factor, exposure levels and distribution in the [[study population]], and [[dose-response relationship]]s of the pollutants.

A dose-response relationship is a function of the exposure parameter assessed for the study population.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt; Exposure distribution and dose-response relationships are combined to yield the study population's ''health impact distribution'', usually expressed in terms of [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]. The health impact distribution can then be converted into health summary measures, such as DALYs. Exposure-response relationships for a given risk factor are commonly obtained from [[epidemiological studies]].&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt; For example, the disease burden of outdoor air pollution for [[Santiago, Chile]], was calculated by measuring the concentration of [[atmospheric particulate matter]] (PM10), estimating the susceptible population, and combining these data with relevant dose-response relationships. A reduction of particulate matter levels in the air to recommended standards would cause a reduction of about 5,200 deaths, 4,700 respiratory [[hospital admission]]s, and 13,500,000 days of restricted activity per year, for a total population of 4.7 million.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;

In 2002, the WHO estimated the global environmental burden of disease by using [[risk assessment]] data to develop environmentally attributable fractions (EAFs) of mortality and morbidity for 85 categories of disease.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fewtrell07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241595759_eng.pdf|last1=Fewtrell|first1=Lorna|last2=Prüss-Üstün|first2=Annette|last3=Bos|first3=Robert|last4=Gore|first4=Fiona|last5=Bartram|first5=Jamie|title=Water, sanitation and hygiene: quantifying the health impact at national and local levels in countries with incomplete water supply and sanitation coverage|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2007|work=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, they released the first country-by-country analysis of the impact environmental factors had on health for its then 192 member states. These country estimates were the first step to assist governments in carrying out [[preventive action]]. The country estimates were divided into three parts:

;Environmental burden of disease for selected risk factors
:This presents the yearly burden, expressed in deaths and DALYs, attributable to: [[Indoor air quality|indoor air pollution]] from [[solid fuel]] use; outdoor air pollution; and unsafe water, [[sanitation]], and [[hygiene]]. Results are calculated using the exposure-based approach.
;Total environmental burden of disease for the relevant country
:The total number of deaths, DALYs per capita, and the percentage of the national burden of disease attributable to the environment represent the disease burden that could be avoided by modifying the environment as a whole.
;Environmental burden by disease category
:Each country summary was broken down by the disease group, where the annual number of DALYs per capita attributable to environmental factors were calculated for each group.&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;

==Implementation and interpretation==

The public health impacts of air pollution (annual means of PM10 and ozone), noise pollution, and radiation ([[radon]] and UV), can be quantified using DALYs. For each disease, a DALY is calculated as:
:DALYs = number of people with the disease × duration of the disease (or loss of [[life expectancy]] in the case of mortality) × severity (varying from 0 for perfect health to 1 for death)

Necessary data include [[prevalence]] data, exposure-response relationships, and weighting factors that give an indication of the severity of a certain disorder. When information is missing or vague, experts will be consulted in order to decide which alternative data sources to use. An uncertainty analysis is carried out so as to analyze the effects of different assumptions.&lt;ref name="knol05" /&gt;

===Uncertainty===

When estimating the environmental burden of disease, a number of potential sources of error may arise in the measure of exposure and exposure-risk relationship, assumptions made in applying the exposure or exposure-risk relationship to the relevant country, health statistics, and, if used, expert opinions.

Generally, it is not possible to estimate a formal [[confidence interval]], but it is possible to estimate a range of possible values the environmental disease burden may take based on different input parameters and assumptions.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt; When more than one definition has to be made about a certain element in the assessment, multiple analyses can be run, using different sets of definitions. [[Sensitivity analysis|Sensitivity]] and [[Decision analysis|decision analyses]] can help determine which sources of uncertainty affect the final results the most.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt;

==Representative examples==

===The Netherlands===

In [[the Netherlands]], air pollution is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and exposure to certain forms of radiation can lead to the development of cancer. Quantification of the health impact of the environment was done by calculating DALYs for air pollution, noise, radon, UV, and indoor dampness for the period 1980 to 2020. In the Netherlands, 2–5% of the total disease burden in 2000 could be attributed to the effects of (short-term) exposure to air pollution, noise, radon, natural UV radiation, and [[dampness]] in houses. The percentage can increase to up to 13% due to uncertainty, assuming no threshold.

Among the investigated factors, long-term PM10 exposure have the greatest impact on [[public health]]. As levels of PM10 decrease, related disease burden is also expected to decrease. Noise exposure and its associated disease burden is likely to increase to a level where the disease burden is similar to that of traffic accidents. The rough estimates do not provide a complete picture of the environmental health burden, because data are uncertain, not all environmental-health relationships are known, not all environmental factors have been included, and it was not possible to assess all potential health effects. The effects of a number of these assumptions were evaluated in an uncertainty analysis.&lt;ref name="knol05" /&gt;

===Canada===

Exposure to environmental hazards may cause [[chronic disease]]s, so the magnitude of their contribution to the Canada's total disease burden is not well understood. In order to give an initial estimate of the environmental burden of disease for four major categories of disease, the {{abbr|EAF|environmentally attributable fractions}} developed by the WHO, EAFs developed by other researchers, and data from Canadian public health institutions were used.&lt;ref name="wigmore"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wigmore, Cameron|date=2 November 2007|title=Study: Environmental burden of disease in Canada|url=https://greenparty.ca/fr/node/3079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed a total of 10,000–25,000 deaths, with 78,000–194,000 hospitalizations; 600,000–1.5 million days spent in hospital; 1.1–1.8 million restricted activity days for sufferers of [[asthma]]; 8000–24,000 new cases of cancer; 500–2,500 babies with low [[birth weight]]s; and [[Canadian dollar|C$]]3.6–9.1 billion in costs each year due to respiratory disease, cardiovascular illness, cancer, and congenital affliction associated with adverse environmental exposures.&lt;ref name="wigmore" /&gt;

==Criticism==

There is no consensus on the best measures of the public’s health. This is not surprising because measurements are used to accomplish diverse functions (e.g., population health assessment, evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions, formulation of health policies, and projection of future resource need).  The choice of measures may also depend on individual and societal values.  Measures that only consider premature death will omit the burden of living with a disease or disability, and measures that combine both in a single measure (i.e. DALYs) need to make a judgment to the significance of these measures compared to each other. Other metrics such as economic costs will not capture pain and suffering or other broader aspects of burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | issn=0033-3549 | volume=121 | issue=1 | pages=14–22 | last=Thacker | first=Stephen B |author2=Stroup, Donna F |author3=Carande-Kulis, Vilma |author4=Marks, James S |author5=Roy, Kakoli |author6= Gerberding, Julie L  | title=Measuring the Public's Health | journal=Public Health Reports | year= 2006 |pmc=1497799 | pmid=16416694 | doi=10.1177/003335490612100107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DALYs are a simplification of a complex reality, and therefore only give a crude indication of environmental health impact. Relying on DALYs may make donors take a narrow approach to health care programs. [[Foreign aid]] is most often directed at diseases with the highest DALYs, ignoring the fact that other diseases, despite having lower DALYs, are still major contributors to disease burden. Less-publicized diseases thus have little or no funding for health efforts. For example, maternal death (one of the top three killers in most poor countries) and pediatric respiratory and intestinal infections maintain a high disease burden, and safe pregnancy and the prevention of coughs in infants do not receive adequate funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | issn=0015-7120 | issue=January/February 2007 | last=Garrett | first=Laurie | title=The Challenge of Global Health | journal=Foreign Affairs | date=1 January 2007 | url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/doc/2010_GARRETT_Challenge_of_Global_Health.pdf|volume=86|pages=14–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Earth System Governance: People, Places and the Planet. Science and Implementation Plan of the Earth System Governance Project''. Earth System Governance Report 1, IHDP Report 20. Bonn, IHDP: The Earth System Governance Project.&lt;/ref&gt; is a long-term, interdisciplinary social science research programme originally developed under the auspices of the [[International Human Dimensions Programme|International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change]].&lt;ref name="IHDP"&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/publications/?id=325] IHDP Annual Report 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It started in January 2009.

The Earth System Governance Project currently consists of a network of ca. 300 active and about 2,300 indirectly involved scholars from all continents. The project has evolved into the largest social science research network in the area of governance and global environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=9446496&amp;jid=JPS&amp;volumeId=-1&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=9446492] John Dryzek. 2014.

''British Journal of Political Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth System Governance Project Office is hosted at Lund University, Sweden.

== Aims ==
The Earth System Governance Project aims to contribute to science on the large, complex challenges of governance in an era of rapid and large-scale environmental change. The project seeks to create a better understanding of the role of institutions, organizations and governance mechanisms by which humans regulate their relationship with the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt; The Earth System Governance Project aims to integrate governance research at all levels. The project aims to examine problems of the ‘global commons’, but also local problems from [[air pollution]] to the preservation of waters, [[waste treatment]] or [[desertification]] and [[soil degradation]]. However, due to natural interdependencies local environmental pollution can be transformed into changes of the global system that affect other localities. Therefore, the Earth System Governance Project looks at institutions and governance processes both local and globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futureearth.org/blog/2013-jul-15/what-earth-system-governance] What is Earth System Governance?&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth System Governance Project is a scientific effort, but also aims to assist policy responses to the pressing problems of earth system transformation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/Articles/Managing-global-change/Earth-System-Governance-Project/] The Broker Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cri.cn/6966/2011/05/19/1461s638279.htm] Nobel Laureates Hand in Recommendations to UN Panel on Global Sustainability&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual framework ==
{{Main|Earth system governance}}
The Earth System Governance Project organizes its research according to a conceptual framework guided by five analytical problems. These are the problems of the overall ''architecture'' of earth system governance, of ''agency'' beyond the state and of the state, of the ''adaptiveness'' of governance mechanisms and processes, of their ''accountability'' and legitimacy and of modes of ''allocation and access'' in earth system governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agci.vu.nl/en/Images/Biermann%20et%20al%20%202010%20INEA%20ESG%20Research%20Framework_tcm143-191335.pdf] Frank Biermann, Michele M. Betsill, Joyeeta Gupta, Norichika Kanie, Louis Lebel, Diana Liverman, Heike Schroeder, Bernd Siebenhüner and Ruben Zondervan. 2010. Earth system governance: a research framework. ''International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law, and Economics''. Vol 10. Nr 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''concept of Earth System Governance''' is defined as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''... the interrelated and increasingly integrated system of formal and informal rules, rule-making systems, and actor-networks at all levels of human society (from local to global) that are set up to steer societies towards preventing, mitigating, and adapting to global and local environmental change and, in particular, earth system transformation, within the normative context of sustainable development''.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Origin and history ==
In 2001, the four then active global change research programmes [[Diversitas|(DIVERSITAS]], [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]], [[World Climate Research Programme]], and [[International Human Dimensions Programme|International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change]]) agreed to intensify co-operation through setting up an overarching [[Earth System Science Partnership]]. The research communities represented in this Partnership contend in the 2001 Amsterdam Declaration on Global Change&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41] The Amsterdam Declaration on Global Change&lt;/ref&gt; that the earth system now operates ‘well outside the normal state exhibited over the past 500,000 years’ and that ‘human activity is generating change that extends well beyond natural variability—in some cases, alarmingly so— and at rates that continue to accelerate.’ To cope with this challenge, the four global change research programmes have called ‘urgently’ for strategies for Earth System management’.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt;

In March 2007, in response to the 2001 Amsterdam Declaration, the Scientific Committee of the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), the overarching social science programme in the field, mandated the drafting of the Science Plan of the Earth System Governance Project by a newly appointed Scientific Planning Committee. The Earth System Governance Project builds on the results of an earlier long-term research programme, the IHDP core project Institutional Dimensions of Global Environmental Change (IDGEC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dsj1rkoH3scC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=HDP+core+project+Institutional+Dimensions+of+Global+Environmental+Change+earth+system+governance+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NXxIhAHHT2&amp;sig=uHwEdIOQzkkkMQdI7e-kmI0b4Mw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zr-TVdXiLYq5UYWNrBA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=HDP%20core%20project%20Institutional%20Dimensions%20of%20Global%20Environmental%20Change%20earth%20system%20governance%20project&amp;f=false] Peijun Shi, Carlo Jaeger, Qian Ye (editors). 2012. ''Integrated Risk Governance: Science Plan and Case Studies of Large-scale Disasters''. Heidelberg: Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/publication/young-oran--institutions-and-environmental-change] Young, Oran., Heike Schroeder and Leslie A. King (editors). 2008. ''Institutions and Environmental Change: Principal Findings, Applications, and Research Frontiers''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Earth System Governance Project was officially launched.  

In 2009, the Science and Implementation Plan of the Earth System Governance Project was published.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt; In the science and implementation plan, the conceptual problems, cross-cutting themes, flagship projects, and its policy relevance are outlined in detail. The Science Plan was written by an international, interdisciplinary Scientific Planning Committee chaired by Prof. Frank Biermann, which drew on a consultative process that started in 2004. Several working drafts of this Science Plan have been presented and discussed at a series of international events and conferences, and numerous scholars in the field, as well as practitioners, have offered suggestions, advice, and critique.&lt;ref name="IHDP"/&gt;

Since then, the project has evolved into a broader research alliance that builds on an international network of research centers, lead faculty and research fellows. After the termination of the IHDP in 2014, the activities of the Earth System Governance research alliance are supported by an international steering group of representatives of the main Earth System Governance Research Centres and the global group of lead faculty and research fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/people/lead-faculty Earth System Governance Project: Lead Faculty. Website accessed 1 July 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global research network ==
For its activities and implementation, the Earth System Governance Project relies on a global network of experts from different academic and cultural backgrounds. The research network consists of different groups of scientific experts. The Earth System Governance Project operates under the direction of a ''Scientific Steering Group'' chaired by Frank Biermann. The role of the Scientific Steering Committee is to guide the implementation of the Earth System Governance Science Plan. The ''Lead Faculty'' of the Earth System Governance Project is a group of individual scientists who take over (shared) responsibility for the development of research on particular analytical problems. ''Earth System Governance Fellows'' are scientists who link their own research projects with the broader themes and questions raised by the Earth System Governance Science and Implementation Plan.

An important element in the project organisation is the global alliance of research centres that brings together the [[VU University Amsterdam]]; the [[Australian National University]]; [[Chiang Mai University]]; [[Colorado State University]]; [[Lund University]]; [[University of East Anglia]]; [[University of Oldenburg]]; the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]]; the [[University of Toronto]]; the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] and [[Yale University]]. In addition, strong networks on earth system governance research exist in China, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and Russia.

== Research output ==
The network of researchers affiliated with the Earth System Governance Project has brought out many reports and books, and has published in journals such as International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics – incl. option to publish open access|url = https://www.springer.com/law/environmental/journal/10784|website = springer.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological Economics;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ecological Economics {{!}} 0921-8009 {{!}} Elsevier|url = http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/503305/description|website = www.elsevier.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Environmental Change;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Environmental Change {{!}} 0959-3780 {{!}} Elsevier|url = http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/30425/description|website = www.elsevier.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental Science &amp; Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Environmental Science &amp; Policy {{!}} 1462-9011 {{!}} Elsevier|url = http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/601264/description|website = www.elsevier.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Environmental Politics and Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability - ScienceDirect.com|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/18773435|website = www.sciencedirect.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring research topics of the Earth System Governance Project are water governance, climate governance and fragmentation of global environmental governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/publications Earth System Governance Project: Publications. Website accessed 23 July 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A related MIT Press Book series is designed to address the research challenge of earth system governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ESG / MIT Press book series {{!}} Earth System Governance|url = http://earthsystemgovernance.org/esg%20and%20mit%20press%20book%20series|website = earthsystemgovernance.org|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Project publishes regular Working Papers, which are peer-reviewed online publications that broadly address questions raised by the Project’s Science and Implementation Plan.

Several special issues of topics related to earth system governance have been published in scientific journals over the last years.

==  Education programmes ==
Earth system governance as a research object is quickly emerging, and as a consequence, the number of education programmes on bachelor, master and doctoral level related to earth system governance steadily increases. A number of institutes and universities currently collaborate in a Global Alliance of Earth System Governance Research Centres, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/teaching Earth System Governance Project: Teaching. Website accessed 29 April 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ecosystems, Resilience and Governance, University of Stockholm and Stockholm Resilience Centre, Sweden
* Environmental Studies and Sustainability Science, LUMES, International Master’s Programme, Lund University, Sweden
* Environment and Resource Management, VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands
* Global Environmental Governance, Specialization track in MSc Political Science, VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands
* Lund University Centre of Excellence for Integration of Social and Natural Dimensions of Sustainability, LUCID, Research School, Lund University, Sweden
* Sustainability Economics and Management, MSc Programme, University of Oldenburg, Germany
* Environmental Governance related Programmes, MA, MSc, and PhD Programmes, Colorado State University, United States of America
* Environment and Development Programmes, MSc, MRes, and MBA Programmes, University of East Anglia, United Kingdom

A substantial number of the workshops and other events of the project are capacity-building activities. The project also organizes, endorses and provides teaching to summer schools and capacity building events and programs. In addition, members of the Scientific Steering Group and staff of the International Project Office give guest lectures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/teaching Earth System Governance Project: Teaching. Website accessed 2 July 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Task forces ==
The Earth System Governance Project organizes Task Forces, international networks of senior and early career scholars with a series of working groups focused on particular ideas or idea clusters. There are currently two active Task Forces:

* Task Force on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/ website Task Force on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;
This Task Force aims to explore key concepts with regard to Earth System Governance, such as planetary boundaries, green economy, resilience and the Anthropocene. It aims to critically examine and further refine these novel governance ideas. 

* Task Force on Methodology for Earth System Governance Research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbl.nl/en/news/newsitems/2013/methodology-for-earth-system-governance-research PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;
This Task Force seeks aims to advance quantitative earth system governance research by promoting new international research collaborations, fostering interaction and dialogue among existing research projects, and developing architectures to promote the building and sharing of datasets.

== Policy influence ==
In 2011, the Earth System Governance Project launched an initiative on International Environmental Governance. This initiative aims to provide a forum for discussion of current and ongoing research on international environmental governance and the institutional framework for sustainable development, in the period leading up to the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] in Rio de Janeiro, also known as ‘Rio + 20’. In addition, the initiative aims to target decision-makers and to contribute not just to a better understanding but also to actual improvements in international environmental governance towards an institutional framework that enables sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/blog/2011/07/guest-blog-post-earth-system-governance-initiative-international-environmental-governan The Access Initiative, Guest Blog Post: Earth System Governance Initiative on International Environmental Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;

== context ==
There is widespread support for the Earth System Governance Project in the scientific community, which is reflected in the size of the research network and in various publications by experts. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-2585-2007.32.pdf.] Myanna Lahsen. 2007. Earth System Governance: Research in Aid of Global Environmental Sustainability. ''Global Change NewsLetter No. 70''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WIzFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=interesting+earth+system+governance+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=klDVNzhn8u&amp;sig=zIOwy73tahadMZ5OwQOooWa-QnI&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAjhGahUKEwjgpM7a4qrHAhUFPBoKHVuIC10#v=onepage&amp;q=interesting%20earth%20system%20governance%20project&amp;f=false] Michael Manton and Linda Anne Stevenson. 2013. Climate in Asia and the Pacific: Security, Society and Sustainability. ''Springer Science &amp; Business Media''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, criticisms of the Earth System Governance Project have also been made. 

In an internal report of the International Human Dimensions Programme it is stated that the steering group of the Earth System Governance Project is too much dominated by experts from OECD countries. Since then, the Earth System Governance Project has actively sought ways to involve experts from different regions of the world. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/docs/Publications/ESG/ESG%20SSC-1_Minutes-clean.pdf] 1st Earth System Governance Scientific Steering Committee Meeting&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea of earth system governance has also been criticized for being too top-down, for placing too much emphasis on global governance structures. According to Mike Hulme, earth system governance represents an attempt to ‘geopolitically engineer’ our way out of the climate crisis. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/30139401?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents] Mike Hulme. 2008. The Conquering of Climate: Discourses of Fear and Their Dissolution. ''The Geographical Journal''. Vol. 174, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He questions whether the climate is governable and argues that it is way too optimistic and even hubristic to attempt to control the global climate by universal governance regimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mikehulme.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2008-hulme-governing-and-adapting.pdf] Mike Hulme. 2008. Governing and adapting to climate.
A response to Ian Bailey’s Commentary on ‘Geographical work at the boundaries of climate change’. ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers''.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of the novel concept, however, has been rejected by other scholars as being too narrow and misleading &lt;ref&gt;Frank Biermann. 2014.

The '''German Parliamentary Committee investigation of the NSA spying scandal''' (official title: ''1. Untersuchungsausschuss „NSA“'') was started on March 20, 2014, by the [[German Parliament]] in order to investigate the extent and background of foreign secret services spying in Germany in the light of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)]].
The Committee is also in search of strategies on how to protect telecommunication with technical means.&lt;ref&gt;http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/008/1800843.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Deutscher Bundestag]]: [http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/ausschuesse18/ua/1untersuchungsausschuss 1. Untersuchungsausschuss („NSA“)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The committee is formed by eight members of the German Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/ausschuesse18/ua/1untersuchungsausschuss/mitglieder/262992 Mitglieder des NSA-Untersuchungsausschusses], bundestag.de, accessed July 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentarian of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union (CDU)]] [[Clemens Binninger]] was head of the committee but stepped down after six days. In a statement, Binninger clarified that the other committee members had insisted on inviting Edward Snowden to testify; Binninger objected to this and resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2014/50515028_kw15_binninger/216908|title=Deutscher Bundestag - NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss: Binninger tritt vom Ausschussvorsitz zurück|author=Karl Otto Sattler|date=9 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-04/nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-binninger-ruecktritt NSA-Ausschussvorsitzender geht im Streit], Zeit.de, April 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Sensburg]] (CDU) succeeded him.

== Witnesses ==

=== Discussion about the witness Snowden ===
On May 8, 2014, the committee unanimously decided to let US whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] testify as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-05/sensburg-schlaegt-snowden-befragung-in-schweizer-botschaft-vor NSA-Ausschusschef will Snowden in Schweizer Botschaft befragen], zeit.de, May 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2014, the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]] and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] filed a constitutional complaint against the Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democrats and the NSA Parliamentary Committee because of the Christian Democrats' and the Social Democrats' refusal to let the witness Edward Snowden testify in Berlin. The accused proposed a video conference from Moscow which Snowden had refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/abhoer-affaere-opposition-klagt-wegen-snowden-vernehmung-in-krlsruhe-13175658.html ''Grüne und Linke klagen gegen NSA-Untersuchungsauss'', September 26, 2014]. Website FAZ, accessed September 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2014, the Green Party and The Left filed a constitutional complaint against German chancellor Merkel. According to them, she refuses to comply with her duty according to Chapter 44 of the German constitution to ensure a real investigation; especially by refusing to ensure the legal requirements to allow the witness Edward Snowden to testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-spaehaffaere-opposition-verklagt-merkel-wegen-snowden-a-994029.html|title=NSA Sphaffre: Opposition verklagt Merkel wegen Snowden  - SPIEGEL ONLINE|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=28 September 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testimony of Binney and Drake ===
On July 3, 2014, the former Technical Director of the NSA,  [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], who had become a whistleblower after the [[9/11|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], testified to the committee. He said that the NSA has a totalitarian approach that has previously only been known from dictatorships and that there is no longer such a thing as privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-9-11-hat-alles-veraendert.aeedf44b-6825-4583-a740-0c20c0bd723a.html|title=NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss: 9/11  hat alles verändert - Politik - Stuttgarter Zeitung|author=Stuttgarter Zeitung|location=Stuttgart, Germany|date=3 July 2014|work=stuttgarter-zeitung.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/william-binney-als-zeuge-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-a-979062.html Untersuchungsausschuss im Bundestag: US-Informant vergleicht NSA mit einer Diktatur], Der Spiegel, July 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Former NSA employee [[Thomas Andrews Drake]] described the close cooperation between the NSA and the German foreign intelligence service [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/thomas-drake-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-13027055.html Bundesnachrichtendienst „ein Wurmfortsatz der NSA“], FAZ July 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/ex-nsa-mitarbeiter-drake-bnd-unterstuetzte-drohnenkrieg-der-usa-a-979130.html|title=Ex-NSA-Mitarbeiter Drake: BND untersttzte Drohnenkrieg der USA|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=4 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failed testimony of Greenwald ===
The US journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] was asked to testify in September, 2014. On August 1, 2014, he wrote in a letter that he was willing to support the Parliament's investigation on the espionage in Germany by the NSA. By their refusal to let the crucial witness Edward Snowden testify, German politicians had however shown that it is more important to them not to annoy the US than to really investigate and he was not willing to take part in a "ritual" that "shall seem like an investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/glenn-greenwald-sagt-zeugenvernehmung-vor-nsa-ausschuss-ab-a-984030.html|title=Glenn Greenwald sagt Zeugenvernehmung vor NSA-Ausschuss ab|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=1 August 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://netzpolitik.org/2014/glenn-greenwald-sagt-untersuchungsausschuss-ab-ritual-das-die-illusion-einer-untersuchung-erwecken-soll|title=Glenn Greenwald sagt Untersuchungsausschuss ab: "Ritual, das die Illusion einer Untersuchung erwecken soll"|work=netzpolitik.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Eikonal selectors==
In [[Operation Eikonal]] German [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] agents received "Selector Lists" from the NSA − search terms for their dragnet surveillance. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets.&lt;ref name=spiegel1&gt;{{cite web|title=Spying Close to Home: German Intelligence Under Fire for NSA Cooperation - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-intelligence-agency-bnd-under-fire-for-nsa-cooperation-a-1030593.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the [[European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] (EADS), the [[Eurocopter]] project&lt;ref name="ts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/bnd-und-nsa-die-chronologie-des-spionageskandals/11722810.html|title=BND und NSA: Die Chronologie des Spionageskandals – Politik – Tagesspiegel|work=tagesspiegel.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as French administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/die-neue-bnd-affaere-ein-foul-mit-folgen-1.2448810|title=Wie die NSA europäische Unternehmen ausspionierte|work=Süddeutsche.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005.&lt;ref name="ts1" /&gt; Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/nsa-spitzelei-bnd-soll-12-000-suchbegriffe-geloescht-haben-13569002.html|title=NSA-Spitzelei: BND soll 12.000 Suchbegriffe gelöscht haben|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|date=1 May 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terror attacks]].&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the [[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]] and the [[Greens (Germany)|Greens]] filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht - BVerfG, Beschluss des Zweiten Senats vom 13. n|url=https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2016/10/es20161013_2bve000215.html|website=bundesverfassungsgericht.de|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigative Parliamentary Committee was set up in spring 2014 and reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated [[economic espionage]] directly under the Germans' noses.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denkler|first1=Thorsten|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: NSA jubelte BND deutsche Spähziele unter|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/geheimdienst-affaere-nsa-jubelte-bnd-deutsche-spaehziele-unter-1.2715253|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court - instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, [[Kurt Graulich]], as a "person of trust" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Constitutional Court rules out access to NSA's 'selectors' list|url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-constitutional-court-rules-out-access-to-nsas-selectors-list/a-36396385|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designierter NSA-Sonderermittler: Ein Mann, 40.000 brisante Daten|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-sonderermittler-kurt-graulich-ein-mann-40-000-datensaetze-a-1040661.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his almost 300-paged report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Graulich-Abschlussbericht|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/graulich-abschlussbericht-101.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz)]] − including numerous enterprises based in Germany − were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstaffäre: Sonderermittler spricht von klarem Vertragsbruch der NSA|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-selektorenliste-kurt-graulich-spricht-von-klarem-vertragsbruch-a-1060280.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the magnitude differs there have also been problematic BND-internal selectors which have been used until end of 2013 - around two thirds of 3300 targets were related to EU and NATO states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstkontrolleure: BND hat gegen Recht und Auftrag verstoßen|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Geheimdienstkontrolleure-BND-hat-gegen-Recht-und-Auftrag-verstossen-3045627.html|publisher=Heise Online|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BND hat jahrelang unter Freunden spioniert|url=http://www.dw.com/de/bnd-hat-jahrelang-unter-freunden-spioniert/a-19393446|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Markus|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: BND spitzelte mit eigenen Selektoren|url=http://www.fr-online.de/datenschutz/geheimdienst-affaere-bnd-spitzelte-mit-eigenen-selektoren,1472644,32163156.html|publisher=Frankfurter Rundschau|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Klaus Landefeld]], member of the board at the Internet industry association Eco International, has met intelligence officials and legislators to present suggestions for improvement, like streamlining the selector system.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somaskanda|first1=Sumi|title=Is Big Brother coming to Germany?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/12/big-brother-coming-germany-161213062129779.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spying on the committee ==
On July 4, 2014, it was revealed to the public that BND agent Markus R. had been arrested on July 2, 2014, for apparently having spied. The 31-year-old German is accused of having worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].&lt;ref name="SZ_2032849"&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/neue-medienberichte-festgenommener-bnd-mann-spionierte-auch-fuer-die-cia-1.2032849 Medien: Festgenommener BND-Mann spionierte für CIA], Süddeutsche.de, July 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrest, the US ambassador [[John B. Emerson]] was summoned for talks at the German [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/Untersuchungsausschuss-zur-NSA/!141758/|title=BNDler soll für USA spioniert haben: Der amerikanische Brieföffner - taz.de|author=taz. die tageszeitung|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/nsa-ausschuss-bnd-mitarbeiter-unter-spionageverdacht-1.2030878|title=BND-Mitarbeiter soll NSA-Ausschuss ausspioniert haben|work=Süddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/festnahme-spion-100.html|title=31-Jähriger festgenommen: BND-Mitarbeiter ein US-Spion? - tagesschau.de|date=5 July 2014|work=tagesschau.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bnd-spion-us-botschafter-emerson-ins-auswaertige-amt-gebeten-a-979318.html|title=BND-Spion: US-Botschafter Emerson ins Auswrtige Amt gebeten|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=4 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bnd-spion-berlin-zoegert-wie-bei-nsa-mit-reaktionen-gegenueber-obama-a-979526.html|title=BND-Spion: Berlin zgert wie bei NSA mit Reaktionen gegenber Obama|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=6 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed that the BND-agent had saved 218 secret BND documents on USB sticks since 2012 and sold them to US agents for a sum of 25,000 Euro in Salzburg, Austria. At least three of the documents were about the NSA Parliamentary Committee.&lt;ref name="SZ_2032849" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Festnahme-BND-Mitarbeiter-soll-NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss-ausspioniert-haben-2249652.html|title=Festnahme: BND-Mitarbeiter soll NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss ausspioniert haben|date=4 July 2014|work=heise online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] had mistaken him for a Russian spy and asked US colleagues to help uncover him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bnd-verfassungsschutz-wollte-agenten-mit-us-hilfe-enttarnen-a-979416.html|title=BND: Verfassungsschutz wollte Agenten mit US-Hilfe enttarnen|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=5 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2014, a second US spy was discovered, who worked for the Secretary of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/nsa-spionageaffaere-razzia-100.html|title=Durchsuchung in Berlin: Weiterer US-Spion enttarnt?|date=9 July 2014|work=tagesschau.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ausweitung-der-geheimdienstaffaere-ermittlungen-gegen-us-spion-im-verteidigungsministerium-1.2038151|title=Zweiter US-Spion im Verteidigungsministerium|work=Süddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 a Parliament technician found out that the mobile phone of [[Roderich Kiesewetter]], representative of the Christian Democratic Union in the committee, was spied on. Kiesewetter said there is evidence that all four Party representatives in the committee have been spied on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swr.de/landesschau-aktuell/bw/ulm/kiesewetter-offenbar-abgehoert/-/id=1612/did=13735756/nid=1612/1hqz7ou/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Document leaks ==
In the months following May 2015, [[Peter Pilz]], a member of the Austrian parliament for the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Green Party]], disclosed several documents and transcripts related to [[operation Eikonal]], in which NSA and BND cooperated for tapping transit cables at a facility of [[Deutsche Telekom]] in Frankfurt. These documents were highly sensitive and handed over to the committee for investigating the Eikonal operation. Therefore, it seems likely someone from the committee leaked these documents to Pilz. Among them are lists of communication channels from many European countries, including most of Germany's neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Electrospaces.net: [http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2015/11/unnoticed-leak-answers-and-raises.html Unnoticed leak answers and raises questions about operation Eikonal], November 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Pilz also discovered NSA spying facilities in Austria, and therefore wants a parliamentary committee on the NSA spying in his own country too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.format.at/articles/1430/930/376970/spionage-peter-pilz-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss|title=Spionage: Peter Pilz fordert einen NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss|author=news networld Internetservice GmbH|work=format.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 2016, [[WikiLeaks]] released over 2,400 documents which it claims are from the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Uchill |first=Joe |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/308407-wikileaks-drops-docs-on-inquiry-into-nsa-german-cooperation |title=WikiLeaks publishes docs on inquiry into German cooperation with NSA |work=The Hill |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42102">The '''Global Burden of Disease Study''' ('''GBD''') is a comprehensive regional and global research program of [[disease burden]] that assesses [[death|mortality]] and [[disability]] from major diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s. GBD is a collaboration of over 1,800 researchers from 127 countries. Under principal investigator [[Christopher J.L. Murray]], GBD is based out of the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] (IHME) at the [[University of Washington]] and funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does a $100 million public health data revolution look like?|url=http://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=17751|website=TEDMED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Global Burden of Disease Study began in 1990 as a single [[World Bank]]-commissioned&lt;ref name="sign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/announcement/institute-health-metrics-and-evaluation-and-world-health-organization-sign-new |title=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and World Health Organization sign new agreement |publisher=[[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; study, now called GBD 1990.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt; The original project quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY) as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s,&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546204|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutgbd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; to aid comparisons. GBD 1990 was "institutionalized" at the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the research was "conducted mainly by researchers at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and WHO".&lt;ref name="sign" /&gt;

In 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated by WHO to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;

The WHO estimates were again updated for 2004 in ''The global burden of disease: 2004 update'' (published in 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_full.pdf |title=''The global burden of disease: 2004 update'' |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Global health risks'' (published in 2009).&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_Front.pdf |title=''Global health risks: mortality and burden of disease attributable to selected major risks'' |year=2009 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==

The GBD has three specific aims:

#To systematically incorporate information on non-fatal outcomes into the assessment of the health status (using a time-based measure of healthy years of life lost due either to premature mortality or to years lived with a disability, weighted by the severity of that disability)
#To ensure that all estimates and projections were derived on the basis of objective epidemiological and demographic methods, which were not influenced by advocates.
#To measure the burden of disease using a metric that could also be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions. The metric chosen was the DALY.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The burden of disease can be viewed as the gap between current health status and an ideal situation in which everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. Causes of the gap are premature mortality, disability and exposure to certain risk factors that contribute to illness.

==Results==

The 2013 report showed that global [[life expectancy]] for both sexes increased from 65.3 years in 1990, to 71.5 years in 2013,&lt;ref name="Lancet2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators| date=2014|title=Global, regional, and national age–sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=The Lancet|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–171|issn=0140-6736|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmid=25530442|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the number of deaths increased from 47.5 million to 54.9 million over the same interval.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; Progress varied widely across [[demographic]] and national groups. Reductions in age-standardised death rates for [[cardiovascular diseases]] and [[cancers]] in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from [[diarrhoea]], [[lower respiratory infections]] and neonatal causes in low-income regions drove the changes. [[HIV/AIDS]] reduced life expectancy in southern [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell, while for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates.

Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7%, from 4.3 million deaths in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; For some causes of more than 100,000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, [[pancreatic cancer]], [[atrial fibrillation]] and flutter, drug use disorders, [[diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell anaemias]]. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes and malaria remain in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important [[pathogens]] are [[rotavirus]] for diarrhoea and [[pneumococcus]] for lower respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt;

GBD 2015 found that for the first time, annual deaths from [[measles]] had fallen below 100,000 in 2013 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/11/16/vaccinations-vaccine-science-and-a-new-us-president/ |title=Vaccinations, Vaccine Science, and a New US President {{!}} Speaking of Medicine |publisher=[[PLOS]] |date=November 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 31, 2017 |author=Peter Hotez |quote=Those results include new findings just released by the Gates Foundation-supported Global Burden of Disease 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators that found a 75 percent reduction in global measles mortality over the last decade such that (for the first time ever) fewer than 100,000 children died from measles in 2013 and 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl3&amp;pii=S0140673614616822 |title=Table 3: Selected causes of global child deaths in 1990 and 2013 |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl5&amp;pii=S0140673616310121 |title=Table 5: Global deaths in 2005 and 2015 for all ages and both sexes combined and age-standardised death rates, with percentage change between 2005 and 2015 for 249 causes |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the global annual rate of new HIV infections has largely stayed the same during the past 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/global-rate-of-new-hiv-infections-hasn-t-fallen-in-a-decade-1.20305 |publisher=Nature News &amp; Comment |title=Global rate of new HIV infections hasn't fallen in a decade |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |author=Nisha Gaind |date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GBD 2015 also introduced the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) as a measure of a location's socio-demographic development that takes into account average income per person, educational attainment, and [[total fertility rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/global-burden-disease-study-2015-gbd-2015-socio-demographic-index-sdi-1980%E2%80%932015 |title=Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) 1980–2015 |website=GHDx |accessdate=February 7, 2017 |publisher=[[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/there-s-a-new-ranking-of-the-healthiest-countries-how-is-yours-doing/ |title=There's a new ranking of the healthiest countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">'''Global Map''' is a set of digital maps that accurately cover the whole globe to express the status of global environment. It is developed through the cooperation of [[National mapping agency|National Geospatial Information Authorities]] (NGIAs) in the world. An initiative to develop Global Map under [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]], the Global Mapping Project, was advocated in 1992 by Ministry of Construction, Japan (MOC) at the time (the current [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan]]-MLIT).

Global Map is digital [[geospatial information]] in 1&amp;nbsp;km [[Optical resolution|resolution]] which satisfies the following conditions:
# Covering the whole land area of the [[globe]]
# In consistent specifications
# Easily accessible by anyone in marginal cost
The global geospatial information developed as Global Map mainly consists of the following thematic layers:
* [[Transportation]] 
* [[Border|Boundary]] 
* [[Drainage]] 
* Population Centers 
* [[Elevation]] 
* [[Vegetation]] （Percent Tree Cover） 
* [[Land Cover]] 
* [[Land Use]]

== History of the Global Mapping Project ==
Since the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in 1972, global environmental challenges have been recognized as an issue which is common to humankind. “The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the [[Earth Summit]])” in Brazil in 1992 adopted “An action plan of humankind for sustainable development: [[Agenda 21]].” Agenda 21 describes in many parts the importance of information for decision-making to appropriately cope with global environmental challenges. Especially geospatial information is regarded to be critical.

In response to the objectives of Agenda 21 and in recognition of the need for further contribution to the development of geospatial information, the MOC at the time (the current MLIT) advocated, in the same year, the Global Mapping Project, an international cooperation initiative to develop global geospatial information to understand the present status and changes of global environment. This concept was presented at the Fifth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for the Americas in New York in 1993. At the same time, resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/METHODS/CARTOG/Americas/5/EConf.86.3.pdf

|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
calling for the promotion of the development of global geospatial data was adopted at this conference. Following this conference, a similar resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/cartog/Asia_and_Pacific/13/ECONF87.3.pdf
|title=Report of the Thirteenth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific

|date=May 1994
|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was adopted at Thirteenth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific in Beijing in 1994.
 
In 1996, International Steering Committee for Global Mapping (ISCGM), which consists of heads or its equivalents of NGIAs, was established to promote the Global Mapping Project. Thus the mechanism for the international promotion was formed. The [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]] (GSI) has been serving as the secretariat of the ISCGM. In the following year, in 1997, which was five years after the Earth Summit, the nineteenth [[United Nations General Assembly#Special sessions|special session of the United Nations General Assembly]] (19th UNGASS) was held. At the paragraph 112 of the resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/spec/aress19-2.htm
|title=Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21
|date=1997-06-28

|accessdate=2012-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the 19th UNGASS, importance of a supportive environment to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection and processing, especially in developing countries, to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues was mentioned along with the description mentioning the significance of international cooperation, including global mapping, as a means to develop the supportive environment.

As a result of such movement, In 1998, a recommendatory letter to participate in the Global Mapping Project was sent from the [[United Nations]] to NGIAs of respective countries in the world.

Further, at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Johannesburg Summit) held in 2002, global mapping was included in the Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9567">In most discussions, the '''global citizens movement''' is a socio-political process rather than a political organization or party structure. The term is often used synonymously with the [[anti-globalization movement]]  or the [[global justice movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan George, "Global Citizens Movement: A New Actor for a New Politics," Conference on Reshaping Globalisation: Multilateral Dialogues and New Policy Initiatives, Central European University, Budapest, October 18, 2001, http://www.tni.org/article/global-citizens-movement-new-actor-new-politics.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Global citizens movement" has been used by activists to refer to a number of organized and overlapping citizens groups who seek to influence public policy often with the hope of establishing global solidarity on an issue. Such efforts include advocacy on ecological [[sustainability]], corporate responsibility, social justice, and similar progressive issues.

In theoretical discussions of [[social movements]], global citizens movement refers to a complex and unprecedented phenomena made possible by the unique subjective and objective conditions of the [[planetary phase of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Orion Kriegman, ''Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2006), http://www.tellus.org/pub/Dawn_of_the_Cosmopolitan.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to distinguish the latent potential for a profound shift in values among an aware and engaged citizenry from existing transnational citizens movements which tend to focus on specific issues (such as the [[anti-war movement]] or the [[labor movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;J. Guidry, M. Kennedy, and M. Zald, eds., ''Globalizations and Social Movements: Culture, Power, and the Transnational Public Sphere'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2003; Daniel Jakopovich, "The Construction of a Trans-European Labour Movement," ''Capital &amp; Class'' 35, no. 1 (February 2011): 63-79, http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/35/1/63.short.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The concept of [[global citizenship]] first emerged among the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Greek Cynics]] in the 4th Century BCE, who coined the term “[[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]]” – meaning ''citizen of the world''. The [[Stoics]] later elaborated on the concept. The contemporary concept of [[cosmopolitanism]], which proposes that all individuals belong to a single moral community, has gained a new salience as scholars examine the ethical requirements of the [[planetary phase of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that today’s objective and subjective conditions have increased the latency for an emergent global civic identity has been argued by the authors of the [[Global Scenario Group]]’s final report ''Great Transition: the Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Raskin, Tariq Banuri, Gilberto Gallopín, Pablo Gutman, Al Hammond, Robert Kates, and Rob Swart, ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead'' (Boston: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2002), http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay. See also the sequel to ''Great Transition'': Paul Raskin, ''Journey to Earthland: A Great Transition to Planetary Civilization'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2016), http://www.greattransition.org/publication/journey-to-earthland.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments for the existence of a latent pool of tens of millions of people ready to identify around new values of earth consciousness have been put forth by such authors as [[Paul Raskin]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Raskin, ''World Lines: Pathways, Pivots, and the Global Futures'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2006), http://www.tellus.org/pub/World%20lines-A%20framework%20for%20exploring%20global%20pathways.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul H. Ray]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson, ''The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People are Changing the World'' (New York: Three Rivers Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Korten]].&lt;ref&gt;David Korten, ''The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community'' (San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations, such as [[Oxfam International]] believe that a global citizens movement rooted in social and economic justice is emerging and is necessary for ending global poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam International, ''Towards Global Equity: Oxfam International's Strategic Plan, 2001 – 2006'' (Oxford, UK: Oxfam International, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
In the last chapter of his book ''Red Sky at Morning'', [[James Gustave Speth|Gus Speth]] describes the potential for a new type of social movement composed of "we the people, as citizens" rooted in the principles of the [[Earth Charter]] to lead the transition in consciousness and values necessary for the emergence of a new planetary civilization.&lt;ref&gt;James Gustave Speth, ''Red Sky at Morning: America and the Crisis of the Global Environment. A Citizen's Agenda for Action'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Orion Kriegman, author of [http://www.tellus.org/pub/Dawn_of_the_Cosmopolitan.pdf ''Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement''], states, “Transnational corporations, governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) remain powerful global actors, but all of these would be deeply influenced by a coherent, worldwide association of millions of people who call for priority to be placed on new values of quality of life, human solidarity, and environmental sustainability.”&lt;ref&gt;Kriegman, ''Dawn of the Cosmpolitan.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Kriegman distinguishes this "coherent, worldwide association of millions" from the existing fragmented social movements active in the [[World Social Forum]]. These movements tend to be issue-specific – focused on labor, environment, human rights, feminist issues, indigenous struggles, poverty, AIDS, and numerous other interrelated but "siloed" efforts. Coherence among these movements would require a reframing of their work under the rubric of the struggle for a socially just and ecologically sustainable global society and the establishment of an institutional structure to defend the rights of humanity, future generations, and the biosphere.

==Critiques==
The major critique of the notion of a global citizens movement centers on the potential for the emergence of solidarity on issues at the global level. Nationalism, racism, and the dominance of the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian state system]] are considered antithetical to the adoption of a global civic identity. However, some scholars point out that the historical emergence of nationalism must have felt just as improbable in a time of warring city-states,&lt;ref&gt;Benedict Anderson, ''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism'' (New York: Verso, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and yet in retrospect it appears inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Chella Rajan, ''Global Politics and Institutions'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2006), http://www.tellus.org/tellus/publication/global-politics-and-institutions-a-utopistic-view.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more radical critique stems from the arguments put forth by [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]] in their book ''[[Multitude]]'' and enshrines [[Michel Foucault]]'s notion of a “plurality of resistance”&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''The History of Sexuality'' (New York: Vintage Books, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; as the only legitimate path forward. This argument asserts that an organized movement among the vast multitude is both undesirable and impossible. Instead of leadership and organizational structures, Hardt and Negri put faith in the emergence of spontaneous coherence due to increasing self-organized networks among various autonomous resistance movements. They critique the notion that there could be legitimate leaders, democratically chosen through a formal network of grassroots structures, acting on behalf of a big-tent pluralistic association of global citizens to directly confront the entrenched power of transnational corporations and state governments. However, it remains unclear how a network of autonomous movements would differ in practice from the vision of an authentic global citizens movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">'''Health systems strengthening''' (also '''health system strengthening''', abbreviated '''HSS''') is a term used in [[global health]] that roughly means to improve the health care system of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/hss_glossary/en/index5.html |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |title=Health Systems Strengthening Glossary |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this general definition, it can mean increasing funding for health infrastructure, improving health policy, trying to achieve [[universal healthcare]],&lt;ref name="glassman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Amanda%20Glassman%208-27-13.pdf |title=Conversation with Amanda Glassman on August 27, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |last=Glassman |first=Amanda |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any number of other health measures.

There has been some effort to use a [[systems thinking]] approach to health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hfgproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Perspectives-in-Health-Systems-Strengthening-Executive-Summary.pdf |publisher=USAID |title=New Perspectives in Health Systems Strengthening}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="systems-thinking-book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf |title=Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that use health systems strengthening==

Various health organizations have claimed to use health systems strengthening (while not necessarily agreeing on the definition). Some of these are:

* [[World Health Organization]]
* [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID, uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report);&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt; USAID states that HSS has been "at the core of [its] mission in health for the last 20 years", and defines HSS as "initiating activities in the six internationally accepted core HSS functions – human resources for health; health finance; health governance; health information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; and service delivery".&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/HSS-Vision.pdf |title=USAID's Vision for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=USAID |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GAVI Alliance]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* The [[Global Fund]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[PEPFAR]] (though less developed)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Stop TB Partnership]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Roll Back Malaria]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;

==Reception==

Both the idea of health systems strengthening and the term itself have received attention.

Even advocates of health systems strengthening admit that it can often seem like a "distant, even abstract aim".&lt;ref name=systems-thinking-book/&gt;

Marchal et al., writing in 2009, called the term "vague" and argued that "most current HSS strategies are selective (i.e., they target a specific disease), and their effects may undermine progress towards the long-term goal of effective, high-quality, and inclusive health systems."&lt;ref name="marchal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000059#s2 |title=Global Health Actors Claim To Support Health System Strengthening—Is This Reality or Rhetoric? |authors=Marchal B, Cavalli A, Kegels G |date=April 28, 2009 |publisher=''[[PLOS Medicine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karengrepin.com/2009/04/are-health-system-strengthening-efforts.html |title=Are health system strengthening efforts just hype? |date=April 29, 2009 |author=Karen Grepin |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Berman]], who was the lead health economist at the [[World Bank]], has pointed out that "Almost any support to health interventions can be considered HSS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHSD/Resources/376278-1114111154043/1011834-1246449110524/062509BermanUnpackingHealthSystemStrengthening.pdf |author=Peter Berman |date=June 2009 |publisher=World Bank |title=Unpacking Health System Strengthening |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge''' ('''HZMB'''), officially the '''Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macao Bridge''', is a {{convert|55|km|mi|adj=on}} [[bridge–tunnel]] system consisting of a series of three [[cable-stayed bridge]]s, an [[undersea tunnel]], and four [[artificial islands]]. It is both the longest sea crossing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45937924|title=China opens longest sea-crossing bridge|date=2018-10-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/smooth-start-for-worlds-longest-sea-crossing|title=Smooth start for world's longest state of the art sea crossing|last=hermes|date=2018-10-25|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the longest [[Intercontinental and transoceanic fixed links|fixed link]] on earth.

== Planning ==
=== Background ===
[[Hopewell Holdings]] founder and then-managing director [[Gordon Wu]] proposed the concept of a bridge-tunnel linking China, Hong Kong and Macau in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/2169864/property-tycoon-gordon-wus-35-year-dream-massive|title=Tycoon’s 35-year dream finally realised as mega bridge opens|last=Tsang|first=Denise|date=2018-10-23|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wu stated that he got the idea in 1983 from the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel]]. In 1988, Wu pitched the concept to Guangdong and Beijing officials. He envisaged a link farther north than the current design, beginning at Black Point near [[Tuen Mun]], Hong Kong and crossing the Pearl River estuary via [[Nei Lingding Island|Neilingding Island]] and [[Qi'ao Island]]. His proposed bridge would end at the Chinese village of Tangjia, and a new road would continue south through Zhuhai before terminating at Macau.&lt;ref name="bridgetochina"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stoner |first1=Tad |title=$6b bridge to China plan |work=South China Morning Post |date=3 November 1988 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions stalled after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square massacre]] in mid-1989 "unnerved" Wu and other foreign investors, and caused Hopewell's Hong Kong share prices to plunge.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurbecomes"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Christopher |title=Entrepreneur Becomes a Weather Vane For Resuming Business in China Now |work=The Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition |date=29 December 1989 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The route proposed by Wu was promoted by the government of [[Zhuhai]] under the name [[Lingdingyang Bridge]]. In the mid-1990s, Zhuhai built a bridge between the mainland and Qi'ao Island that was intended as the first phase of this route, though the full scheme had not been approved by either the Chinese nor Hong Kong governments at that time.&lt;ref name="firstlingdingyang"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cheung |first1=Agnes |title=First Lingdingyang link nearly ready |work=South China Morning Post |date=29 March 1995 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's central government showed support for this project on 30 December 1997.&lt;ref name="beijingapproves97"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Szeto |first1=Wanda |last2=Ng |first2=Kang-chung |title=Beijing approves Zhuhai-HK bridge |work=South China Morning Post |page=1 |date=31 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Hong Kong government was reticent, stating that it was still awaiting cross-border traffic study results, and Hong Kong media questioned the environmental impact of the project with regard to air pollution, traffic and marine life.&lt;ref name="toofar"&gt;{{cite news |title=A bridge too far |work=South China Morning Post |date=2 January 1998 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] passed a motion urging the Administration to develop the logistics industry including the construction of a bridge connecting Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macao. At a meeting of the China/Hong Kong Conference on Co-ordination of Major Infrastructure Projects held on 20 September 2002, it was agreed that a joint study should be conducted on the transport link between Hong Kong and Pearl River West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legco.gov.hk/database/english/data_tp/tp-zhuhzi-macao-bridge.htm|title=Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao Bridge (HZMB)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparation ===
To coordinate the project, the Advance Work Coordination Group of HZMB was set up in 2003. Officials from three sides solved the issues such as landing points and alignments of the bridge, operations of the Border Crossing Facilities and project financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmb.org/en/bencandy.asp?id=2|title=Introduction to Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge - Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridg|website=www.hzmb.org|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, China's Central Government, the governments of [[Guangdong]], Hong Kong and Macau agreed to finance 42% of the total costs.

In March 2009, it was further reported that China's Central Government, Hong Kong and Macau agreed to finance 22% of the total costs.

== Sections and elements ==
The 55-km ({{Convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) HZMB consists of three main sections: the Main Bridge ({{Convert|29.6|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the middle of the Pearl River estuary, the Hong Kong Link Road ({{Convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the east and the Zhuhai Link Road ({{Convert|13.4|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the west of the estuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=116030&amp;sid=3|title=China border control at sea crossing|work=The Standard|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hzmb.gov.hk/en/|title=Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao Bridge|website=www.hzmb.gov.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Main Bridge ===
The Main Bridge, the largest part of the HZMB project, is a bridge-cum-tunnel system constructed by the mainland Chinese authorities.&lt;ref name="hkMainBridge"&gt;{{cite web |title=HZMB Main Bridge |url=http://www.hzmb.hk/eng/about_overview_01.html |publisher=[[Highways Department]] (Hong Kong) |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It connects an artificial island, housing the Boundary Crossing Facilities (BCF) for both mainland China and Macau in the west, to the Hong Kong Link Road in the east.

This section includes a 22.9-km ({{Convert|22.9|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) viaduct and a 6.7-km ({{Convert|6.7|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) undersea tunnel that runs between two artificial islands. The viaduct crosses the Pearl River estuary with three cable-stayed bridges spanning between 280 and 460 metres (920 and 1,510 ft), allowing shipping traffic to pass underneath.&lt;ref&gt;Website of [[Transport and Housing Bureau]] ([[Hong Kong|HKSAR]]): [http://www.thb.gov.hk/eng/policy/transport/issues/cbt_3.htm "Cross boundary traffic: Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118160158/http://www.thb.gov.hk/eng/policy/transport/issues/cbt_3.htm |date=18 January 2010 }}.

Retrieved 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong Link Road ===
Under Hong Kong jurisdiction, the Hong Kong Link Road was built by [[Highways Department|Highway Department]] to connect the Main Bridge to an artificial island housing the Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities (HKBCF). This section includes a 9.4-km ({{Convert|9.4|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) viaduct, a 1-km ({{Convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) Scenic Hill Tunnel and a 1.6-km ({{Convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) at-grade road along the east coast of the [[Hong Kong International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmb.hk/eng/about_overview_02.html|title=HongKong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) : Hong Kong Link Road|website=www.hzmb.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2018/01/20180120/20180120_113410_060.html|title=Bridge link road surfacing completed|website=Hong Kong's Information Services Department|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hyd.gov.hk/en/road_and_railway/hzmb_projects/6787th/HZM6844TH-PD0005.pdf|title=Plot of Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao Baridge - Hong Kong Link Road|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zhuhai Link Road ===
The Zhuhai Link Road starts from an artificial island housing the Boundary Crossing Facilities for both mainland China and Macau, passes through the developed area of [[Gongbei Subdistrict|Gongbei]] via a tunnel towards Zhuhai, and connects to three major expressways, namely, the [[Jingzhu Expressway|Jing-Zhu Expressway]], Guang-Zhu West Expressway and Jiang-Zhu Expressway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmb.hk/eng/about_overview_06.html|title=HongKong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) : Connectivity to Pearl River West|website=www.hzmb.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Albert|date=2016-01-29|title=Geotechnical works of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Project|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292213640_Geotechnical_works_of_the_Hong_Kong-Zhuhai-Macao_Bridge_Project|journal=Japanese Geotechnical Society Special Publication|volume=2|pages=109–121|doi=10.3208/jgssp.ESD-KL-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hyd.gov.hk/en/road_and_railway/hzmb_projects/6787th/HZM6844TH-PD0005.pdf|title=Hong Kong Link Road (HKLR)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Left- and right-hand traffic ==
Although the HZMB connects two [[left-hand traffic]] (LHT) areas, namely Hong Kong and Macau, the crossing itself is [[right-hand traffic]] (RHT), the same as in Zhuhai and other regions of China. Thus, drivers from Hong Kong and Macau need to make use of crossing viaducts to switch to RHT upon entering the bridge, and back to LHT upon leaving the bridge when they are back to Hong Kong and Macau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/02/21/cars-may-drive-right-hong-kong-zhuhai-macao-bridge-despite-citys-left-hand-traffic-arrangement/|title=Cars may drive on the right on Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, despite city's left-hand traffic arrangement {{!}} Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|date=2017-02-21|work=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://html2-f.scribdassets.com/4jy6fyf98g5q0dpy/images/15-456a6791f3.png|title=Interface of "Left-driving" &amp; "Right-driving" Arrangement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic between Zhuhai and the bridge requires no left-right conversion as they are both RHT.&lt;ref name="rightside"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Su |first1=Xinqi |last2=Yeung |first2=Raymond |title=Right side of road the only way to travel on Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2133246/right-side-road-only-way-travel-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau-bridge |work=South China Morning Post |date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==

=== Shuttle buses ===
[[File:VR6495 at HZMB Zhuhai Port (20181024103741).jpg|thumb|Shuttle buses between Hong Kong and Zhuhai/Macau]]
Shuttle buses are available 24 hours a day and depart up to every 5 minutes with tickets available for purchase from vending machines or ticket counters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmbus.com|title=HZMBus|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hzmbus.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They take around 40 minutes to cross the HZMB.

The HZMB Hong Kong Port can be reached from Hong Kong by taxis or various buses including CityFlyer airport (A-number) routes, or the B5 shuttle bus from Sunny Bay MTR station, or the B6 bus from [[Tung Chung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmbus.com/passenger_service.html?id=53|title=Shuttle bus services at Hong Kong Port (in Chinese)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hzmbus.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HZMB Zhuhai Port can be reached from the mainland by taxis or the L1 bus which uses historic tourist vehicles, or Line-12, 23, 25 or 3 buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmbus.com/passenger_service.html?id=45|title=Shuttle bus services at Zhuhai Port (in Chinese)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hzmbus.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HZMB Macau Port can be reached from Macau by taxis or various buses including the 101X bus and the 102X bus from St Paul's and Taipa, or the HZMB Integrated Resort Connection bus from Taipa Ferry Terminal or the Exterior Ferry terminal, connecting with free casino shuttle buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmbus.com/passenger_service.html?id=60|title=Shuttle bus services at Macau Port (in Chinese)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hzmbus.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private vehicles and restrictions ===
Currently only 10,000 permits are available for private vehicles to drive across the HZMB from Hong Kong to Zhuhai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2124010/hong-kongs-bridge-zhuhai-allow-7000-extra-cars-cross-after|title=Zhuhai bridge to allow 7,000 more cars after high demand|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the number of vehicles permitted to enter Hong Kong and Macau from other regions is subject to a daily quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.td.gov.hk/en/public_services/licences_and_permits/closed_road_permit_for_cross_boundary_vehicles/rq_hk_private_cars_to_macao_access_city_centre/index.html|title=Transport Department - Regular Quota for Hong Kong Private Cars to Macao (Access to City Centre)|website=www.td.gov.hk|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Hong Kong government imposes significant fees, taxes and administrative paperwork on private car ownership and usage to deal with road congestion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moneyhero.com.hk/blog/en/how-much-does-it-cost-to-own-a-car-in-hong-kong|title=The cost of owning a car in Hong Kong|website=www.moneyhero.com.hk|language=en-HK|access-date=2018-10-22|date=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; driving a car on the HZMB would incur the same restrictions as current cross-border traffic. These include applying for separate driving licences for both Hong Kong and mainland China, a Hong Kong Closed Road Permit for cross-boundary vehicles, and an Approval Notice from the Guangdong Public Security Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.hk/en/residents/transport/crossboundary/xb_driving.htm|title=GovHK: Cross-boundary Driving|last=(www.gov.hk)|first=GovHK|website=www.gov.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.td.gov.hk/en/public_services/licences_and_permits/closed_road_permit_for_cross_boundary_vehicles/index.html|title=Transport Department - Closed Road Permit for Cross-boundary Vehicles|website=www.td.gov.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicle owners also need to ensure they have the appropriate insurance coverage for the regions they are travelling to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Insurance Authority - Motor insurance for using Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) |url=https://www.ia.org.hk/en/infocenter/faqs/faqs_13.html |website=www.ia.org.hk |language=zh-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic effects ==
The HZMB links three major cities Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macau, which are geographically close but separated by water. With the bridge in place, travelling time between Zhuhai and Hong Kong would cut down from about four hours to 30 minutes on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45937924|title=World's longest sea crossing: Hong Kong-Zhuhai bridge opens|date=2018-10-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-07/07/content_30035204.htm|title=Main structure of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is completed[1]- Chinadaily.com.cn|last=郭凯|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HZMB project is part of a [[Beijing]]-driven strategy to create an economic hub and promote the economic development of the whole area of the [[Pearl River Delta]], which is also known as Greater Bay Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2018/10/23/chinas-president-launches-hong-kong-mainland-mega-bridge/|title=China's president launches Hong Kong-mainland mega bridge - ASEAN Plus {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to leverage the bridge and create an economic zone linking the three cities, Zhuhai's [[Hengqin]] area was designated as a free trade zone in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Economy/Hong-Kong-Zhuhai-Macau-Bridge-construction-set-to-finish-this-year|title=Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge construction set to finish this year|website=Nikkei Asian Review|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Delays and budget overruns ===
The artificial island housing the Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities (HKBCF) was reported drifting due to an unconventional method, hitherto unused in Hong Kong, for land reclamation with steel circular cells in a row pushed through the mud and filled with inert material to form a seawall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzmb.hk/eng/doc/BCF%20Newsletter%20Issue%201%20E-A4.pdf|title=Newsletter 2012 July|date=July 2012|website=Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and Related Hong Kong Projects|publisher=Highways Department|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126121032/http://www.hzmb.hk/eng/doc/BCF%20Newsletter%20Issue%201%20E-A4.pdf|archivedate=26 November 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drifting of parts of the reclaimed island had allegedly caused a delay in the HZMB project. The Highways Department denied reports in various sources of movement up to 20 metres but admitted parts of the reclaimed land had moved "up to six or seven metres",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20150923-island-drift-threatens-further-delays-in-cross-border-bridge/|title=Island drift threatens further delays in cross-border bridge|date=23 September 2015|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126120958/http://www.ejinsight.com/20150923-island-drift-threatens-further-delays-in-cross-border-bridge/|archivedate=26 November 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hkfp1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/11/25/delays-of-up-to-5-years-for-hk30bn-moving-macau-bridge-crossing-facilities/|title=Delays of up to 5 years for HK$30bn ‘moving’ Macau bridge crossing facilities|last1=Winn|first1=Howard|date=25 November 2015|work=Hong Kong Free Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126102937/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/11/25/delays-of-up-to-5-years-for-hk30bn-moving-macau-bridge-crossing-facilities/|archivedate=26 November 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1860898/seven-metre-drift-hong-kong-artificial-island-reclaimed-bridge|title=Seven-metre drift on Hong Kong artificial island reclaimed for bridge project is normal, say officials|last1=Siu|first1=Phila|date=24 September 2015|work=South China Morning Post|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119185623/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1860898/seven-metre-drift-hong-kong-artificial-island-reclaimed-bridge|archivedate=19 November 2015|deadurl=no|last2=Lee|first2=Eddie|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that some movement was expected and safety had not been jeopardised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/article/1861223/shifting-sands-flaws-blamed-problems-artificial-island-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau|title=Shifting sands: 'flaws' blamed for problems at artificial island for Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge|last1=Ng|first1=Kang-chung|date=25 September 2015|work=South China Morning Post|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130023339/http://www.scmp.com/news/article/1861223/shifting-sands-flaws-blamed-problems-artificial-island-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau|archivedate=30 November 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainland contractors were also reportedly having difficulty in constructing immersed tubes in their section of the project, with the director of the Guangdong National Development and Reform Commission stating that 2020 would be a difficult target to meet.&lt;ref name="hkfp1" /&gt;

In 2017, the Main Bridge of the HZMB project experienced a cost overrun of about 10 billion yuan, arising from an increase in labor and material costs, as well as the refinement of the design and construction schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/11/22/china-stretch-hong-kong-zhuhai-macao-bridge-hits-another-budget-overrun-totalling-hk11-7-billion/|title=China stretch of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge hits another budget overrun totalling HK$11.7 billion|date=2017-11-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206161803/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/11/22/china-stretch-hong-kong-zhuhai-macao-bridge-hits-another-budget-overrun-totalling-hk11-7-billion/|archivedate=6 December 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=2017-12-06|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worker deaths and injuries ===
The number of deaths and injuries that have taken place on the project has come under scrutiny in Hong Kong. Apart from nine fatal cases on the mainland side,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45937924|title=China opens longest sea-crossing bridge|date=2018-10-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been ten deaths reported on the Hong Kong side of the construction project, and somewhere between 234 and 600 injuries, depending on the source.&lt;ref name="slam"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/04/11/lawmakers-slam-govt-misleading-death-rates-related-hk-zhuhai-macau-bridge-project/|title=Lawmakers slam gov’t over ‘misleading’ death rates related to HK-Zhuhai-Macau bridge project|last1=Ng|first1=Ellie|date=11 April 2017|work=Hong Kong Free Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413235316/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/04/11/lawmakers-slam-govt-misleading-death-rates-related-hk-zhuhai-macau-bridge-project/|archivedate=13 April 2017|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, the Construction Site Workers General Union, the [[Labour Party (Hong Kong)|Labour Party]] and the [[Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions|Confederation of Trade Unions]] demonstrated at the [[Central Government Complex]], demanding the government take action.&lt;ref name="regrets"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/04/12/govt-regrets-fatalities-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau-bridge-project-workers-demand-halt-murders/|title=Gov’t ‘regrets’ fatalities at Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge project, as workers demand halt to ‘murders’|last1=Ng|first1=Ellie|date=12 April 2017|work=Hong Kong Free Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414080754/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/04/12/govt-regrets-fatalities-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau-bridge-project-workers-demand-halt-murders/|archivedate=14 April 2017|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawmaker [[Fernando Cheung]] also expressed concerns over the unknown death toll on the Chinese side of the project, stating: "the project is known as the 'bridge of blood and tears’ and we are only talking about the Hong Kong side. We don’t even know what is happening in China. I suppose the situation could be 10 times worse than that in Hong Kong." He said that the Hong Kong Government had a responsibility to consider worker safety on the Chinese side.&lt;ref name="regrets" /&gt;

=== Faked safety testing ===

In 2017, Hong Kong's [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] (ICAC) arrested 21 employees (two senior executives, 14 laboratory technicians and five laboratory assistants) of Jacobs China Limited, a contractor of the Civil Engineering and Development Department for falsifying concrete test results, thus potentially risking the safety of bridge for public use.&lt;ref name="fakelab"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/05/24/arrests-fake-lab-tests-mega-bridge-project-damages-trust-govt-lawmakers-warn/|title=‘Fake’ lab tests at mega bridge project damage trust in gov’t, lawmakers warn|last1=Ng|first1=Ellie|date=24 May 2017|work=Hong Kong Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, a lab technician pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for eight months, while the others await sentencing. Hong Kong's Highways Department conducted tests again after the falsified results were exposed and found all test results met safety standards.&lt;ref name="labtechnician"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/12/01/lab-technician-jailed-8-months-falsifying-hong-kong-zhuhai-macao-bridge-test-records/|title=Lab technician jailed for 8 months after falsifying Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge test records|last1=Cheng|first1=Kris|date=1 December 2017|work=Hong Kong Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seawall integrity ===
In April 2018, the public and media raised questions over the integrity of the seawalls protecting the artificial islands at both ends of the undersea tunnel. In footage taken by drone users and mariners, the [[dolos]]se installed at the edges of the artificial islands appear to have dislodged. Some civil engineers suggested that there was an error in design.&lt;ref name="bridgeproblem"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://lantaunews.com/2018/04/05/this-weeks-bridge-problem-tunnels-face-flooding-threat/|title=This week’s bridge problem: tunnel faces flooding threat|last1=Clark|first1=Robert|date=5 April 2018|work=Lantau News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="illusion"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/04/03/hk-zhuhai-macao-bridge-components-found-drifting-artificial-island-authority-claims-may-illusion/|title=HK-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge components found drifting from artificial island, as authority claims it may be an ‘illusion’|last1=Cheng|first1=Kris|date=3 April 2018|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dismissing the safety concerns, the HZMB Authority said the dolosse were designed to be submerged and the design was working as intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2140330/safety-concerns-over-artificial-island-mega-hong-kong-zhuhai|title=Drifting away? Concerns over Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge dismissed|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of [[Highways Department]] Daniel Chung denied on 8 April 2018 that the breakwater components had been washed away by waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/04/10/hong-kong-zhuhai-macao-bridge-breakwater-design-scientific-reasonable-safe-says-top-govt-official/|title=Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge breakwater design scientific, reasonable and safe, says top gov't official {{!}} Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|date=2018-04-10|work=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent aerial footage posted online showed a section of the dolosse breakwater completely underwater. Civil engineer So Yiu-kwan told Hong Kong media on 12 April 2018 that the water level, at the time the photos were taken, was about 1.74 mPD (metres above Principal Datum), but the maximum water level could reach 2.7 mPD. He said the dolosse would offer no wave protection if entirely submerged, and further alleged that they had been installed backwards.&lt;ref name="underwaterhightide"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/04/12/sea-bridge-islands-breakwater-blocks-offer-no-protection-underwater-high-tide-says-veteran-engineer/|title=Sea bridge island’s breakwater blocks offer no protection as they are underwater at high tide, says veteran engineer|last1=Cheng|first1=Kris|date=12 April 2018|work=Hong Kong Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falling number of dolphins===
Conservationists at [[WWF Hong Kong]] blamed the construction of the HZMB for the falling number of [[Sousa chinensis|white dolphins]] in the waters near the bridge. The dolphins found near waters of [[Lantau]] were worst hit with numbers dropping by 60 per cent between April 2015 and March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Experts blame Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge for falling dolphin numbers |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/1990312/experts-blame-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau-bridge |accessdate=28 October 2018 |agency=SCMP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">The '''INF World Rankings''' are published by the [[International Netball Federation]] (INF) to make it possible to compare the relative strengths of internationally active national [[netball]] teams. Initially, rankings were based on the results from the [[World Netball Championships]], and released after the conclusion of each event, every four years. A new ranking system was implemented on 11 February 2008, wherein teams are ranked based on international [[Test match (netball)|tests]] played, currently since July 2010. Teams appear on the rankings list once they have played eight international test matches, starting from July 2010. The rankings are updated by the INF every month. Australia and New Zealand have dominated the INF world rankings in previous years and they are the only two netball nations to have ever held the number one world ranking since its introduction in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">'''Ideoscape''' is a term used to describe one of [[Arjun Appadurai]]’s five dimensions of global cultural flows. The five dimensions consist of [[ethnoscape]]s, [[mediascape]]s, [[technoscape]]s, [[Financescape|financescapes]], and '''ideoscapes'''. The suffix -''scape'' denotes that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, linguistic, and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: "[[nation-states]], multinationals, diasporic communities, as well as subnational groupings and movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy|date=1990|publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons, Ltd|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can either be religious, political, or economic. Because cultural exchange and transactions have typically been restricted in the past due to geographical and economical aspects, Appadurai’s five dimensions give the opportunity for cultural transactions to occur. '''Ideoscapes''' is the movement of ideologies. It is often political and usually has to do with the ideologies of states and the counterideologies of movements explicitly oriented to capturing state power or a piece of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lechner|first1=Frank|last2=Boli|first2=John|title=The Globalization Reader|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=978-1-118-73355-4|pages=94–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Ideoscapes''' are usually composed of ideas, terms, and images including “freedom, welfare, rights, sovereignty, representation, and democracy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy|date=1990|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==

The [[Directorate-General for External Security]] (DGSE) of France maintains a close relationship with both the NSA and the GCHQ after discussions for increased cooperation began in November 2006.&lt;ref name=frlemjac&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2013/11/29/la-france-precieux-partenaire-de-l-espionnage-de-la-nsa_3522653_651865.html |title=La France, précieux partenaire de l'espionnage de la NSA |author=Jacques Follorou |work=Le Monde |language=French |date=2013-11-29 |accessdate=2014-03-22 |archivedate=2013-11-30 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131130144856/http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2013/11/29/la-france-precieux-partenaire-de-l-espionnage-de-la-nsa_3522653_651865.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 2010s, the extent of cooperation in the joint interception of digital data by the DGSE and the NSA was noted to have increased dramatically.&lt;ref name=frlemjac /&gt;&lt;ref name="rfi-dgse-nsa-partnerschaft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfi.fr/ameriques/20131130-espionnage-services-secrets-francais-precieux-partenaires-nsa-americaine/?ns_campaign=google_choix_redactions&amp;ns_fee=0&amp;ns_linkname=ameriques.20131130-espionnage-services-secrets-francais-precieux-partenaires-nsa-americaine&amp;ns_mchannel=editors_picks&amp;ns_source=google_actualite |title=Espionnage: les services secrets français précieux partenaires de la NSA américaine |author=Radio France Internationale |work=Radio France Internationale |language=French |date=2013-11-29 |accessdate=2014-03-22 |archivedate=2014-03-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OH01RbbB?url=http://www.rfi.fr/ameriques/20131130-espionnage-services-secrets-francais-precieux-partenaires-nsa-americaine/?ns_campaign=google_choix_redactions&amp;ns_fee=0&amp;ns_linkname=ameriques.20131130-espionnage-services-secrets-francais-precieux-partenaires-nsa-americ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a formal [[memorandum]] for data exchange was signed by the DGSE and the NSA, which facilitated the transfer of millions of [[metadata]] records from the DGSE to the NSA.&lt;ref name="lemonde1" /&gt; In 2013, the existence of the Lustre treaty was revealed in documents leaked by the former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name="lemonde1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2013/10/30/surveillance-la-dgse-a-transmis-des-donnees-a-la-nsa-americaine_3505266_3210.html |title=Surveillance : la DGSE a transmis des données à la NSA américaine |author=Jacques Follorou |work=Le Monde |language=French |date=2013-10-30 |accessdate=2014-03-22 |archivedate=2013-11-01 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131101055116/http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2013/10/30/surveillance-la-dgse-a-transmis-des-donnees-a-la-nsa-americaine_3505266_3210.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scale of surveillance ==

The French telecommunications corporation [[Orange S.A.]] shares customer call data with the French intelligence agency DGSE, and the intercepted data is handed over to GCHQ.&lt;ref name="orangelemonde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2014/03/20/dgse-orange-des-liaisons-incestueuses_4386264_3210.html |title=Espionnage : comment Orange et les services secrets coopèrent |author=Jacques Follorou |work=Le Monde |language=French |date=2014-03-20 |accessdate=2014-03-20 |archivedate=2014-03-20 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140320120950/http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2014/03/20/dgse-orange-des-liaisons-incestueuses_4386264_3210.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 2012 to 8 January 2013, over 70 million [[metadata]] records were handed over to the NSA by French intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="lemonde1"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
'''Malnutrition''' is a condition that results from eating a [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] in which one or more [[nutrient]]s are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems.&lt;ref name=FFL2010&gt;{{cite book|title=Facts for life|date=2010|publisher=United Nations Children's Fund|location=New York|isbn=978-92-806-4466-1|pages=61 and 75|edition=4th|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Facts_for_Life_EN_010810.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dor2017&gt;{{DorlandsDict|five/000062745|malnutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may involve [[calories]], [[protein]], [[carbohydrates]], [[vitamin]]s or [[dietary element|mineral]]s.&lt;ref name="FFL2010" /&gt; Not enough nutrients is called '''undernutrition''' or '''undernourishment''' while too much is called [[overnutrition]].&lt;ref name=Young2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=E.M.|title=Food and development|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=9781135999414|pages=36–38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XhwKwNzJVjQC&amp;pg=PA36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malnutrition is often used to specifically refer to undernutrition where an individual is not getting enough calories, protein, or [[micronutrients]].&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones2011&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of International Health|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449667719|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lt7TqZPZSlIC&amp;pg=PA194}}&lt;/ref&gt; If undernutrition occurs during [[pregnancy]], or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development.&lt;ref name=FFL2010/&gt; Extreme undernourishment, known as [[starvation]], may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and [[abdomen]].&lt;ref name=FFL2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; People also often get infections and are frequently [[hypothermia|cold]].&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; The symptoms of [[micronutrient deficiencies]] depend on the micronutrient that is lacking.&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high-quality food being available to eat.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; This is often related to high food prices and [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=FFL2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; A lack of [[breastfeeding]] may contribute, as may a number of [[infectious diseases]] such as: [[gastroenteritis]], [[pneumonia]], [[malaria]], and [[measles]], which increase nutrient requirements.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; There are two main types of undernutrition: [[protein-energy malnutrition]] and dietary deficiencies.&lt;ref name=Jones2011/&gt; Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: [[marasmus]] (a lack of protein and calories) and [[kwashiorkor]] (a lack of just protein).&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of [[iron deficiency|iron]], [[iodine deficiency|iodine]], and [[vitamin A deficiency|vitamin A]].&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; During [[pregnancy]], due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Arora |editor-first1=Mala  |editor-last2=Konje |editor-first2=Justin C. |title=Recurrent pregnancy loss |date=2007 |publisher=Jaypee Bros.

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Efforts to improve [[nutrition]] are some of the most effective forms of [[development aid]].&lt;ref name=UK2012/&gt; Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children,&lt;ref name=FFL2010/&gt; and efforts to promote the practice increase the rates of breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=Bh2013/&gt; In young children, providing food (in addition to breastmilk) between six months and two years of age improves outcomes.&lt;ref name=Bh2013/&gt; There is also good evidence supporting the [[dietary supplements|supplementation]] of a number of micronutrients to women during pregnancy and among young children in the developing world.&lt;ref name=Bh2013/&gt; To get food to people who need it most, both delivering food and providing money so people can buy food within local markets are effective.&lt;ref name=UK2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Food Programme, Cash and Vouchers for Food|url=http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/communications/wfp246176.pdf|website=WFP.org|accessdate=July 5, 2014|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply feeding students at school is insufficient.&lt;ref name=UK2012/&gt; Management of severe malnutrition within the person's home with [[therapeutic food#Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food|ready-to-use therapeutic foods]] is possible much of the time.&lt;ref name=Bh2013/&gt; In those who have severe malnutrition complicated by other health problems, treatment in a hospital setting is recommended.&lt;ref name=Bh2013/&gt; This often involves managing [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]] and [[hypothermia|body temperature]], addressing [[dehydration]], and gradual feeding.&lt;ref name=Bh2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2003&gt;{{cite book|author= Ann Ashworth|title=Guidelines for the inpatient treatment of severely malnourished children|date=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-9241546096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Routine [[antibiotic]]s are usually recommended due to the high risk of infection.&lt;ref name=WHO2003/&gt; Longer-term measures include: improving agricultural practices,&lt;ref name=solcultivateplanet&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jonathan A.

Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, the term malnutrition refers to undernutrition for the remainder of this article. Malnutrition can be divided into two different types, SAM and MAM. SAM refers to children with severe acute malnutrition. MAM refers to moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sathish Subramanian |author2=Sayeeda Huq |author3=Tanya Yatsunenko |author4=Rashidul Haque |author5=Mustafa Mahfuz |author6=Mohammed A.

===Undernutrition and overnutrition===
Malnutrition is caused by eating a diet in which [[nutrient]]s are ''not enough'' or is ''too much'' such that it causes health problems.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a category of diseases that includes undernutrition and [[overnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO, nutrition experts take action on malnutrition |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/pressnote_action_on_malnutrition/en/|work=World Health Organization |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overnutrition can result in [[obesity]] and being [[overweight]]. In some [[developing countries]], overnutrition in the form of [[obesity]] is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress For Children: A Report Card On Nutrition|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Progress_for_Children_-_No._4.pdf|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term malnutrition is commonly used to refer to undernutrition only.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies particularly to the context of development cooperation. Therefore, "malnutrition" in documents by the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], [[Save the Children]] or other international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) usually is equated to undernutrition.

===Protein-energy malnutrition===

Undernutrition is sometimes used as a synonym of [[protein–energy malnutrition]] (PEM).&lt;ref name="Young2012" /&gt; While other include both [[micronutrient deficiencies]] and protein energy malnutrition in its definition.&lt;ref name="Jones2011" /&gt; It differs from [[calorie restriction]] in that calorie restriction may not result in negative health effects. The term hypoalimentation means underfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000051473|hypoalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "severe malnutrition" or "severe undernutrition" is often used to refer specifically to [[protein–energy malnutrition|PEM]].&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last3=Walker |editor-first3=W. Allan |editor-first=Christopher |editor-last=Duggan |editor-first2=John B. |editor-last2=Watkins |title=Nutrition in pediatrics: basic science, clinical application|year=2008|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton|isbn=978-1-55009-361-2|pages=127–141|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wSTISCdSIosC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nutrition+in+pediatrics+:+basic+science,+clinical+application#v=onepage&amp;q=Nutrition%20in%20pediatrics%20%3A%20basic%20science%2C%20clinical%20application&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; Two forms of PEM are [[kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]], and they commonly coexist.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt;

==== Kwashiorkor ====
[[Kwashiorkor]] is mainly caused by inadequate protein intake.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; The main symptoms are [[edema]], wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, steatosis, and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Kwashiorkor is further identified by swelling of the belly, which is deceiving of actual nutritional status.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt; The term means ‘displaced child’ and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa, means "the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born," as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="listeningga"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Listening to the Ga: Cicely Williams' Discovery of Kwashiorkor on the Gold Coast|author=Stanton J|year=2001|journal=Clio Medica: Studies in the History of Medicine and Health|volume=61|pages=149–71|pmid=11603151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marasmus====
[[Marasmus]] (‘to waste away’) is caused by an inadequate intake of protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe muscle wasting, and non-normal serum albumin levels.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; It is traditionally seen in famine, significant food restriction, or more severe cases of [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]].&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt;

===Undernutrition, hunger===
Undernutrition encompasses [[stunted growth]] (stunting), wasting, and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals (collectively referred to as micronutrients). The term [[hunger]], which describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating, has been used to describe undernutrition, especially in reference to food insecurity.&lt;ref name="Black2008" /&gt;

===Definition by Gomez===
In 1956, Gómez and Galvan studied factors associated with death in a group of malnourished (undernourished) children in a hospital in Mexico City, Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition: first, second, and third degree.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=R. D.|author2=Conaway, M. R.|title=Weight and Mortality Rates: "Gomez Classification" for Children With Cerebral Palsy?|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 2011|volume=128|issue=2|pages=e436–e437|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1472|pmid=21768321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age.&lt;ref name="Grover 2009" /&gt; The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011" /&gt; An adaptation of Gomez's original classification is still used today. While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations, the classification has been criticized for being "arbitrary" and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition. Also, height alone may not be the best indicator of malnutrition; children who are born prematurely may be considered short for their age even if they have good nutrition.&lt;ref name="Gueri 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gueri |first1=M.|author2=J. M. Gurney, P. Jutsum|title=The gomez classification.

===Definition by Waterlow===
[[John Waterlow|John Conrad Waterlow]] established a new classification for malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt; Instead of using just weight for age measurements, the classification established by Waterlow combines weight-for-height (indicating acute episodes of malnutrition) with height-for-age to show the stunting that results from chronic malnutrition.&lt;ref name="J. C. Waterlow"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watts|first=Geoff|title=John Conrad Waterlow|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2010|volume=376|issue=9757|pages=1982|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage of the Waterlow classification over the Gomez classification is that weight for height can be examined even if ages are not known.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt;

Lower energy and impaired function of the brain also represent the downward spiral of malnutrition as victims are less able to perform the tasks they need to in order to acquire food, earn an income, or gain an education.

[[Avitaminosis|Vitamin-deficiency-related diseases]] (such as [[scurvy]] and [[rickets]]).

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can result from a child not eating for 4 to 6 hours. Hypoglycemia should be considered if there is lethargy, limpness, convulsion, or loss of consciousness. If blood sugar can be measured immediately and quickly, perform a finger or heel stick.

[[File:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Union Army]] soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]], 1865]]
Major causes of malnutrition include poverty and food prices, dietary practices and agricultural productivity, with many individual cases being a mixture of several factors.  [[Clinical malnutrition]], such as [[cachexia]], is a major burden also in [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Various scales of analysis also have to be considered in order to determine the sociopolitical causes of malnutrition. For example, the population of a community that is within poor governments, may be at risk if the area lacks health-related services, but on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels, access to land, or levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fotso | first1 = J.

===Dietary practices===

==== Undernutrition ====
A lack of adequate breastfeeding leads to malnutrition in infants and children, associated with the deaths of an estimated one million children annually. Illegal advertising of breast milk substitutes contributed to malnutrition and continued three decades after its 1981 prohibition under the ''WHO International Code of Marketing Breast Milk Substitutes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=June 2012 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=529–32 |title=Marketing breast milk substitutes: problems and perils throughout the world |author=Brady JP |pmid=22419779 |pmc=3371222 |doi=10.1136/archdischild-2011-301299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal malnutrition can also factor into the poor health or death of a baby. Over 800,000 [[neonatal death]] have occurred because of deficient growth of the fetus in the mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/261533.php|title=Malnutrition Kills Over 3 Million Children Annually Worldwide|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deriving too much of one's diet from a single source, such as eating almost exclusively corn or rice, can cause malnutrition. This may either be from a lack of education about proper nutrition, or from only having access to a single food source.&lt;ref name=Burchi&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health |date=February 2011 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=358–73 |title=The role of food and nutrition system approaches in tackling hidden hunger |vauthors=Burchi F, Fanzo J, Frison E |pmid=21556191 |pmc=3084466 |doi=10.3390/ijerph8020358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not just the total amount of calories that matters but specific nutritional deficiencies such as [[vitamin A deficiency]], [[iron deficiency]] or [[zinc deficiency]] can also increase risk of death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNICEF (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2148 Improving Child Nutrition - The achievable imperative for global progress]. UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overnutrition ====
Overnutrition caused by [[overeating]] is also a form of malnutrition. In the United States, more than half of all adults are now overweight — a condition that, like hunger, increases susceptibility to disease and disability, reduces worker productivity, and lowers life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is much more common in the United States, where for the majority of people, access to food is not an issue. Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of non-nutritious food, in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles. Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a "[[toxic food environment]]" where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

The issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food. More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Gary|last2=Halweil|first2=Brian|year=2000|title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|journal=World Watch|volume=13|issue=4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does obesity occur in developed countries, problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist. In China, consumption of high-fat foods has increased while consumption of rice and other goods has decreased.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

Overeating leads to many diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, that may result in death.

===Poverty and food prices===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A child with extreme malnutrition]]

In Bangladesh, poor socioeconomic position was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, meat, poultry, and fruits.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=MM|author2=Kraemer, A|title=Factors associated with being underweight, overweight and obese among ever-married non-pregnant urban women in Bangladesh|journal=Singapore Medical Journal|date=August 2009|volume=50|issue=8|pages=804–13|pmid=19710981}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the [[FAO]] (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living in the developing world live in countries that produce food surpluses.&lt;ref name=Gardner00&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Gary |last2=Halweil |first2=Brian |title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess |journal=World Watch |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=24 |year=2000 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Amartya Sen]] observed that, in recent decades, famine has always been a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and [[famine]] were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.&lt;ref name=Sen81&gt;{{cite book |first=Amartya Kumar |last=Sen |title=Poverty and famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BzU_AwAAQBAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-828463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that commodity speculators are increasing the cost of food. As the real estate bubble in the United States was collapsing, it is said that trillions of dollars moved to invest in food and primary commodities, causing the 2007–2008 [[food price crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The role of speculators in the global food crisis |agency= |work= |newspaper=Spiegel Online |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,549187,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[biofuel]]s as a replacement for traditional fuels raises the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuel use increasing poverty |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= June 25, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7472532.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] special rapporteur on the right to food, [[Jean Ziegler]] proposes that agricultural waste, such as corn cobs and banana leaves, rather than crops themselves be used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuels 'crime against humanity' |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= October 27, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7065061.stm |first=Grant |last=Ferrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural productivity===
Local food shortages can be caused by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as [[crop rotation]], or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern [[agriculture]], such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[free market]] policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zambia: fertile but hungry |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= February 6, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm |first=Peter |last=Biles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, unaffordable food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;
Reasons for the unavailability of fertilizer include moves to stop supplying fertilizer on [[environmental movement|environmental]] grounds, cited as the obstacle to feeding Africa by the [[Green Revolution]] pioneers [[Norman Borlaug]] and Keith Rosenberg.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news |title=Forgotten benefactor of humanity |agency= |work= |newspaper=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future threats===
There are a number of potential disruptions to global food supply that could cause widespread malnutrition.

[[Global warming]] is of importance to food security, with 95 percent of all malnourished peoples living in the relatively stable climate region of the sub-tropics and tropics. According to the latest [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] reports, temperature increases in these regions are "very likely."&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite web |title= Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report |date=November 12–17, 2007 |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf |accessdate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even small changes in temperatures can lead to increased frequency of extreme weather conditions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt; Many of these have great impact on agricultural production and hence nutrition. For example, the 1998–2001 central Asian drought brought about an 80 percent livestock loss and 50 percent reduction in wheat and barley crops in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Battisti, David S. "Climate Change in Developing Countries." University of Washington. Seattle. October 27, 2008.{{vn|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar figures were present in other nations. An increase in extreme weather such as drought in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa would have even greater consequences in terms of malnutrition. Even without an increase of extreme weather events, a simple increase in temperature reduces the productivity of many crop species, also decreasing food security in these regions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Black, Richard |title=Rice yields falling under global warming |agency= |newspaper=BBC News; Science &amp; Environment |date=August 9, 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10918591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colony collapse disorder]] is a phenomenon where bees die in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aginfo.psu.edu/news/2007/1/HoneyBees.htm Honey Bee Die-Off Alarms Beekeepers, Crop growers and researchers]&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[list of crop plants pollinated by bees|many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees]], this represents a threat to the supply of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vanishing bees threaten US crops |newspaper=BBC News |date= March 11, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6438373.stm |first=Matt |last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===

{{Main|Food security}}
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the West, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, to Asia, called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in increased [[food production]] and corresponding decreases in prices and malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that are in short supply in Africa, such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Africa, prosperity from seeds falls short |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date= October 10, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investments in agriculture, such as subsidized fertilizers and seeds, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barclay, Eliza |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |agency= |work= |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=June 18, 2008 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the case of Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid. However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced against World Bank strictures, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; This lowered food prices and increased wages for farm workers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; Such investments in agriculture are still needed in other African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country has one of the highest  prevalence of malnutrition even though it is blessed with great agricultural potential John Ulimwengu explains in his article for D+C.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author=John Ulimwengu|title=Need in a land of planty |publisher= dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/spite-drcs-huge-agricultural-potential-many-people-lack-vital-nutrients|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents for investing in agriculture include [[Jeffrey Sachs]], who has championed the idea that wealthy countries should invest in fertilizer and seed for Africa’s farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama enlists major powers to aid poor farmers with $15 billion |agency= |work= The New York Times|newspaper= |date=July 9, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/europe/09food.html |first1=Peter |last1=Baker |first2=Celia W. |last2=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nigeria, the use of imported Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) has been used to treat malnutrition in the North. ''Soy Kunu'', a locally sourced and prepared blend consisting of peanut, millet and soya beans may also be used.&lt;ref name=Soykunu&gt;{{cite news |title=Severe Malnutrition, A Disturbance in Nigerian Health Sector |agency= |work= Public Health Nigeria|newspaper= |date=October 12, 2018 |url=https://publichealthng.com/severe-malnutrition-a-disturbance-in-nigerian-health-sector/ |first1=Obasi |last1=Chinedu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technology in agricultural production also has great potential to combat undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Jiming, Yeyun Xin and Longping Yuan. (2010). Pushing the Yield Frontier: Hybrid rice in China. In MillionsFed: Proved Success in Agriculture Development. Washington, DC: International Policy Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income as well as open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims to be part of the solution to malnutrition, asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.

===Economics===
There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html|title=UN aid debate: give cash not food?|date=June 4, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's [[World Food Program]], the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wfp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|title=Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots|date=December 8, 2008|publisher=World Food Programme|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|archivedate=February 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

However, for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets, delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt; [[Fred Cuny]] stated that "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development)&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law, which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live, is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport.&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients" /&gt; Cuny further pointed out "studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country — though not always in the immediate food deficit area" and "even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York), July 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]
[[Food bank]]s and [[soup kitchen]]s address malnutrition in places where people lack money to buy food.  A [[basic income]] has been proposed as a way to ensure that everyone has enough money to buy food and other basic needs; it is a form of [[social security]] in which all citizens or residents of a country regularly receive an unconditional sum of money, either from a government or some other public institution, in addition to any income received from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title = Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher = Government of Canada |year = 1994 |accessdate = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2|title=A model of African food aid is now in trouble|date=May 6, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5" /&gt;

===World population===

Restricting population size is a proposed solution. [[Thomas Malthus]] argued that population growth could be controlled by natural disasters and voluntary limits through "moral restraint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Thomas Robert |last1=Malthus |authorlink=Thomas Malthus |first2=Philip |last2= Appleman |title=An essay on the principle of population: text, sources and background, criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raGGQgAACAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-09202-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Chapman suggests that an intervention through government policies is a necessary ingredient of curtailing global population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = R. | title = No room at the inn, or why population problems are not all economic | journal = Population and Environment | volume = 21 | pages = 81–97 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/BF02436122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependence and complementarity of population growth with poverty and malnutrition (as well as the environment) is also recognised by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/environment/index.shtml|title=Environment - United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 million women worldwide do not have adequate access to family planning services. According to the World Health Organisation, "Family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception|title=Family planning/Contraception|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many who believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population. Instead, these theorists point to unequal distribution of resources and under- or unutilized arable land as the cause for malnutrition problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin, G. (1967). Population control and economic development. Paris: Dev Centers, OECD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, K. (1992). Global Justice, Capitalism and the Third World. (R. A. Wilkons, Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amartya Sen advocates that, "no matter how a famine is caused, methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the [[Public Distribution System|public distribution system]]. This applies not only to organizing rationing and control, but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation."&lt;ref name="Sen81" /&gt; 

===Food sovereignty===

{{Main|Food sovereignty}}
One suggested policy framework to resolve access issues is termed [[food sovereignty]]—the right of peoples to define their own food, agriculture, livestock, and fisheries systems, in contrast to having food largely subjected to international market forces. Food First is one of the primary think tanks working to build support for food sovereignty. Neoliberals advocate for an increasing role of the free market.

===Health facilities===

Another possible long term solution would be to increase access to health facilities to rural parts of the world. These facilities could monitor undernourished children, act as supplemental food distribution centers, and provide education on dietary needs. These types of facilities have already proven very successful in countries such as Peru and Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = H. R. | last2 = Penny | first2 = M.

As of 2016 is estimated that about 821,000 deaths of children less than five years old could be prevented globally per year through more widespread breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Lancet2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Victora|first1=CG|last2=Bahl|first2=R|last3=Barros|first3=AJ|last4=França|first4=GV|last5=Horton|first5=S|last6=Krasevec|first6=J|last7=Murch|first7=S|last8=Sankar|first8=MJ|last9=Walker|first9=N|date=January 30, 2016|title=Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect.|journal=Lancet|volume=387|issue=10017|pages=475–90|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01024-7|pmid=26869575|last10=Rollins|first10=NC|last11=Lancet Breastfeeding Series|first11=Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reducing infant death, breast milk feeding provides an important source of micronutrients, clinically proven to bolster the immune system of children, and provide long-term defenses against non-communicable and allergic diseases.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lessen|first=Rachelle|last2=Kavanagh|first2=Katherine|date=2015-03-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Promoting and Supporting Breastfeeding|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01876-0/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=115|issue=3|pages=444–449|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2014.12.014|pmid=25721389|issn=2212-2672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding has also been shown to improve cognitive abilities in children, with a strong correlation to individual educational achievements.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi Omobolanle|last2=Dagvadorj|first2=Amarjagal|last3=Anigo|first3=Kola Mathew|last4=Ota|first4=Erika|last5=Sasaki|first5=Satoshi|date=2015-10-01|title=Factors influencing breastfeeding exclusivity during the first 6 months of life in developing countries: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=433–451|doi=10.1111/mcn.12180|pmid=25857205|issn=1740-8709}}&lt;/ref&gt; As previously noted, lack of proper breastfeeding is a major factor in child mortality rates, and a primary determinant of disease development for children. The medical community recommends exclusively breastfeeding infants for 6 months, with nutritional whole food supplementation and continued breastfeeding up to 2 years or older for overall optimal health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Linda C.|last2=Milligan|first2=Renee A.|last3=Frick|first3=Kevin D.|last4=Spatz|first4=Diane|last5=Bronner|first5=Yvonne|date=2002-06-01|title=Breastfeeding Duration, Costs, and Benefits of a Support Program for Low-Income Breastfeeding Women|journal=Birth|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=95–100|doi=10.1046/j.1523-536X.2002.00169.x|pmid=12000411|issn=1523-536X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cai|first=Xiaodong|last2=Wardlaw|first2=Tessa|last3=Brown|first3=David W.|date=2012-09-28|title=Global trends in exclusive breastfeeding|journal=International Breastfeeding Journal|volume=7|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/1746-4358-7-12|pmid=23020813|pmc=3512504|issn=1746-4358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as only giving an infant breast milk for six months as a source of food and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; This means no other liquids, including water or semi-solid foods.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

==== Barriers to breastfeeding ====

Breastfeeding is noted as one of the most cost effective medical interventions for providing beneficial child health.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; While there are considerable differences within developed and developing countries: income, employment, social norms, and access to healthcare were found to be universal determinants of whether a mother breast or formula fed their children.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Community based healthcare workers have helped alleviate financial barriers faced by newly made mothers, and provided a viable alternative to traditional and expensive hospital based medical care.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Recent studies based upon surveys conducted from 1995-2010 shows exclusive breastfeeding rates have gone up globally, from 33% to 39%.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Despite the growth rates, medical professionals acknowledge the need for improvement given the importance of exclusive breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===Global initiatives===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger campaign|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.

Food security and global malnutrition has long been a topic of international concern, with one of the first official global documents addressing it being the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]](UDHR). Within this document it stated that access to food was part of an adequate right to a standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24|date=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Right to food]] was asserted in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], a [[treaty]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 16, 1966. The Right to food is a [[human rights|human right]] for people to feed themselves in dignity, be free from hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.righttofood.org/work-of-jean-ziegler-at-the-un/what-is-the-right-to-food/|title=What is the Right to Food? {{!}} Right to food|website=www.righttofood.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the treaty has been signed by 166 countries, by signing states agreed to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve the right to adequate food.

However, after the 1966 International Covenant the global concern for the access to sufficient food only became more present, leading to the first ever World Food Conference that was held in 1974 in Rome, Italy. The [[Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition]] was a UN resolution adopted November 16, 1974 by all 135 countries that attended the 1974 World Food Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-legally binding document set forth certain aspirations for countries to follow to sufficiently take action on the global food problem. Ultimately this document outline and provided guidance as to how the international community as one could work towards fighting and solving the growing global issue of malnutrition and hunger.

Adoption of the right to food was included in the [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional Protocols|Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]], this 1978 document was adopted by many countries in the Americas, the purpose of the document is, "to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and [[social justice]] based on respect for the essential rights of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/American_Convention/oashr.html|title=American Convention on Human Rights|website=www.hrcr.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next document in the timeline of global inititaves for malnutrition was the 1996 [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security]], organized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]. This document reaffirmed the right to have access to safe and nutritous food by everyone, also considering that everyone gets sufficient food, and set the goals for all nations to improve their commitment to food security by halfing their amount of undernourished people by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.htm|title=Rome Declaration and Plan of Action|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Food and Agriculture Organization adopted the  [[Right to Food Guidelines]], which offered states a framework of how to increase the right to food on a national basis.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx Outcome of the 2012 Copenhagen Consensus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], approved through the UN in 2015. In particular Goal 2: Zero hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/ Description and targets for Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition. 2015.

In June 2015, the [[European Union]] and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children. The program will initiatilly be implemented in Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos and Niger and will help these countries to improve information and analysis about nutrition so they can develop effective national nutrition policies.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Press release.

Accessed on 1 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the UN has created a partnership that will act through the [[African Union]]'s CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the right to food into national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015.

In response to child malnutrition, the [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi government]] recommends ten steps for treating severe malnutrition. They are to prevent or treat [[dehydration]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[hypothermia|low body temperature]], infection, correct electrolyte imbalances and micronutrient deficiencies, start feeding cautiously, achieve catch-up growth, provide psychological support, and prepare for discharge and follow-up after recovery.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

Among those who are hospitalized, nutritional support improves protein, calorie intake and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bally|first1=MR|last2=Blaser Yildirim|first2=PZ|last3=Bounoure|first3=L|last4=Gloy|first4=VL|last5=Mueller|first5=B|last6=Briel|first6=M|last7=Schuetz|first7=P|date=January 1, 2016|title=Nutritional Support and Outcomes in Malnourished Medical Inpatients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=1|pages=43–53|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.6587|pmid=26720894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
The evidence for benefit of supplementary feeding is poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sguassero|first1=Y|last2=de Onis|first2=M|last3=Bonotti|first3=AM|last4=Carroli|first4=G|date=Jun 13, 2012|title=Community-based supplementary feeding for promoting the growth of children under five years of age in low and middle income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD005039|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005039.pub3|pmid=22696347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the small amount of research done on this treatment.

Specially formulated foods do however appear useful in those from the developing world with moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Lazzer2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazzerini|first1=M|last2=Rubert|first2=L|last3=Pani|first3=P|date=Jun 21, 2013|title=Specially formulated foods for treating children with moderate acute malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009584|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009584.pub2|pmid=23794237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In young children with severe acute malnutrition it is unclear if [[ready-to-use therapeutic food]] differs from a normal diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoonees|first1=A|last2=Lombard|first2=M|last3=Musekiwa|first3=A|last4=Nel|first4=E|last5=Volmink|first5=J|date=Jun 6, 2013|title=Ready-to-use therapeutic food for home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children from six months to five years of age.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009000|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009000.pub2|pmid=23744450}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have some benefits in humanitarian emergencies as they can be eaten directly from the packet, do not require refrigeration or mixing with clean water, and can be stored for years.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8114750.stm|title=Firms target nutrition for the poor|last=Anderson|first=Tatum|date=June 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=BBC News|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those who are severely malnourished, feeding too much too quickly can result in [[refeeding syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Via2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Viana Lde|first1=A|last2=Burgos|first2=MG|last3=Silva Rde|first3=A|date=Jan–Mar 2012|title=Refeeding syndrome: clinical and nutritional relevance.|journal=Arquivos Brasileiros de Cirurgia Digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian Archives of Digestive Surgery|volume=25|issue=1|pages=56–9|pmid=22569981}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result regardless of route of feeding and can present itself a couple of days after eating with [[heart failure]], [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]]s and confusion that can result in death.&lt;ref name="Via2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boateng|first1=AA|last2=Sriram|first2=K|last3=Meguid|first3=MM|last4=Crook|first4=M|date=Feb 2010|title=Refeeding syndrome: treatment considerations based on collective analysis of literature case reports.|journal=Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)|volume=26|issue=2|pages=156–67|doi=10.1016/j.nut.2009.11.017|pmid=20122539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers are trying to fortify everyday foods with micronutrients that can be sold to consumers such as wheat flour for Beladi bread in Egypt or fish sauce in Vietnam and the iodization of salt.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

For example, flour has been fortified with iron, zinc, folic acid and other B vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin B12.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Micronutrients===
Treating malnutrition, mostly through [[food fortification|fortifying]] foods with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), improves lives at a lower cost and shorter time than other forms of [[aid]], according to the World Bank.&lt;ref name="IQ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/opinion/04kristof.html|title=Raising the world's IQ|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=December 4, 2008|work=The New York Times|newspaper=|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which look at a variety of development proposals, ranked micronutrient supplements as number one.&lt;ref name="hiddenhunger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/opinion/24kristof.html|title=The Hidden Hunger|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=May 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=New York Times|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/160075|title=Let them eat micronutrients|work=|newspaper=Newsweek|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those with diarrhea, once an initial four-hour rehydration period is completed, zinc supplementation is recommended. Daily zinc increases the chances of reducing the severity and duration of the diarrhea, and continuing with daily zinc for ten to fourteen days makes diarrhea less likely recur in the next two to three months.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)"&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], World Health Organization, 2005.  See especially Ch. 4 "Management of Acute Diarrhoea (Without Blood)" and Ch. 8 "Management of Diarrhoea With Severe Malnutrition."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, malnourished children need both potassium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh], Institute of Public Health Nutrition, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, May 2008, page 18 (19 in PDF) and following pages.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be obtained by following the above recommendations for the dehydrated child to continue eating within two to three hours of starting rehydration,&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; and including foods rich in potassium as above. [[Hypokalemia|Low blood potassium]] is worsened when base (as in Ringer's/Hartmann's) is given to treat acidosis without simultaneously providing potassium.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; As above, available home products such as salted and unsalted cereal water, salted and unsalted vegetable broth can be given early during the course of a child's diarrhea along with continued eating.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;  Vitamin A, potassium, magnesium, and zinc should be added with other vitamins and minerals if available.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

For a malnourished child with diarrhea from any cause, this should include foods rich in potassium such as bananas, green coconut water, and unsweetened fresh fruit juice.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;

===Diarrhea===
[[File:ORT saches.JPG|thumb|Examples of commercially available oral rehydration salts (Nepal on left, Peru on right).]]
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rehydrating a severely undernourished child who has diarrhea relatively slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called [[oral rehydration solution]] (ORS).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The oral rehydration solution is both slightly [[sweet]] and slightly [[salt]]y and the one recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; Fluids by [[nasogastric tube]] may be use in those who do not drink.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; [[Intravenous]] fluids are recommended only in those who have [[Shock (circulatory)|significant dehydration]] due to their potential complications.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; These complications include [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Over time, ORS developed into [[Oral rehydration therapy|ORT]], or [[oral rehydration therapy]], which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victora|first=Cesar|last2=Bryce|first2=Jennifer|date=Jan 2000|title=Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy|url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000001000010&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=e|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1246–1255|doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000001000010|pmid=|access-date=|doi-broken-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast feeding and eating should resume as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Drinks such as soft drinks, fruit juices, or sweetened teas are not recommended as they contain too much sugar and may worsen diarrhea.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf|title=The Treatment of diarrhoea : a manual for physicians and other senior health  workers.|date=2005|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=924159318 0|edition=4|location=Geneva|pages=8–16|chapter=4. Management of acute diarrhoea without blood}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broad spectrum antibiotic]]s are recommended in all severely undernourished children with diarrhea requiring admission to hospital.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

To prevent dehydration readily available fluids, preferably with a modest amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, unless there are signs of swelling.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4" /&gt; A severely malnourished child with what appears to be dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

For babies a dropper or syringe without the needle can be used to put small amounts of fluid into the mouth; for children under 2, a teaspoon every one to two minutes; and for older children and adults, frequent sips directly from a cup.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; After the first two hours, rehydration should be continued at the same or slower rate, determined by how much fluid the child wants and any ongoing diarrheal loses. After the first two hours of rehydration it is recommended that to alternate between rehydration and food.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

In 2003, WHO and UNICEF recommended a reduced-[[osmolarity]] ORS which still treats dehydration but also reduced stool volume and vomiting. Reduced-osmolarity ORS is the current standard ORS with reasonably wide availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4950e/2.4.html WHO Drug Information Vol. 16, No. 2, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehydrate.org/ors/low-osmolarity-ors.htm Low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS)], Rehydrate Project, updated: April 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For general use, one packet of ORS (glucose sugar, salt, potassium chloride, and trisodium citrate) is added to one liter of water; however, for malnourished children it is recommended that one packet of ORS be added to two liters of water along with an extra 50 grams of sucrose sugar and some stock potassium solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], WHO, 2005.  Specifically, 45 milliliters of potassium chloride solution from a stock solution containing 100g KCl per liter, along with one packet of ORS, ''&lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt;'' liters of water, and 50 grams of sucrose.  And please remember, sucrose has approximately twice the molecular weight of glucose, with one mole of glucose weighing 180 g and one mole of sucrose weighing 342 g.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malnourished children have an excess of body sodium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;  Recommendations for home remedies agree with one liter of water (34 oz.) and 6 teaspoons sugar and disagree regarding whether it is then one teaspoon of salt added or only 1/2, with perhaps most sources recommending 1/2 teaspoon of added salt to one liter water.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241592330.pdf "Guidelines for the control of shigellosis, including epidemics due to Shigella dysenteriae type 1".] World Health Organization, 2005, Annex 12 - Preparation of Home Made Oral Rehydration Solution, page 51 (57 in PDF): "Ingredients: Half a teaspoon of salt (2.5 grams), six level teaspoons of sugar (30 grams) and one litre of safe drinking water".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/treatment/con-20030056 "Dehydration, treatments and drugs."] Mayo Clinic January 7, 2011.

[[Hypoglycemia]], whether known or suspected, can be treated with a mixture of sugar and water. If the child is conscious, the initial dose of sugar and water can be given by mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh] recommends, for initial hypoglycemia, a 50 milliliter bolus of 10% glucose or sucrose.  This can also be achieved by added 1 rounded teaspoon of sugar to 10.5 teaspoons of water (which is 3.5 tablespoons of water).&lt;/ref&gt; If the child is unconscious, give glucose by [[intravenous]] or [[nasogastric tube]]. If seizures occur after despite glucose, rectal [[diazepam]] is recommended. Blood sugar levels should be re-checked on two hour intervals.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

===Hypothermia===
[[Hypothermia]] can occur. To prevent or treat this, the child can be kept warm with covering including of the head or by direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother or father and then covering both parent and child. Prolonged bathing or prolonged medical exams should be avoided. Warming methods are usually most important at night.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

The figures provided in this section on epidemiology all refer to ''undernutrition'' even if the term malnutrition is used which, by definition, could also apply to too much nutrition.

The [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) is a multidimensional statistical tool used to describe the state of countries’ hunger situation. The GHI measures progress and failures in the global fight against hunger.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8306556.stm |title= Global hunger worsening, warns UN |publisher= BBC (Europe) |date= 14 October 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GHI is updated once a year. The data from the 2015 report shows that Hunger levels have dropped 27% since 2000. Fifty two countries remain at serious or alarming levels. In addition to the latest statistics on Hunger and Food Security, the GHI also features different special topics each year. The 2015 report include an article on conflict and food security.&lt;ref&gt;K. von Grebmer, J. Bernstein, A. de Waal, N. Prasai, S. Yin, Y.

In 2010 [[protein-energy malnutrition]] resulted in 600,000 deaths down from 883,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lozano R, Naghavi M, Foreman K, etal |title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 |journal=Lancet |volume=380 |issue=9859 |pages=2095–128 |date=December 2012  |pmid=23245604 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0 |url=|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30050819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nutritional deficiencies, which include [[iodine deficiency]] and [[iron deficiency anemia]], result in another 84,000 deaths.&lt;ref name="Loz2012" /&gt; In 2010 malnutrition caused about 1.5 million deaths in women and children.&lt;ref name="Lim2012" /&gt;

Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of [[vitamin A]] or [[zinc]], for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition in the first two years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower education achievement. Their own children tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously{{when|date=September 2016}} seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

==History ==
Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often experienced sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, this resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. For the first few decades after [[World War II]], technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2000 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's people. According to the WFP some statistics are that, "Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. That's about one in nine people on earth. The vast majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished."&lt;ref name="wfp.org Hunger Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger Statistics|url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats|website=World Food Programme|publisher=wfp.org|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2006, the average international price of food had been largely stable for several decades. In the closing months of 2006, however, prices began to [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|rise rapidly]]. By 2008, rice had tripled in price in some regions, and this severely affected [[developing countries]]. Food prices fell in early 2009, but rose to another record high in 2011, and have since decreased slightly. The [[financial crisis of 2007–2012|2008 worldwide financial crisis]] further increased the number of people suffering from hunger, including dramatic increases even in advanced economies such as [[Great Britain]], the [[Eurozone]] and the [[United States]].

The [[Millennium Development Goals]] included a commitment to a further 50% reduction in the proportion of the world's population who have extreme hunger by 2015. As of 2012, this target appeared difficult to achieve, due in part to persistent inflation in food prices. However, in late 2012 the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) stated it is still possible to hit the target with sufficient effort. In 2013, the ''FAO'' estimated that 842 million people are undernourished (12% of the global population). Malnutrition is a cause of death for more than 3.1 million children under 5 every year. [[UNICEF]] estimates 300 million children go to bed hungry each night; and that 8000 children under the age of 5 are estimated to die of malnutrition every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/364_617.htm|author=Ernest C. Madu|title=Investment and Development Will Secure the Rights of the Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century and earlier===
Throughout history, the need to aid those suffering from hunger has been commonly, though not universally,&lt;ref&gt;As an example of historical opposition to food aid, during the [[Hungry Forties]], English [[Laissez-faire]] advocates were largely successful in preventing it being deployed by Great Britain to relief the Irish famine; see for example the section on "Ideology and relief"' in Chpt. 2 of ''The Great Irish Famine'' by [[Cormac Ó Gráda]].

For a detailed description of how views opposed to hunger relief became dominant within Great Britain's policy making circles during the 19th century, and also their subsequent displacement, see ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007) by James Vernon, esp. Chpts. 1–3. In 2012, advocates of small government spoke out against the US food stamp programme, saying it discourages people from fending for themselves, in the same way as it is not always a good idea to feed hungry wild animals. ( See [http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/07/14/4099922/food-stamp-debate-brings-out-the.html Food stamp debate brings out the haters] published by the ''Star Telegram''. )&lt;/ref&gt; recognized.

The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when you have resources to do so is the most obvious of all human [[Moral obligation|obligations]]. She says that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], many believed that people had to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Weil writes that [[Social progress]] is commonly held to be first of all, "...a transition to a state of human society in which people will not suffer from hunger." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=The Need for Roots|page = 6|year=2002 |orig-year= 1942|isbn=978-0-415-27102-8|publisher = [[Routledge]]|title-link=The Need for Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organization in the 19th century, most human societies would either starve all together or not at all, because communities would invariably share their food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Karl Polanyi]] | title = The Great Transformation | year = 2002 |orig-year=1942 | chapter = chpt. 4  | isbn = 978-0-8070-5643-1  | publisher=Beacon Press | title-link = The Great Transformation (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first age of globalization, which began in the 19th century, it became more common for people to consider problems like hunger in global terms. However, as early globalization largely coincided with the high peak of influence for [[classical liberalism]], there was relatively little call for politicians to address world hunger.&lt;ref&gt;For further info see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom#Attitudes towards hunger relief]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There were many exceptions. For example, in ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007), James Vernon describes dozens of 18th and 19th century campaigners who spoke in favor of hunger relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the view that politicians ought not to intervene against hunger was increasingly challenged by campaigning journalists, with some academics and politicians also calling for or organizing intervention against world hunger, such as U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"&gt;{{cite book |author = James Vernon|title=Hunger: A Modern History |chapter = Chpts. 1-3|year= 2007|isbn=978-0674026780 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"&gt;{{cite journal|author = David Grigg|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945–1980|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1981

===Great Depression===
[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|210px|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in Chicago, 1931|upright=1.15]]
Hunger as an academic and social topic came to prominence during the [[Great Depression]]. As many individuals struggled for food, the same agricultural industries were suddenly producing large surpluses as means of increased production to counter the drop in demand from the European markets. This increased output was meant to ease the growing debt levels, however domestic demand could not keep up with prices. Instead, what is often called "the paradox of want amid plenty," agricultural surpluses and large demand simply did not fit together, causing the Hoover administration to buy large amounts of product, such as grain, to stabilize prices. Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the allocation of large grain surpluses, waste became the eventual driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Janet Poppendieck | title = Eating Agendas | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-202-30508-0 | publisher=Aldine Transaction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Martin Luther King]] (center), one of many twentieth century political figures who considered it important to fight hunger: "When I die, don't build a monument to me. Don't bestow me degrees from great universities. Just clothe the naked. Say that I tried to house the homeless. Let people say that I tried to feed the hungry." &lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;]]
After World War II, a new international politico-economic order came into being, which was later described as [[Embedded liberalism]].

For at least the first decade after the war, the United States, by far the period's most dominant national actor, was strongly supportive of efforts to tackle world hunger and to promote international development. It heavily funded the United Nation's development programmes, and later the efforts of other multilateral organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB).&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"&gt;{{cite book |author = John R. Butterly and Jack Shepherd |title=Hunger: The Biology and Politics of Starvation|year= 2010|isbn=978-1584659266 |publisher= Dartmouth College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly established United Nations became a leading player in co-ordinating the global fight against hunger. The UN has three agencies that work to promote food security and agricultural development: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD). FAO is the world's agricultural knowledge agency, providing policy and technical assistance to developing countries to promote food security, nutrition and sustainable agricultural production, particularly in rural areas.

WFP's key mission is to deliver food into the hands of the hungry poor. The agency steps in during [[emergencies]] and uses food to aid recovery after emergencies. Its longer term approaches to hunger helps the transition from recovery to development. IFAD, with its knowledge of rural poverty and exclusive focus on poor rural people, designs and implements programmes to help those people access the assets, services and opportunities they need to overcome poverty.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

Following successful post WWII reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the IMF and WB began to turn their attention to the developing world. A great many [[NGO|civil society actors]] were also active in trying to combat hunger, especially after the late 1970s when global media began to bring the plight of starving people in places like [[Ethiopia]] to wider attention.  Most significant of all, especially in the late 1960s and 70s, the [[Green revolution]] helped improved agricultural technology propagate throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

The United States began to change its approach to the problem of world hunger from about the mid 1950s. Influential members of the administration became less enthusiastic about methods they saw as promoting an over reliance on the state, as they feared that might assist the spread of communism. Despite this view, during the 1960s postwar era hunger within the United States was overshadowed by hunger in Europe and Asia. John F. Kennedy did in fact use Executive Order to double the amount of commodities available from the surplus commodity program as well as initiated the pilot Food Stamp Program which later became permanent in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Donna|last2=Poppendieck|first2=Janet|title=Eating agendas : food and nutrition as social problems|date=1995|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=9780202305073|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
By the 1980s, the previous consensus in favour of moderate government intervention had been [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displaced across the western world.]] The IMF and World Bank in particular began to promote market-based solutions. In cases where countries became dependent on the IMF, they sometimes forced national governments to prioritize debt repayments and sharply cut public services. This sometimes had a negative effect on efforts to combat hunger.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"/&gt;
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|left|Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the [[Green Revolution]].]]
Organizations such as [[Food First]] raised the issue of [[food sovereignty]] and claimed that every country on earth (with the possible minor exceptions of some city-states) has sufficient agricultural capacity to feed its own people, but that the "[[free trade]]" economic order, which from the late 1970s to about 2008 had been associated with such institutions as the IMF and World Bank, had prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The World Bank itself claimed it was part of the solution to hunger, asserting that the best way for countries to break the cycle of poverty and hunger was to build export-led economies that provide the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market. However, in the early 21st century the World Bank and IMF became less dogmatic about promoting [[free market]] reforms. They increasingly returned to the view that government intervention does have a role to play, and that it can be advisable for governments to support food security with policies favourable to domestic agriculture, even for countries that do not have a [[Comparative advantage]] in that area. As of 2012, the World Bank remains active in helping governments to intervene against hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/07/30/food-price-volatility-growing-concern-world-bank-stands-ready-respond|title=Food Price Volatility a Growing Concern, World Bank Stands Ready to Respond|publisher= [[World Bank]]|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until at least the 1980s—and, to an extent, the 1990s—the dominant academic view concerning world hunger was that it was a problem of demand exceeding supply. Proposed solutions often focused on boosting food production, and sometimes on birth control. There were exceptions to this, even as early as the 1940s, [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|Lord Boyd-Orr]], the first head of the UN's FAO, had perceived hunger as largely a problem of distribution, and drew up comprehensive plans to correct this. Few agreed with him at the time, however, and he resigned after failing to secure support for his plans from the US and Great Britain. In 1998, [[Amartya Sen]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in part for demonstrating that hunger in modern times is not typically the product of a lack of food. Rather, hunger usually arises from food distribution problems, or from governmental policies in the developed and developing world. It has since been broadly accepted that world hunger results from issues with the distribution as well as the production of food.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"&gt;[[Harry Magdoff#Death|Fred Magdoff]], [https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs - Accumulation by Agricultural Dispossession], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', 2013, Volume 65, Issue 06 (November)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"&gt;Rahul Goswami, [http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/goswami041212.html For Whom Do the FAO and Its Director-General Work?], ''[[Monthly Review|Monthly Review Magazine]]'', 2012.12.04&lt;/ref&gt;  Sen's 1981 essay ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' played a prominent part in forging the new consensus.&lt;ref name="foodAndFamine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= John Baylis, Steve Smith and Patricia Owens |author = Caroline Thomas and Tony Evans|title=The Globalization of World Politics|chapter = "Poverty, development and hunger"|year= 2010|isbn=978-0199569090 |publisher= [[Oxford University press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2007 and 2008, rapidly increasing food prices caused a ''global food crisis'', increasing the numbers suffering from hunger by over a hundred million. [[Food riot]]s erupted in several dozen countries; in at least two cases, [[Haiti]] and [[Madagascar]], this led to the toppling of governments. A second ''global food crisis'' unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food stock piles for relief. However, several analysts argue the food crisis was one of the causes of the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name="Politics of hunger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G202012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"&gt;{{cite news|

As of 2008 roughly $300 million of aid went to basic nutrition each year, less than $2 for each child below two in the 20 worst affected countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In contrast, at that time [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], which caused fewer deaths than child malnutrition, received $2.2 billion—$67 per person with HIV in all countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In 2008 UN estimated that ending world hunger could cost about 30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/news/04iht-04food.13446176.html|title=UN says solving food crisis could cost $30 billion|first=Elisabeth Rosenthal and Andrew|last=Martin|date=2008-06-04|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]), a member of the [[CGIAR]] consortium, partners with farmers, governments, researchers and NGOs to help farmers grow nutritious crops, such as [[chickpea]], [[groundnut]], [[pigeonpea]], [[millet]] and [[sorghum]]. This helps their communities have more balanced diets and become more resilient to pests and drought. The Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian-Subcontinent (HOPE) project, for example, is increasing yields of [[eleusine coracana|finger millet]] in [[Tanzania]] by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties. Finger millet is very high in calcium, rich in iron and fiber, and has a better energy content than other cereals. These characteristics make it ideal for feeding to infants and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Alina Paul Bossuet, ''Nourishing Communities Through Holistic Farming'' {{cite web|url=http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}.

Some organizations have begun working with teachers, policymakers, and managed food service contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university-level institutions. Health and nutrition have been proven to have close links with overall educational success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/wbro/11.1.23|jstor=3986477|title=The Impact of Health and Nutrition on Education|author=Jere R.

In the early 21st century, there was relatively little awareness of hunger from leaders of advanced nations such as those that form the [[G8]].&lt;ref name="G202012"/&gt; Prior to 2009, efforts to fight hunger were mainly undertaken by governments of the worst affected countries, by civil society actors, and by multilateral and regional organizations. In 2009, Pope Benedict published his third encyclical, [[Caritas in Veritate]], which emphasised the importance of fighting against hunger. The encyclical was intentionally published immediately before the [[35th G8 summit|July 2009 G8 Summit]] to maximise its influence on that event. At the Summit, which took place at [[L'Aquila]] in central Italy, the ''L'Aquila Food Security Initiative'' was launched, with a total of US$22 billion committed to combat hunger.&lt;ref&gt;

Food prices did fall sharply in 2009 and early 2010, though analysts credit this much more to farmers increasing production in response to the 2008 spike in prices, than to the fruits of enhanced government action. However, since the 2009 G8 summit, the fight against hunger has remained a high-profile issue among the leaders of the worlds major nations, and was a prominent part of the agenda for the [[2012 G-20 Mexico summit|2012 G-20 summit]].&lt;ref name="G202012"&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome - Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2012, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] launched a "new alliance for food security and nutrition"—a broad partnership between private sector, governmental and civil society actors—that aimed to "...achieve sustained and inclusive agricultural growth and raise 50 million people out of poverty over the next 10 years."&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2343978/uk_aid_is_financing_a_corporate_scramble_for_africa.html UK 'aid' is financing a corporate scramble for Africa], Miriam Ross, ''[[The Ecologist]]'', 2014.04.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "2012G8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity/190282.htm G8 Action on Food Security and Nutrition] 2012 statement hosted by the US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/18/remarks-president-symposium-global-agriculture-and-food-security Remarks by President concerning the launch of the ''new alliance for food security and nutrition'']&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's prime minister [[David Cameron]] held a [[2012 Olympic hunger summit|hunger summit]] on 12 August, the last day of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="2012G8"/&gt;

The fight against hunger has also been joined by an increased number of regular people. While folk throughout the world had long contributed to efforts to alleviate hunger in the developing world, there has recently been a rapid increase in the numbers involved in tackling domestic hunger even within the economically advanced nations of the [[Global North]].

This had happened much earlier in North America than it did in Europe. In the US, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration scaled back welfare the early 1980s, leading to a vast increase of charity sector efforts to help Americans unable to buy enough to eat. According to a 1992 survey of 1000 randomly selected US voters, 77% of Americans had contributed to efforts to feed the hungry, either by volunteering for various hunger relief agencies such as [[food banks]] and [[soup kitchen]]s, or by donating cash or food.&lt;ref&gt;

Europe, with its more generous welfare system, had little awareness of domestic hunger until the food price inflation that began in late 2006, and especially as austerity-imposed welfare cuts began to take effect in 2010. Various surveys reported that upwards of 10% of Europe's population had begun to suffer from food insecurity. Especially since 2011, there has been a substantial increase in grass roots efforts to help the hungry by means of food banks, within both the UK and continental Europe.&lt;ref name = "modell"&gt;{{cite news  |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nqcbm |title= Britain's hidden hunger |publisher= [[BBC]] |author= [[David Model (journalist)|David Model]] |date = 30 October 2012 |accessdate= 4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

By July 2012, the [[2012 US drought]] had already caused a rapid increase in the price of grain and soy, with a knock on effect on the price of meat. As well as affecting hungry people in the US, this caused prices to rise on the global markets; the US is the world's biggest exporter of food. This led to much talk of a possible third 21st century global food crisis. The ''Financial Times'' reported that the [[BRICS]] may not be as badly affected as they were in the earlier crises of 2008 and 2011. However, smaller developing countries that must import a substantial portion of their food could be hard hit. The UN and [[G20]] has begun contingency planning so as to be ready to intervene if a third global crisis breaks out.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US drought"&gt;

Older sources sometimes claim this phenomenon is unique to developing countries, due to greater sexual inequality. More recent findings suggested that mothers often miss meals in advanced economies too. For example, a 2012 study undertaken by [[Netmums]] in the UK found that one in five mothers sometimes misses out on food to save their children from hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide

In several periods and regions, gender has also been an important factor determining whether or not victims of hunger would make suitable examples for generating enthusiasm for hunger relief efforts. James Vernon, in his ''Hunger: A Modern History'', wrote that in Britain before the 20th century, it was generally only women and children suffering from hunger who could arouse compassion. Men who failed to provide for themselves and their families were often regarded with contempt. This changed after [[World War I]], where thousands of men who had proved their manliness in combat found themselves unable to secure employment. Similarly, female gender could be advantageous for those wishing to advocate for hunger relief, with Vernon writing that being a woman helped [[Emily Hobhouse]] draw the plight of hungry people to wider attention during the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"/&gt;

Studies on nutrition concerning gender bias within households look at patterns of food allocation, and one study from 2003 suggested that women often receive a lower share of food requirements than men.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Gender discrimination, gender roles, and social norms affecting women can lead to early marriage and childbearing, close birth spacing, and undernutrition, all of which contribute to malnourished mothers.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh" /&gt;

Within the household, there may be differences in levels of malnutrition between men and women, and these differences have been shown to vary significantly from one region to another, with problem areas showing relative deprivation of women.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Samples of 1000 women in India in 2008 demonstrated that malnutrition in women is associated with poverty, lack of development and awareness, and illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; The same study showed that gender discrimination in households can prevent a woman's access to sufficient food and healthcare.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; How socialization affects the health of women in Bangladesh, Najma Rivzi explains in an article about a research program on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Najma Rizvi |publisher=dandc.eu |title=Enduring misery |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/bangladesh-does-not-guarantee-food-security-demanded-its-constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as in parts of Kenya in 2006, rates of malnutrition in pregnant women were even higher than rates in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Rachel Bonham|title=Survey Reveals High Malnutrition Rates Among Pregnant Women in Kenya|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_33782.html|publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in some societies are traditionally given less food than men since men are perceived to have heavier workloads.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;  Household chores and agricultural tasks can in fact be very arduous and require additional energy and nutrients; however, physical activity, which largely determines energy requirements, is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Physiology====
Women have unique nutritional requirements, and in some cases need more nutrients than men; for example, women need twice as much calcium as men.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Nutrition 2001|url=https://www.uthfa.com/gender-nutrition-2001/|publisher=Food and Agriculture of the United Nations |accessdate=August 22, 2016|date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pregnancy and breastfeeding====
During pregnancy and breastfeeding, women must ingest enough nutrients for themselves and their child, so they need significantly more protein and calories during these periods, as well as more vitamins and minerals (especially iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K).&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in [[developing countries]] and increased the risk of death during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105,000 maternal deaths (23.6 percent of all maternal deaths).&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhutta | first1 = Z.

Frequent pregnancies with short intervals between them and long periods of breastfeeding add an additional nutritional burden.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Educating children====
According to the FAO, women are often responsible for preparing food and have the chance to educate their children about beneficial food and health habits, giving mothers another chance to improve the nutrition of their children.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5678">:''Not to be confused with ''[[Macworld]]'', the periodical dedicated to Apple Macintosh products''

'''McWorld''' is a term referring to the spreading of [[McDonald's]] restaurants throughout the world as the result of [[globalization]], and more generally to the effects of international '[[McDonaldization]]' of services and [[commercialization]] of goods as an element of globalization as a whole. The name also refers to a 1990s advertising campaign for McDonald's, and to a children's website launched by the firm in 2008.

== Globalization-related term ==
Critics claim that [[fast food]] chain restaurants such as McDonald's are destructive towards many aspects of the indigenous cultures in countries where they have been introduced.

In March 1992, an article first published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' by [[Rutgers]] [[political science]] professor [[Benjamin Barber]] entitled "[[Jihad vs. McWorld]]", described international commercialization as one of two great clashing forces of the 21st century, the other being tribalistic [[fundamentalism]]. According to his writing, there are four imperatives which constitute the McWorld: a market imperative, a resource imperative, an [[information technology]] imperative, and an ecological imperative. The four imperatives are transnational, transideological, [[transculturation|transcultural]] and [[ecology|ecological]]. The contracting idea of McWorld, the Jihad, unlike those four imperatives, stress identity of each community.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin R. Barber. (1992, March). "Jihad vs. McWorld," ''The Atlantic'' 269(3): 53-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clashing forces results from what Barber explains as the two core doctrines of our age: globalism and retribalization. It was expanded and published in 1995, and became a bestselling book.&lt;ref name="barber"&gt;[[Benjamin Barber|Barber, Benjamin R.]] ''[[Jihad vs. McWorld]]: How Globalism and Tribalism Are Reshaping the World.'' Hardcover: Crown, 1995, {{ISBN|0-8129-2350-2}}; Paperback: Ballantine Books, 1996, {{ISBN|0-345-38304-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
McWorld does not necessarily relate to democracy. It cares about the elements of democracy, but only to the degree that it promotes economic production and consumption.
In the book, Barber explains that liberalization of nation state oriented markets to a globalized market does not seem democratic. [[Democracy]] and [[liberal capitalism]] are terms commonly used as a correlation; how democracy leads to capitalist economy and vice versa. However Barber argues that [[multinational corporation]]s pursuing profits outside their home country due to competition has less correlation with [[open society]].

A 1999 book entitled ''Mustard Seed Versus McWorld'' by [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[minister of religion|minister]] Tom Sine implores [[Christians]] to reject the diminution of religious values that he contends results from excessive commercialization.&lt;ref name="sine"&gt;Sine, Tom. ''Mustard Seed Versus McWorld.'' 1999. {{ISBN|0-8010-9088-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1990s advertising campaign ==
The name McWorld was originally the name of a TV campaign for the restaurant by [[Leo Burnett]] that ran many of its ads during [[Saturday morning cartoons]] and on other television channels and programming blocks targeted toward children in the United States in the mid 1990s. The adverts featured the exciting McDonald's-related happenings that would purportedly occur if children ran the world.&lt;ref name="hood"&gt;Hood, Duncan. [http://www.kidscreen.com/articles/magazine/19990301/24619.html?print=yes "Revenge of the tweens"]. ''KidScreen Magazine'', March 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; These included fantasies such as having gym class every period in school and eating McDonald's at every meal.  In addition to planet Earth, McWorld ads featured children ruling school, space, and other arenas typically dominated by an adult [[hegemony]]; adults were portrayed as inferior and ineffective.  Memorably, each spot concluded with the phrase, "McWORLD! Hey, it could happen!", as a guitar chord played in the background.  One such spot won a [[Golden Marble Award]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="selling"&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FVE/is_19_3/ai_53015132 "'Raccoon' takes home awards for Hostess, Mithun Esty".] bill 'Selling to Kids', September 16, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2008 website ==
McWorld was also the name of an interactive "virtual world" website launched by [[McDonald's]] in 2008 on [http://happymeal.com happymeal.com], and aimed at children. Visitors to the website could play games, go on quests, earn points and buy accessories for their treehouses and avatars (called "mPals"). The website shut down on February 7, 2014 and was replaced by McPlay.

While the McWorld website bore some similarities to the ideas in the original McWorld campaign, such as children being in charge, it is an essentially distinct concept, created independently for a younger age group. McWorld was named by a vote of kids on happymeal.com.&lt;ref name="mcworldvw"&gt;[http://vw.happymeal.com/en_US/ McWorld: It's a kid's world where kids rule.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212230549/http://vw.happymeal.com/en_US/ |date=2009-02-12 }} McDonald's Corporation, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">'''Military [[globalization]]''' is defined by [[David Held]] as “the process which embodies the growing extensity and intensity of military relations among the political units of the [[world system]]. Understood as such, it reflects both the expanding network of worldwide military ties and relations, as well as the impact of [[history of military technology|key military technological innovations]] (from [[steamship]]s to [[satellite]]s), which over time, have reconstituted the world into a single [[geostrategic]] space."&lt;ref name=held&gt;David Held, Anthony McGrew, David Goldblatt &amp; Jonathan Perraton. (1999). ''Global Transformations; Politics, Economics and Culture'', Cambridge Polity Press, p 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Military globalization implies firmer integration of [[armed forces]] around the world into the global military system. For [[Robert Keohane]] and [[Joseph Nye]] military globalization entails “long-distance networks of interdependence in which force, and the threat or promise of force, are employed.”&lt;ref&gt;Robert Keohane &amp; Joseph Nye. (2002). ''Power and Interdependence'', Boston: Little, Brown and Co, p 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Held&lt;ref&gt;''Global Transformations'', p 89.&lt;/ref&gt; divides the military globalization into three distinct phenomena: 

#The globalization of the war system. This refers to the “[[geopolitical]] order, [[great power]] rivalry, conflict and security relations.”
#The global system of [[arms industry|arms production]] and transfers, reflected in the global arms dynamics.
#The geo-governance of violence, “embracing the formal and informal international regulation of the acquisition, deployment and use of military force.”

All three processes above “are connected to technological development, which made them possible in the first place. The result is increasing global interdependence and complexity."&lt;ref&gt;Armin Krishnan. (2008). ''Wars as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting'', London &amp; New York: Routledge, p 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of military globalization starts with the [[Age of Discovery]], when the [[European colonial empires]] began military operations on the global scale. Their "[[imperial rivalry]] led to the [[First World War]], which was the first [[global conflict]] in world history."&lt;ref&gt;''Wars as Business'', p 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Keohane dates military globalization at least from the time of the [[conquests of Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Keohane. (2002). ''Power and Governance in a Partially Globalized World'', London &amp; New York: Routledge, p 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modern history''', the '''modern period''' or the '''modern era''', is the linear, global, [[historiography|historiographical]] approach to the time frame after [[post-classical history]].&lt;ref&gt;Intrinsic to the [[English language]], "modern" denotes (in reference to history) a period that is opposed to either ancient or medieval; modern history is the history of the world since the end of the Middle Ages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaNDmZBcNGQC&amp;pg=PA3814|title=The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia|publisher=|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern history can be further broken down into periods:

In the pre-modern era, many people's sense of self and purpose was often expressed via a [[faith]] in some form of [[deity]], be it that in a single [[God]] or in many [[gods]].&lt;ref&gt;Tirosh-Samuelson, H.

===Modern===

The term ''modern'' was coined in the 16th century to indicate present or recent times (ultimately derived from the Latin adverb ''modo'', meaning "just now").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/modern|website=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European [[Renaissance]] (c. 1420–1630), which marked the transition between the [[Late Middle Ages]] and Early Modern times, started in Italy and was spurred in part by the rediscovery of [[classical antiquity|classical]] art and literature, as well as the new perspectives gained from the [[Age of Discovery]] and the invention of the [[telescope]] and [[microscope]], expanding the borders of thought and knowledge.

In contrast to the pre-modern era, [[Western world|Western civilization]] made a gradual transition from pre-modernity to modernity when [[scientific method]]s were developed which led many to believe that the use of science would lead to all knowledge, thus throwing back the shroud of [[mythology|myth]] under which pre-modern peoples lived. New information about the world was discovered via [[empirical observation]],&lt;ref&gt;Baird, F.E., &amp; Kaufmann, W.A. (2008). ''Philosophic classics: From Plato to Derrida''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; versus the historic use of [[reason]] and [[innate knowledge]].

The term ''Early Modern'' was introduced in the English language in the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;''New Dictionary of the History of ideas'', Volume 5, Detroit 2005. Modernism and Modern&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish the time between what has been called the [[Middle Ages]] and time of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (1800) (when the meaning of the term ''Modern Ages'' was developing its contemporary form). It is important to note that these terms stem from European history. In usage in other parts of the world, such as in Asia, and in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]], the terms are applied in a very different way, but often in the context with their contact with European culture in the Age of Discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_14.html|title=Islamic Culture and the Medical Arts: Late Medieval and Early Modern Medicine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary ===

{{Main|Contemporary history}}
In the Contemporary era, there were various socio-technological trends. Regarding the 21st century and the late modern world, the [[Information Age]] and computers were forefront in use, not completely ubiquitous but often present in everyday life. The development of Eastern powers was of note, with China and India becoming more powerful. In the Eurasian theater, the [[European Union]] and [[Russia|Russian Federation]] were two forces recently developed. A concern for Western world, if not the whole world, was the late modern form of terrorism and the warfare that has resulted from the contemporary terrorist acts.

== Modern era ==
=== Significant developments ===

The modern period has been a period of significant development in the fields of [[science]], [[politics]], [[warfare]], and [[technology]]. It has also been an [[age of discovery]] and [[globalization]]. During this time, the [[power (international)|European powers]] and later their colonies, began a political, economic, and cultural [[colonization]] of the rest of the world.

By the late 19th and 20th centuries, [[modernist]] art, politics, science and culture has come to dominate not only [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]], but almost every civilized area on the globe, including movements thought of as opposed to the west and globalization. The modern era is closely associated with the development of [[individualism]],&lt;ref name="NCEref"&gt;''National, cultural, and ethnic identities: harmony beyond conflict'' by Jaroslav Hroch, David Hollan&lt;/ref&gt; [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;''Capitalism and modernity: the great debate'' by Jack Goody&lt;/ref&gt; [[urbanization]]&lt;ref name="NCEref" /&gt; and a belief in the possibilities of technological and political [[Progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m9Ha1fmAXk4C ''Progress and its discontents''] American Academy of Arts and Sciences. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ov86j30F96EC&amp;pg=PA297 Technology and politics]." Western Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A companion to the philosophy of technology'' by Jan-Kyrre Berg Olsen, Stig Andur Pedersen, Vincent F. Hendricks&lt;/ref&gt;

Wars and other perceived problems of this era, many of which come from the effects of rapid change, and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms, have led to many reactions against modern development.&lt;ref&gt;''Marx, Durkheim, Weber: formations of modern social thought'' by Kenneth L. Morrison. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Schweiker, ''The Blackwell companion to religious ethics''. 2005. p. 454. (cf., "In modernity, however, much of economic activity and theory seemed to be entirely cut off from religious and ethical norms, at least in traditional terms. Many see modern economic developments as entirely secular.")&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism and belief in constant progress has been most recently criticized by [[postmodernism]] while the dominance of Western Europe and [[Anglo-America]] over other continents has been criticized by [[postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]].

One common conception of modernity is the condition of Western history since the mid-15th century, or roughly the European development of [[movable type]]&lt;ref&gt;''Early European History'' by [[Henry Kitchell Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;''The European Reformations'' by [[Carter Lindberg]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context the "modern" society is said to develop over many periods, and to be influenced by important events that represent breaks in the continuity.&lt;ref&gt;''The new Cambridge modern history: Companion volume'' by Peter Burke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Plains Indian History and Culture: Essays on Continuity and Change'' by John C. Ewers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Weber, irrationality, and social order'' by Alan Sica&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early ====
{{Main|Early modern period}}
The modern era includes the early period, called the early modern period, which lasted from c. 1500 to around c. 1800 (most often 1815). Particular facets of early modernity include:
* The [[Renaissance]]
* The [[Protestant reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter Reformation]].
* The [[Age of Discovery]]
* The Rise of [[capitalism]]
* The [[Golden Age of Piracy]]

Important events in the early modern period include:
* The invention of the [[printing press]]
* The [[English Civil War]]
* The [[Seven Years' War]]

|&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Modern Age characteristics&lt;/div&gt;
The concept of the modern world as distinct from an ancient or medieval world rests on a sense that the modern world is not just another [[era]] in history, but rather the result of a new type of change. This is usually conceived of as progress driven by deliberate human efforts to better their situation.

Advances in all areas of human activity—[[politics]], [[industry]], [[society]], [[economics]], [[commerce]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[mechanization]], [[automation]], [[science]], [[medicine]], [[technology]], and [[culture]]—appear to have transformed an ''Old World'' into the ''Modern'' or ''New World''.&lt;ref name="GrosvenorModern"&gt;''Contemporary history of the world'' by Edwin Augustus Grosvenor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicheletAndSimpson"&gt;''A summary of modern history'' by Jules Michelet, Mary Charlotte Mair Simpson&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the identification of the old Revolutionary change can be used to demarcate the old and old-fashioned from the modern.&lt;ref name="GrosvenorModern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicheletAndSimpson" /&gt;

Portions of the Modern world altered its relationship with the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[value system]], revalued the [[monarchy|monarchical]] government system, and abolished the [[feudalism|feudal]] economic system, with new [[democracy|democratic]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas in the areas of [[politics]], [[science]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="GrosvenorModern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicheletAndSimpson" /&gt;
|}
This combination of epoch events totally changed thinking and thought in the early modern period, and so their dates serve as well as any to separate the old from the new modes.

As an [[Age of Revolution]]s dawned, beginning with those revolts in [[American Revolution|America]] and [[French Revolution|France]], political changes were then pushed forward in other countries partly as a result of upheavals of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and their impact on thought and thinking, from concepts from nationalism to organizing armies.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, C.W. (1965). [[Cambridge Modern History|The new Cambridge modern history]]. Volume 9., ''War and peace in an age of upheaval, 1793–1830''.

New York: Gotham Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a result of [[mechanization]] in society, the [[American Revolution]], the first [[French Revolution]]; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the [[s:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first=Marjie|title=The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 – 8 June 1815|publisher=The Victorian Web|date=30 April 2002|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the peace established by [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Second Treaty of Paris]] which ended the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, Charles Downer (1910). ''Europe since 1815''. American historical series, H. Holt and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Late ====
As a result of the Industrial Revolution and the earlier political revolutions, the worldviews of [[Modernism]] emerged. The industrialization of many nations was initiated with the industrialization of Britain. Particular facets of the late modernity period include:
* Increasing role of [[science]] and [[technology]]
* Mass [[literacy]] and proliferation of [[mass media]]
* Spread of [[social movements]]
* Institution of [[representative democracy]]
* [[Individualism]]
* [[Industrialization]]
* [[Urbanization]]
* [[Total fertility rate]]s and [[ecological collapse]]s occurring at [[exponential growth|geometric rates]];

Other important events in the development of the Late modern period include:
* The [[American Revolution]]
* The [[French Revolution]]
* The [[Colonization of Australia]]
* The [[Revolutions of 1848]]
* The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]
* The [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]]

Our most recent era{{mdash}}Modern Times{{mdash}}begins with the end of these revolutions in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Duruy, V., &amp; Grosvenor, E.A. (1894).

''Modern times: The world from the twenties to the nineties''. New York: HarperPerennial.&lt;/ref&gt; (encompassing [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]) and the emergence of [[socialism|socialist countries]] that led to the [[Cold War]]. The ''contemporary era'' follows shortly afterward with the explosion of research and increase of knowledge known as the [[Information Age]] in the latter 20th and the early 21st century. Today's [[Postmodernity|Postmodern]] era is seen in widespread [[digitality]].&lt;ref&gt;Martín Lister, ''New media: a critical introduction''. Psychology Press, 2003. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early modern period ==
{{Main|Early modern period}}
Historians consider the early modern period to be approximately between 1500 and 1800. It follows the Late Middle Ages and is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable nation-states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.

The expansion of Islam took place in North and East Africa. In West Africa, various native nations existed. The Indian Empires and civilizations of Southeast Asia were a vital link in the spice trade. On the Indian subcontinent, the [[Mughal Empire]] existed. The archipelagic empires, the Sultanate of Malacca and later the Sultanate of Johor, controlled the southern areas.

Various Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates controlled the Asian sphere. In Japan, the [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period. In Korea, the early modern period is considered to have lasted from the rise of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] to the enthronement of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]]. In the Americas, Pre-Columbian peoples had built a large and varied civilization, including the Aztec Empire and alliance, the [[History of the Incas|Inca civilization]], the [[Maya civilization|Mayan Empire]] and cities, and the [[Muisca Confederation|Chibcha]]. In the west, kingdoms of Europe moved in the direction of reformation and expansion. Russia [[Russian conquest of Siberia|reached the Pacific coast]] in 1647 and consolidated its control over the [[Russian Far East]] in the 19th century.

Later religious trends of the period saw the end of the aforementioned Muslim expansion. Christians and Christendom saw the end of the Crusades and of religious unity under the Roman Catholic Church. It was during this time that the Inquisitions and the [[Protestant Reformation]] took place.
[[File:Colonial empires in 1800.svg|centre|thumb|upright=3.4|{{center|Colonial empires in 1800}}]]
During the early modern period, an [[age of discovery]] and trade was undertaken by the Western European nations. Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France went on a colonial expansion and took possession of lands and set up colonies in Africa, southern Asia, and North and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=American Colonies|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0142002100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey colonized Southeastern Europe, and parts of the West Asia and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434996/Ottoman-Empire |title=Ottoman Empire |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia took possession in Eastern Europe, Asia, and North America.

In China, urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as [[Nanjing]] and [[Beijing]], also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however,  relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. Despite the [[xenophobia]] and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of [[neo-Confucianism]], China under the later Ming Dynasty became isolated, prohibiting the construction of ocean going sea vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1000ce_mingvoyages.htm#decision|title=The Ming Voyages {{!}} Asia for Educators {{!}} Columbia University|website=afe.easia.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite isolationist policies the Ming Economy still suffered from an inflation due to an overabundance of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish New World]] silver entering its economy through new European colonies such as [[Portuguese Macau|Macao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/115ch8.html|title=Chapter 8 The New World|website=mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ming China was further strained by victorious but costly wars to protect [[Joseon|Korea]] from [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Japanese Invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|pages=168–169|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908–1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) was founded after the fall of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], the last [[Han Chinese]] dynasty, by the [[Manchu people|Manchus]]. The Manchus were formerly known as the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]]. When Beijing was captured by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebels in 1644, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus then allied with former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of [[Beijing]], which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of [[China proper]]. Schoppa, the editor of ''The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History'' argues, "A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'. It also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the Chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]], art flourished in the Edo Period]]
In pre-modern&lt;ref&gt;or early-modern&lt;/ref&gt; Japan following the [[Sengoku period]] of "warring states", central government had been largely reestablished by [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] during the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]]. After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, central authority fell to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who completed this process and received the title of ''[[shōgun]]'' in 1603.
Society in the Japanese "[[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa period]]" ([[Edo society]]), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class [[hierarchy]] originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimyō]]s'' (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the [[warrior]]-caste of [[samurai]], with the [[farmer]]s, [[artisans]], and [[merchant|traders]] ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the ''[[Sakoku]]'' policy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=175|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908–1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy among the Japanese people rose in the two centuries of isolation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimyōs'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimyōs'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this [[social stratification]] system unleashed disruptive forces over time. [[Taxes]] on the [[peasantry]] were set at fixed amounts which did not account for [[inflation]] or other changes in [[monetary]] value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.

During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.

===== British and Dutch colonization =====

The development of [[New Imperialism]] saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers. The [[Company rule in India|commercial colonization of India]] commenced in 1757, after the [[Battle of Plassey]], when the [[Nawab of Bengal]] surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2003|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1765, when the Company was granted the ''diwani'', or the right to collect revenue, in [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=46}}, {{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1772, when the Company established a capital in [[Calcutta]], appointed its first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], [[Warren Hastings]], and became directly involved in governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Clive and Mir Jafar after the Battle of Plassey, 1757 by Francis Hayman.jpg|left|thumb|[[Robert Clive]] and [[Mir Jafar]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]], 1757 by Francis Hayman]]

The [[Maratha Empire|Maratha states]], following the [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], eventually lost to the [[British East India Company]] in 1818 with the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]. The rule lasted until 1858, when, after the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] and consequent of the [[Government of India Act 1858]], the [[India Office|British government]] assumed the task of directly administering India in the new [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819 [[Stamford Raffles]] established [[Singapore]] as a key trading post for Britain in their rivalry with the Dutch. However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch treaty]] demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.

The [[Dutch East India Company]] (1800) and [[British East India Company]] (1858) were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. Only [[Thailand]] was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. Colonial rule had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent.&lt;ref&gt;Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many major events caused [[Europe]] to change around the start of the 16th century, starting with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the fall of [[Muslim Spain]] and the discovery of the [[Americas]] in 1492, and [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1517. In [[England]] the modern period is often dated to the start of the [[Tudor period]] with the victory of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] over [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Miller, Aubrey Newman. ''Early modern British history, 1485–1760: a select bibliography'', [[Historical Association]], 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rul/rr_gateway/research_guides/history/texts_by_period.shtml#emp ''Early Modern Period (1485–1800)''], Sites Organized by Period, [[Rutgers University]] Libraries&lt;/ref&gt; [[Early modern Europe]]an history is usually seen to span from the start of the 15th century, through the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 17th and 18th centuries, until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century.

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}

Russia experienced territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. The native land of the Cossacks is defined by a line of Russian/Ruthenian town-fortresses located on the border with the [[Eurasian Steppe|steppe]] and stretching from the middle Volga to Ryazan and Tula, then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the Dnieper via Pereyaslavl. This area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts.
[[File:Repin Cossacks.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cossacks]] became the backbone of the early Russian Army.]]
In 1648, the peasants of [[Ukraine]] joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the river [[Dnieper]], leaving the western part (or [[Right-bank Ukraine]]) under Polish rule and eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian. Later, in 1670–71 the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[fur]]s and [[ivory]]. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian river routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].

==== Reason and Enlightenment ====
{{Further|Great Divergence}}
[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach - Mass in B minor - Agnus Dei.ogg|left|thumb|Johann Sebastian Bach – Mass in B minor – Agnus Dei, From 1724]]
[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice full.jpg|thumb|upright=1|"If there is something you know, communicate it. If there is something you don't know, search for it." An engraving from the 1772 edition of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''; [[Truth]] (center) is surrounded by light and unveiled by the figures to the right, [[Philosophy]] and [[Reason]]|alt=]]

Traditionally, the European intellectual transformation of and after the Renaissance bridged the Middle Ages and the Modern era. The [[Age of Reason]] in the Western world is generally regarded as being the start of [[modern philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'' offered an explanation of the heliocentric model of the Universe.&lt;/ref&gt; and a departure from the medieval approach, especially [[Scholasticism]]. Early 17th-century philosophy is often called the Age of Rationalism and is considered to succeed Renaissance philosophy and precede the Age of Enlightenment, but some consider it as the earliest part of the Enlightenment era in philosophy, extending that era to two centuries. The 18th century saw the beginning of [[secularization]] in Europe, rising to notability in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] is a time in [[Western philosophy]] and cultural life centered upon the 18th century in which reason was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy for authority. Enlightenment gained momentum more or less simultaneously in many parts of Europe and America. Developing during the Enlightenment era, [[Renaissance humanism]] as an intellectual movement spread across Europe. The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). The term ''umanista'' comes from the latter part of the 15th century. The people were associated with the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'', a novel curriculum that was competing with the ''[[quadrivium]]'' and [[scholastic logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113–114, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaissance humanism took a close study of the Latin and Greek classical texts, and was antagonistic to the values of [[scholasticism]] with its emphasis on the accumulated commentaries; and humanists were involved in the sciences, philosophies, arts and poetry of classical antiquity. They self-consciously imitated [[classical Latin]] and deprecated the use of [[medieval Latin]]. By analogy with the perceived decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ''[[ad fontes]]'', or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning.[[File:PeuerbachSuperioribus2.png|thumb|Model for the Three Superior Planets and Venus from [[Georg von Peuerbach]], ''Theoricae novae planetarum''.|alt=|147x147px|left]]The [[quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]] was a [[literature|literary]] and artistic quarrel that heated up in the early 1690s and shook the [[Académie française]]. The opposing two sides were, the Ancients (''Anciens'') who constrain choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] and the Moderns (''Modernes''), who supported the merits of the authors of the century of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]] quickly followed with his ''Digression sur les anciens et les modernes'' (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.

==== Scientific Revolution ====
{{Main|Scientific Revolution}}
The Scientific Revolution was a period when European ideas in [[classical physics]], [[classical astronomy|astronomy]], [[classical biology|biology]], [[History of anatomy#Early modern anatomy|human anatomy]], [[classical chemistry|chemistry]], and other [[classical science]]s were rejected and led to doctrines supplanting those that had prevailed from [[Ancient Greece]] to the Middle Ages which would lead to a transition to [[modern science]]. This period saw a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas across [[physics]], [[astronomy]], and [[biology]], in institutions supporting [[scientific investigation]], and in the more [[worldview|widely held picture of the universe]]. Individuals started to question all manners of things and it was this questioning that led to the Scientific Revolution, which in turn formed the foundations of contemporary sciences and the establishment of several modern scientific fields.

==== The French Revolutions ====
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''La liberté guidant le peuple''. The [[French Revolution]] inspired a wave of revolutions across Europe. [[Liberalism]] and [[Nationalism]] were popular ideas that challenged [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute Monarchies]] in the 19th century. |alt=]]
{{Main|French Revolution}}
Toward the middle and latter stages of the Age of Revolution, the French political and social revolutions and radical change saw the French governmental structure, previously an absolute monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy transform, changing to forms based on Enlightenment principles of citizenship and inalienable rights. The first revolution led to government by the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], the second by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and the third by the [[French Directory|Directory]].

The changes were accompanied by violent turmoil which included the trial and execution of the king, vast bloodshed and repression during the Reign of Terror, and warfare involving every other major European power. Subsequent events that can be traced to the Revolution include the Napoleonic Wars, two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern France took shape. In the following century, France would be governed at one point or another as a republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empires.

===== National and Legislative Assembly =====
{{Main|National Assembly (French Revolution)|Legislative Assembly (France)}}
During the French Revolution, the National Assembly, which existed from June 17 to July 9 of 1789, was a transitional body between the Estates-General and the National Constituent Assembly.

The Legislative Assembly was the legislature of France from October 1, 1791 to September 1792. It provided the focus of political debate and revolutionary law-making between the periods of the National Constituent Assembly and of the National Convention.

===== The Directory and Napoleonic Era =====
[[File:Baron Antoine-Jean Gros-Battle Pyramids 1810.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon III|Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]] 1810 by Baron Antoine-Jean Gros]]
{{Main|French Directory|Napoleonic Era}}
The Executive Directory was a body of five Directors that held executive power in France following the Convention and preceding the Consulate. The period of this regime (2 November 1795 until 10 November 1799), commonly known as the Directory (or Directoire) era, constitutes the second to last stage of the French Revolution. Napoleon, before seizing the title of Emperor, was elected as First Consul of the Consulate of France.

The campaigns of French Emperor and General Napoleon Bonaparte characterized the Napoleonic Era. Born on Corsica as the French invaded, and dying suspiciously on the tiny British Island of St. Helena, this brilliant commander, controlled a French Empire that, at its height, ruled a large portion of Europe directly from Paris, while many of his friends and family ruled countries such as Spain, Poland, several parts of Italy and many other Kingdoms Republics and dependencies. The Napoleonic Era changed the face of Europe forever, and old Empires and Kingdoms fell apart as a result of the mighty and "Glorious" surge of [[Republicanism]].

==== Italian unification ====
[[File:Gioacchino toma roma o morte 1863.jpg|left|thumb|''Rome or Death,'' Italian Patriotic Painting, 1863]]

[[Italian unification]] was the political and social movement that annexed different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of Italy in the 19th century. There is a lack of consensus on the exact dates for the beginning and the end of this period, but many scholars agree that the process began with the end of Napoleonic rule and the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, and approximately ended with the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871, though the last ''[[Italia irredenta|città irredente]]'' did not join the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] until after World War I.

==== End of the early modern period ====
Toward the end of the early modern period, Europe was dominated by the evolving system of mercantile capitalism in its trade and the New Economy. European states and politics had the characteristic of Absolutism. The French power and English revolutions dominated the political scene. There eventually evolved an international balance of power that held at bay a great conflagration until years later.

The end date of the early modern period is usually associated with the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in about 1750. Another significant date is 1789, the beginning of the French Revolution, which drastically transformed the state of European politics and ushered in the Prince Edward Era and modern Europe.

=== North America ===
{{Main|European colonization of the Americas}}[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'', showing the five-man committee in charge of drafting the Declaration in 1776 as it presents its work to the [[Second Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]

The [[French and Indian Wars]] were a series of conflicts in North America that represented the actions there that accompanied the European dynastic wars. In Quebec, the wars are generally referred to as the Intercolonial Wars. While some conflicts involved Spanish and Dutch forces, all pitted Great Britain, its colonies and American Indian allies on one side and France, its colonies and Indian allies on the other.

The expanding French and British colonies were contending for control of the western, or interior, territories. Whenever the European countries went to war, there were actions within and by these colonies although the dates of the conflict did not necessarily exactly coincide with those of the larger conflicts.

Beginning the Age of Revolution, the [[American Revolution]] and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (also called American War of Independence).

[[File:North America 1797 - U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1909.jpg|left|thumb|right|North America 1797]]

The American Revolution began with fighting at Lexington and Concord. On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed their independence from Great Britain and their formation of a cooperative union. In June 1776, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was appointed a member of the [[Committee of Five]] that drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by [[Thomas Jefferson]].

The rebellious states defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence. While the states had already rejected the governance of Parliament, through the Declaration the new United States now rejected the legitimacy of the monarchy to demand allegiance. The war raged for seven years, with effective American victory, followed by formal British abandonment of any claim to the United States with the Treaty of Paris.

The [[Philadelphia Convention]] set up the current United States; the [[United States Constitution]] ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a limited central government. The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], comprising ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many fundamental civil rights and freedoms, was ratified in 1791.

==== Decolonization of North and South Americas ====
{{Main|Decolonization of the Americas|Spanish American wars of independence}}The decolonization of the Americas was the process by which the countries in the Americas gained their independence from European rule. Decolonization began with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries. The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, from 1808 until 1829, directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
|}

When the Central Junta fell to the French, numerous new Juntas appeared all across the Americas, eventually resulting in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south, to Mexico in the north. After the death of the king Ferdinand VII, in 1833, only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the Spanish–American War in 1898. Unlike the Spanish, the Portuguese did not divide their colonial territory in America. The captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in Salvador (later relocated to Rio de Janeiro) which reported directly to the Portuguese Crown until its independence in 1822, becoming the [[Empire of Brazil]].

=== Industrial revolutions ===
{{Main|Industrial Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM]]

The development of the [[steam engine]] started the Industrial Revolution in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Watt steam engine]] image: located in the lobby of into the Superior Technical School of Industrial Engineers of the UPM ([[Madrid]])&lt;/ref&gt; The steam engine was created to pump water from coal mines, enabling them to be deepened beyond [[groundwater]] levels. The date of the Industrial Revolution is not exact. [[Eric Hobsbawm]] held that it "broke out" in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, ''The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Ltd.  {{ISBN|0349104840}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[T.S. Ashton]] held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830 (in effect the reigns of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], The [[English Regency|Regency]], and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E Inikori.  [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0521010799&amp;id=y7rhKYWhCyIC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;sig=zOPr9UkQv258KyhCkuFM0abERnI  ''Africans and the Industrial Revolution in England''], Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521010799}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The great changes of centuries before the 19th were more connected with ideas, religion or military conquest, and technological advance had only made small changes in the material wealth of ordinary people.

The first Industrial Revolution merged into the Second Industrial Revolution around 1850, when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered ships and railways, and later in the 19th century with the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[electric power]] generation. The Second Industrial Revolution was a phase of the Industrial Revolution; labeled as the separate Technical Revolution. From a technological and a social point of view there is no clean break between the two. Major innovations during the period occurred in the chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel industries. Specific advancements included the introduction of oil fired steam turbine and internal combustion driven steel ships, the development of the airplane, the practical commercialization of the automobile, mass production of consumer goods, the perfection of canning, mechanical refrigeration and other food preservation techniques, and the invention of the telephone.

==== Industrialization ====
[[Industrialization]] is the process of social and economic change whereby a human group is transformed from a pre-industrial society into an industrial one. It is a subdivision of a more general [[modernization]] process, where [[social change]] and [[economic development]] are closely related with [[innovation|technological innovation]], particularly with the development of large-scale energy and metallurgy production. It is the extensive organization of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing. Industrialization also introduces a form of philosophical change, where people obtain a different attitude towards their [[nature|perception of nature]].

==== Revolution in manufacture and power ====
[[File:First passenger railway 1830.jpg|left|thumb|[[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] from 1830, world's first railway.]]
An [[economic system|economy]] based on [[manual labour]] was replaced by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of machinery. It began with the mechanization of the [[textile]] industries and the development of [[iron]]-making techniques, and trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, improved roads, and then [[rail transport|railways]].

The introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] (fuelled primarily by [[coal]]) and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Business and Economics.  [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0195115899&amp;id=CX9kBaVx4JkC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;sig=V0eO27c7koD8rrIV2EKv6-guB5s  ''Leading Issues in Economic Development''], Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|0195115899}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of all-metal [[machine tool]]s in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries.

The modern [[petroleum industry]] started in 1846 with the discovery of the process of refining [[kerosene]] from [[coal]] by [[Nova Scotia]]n [[Abraham Pineo Gesner]]. [[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]] improved Gesner's method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available "rock oil" ("petr-oleum") [[seep]]s in 1852 and the first rock oil mine was built in [[Bóbrka, Krosno County|Bóbrka]], near [[Krosno]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in the following year. In 1854, [[Benjamin Silliman]], a science professor at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], was the first to fractionate petroleum by distillation. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world.

==== Notable engineers ====
[[File:Teslathinker.jpg|thumb|Nikola Tesla with his high-frequency transformer at East Houston Street, New York|alt=|193x193px]]

Engineering achievements of the revolution ranged from electrification to developments in materials science. The advancements made a great contribution to the quality of life. In the first revolution, [[Lewis Paul]] was the original inventor of roller spinning, the basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill. [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]]'s improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both the Kingdom of Great Britain and the world.

In the latter part of the second revolution, [[Thomas Alva Edison]] developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world and is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory. In 1882, Edison switched on the world's first large-scale [[electrical supply network]] that provided 110 volts direct current to fifty-nine customers in lower Manhattan. Also toward the end of the second industrial revolution, [[Nikola Tesla]] made many contributions in the field of [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==== Social effects and classes ====
The Industrial Revolutions were major [[technology|technological]], [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]], and [[culture|cultural]] changes in late 18th and early 19th centuries that began in Britain and spread throughout the world. The effects spread throughout [[Western Europe]] and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting the majority of the world. The impact of this change on [[society]] was enormous and is often compared to the [[Neolithic revolution]], when mankind developed [[agriculture]] and gave up its [[nomad]]ic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Brown, Lester. [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN1853839043&amp;id=5aCyfUsHM6kC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;sig=1dsUat9P_-9dWWVRMpPt1udT8DQ ''Eco-Economy''], James &amp; James, Earthscan. {{ISBN|1853839043}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] per capita was much more stable and progressed at a much slower rate until the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy, and that it has since increased rapidly in capitalist countries.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis [https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm essay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127032512/http://minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm |date=2007-11-27 }} retrieved March 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Mid-19th-century European revolts =====
[[File:Alexanderplatz Berlin 1848.jpg|left|thumb|[[Revolutions of 1848|German Revolution]], Berlin 1848]]
The [[Revolutions of 1848|European Revolutions of 1848]], known in some countries as the Spring of Nations or the Year of Revolution, were a series of political upheavals throughout the European continent. Described as a revolutionary wave, the period of unrest began in France and then, further propelled by the French Revolution of 1848, soon spread to the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cayley, E.S. (1856). ''The European revolutions of 1848''. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. Vol. I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, S.B., &amp; Hart, A.B. (1918). ''New medieval and modern history''. New York: American book company.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the revolutions were quickly put down, there was a significant amount of violence in many areas, with tens of thousands of people tortured and killed. While the immediate political effects of the revolutions were reversed, the long-term reverberations of the events were far-reaching.

===== Industrial age reformism =====
Industrial age [[reform movement]]s began the gradual change of society rather than with episodes of rapid fundamental changes. The reformists' ideas were often grounded in liberalism, although they also possessed aspects of utopian, socialist or religious concepts. The Radical movement campaigned for electoral reform, a reform of the Poor Laws, free trade, educational reform, postal reform, prison reform, and public sanitation.

Following the Enlightenment's ideas, the reformers looked to the [[Scientific Revolution]] and industrial progress to solve the social problems which arose with the Industrial Revolution. Newton's natural philosophy combined a mathematics of axiomatic proof with the mechanics of physical observation, yielding a coherent system of verifiable predictions and replacing a previous reliance on revelation and inspired truth. Applied to public life, this approach yielded several successful campaigns for changes in social policy.

==== Imperial Russia ====
{{Main|Russian Empire}}
[[File:Russian Peasant Girls-retouched.jpg|thumb|Russian Peasant Girls, 1900]]
Under [[Peter the Great]], Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the [[Great Northern War]], forcing it to cede West [[Karelia]] and [[Ingria]] (two regions lost by Russia in the [[Time of Troubles]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=9, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/09_01.html|isbn=978-5170021420|accessdate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Governorate of Estonia|Estland]] and [[Livland]], securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=15, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/15_01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Baltic Sea]] Peter founded a new capital called [[Saint Petersburg]], later known as Russia's ''Window to Europe''. [[Peter the Great's reforms]] brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] (''the Great''), who ruled in 1762–96, extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward and southward.  Russia would [[Russian conquest of Siberia|colonize]] the vast Asian lands of [[Siberia]] expanding by land to the Pacific Coast of Asia, and [[Russian America|North America]].  As the large realm embraced [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute Monarchy]] Russia remained more conservative than its western neighbors. In the 19th century, Russia was invaded by France in 1812 but emerged as a more powerful superpower afterwards. Nonetheless industrialization did not come to Russia until the 1870s. The Medieval practice of serfdom was [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolished]] in 1861 freeing over thirty million Russian peasants. A market economy finally emerged in the Russian Empire. However class warfare rose, and the nation was vulnerable due to rivalries with the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]].

=== European dominance and the 19th century ===
{{Main|19th century|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)}}
Historians define the 19th century [[List of time periods|historical era]] as stretching from 1815 (the [[Congress of Vienna]]) to 1914 (the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]]). Alternatively, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] defined the [[The long 19th century|"Long Nineteenth Century"]] as spanning the years 1789 to 1914.

==== Imperialism and empires ====

[[File:World heads of state in 1889.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|alt=Painting of a group of standing and seated heads of state in a variety of national uniforms and formal dress|"The World's Sovereigns", 1889]]

In the 1800s and early 1900s, once great and powerful Empires such as Spain, Ottoman Turkey, the Mughal Empire, and the Kingdom of Portugal began to break apart. Spain, which was at one time unrivaled in Europe, had been declining for a long time when it was crippled by Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion. Sensing the time was right, Spain's vast colonies in South America began a series of rebellions that ended with almost all of the Spanish territories gaining their independence.

The once mighty Ottoman Empire was wracked with a series of revolutions, resulting with the Ottoman's only holding a small region that surrounded the capital, Istanbul.

[[File:Imperalism.xcf|left|thumb|Montage that depicts European wars of imperialism. By clockwise, wars include [[French conquest of Algeria|French Algerian War]], [[First Opium War|Opium War]], [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|Russian Conquest of Central Asia]] and [[Anglo-Zulu War|Zulu War]]]]
The Mughal empire, which was descended from the Mongol Khanate, was bested by the upcoming [[Maratha Confederacy]]. All was going well for the [[Maratha]]s until the British took an interest in the riches of India and the British ended up ruling not just the boundaries of Modern India, but also Pakistan, Burma, Nepal, Bangladesh and some Southern Regions of Afghanistan.

The King of Portugal's vast territory of Brazil reformed into the independent Empire of Brazil. With the defeat of Napoleonic France, Britain became undoubtedly the most powerful country in the world, and by the end of the First World War controlled a Quarter of the world's population and a third of its surface. However, the power of the British Empire did not end on land, since it had the greatest navy on the planet. Electricity, steel, and petroleum enabled Germany to become a great [[Power (international)|international power]] that raced to create empires of its own.

The [[Meiji Restoration]] was a chain of events that led to enormous changes in Japan's political and social structure that was taking a firm hold at the beginning of the [[Meiji Era]] which coincided the opening of Japan by the arrival of the [[Black Ships]] of [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] and made [[Imperial Japan]] a [[great power]]. [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and [[Qing Dynasty]] China failed to keep pace with the other world powers which led to massive social unrest in both empires. The Qing Dynasty's military power weakened during the 19th century, and faced with international pressure, massive [[rebellion]]s and defeats in wars, the dynasty declined after the mid-19th century.

European powers controlled parts of Oceania, with French [[New Caledonia]] from 1853 and [[French Polynesia]] from 1889; the Germans established colonies in [[German New Guinea|New Guinea]] in 1884, and [[German Samoa|Samoa]] in 1900. The United States expanded into the Pacific with Hawaii becoming a [[Territory of Hawaii|U.S. territory]] from 1898. Disagreements between the US, Germany and UK over Samoa led to the [[Tripartite Convention (1899)|Tripartite Convention of 1899]].

==== British Victorian era ====
{{Main|British Empire|Victorian era}}[[File:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|The British Empire in 1897, marked in the traditional colour for imperial British dominions on maps|alt=|left]]The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was the period of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign from June 1837 to January 1901. This was a long period of prosperity for the British people, as profits gained from the overseas British Empire, as well as from industrial improvements at home, allowed a large, educated middle class to develop. Some scholars would extend the beginning of the period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political games that have come to be associated with the Victorians—back five years to the passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]].
[[File:Fleet Street. By James Valentine c.1890..jpg|alt=Fleet Street in London, 1890.|thumb|Fleet Street in London capital of the [[British Empire]], 1890]]
In Britain's "imperial century",&lt;ref&gt;For more, see [[Pax Britannica]].&lt;/ref&gt; victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than Russia in central Asia. Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'', and a foreign policy of "[[splendid isolation]]". Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many nominally independent countries, such as China, [[Argentina]] and [[Thailand|Siam]], which has been generally characterized as "[[informal empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, B. T. (2004). ''Informal empire: Mexico and Central America in Victorian culture''. Minneapolis, Minn: Univ. of Minnesota Press&lt;/ref&gt; Of note during this time was the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], which was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the [[Zulu Empire]].

British imperial strength was underpinned by the [[Steamboat|steamship]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the Empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called [[All Red Line]]. Growing until 1922, around {{convert|13000000|sqmi|km2}} of territory and roughly 458 million people were added to the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Maddison, Angus (2001).

''Colossus: The Price of America's Empire''. Penguin. {{ISBN|1594200130}}. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The British established colonies in Australia in 1788, New Zealand in 1840 and [[Colonial Fiji|Fiji]] in 1872, with much of [[Oceania]] becoming part of the British Empire.

==== French governments and conflicts ====
The [[Bourbon Restoration]] followed the ousting of Napoleon I of France in 1814. The Allies restored the Bourbon Dynasty to the French throne. The ensuing period is called the Restoration, following French usage, and is characterized by a sharp conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Church as a power in French politics. The [[July Monarchy]] was a period of liberal constitutional monarchy in France under King Louis-Philippe starting with the July Revolution (or Three Glorious Days) of 1830 and ending with the Revolution of 1848. The [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second Republic and the Third Republic, in France.

[[File:BismarckundNapoleonIII.jpg|left|thumb|[[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] after the [[Battle of Sedan]]]]
The [[Franco-Prussian War]] was a conflict between France and Prussia, while Prussia was backed up by the North German Confederation, of which it was a member, and the South German states of Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria. The complete Prussian and German victory brought about the final unification of Germany under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. It also marked the downfall of Napoleon III and the end of the Second French Empire, which was replaced by the Third Republic. As part of the settlement, almost all of the territory of Alsace-Lorraine was taken by Prussia to become a part of Germany, which it would retain until the end of World War I.

The [[French Third Republic]] was the republican government of France between the end of the Second French Empire following the defeat of Louis-Napoléon in the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 and the Vichy Regime after the invasion of France by the German Third Reich in 1940. The Third Republic endured seventy years, making it the most long-lasting regime in France since the collapse of the Ancien Régime in the French Revolution of 1789.

==== Slavery and abolition ====
[[File:Une Dame d´une Fortune Ordinaire dans son Intérieur au Milieu de ses Habitudes Journalières, by Jean-Baptiste Debret 1823.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Slavery]] in [[Brazil]], before 1823]]
{{Main|Abolitionism}}
[[Slavery]] was greatly reduced around the world in the 19th century. Following a successful [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt in Haiti]], Britain forced the [[Barbary pirates]] to halt their practice of kidnapping and enslaving Europeans, [[Slavery Abolition Act|banned slavery throughout its domain]], and charged its navy with ending the global [[slave trade]]. Slavery was then abolished in [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|Russia]], [[Emancipation Proclamation|America]], and [[Lei Áurea|Brazil]].

==== African colonization ====
{{Main|Colonisation of Africa}}

Following the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 and propelled by economic exploitation, the [[Scramble for Africa]] was initiated formally at the [[Berlin West Africa Conference]] in 1884–1885. The Berlin Conference attempted to avoid war among the European powers by allowing the European rival countries to carve up the continent of Africa into national colonies. Africans were not consulted.

The major European powers laid claim to the areas of [[Africa]] where they could exhibit a sphere of influence over the area. These claims did not have to have any substantial land holdings or treaties to be legitimate. The European power that demonstrated its control over a territory accepted the mandate to rule that region as a national [[colony]]. The European nation that held the claim developed and benefited from their colony’s commercial interests without having to fear rival European competition. With the colonial claim came the underlying assumption that the European power that exerted control would use its mandate to offer protection and provide welfare for its colonial peoples, however, this principle remained more theory than practice. There were many documented instances of material and moral conditions deteriorating for native Africans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under European colonial rule, to the point where the colonial experience for them has been described as "hell on earth."
[[File:Kongokonferenz.jpg|left|thumb|European officials staking claims to [[Africa]] in the [[Congress of Berlin]] ]]
At the time of the [[Berlin Conference]], Africa contained one-fifth of the world’s population living in one-quarter of the world’s land area. However, from Europe's perspective, they were dividing an unknown continent. European countries established a few coastal colonies in Africa by the mid-nineteenth century, which included [[Cape Colony]] (Great Britain), [[Angola]] (Portugal), and [[Algeria]] (France), but until the late nineteenth century Europe largely traded with free African states without feeling the need for territorial possession. Until the 1880s most of Africa remained uncharted, with western maps from the period generally showing blank spaces for the continent’s interior.

From the 1880s to 1914, the European powers expanded their control across the African continent, competing with each other for Africa’s land and resources. [[Great Britain]] controlled various colonial holdings in East Africa that spanned the length of the African continent from Egypt in the north to South Africa. The [[France|French]] gained major ground in West Africa, and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] held colonies in southern Africa. [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]] established a small number of colonies at various points throughout the continent, which included German East Africa (Tanganyika) and German Southwest Africa for Germany, Eritrea and Libya for Italy, and the Canary Islands and Rio de Oro in northwestern Africa for Spain. Finally, for [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold]] (ruled from 1865 to 1909), there was the large “piece of that great African cake” known as the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]], which became his personal fiefdom. By 1914, almost the entire continent was under European control. [[Liberia]], which was settled by freed American slaves in the 1820s, and Abyssinia ([[Ethiopia]]) in eastern Africa were the last remaining independent African states.&lt;ref&gt;John Merriman, ''A History of Modern Europe, Volume Two: From the French Revolution to the Present'', Third Edition (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;819–859&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Meiji Japan ====
{{Main|Meiji period}}
[[File:View of Kobe LACMA M.91.377.8.jpg|left|thumb|Kobe Japan and its harbor, 1865. Hand colored.]] Around the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, the [[Meiji era]] occurred during the reign of the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji Emperor]]. During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This [[Japanese era name|era name]] means "Enlightened Rule". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth B. Pyle, "Profound Forces in the Making of Modern Japan", ''Journal of Japanese Studies'' (2006) 32#2 pp. 393–418 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jjs/summary/v032/32.2pyle01.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The [[Ministry of War (pre-modern Japan)|hyobusho]] (war office) was replaced with a [[Imperial Japanese Army|War Department]] and a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Naval Department.]] The [[samurai]] class suffered great disappointment the following years.

Laws were instituted that required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves. This action, the deathblow for the samurai warriors and their ''daimyōs'', initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki ("blood tax") literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. The Japanese government began modelling their ground forces after the French military. The French government contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks. Japan's modernized military gave Japan the opportunity to engage in Imperialism with its victory against the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] Japan annexed [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]] and the Chinese province of [[Shandong|Shangdong]].

After the death of the Meiji Emperor, the [[Emperor Taishō|Taishō Emperor]] took the throne, the[[Taishō period]] was a time of democratic reform granting democratic rights to all Japanese men. Foreigners would instrumental in aiding in Japan's modernization.  A key foreign observer of the remarkable and rapid changes in [[culture of Japan|Japanese society]] in this period was [[Ernest Mason Satow]].

The [[Antebellum Age]] was a period of increasing division in the country based on the growth of slavery in the [[Southern United States|American South]] and in the western territories of [[Kansas]] and [[Nebraska]] that eventually led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861. The Antebellum Period is often considered to have begun with the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] of 1854,{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} although it may have begun as early as 1812. This period is also significant because it marked the transition of American manufacturing to the industrial revolution.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

"[[Manifest destiny]]" was the belief that the United States was destined to expand across the North American continent, from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific Ocean. During this time, the United States expanded to the Pacific Ocean—"from sea to shining sea"—largely defining the borders of the contiguous United States as they are today.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

{{Main|American Civil War|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
The American Civil War began when seven [[Slave state|Southern slave states]] declared their [[secession]] from the U.S. and formed the [[Confederate States of America]], the Confederacy (four more states joinged the Confederacy later). Led by [[Jefferson Davis]], they fought against the [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S. federal government (the Union)]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]], which was supported by all the free states and the five [[Border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]] in the north.

Northern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. Secession and Confederate nationalism had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery or quasi-slavery had to be eliminated. Lincoln proved effective in mobilizing support for the war goals, raising large armies and supplying them, avoiding foreign interference, and making the end of slavery a war goal. The Confederacy had a larger area than it could defend, and it failed to keep its ports open and its rivers clear as was the case in the [[Siege of Vicksburg|Battle of Vickysburg]]. The [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] kept up the pressure as the South could barely feed and clothe its soldiers. Its soldiers, especially those in the East under the command of General [[Robert E. Lee]] proved highly resourceful until they finally were overwhelmed by Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] in 1864–65. The [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]] (1863–77) began with the [[Emancipation Proclamation|Emancipation proclamation]] in 1863, and included freedom, full citizenship and voting rights for Southern blacks. It was followed by a reaction that left the blacks in a second class status legally, politically, socially and economically until the 1960s.

==== The Gilded Age and legacy ====
{{Main|Gilded Age}}

[[File:Flatiron Building and Street Scene October 8th 1902 New York City.ogv|thumb|1902 New York City in early [[skyscraper]]s]]

During the Gilded Age, there was substantial growth in population in the United States and extravagant displays of wealth and excess of America's upper-class during the post-Civil War and post-Reconstruction era, in the late 19th century. The wealth polarization derived primarily from industrial and population expansion. The businessmen of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] created industrial towns and cities in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] with new factories, and contributed to the creation of an ethnically diverse industrial [[working class]] which produced the wealth owned by rising super-rich [[Robber baron (industrialist)|industrialists and financiers called the "robber barons"]]. An example is the company of [[John D. Rockefeller]], who was an important figure in shaping the new oil industry. Using highly effective tactics and aggressive practices, later widely criticized, [[Standard Oil]] absorbed or destroyed most of its competition.

The creation of a modern industrial economy took place. With the creation of a [[Infrastructure|transportation and communication infrastructure]], the [[corporation]] became the dominant form of business organization and a [[Management|managerial revolution]] transformed [[business]] operations. In 1890, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]—the source of all American anti-monopoly laws. The law forbade every contract, scheme, deal, or conspiracy to restrain trade, though the phrase "restraint of trade" remained subjective. By the beginning of the 20th century, per capita income and [[industrial production]] in the United States exceeded that of any other country except Britain. Long hours and hazardous working conditions led many workers to attempt to form [[labor union]]s despite strong opposition from industrialists and the courts. But the courts did protect the marketplace, declaring the Standard Oil group to be an "unreasonable" [[monopoly]] under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] in 1911. It ordered Standard to break up into 34 independent companies with different boards of directors.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States'', 221 U.S. 1 (1911).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science and philosophy ===

In biology, [[Darwinism]] gained acceptance, promoting the concept of [[adaptation]] in the theory of [[natural selection]]. The fields of [[modern geology|geology]], [[modern astronomy|astronomy]] and [[modern psychology|psychology]] also made strides and gained new insights. In [[modern medicine|medicine]], there were advances in [[medical theory]] and [[medical treatment|treatments]].

Starting one-hundred years before the 20th century, the [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment spiritual philosophy]] was challenged in various quarters around the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Adams Cram]].

These ideas were challenged, for example by the [[young Marx|young Karl Marx]], who criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied in the form of [[human rights]]), asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose. For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], humanism was nothing more than a secular version of [[theism]]. In his ''[[Genealogy of Morals]]'', he argues that human rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong. On this view, such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life, but rather deny it. In the 20th century, the notion that human beings are rationally autonomous was challenged by the concept that humans were driven by unconscious irrational desires.

==== Notable persons ====
[[File:Albert Einstein 1921 by F Schmutzer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Albert Einstein in 1921|alt=]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] is renowned for his redefinition of [[sexual desire]] as the primary motivational energy of human life, as well as his therapeutic techniques, including the use of [[free association (psychology)|free association]], his [[transference|theory of transference]] in the therapeutic relationship, and the [[Dream interpretation|interpretation of dreams]] as sources of insight into [[unconscious desire]]s.

[[Albert Einstein]] is known for his theories of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. He also made important contributions to [[statistical mechanics]], especially his mathematical treatment of [[Brownian motion]], his resolution of the [[Einstein solid|paradox of specific heats]], and his connection of [[Fluctuation dissipation theorem|fluctuations and dissipation]]. Despite his reservations about its interpretation, Einstein also made contributions to quantum mechanics and, indirectly, [[quantum field theory]], primarily through his theoretical studies of the [[photon]].

==== Social Darwinism ====
At the end of the 19th century, [[Social Darwinism]] was promoted and included the various ideologies based on a concept that competition among all individuals, groups, nations, or ideas was a "natural" framework for social evolution in human societies. In this view, society's advancement is dependent on the "[[survival of the fittest]]", the term was in fact coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] and referred to in "[[The Gospel of Wealth]]" written by [[Andrew Carnegie]].

==== Marxist society ====
[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.jpg|thumb|[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]], produced in the United States|alt=|left]]
[[Karl Marx]] summarized his approach to history and politics in the opening line of the first chapter of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848). He wrote:
:''The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of [[class struggle]]s.''&lt;ref&gt;In the 1888 English edition of the ''Communist Manifest'', [[Friedrich Engels]] added a footnote with the commentary: "That is, all written history. In 1847, the prehistory of society, the social organization existing previous to recorded history, was all but unknown. Since then Haxthausen discovered common ownership of land In Russia, Maurer concluded it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and by and by village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The Inner organization of this primitive Communistic society was laid bare, In its typical form, by Morgan's work on the true nature of the gens and Its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of these primaeval communities society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempte to retrace this process of dissolution in "''[[Der Ursprung der Familie, des Privateigenthums und des Staats]]''"", from Marx, Karl, Friedrich Engels, Leon Trotsky, and Karl Marx. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dEyEzazZKwIC&amp;pg=PA46 The Communist Manifesto and Its Relevance for Today]''. Chippendale, N.S.W.: Resistance Books, 1998. p. 46, see also ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p7s0oTEWB_MC&amp;pg=PA204 Cornelius Castoriadis, Political and Social Writings]''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993. p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Manifesto'' went through a number of editions from 1872 to 1890; notable new prefaces were written by Marx and Engels for the 1872 German edition, the 1882 Russian edition, the 1883 German edition, and the 1888 English edition. In general, [[Marxism]] identified five (and one transitional) successive stages of development in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". (Marx, Karl, Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877) His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Primitive Communism]]: as seen in cooperative tribal societies.
# [[Slave]] Society: which develops when the tribe becomes a city-state. Aristocracy is born.
# [[Feudalism]]: aristocracy is the ruling class. Merchants develop into capitalists.
# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the true working class.
# [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]]: workers gain class consciousness, [[Proletarian revolution|overthrow]] the capitalists and take control over the [[Socialist state|state]].
# [[Communism]]: a [[classless society|classless]] and [[stateless society]].

[[File:Australia 1900.jpg|thumb|Though still tied to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|commonwealth]] [[Australia]] achieved peaceful independence in 1901.|alt=]]
Major political developments saw the former [[British Empire]] lose most of its remaining political power over [[British Commonwealth|commonwealth]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;Most notably by dividing the British crown into several sovereignties by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], the [[patriation]] of constitutions by the [[Canada Act 1982]] and the [[Australia Act 1986]], and by the independence of countries such as India, Pakistan, South Africa, and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Other events include the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], two world wars, and the [[Cold War]].

==== Australian Constitution ====
In 1901, the [[Federation of Australia]] was the process by which the six separate British [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] formed one nation. They kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the [[Constitution of Australia]] came into force, the colonies collectively became [[States and territories of Australia|states]] of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]].

==== Revolution and Warlords in China ====
[[File:Xinhai Revolution in Shanghai.jpg|thumb|[[Xinhai Revolution]] in [[Shanghai]]; [[Chen Qimei]] organized Shanghainese civilians to start the uprising and was successful. The picture above is [[Nanjing Road]] after the uprising, hung with the [[Five Races Under One Union]] Flags then used by the revolutionaries.|alt=|left]]
The last days of the [[Qing dynasty]] were marked with civil unrest, [[Hundred Days' Reform|failed reforms]] and foreign invasions such as the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer rebellion]]. Responding to these civil failures and discontent, the Qing Imperial Court did attempt to reform the government in various ways, as the decision to draft a constitution in 1906, the establishment of provincial legislatures in 1909, and the preparation for a national parliament in 1910. However, many of these measures were opposed by the conservatives of the Qing Court, and many reformers were either imprisoned or executed outright. The failures of the Imperial Court to enact such reforming measures of political liberalization and modernization caused the reformists to steer toward the road of revolution.

The assertions of Chinese philosophy&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Enlightenment. By Vera Schwarcz. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; began to integrate concepts of Western philosophy, as steps toward modernization. By the time of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, there were many calls, such as the [[May Fourth Movement]], to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China. There were attempts to incorporate [[democracy]], [[republicanism]], and [[industrialism]] into Chinese philosophy, notably by [[Sun Yat-sen]] at the beginning of the 20th century

In 1912, the Republic of China was established and Sun Yat-sen was inaugurated in [[Nanjing]] as the first [[President of the Republic of China|Provisional President]]. But power in [[Beijing]] already had passed to [[Yuan Shikai]], who had effective control of the [[Beiyang Army]], the most powerful military force in China at the time. To prevent [[civil war]] and possible foreign intervention from undermining the infant republic, leaders agreed to Army's demand that China be united under a Beijing government. On March 10, in Beijing, Shikai was sworn in as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China.

After the early 20th century revolutions, shifting alliances of [[Warlord era (China)|China's regional warlords]] waged war for control of the Beijing government. Despite the fact that various warlords gained control of the government in Beijing during the warlord era, this did not constitute a new era of control or governance, because other warlords did not acknowledge the transitory governments in this period and were a law unto themselves. These military-dominated governments were collectively known as the [[Beiyang government]]. The warlord era ended around 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, W.A. (2010). ''Politics in China: An introduction''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 the World's Population had approached approximately 1.6 billion.
Four years into the 20th century saw the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] establishing the [[Empire of Japan]] as a world power. The Russians were in constant pursuit of a [[warm water port]] on the Pacific Ocean, for their navy as well as for maritime trade. The Manchurian Campaign of the [[Russian Empire]] was fought against the Japanese over [[Manchuria]] and [[Korea]]. The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and [[Mukden]], and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the [[Yellow Sea]]. The resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers. These victories, as time transpired, would dramatically transform the distribution of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. The embarrassing string of defeats increased Russian popular dissatisfaction with the inefficient and corrupt Tsarist government.

The [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] was a wave of mass political unrest through vast areas of the [[Russian Empire]]. Some of it was directed against the government, while some was undirected.  It included [[terrorism]], worker strikes, peasant unrests, and military mutinies. It led to the establishment of the limited constitutional monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;[[Russian Constitution of 1906]]&lt;/ref&gt; the establishment of [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]], and the [[multi-party system]].

In China, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown following the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. The Xinhai Revolution began with the [[Wuchang Uprising]] on October 10, 1911 and ended with the abdication of [[Emperor Puyi]] on February 12, 1912. The primary parties to the conflict were the Imperial forces of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), and the revolutionary forces of the [[Tongmenghui|Chinese Revolutionary Alliance]] (Tongmenghui).

===== Edwardian Britain =====
[[File:Steamship Titanic.jpg|thumb|The [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]] was the largest ship constructed in its time. Deemed invincible, it was sunk by [[iceberg]]s off the coast of [[Labrador|Labrador, Canada.]] |alt=|left]]
The [[Edwardian era]] in the United Kingdom is the period spanning the reign of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] up to the end of the First World War, including the years surrounding the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. In the early years of the period, the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa split the country into anti- and pro-war factions. The imperial policies of the Conservatives eventually proved unpopular and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|general election of 1906]] the Liberals won a huge landslide. The Liberal government was unable to proceed with all of its radical programme without the support of the [[House of Lords]], which was largely Conservative. Conflict between the two Houses of Parliament over the [[People's Budget]] led to a reduction in the power of the peers in 1910. The [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|general election in January that year]] returned a [[hung parliament]] with the balance of power held by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Nationalist Party (Ireland)|Irish Nationalist]] members.

===== World War I =====
{{Main|World War I}}

The [[causes of World War I]] included many factors, including the conflicts and antagonisms of the four decades leading up to the war. The [[Triple Entente]] was the name given to the loose alignment between the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] after the signing of the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907.  The alignment of the three powers, supplemented by various agreements with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], the United States, and [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], constituted a powerful counterweight to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], the third having concluded an additional secret agreement with France effectively nullifying her Alliance commitments. Militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism played major roles in the conflict. The immediate origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the [[July Crisis]] of 1914, the spark (or casus belli) for which was the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] of Austria.

However, the crisis did not exist in a void; it came after a long series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers over European and colonial issues in the decade prior to 1914 which had left tensions high. The diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1870. An example is the [[Baghdad Railway]] which was planned to connect the [[Ottoman Empire]] cities of [[Konya]] and [[Baghdad]] with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;([[Morris Jastrow, Jr.|Jastrow]] 1917)&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the [[Balkans]]. Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties. The [[Balkan Wars]] were two wars in South-eastern Europe in 1912–1913 in the course of which the [[Balkan League]] (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia) first captured Ottoman-held remaining part of Thessaly, Macedonia, Epirus, Albania and most of Thrace and then fell out over the division of the spoils, with incorporation of Romania this time.

The [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], led by the [[Britain in World War I|British Empire]], [[French Third Republic|France]], Russia until March 1918, Japan and the United States after 1917, defeated the [[Central Powers]], led by the [[German Empire]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The war caused the disintegration of four empires—the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian ones—as well as radical change in the European and West Asian maps. The Allied powers before 1917 are referred to as the [[Triple Entente]], and the Central Powers are referred to as the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].

[[File:Chemical Warfare in the Twentieth Century Q54781.jpg|left|thumb|[[Chemical warfare|Chemical Warfare]] was used for the first time in WWI. Soldiers used [[Gas mask|gas-masks]] to protect themselves]]Much of the fighting in World War I took place along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], within a system of opposing manned trenches and fortifications (separated by a "[[No man's land]]") running from the [[North Sea]] to the border of Switzerland. On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the vast eastern plains and limited rail network prevented a trench warfare stalemate from developing, although the scale of the conflict was just as large.  Hostilities also occurred on and under the sea and—for the first time—from the air. More than 9 million soldiers died on the various battlefields, and nearly that many more in the participating countries' home fronts on account of food shortages and [[genocide]] committed under the cover of various civil wars and internal conflicts. Notably, more people died of the worldwide [[Spanish flu|influenza outbreak]] at the end of the war and shortly after than died in the hostilities. The unsanitary conditions engendered by the war, severe overcrowding in barracks, wartime propaganda interfering with public health warnings, and migration of so many soldiers around the world helped the outbreak become a [[pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barry|first=John M.|authorlink=John M.

Ultimately, World War I created a decisive break with the old [[New World Order (political)|world order]] that had emerged after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which was modified by the mid-19th century's nationalistic revolutions. The results of World War I would be important factors in the development of World War II approximately 20 years later. More immediate to the time, the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] was a political event that redrew the political boundaries of West Asia. The huge conglomeration of territories and peoples formerly ruled by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new nations.&lt;ref&gt;Roderic H. Davison; Review "From Paris to Sèvres: The Partition of the Ottoman Empire at the Peace Conference of 1919–1920. by Paul C.

The [[League of Nations]] granted France mandates over [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]] and [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]] and granted the United Kingdom mandates over [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestine]] (which was later divided into two regions: [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]). Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] became parts of what are today [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]].

===== Revolutions and war in Eurasia =====

{{Main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:Lenin.gif|thumb|Lenin]]

The Russian Revolution is the series of revolutions in Russia in 1917, which destroyed the [[Tsarist autocracy]] and led to the creation of the Soviet Union. Following the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia]], the [[Russian Provisional Government]] was established. In October 1917, a [[October Revolution|''red'' faction revolution]] occurred in which the [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]], armed groups of workers and deserting soldiers directed by the Bolshevik Party, seized control of [[Saint Petersburg]] (then known as [[Petrograd]]) and began an immediate armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former [[Russian Empire]].

Another action in 1917 that is of note was the armistice signed between Russia and the Central Powers at [[Brest-Litovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;Evan Mawdsley (2008) ''The Russian Civil War'': 42&lt;/ref&gt; As a condition for peace, the treaty by the [[Central Powers]] conceded huge portions of the former Russian Empire to [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] and the Ottoman Empire, greatly upsetting [[nationalist]]s and [[Conservatism|conservatives]]. The Bolsheviks made peace with the [[German Empire]] and the [[Central Powers]], as they had promised the Russian people prior to the Revolution. Vladimir Lenin's decision has been attributed to his sponsorship by the foreign office of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]], offered by the latter in hopes that with a revolution, Russia would withdraw from World War I. This suspicion was bolstered by the German Foreign Ministry's sponsorship of Lenin's return to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]].  The [[Triple Entente|Western Allies]] expressed their dismay at the Bolsheviks, upset at:
# the withdrawal of Russia from the war effort,
# worried about a possible Russo-German alliance, and
# galvanized by the prospect of the Bolsheviks making good their threats to assume no responsibility for, and so default on, Imperial Russia's massive [[External debt|foreign loans]].&lt;ref&gt;the legal notion of [[Odious debt]] had not yet been formulated&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Russian civil war posters.png|left|thumb|Two contrasting visions of the [[Russian Civil War]]. To the left is propaganda from the [[White Army]], to the right is propaganda from the [[Bolsheviks]]. ]]
In addition, there was a concern, shared by many [[Central Powers]] as well, that the socialist revolutionary ideas would spread to the West. Hence, many of these countries expressed their support for the Whites, including the provision of troops and supplies. [[Winston Churchill]] declared that Bolshevism must be "strangled in its cradle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282 Cover Story: Churchill's Greatness.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004110408/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282 |date=2006-10-04 }} Interview with Jeffrey Wallin.

The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war that occurred within the former [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Russian provisional government]] collapsed and the [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviets]] under the domination of the [[Bolshevik]] party assumed power, first in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd (St. Petersburg)]] and then in other places. In the wake of the [[October Revolution]], the old Russian Imperial Army had been demobilized; the volunteer-based Red Guard was the Bolsheviks' main military force, augmented by an armed military component of the [[Cheka]], the Bolshevik state security apparatus. There was an instituted mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;Read, Christopher, ''From Tsar to Soviets'', Oxford University Press (1996), p. 237: By 1920, 77% of the Red Army's enlisted ranks were composed of peasant conscripts.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition of rural Russians to Red Army conscription units was overcome by taking hostages and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Beryl, ''The Russian Revolution 1917–1921'', Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

[[File:Vladivostok intervention.jpg|thumb|In the Russian Civil War, over eleven nations intervened in favor of the [[White Movement]]. Here Japanese occupy [[Vladivostok]].]]
The principal fighting occurred between the [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]] and the forces of the [[White Movement|White Army]]. Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied Forces]], yet many volunteer foreigners fought in both sides of the Russian Civil War. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist [[Green armies|Green Army]], the Ukrainian anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] and [[Black Guards]], and warlords such as [[Ungern von Sternberg]]. The most intense fighting took place from 1918 to 1920. Major military operations ended on 25 October 1922 when the Red Army occupied [[Vladivostok]], previously held by the [[Provisional Priamur Government]]. The last enclave of the White Forces was the [[Ayano-Maysky District]] on the Pacific coast. The majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of General [[Pyotr Wrangel]] in the [[Crimea]], but a notable resistance in certain areas continued until 1923 (e.g., [[Kronstadt Uprising]], [[Tambov Rebellion]], [[Basmachi Revolt]], and the final resistance of the [[White movement]] in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]]).

While the early 1920s was a time of flux for revolutionary Russia and Central Asia, the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] was proclaimed in 1922 as the successor state to the fallen [[Russian Empire]]. Revolutionary leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] died of natural causes and was succeeded by [[Joseph Stalin]].

==== The Early Republic of China ====

In 1917, China declared war on Germany in the hope of recovering its lost province, then under Japanese control. The [[New Culture Movement]] occupied the period from 1917 to 1923. Chinese representatives refused to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]], due to intense pressure from the student protesters and public opinion alike.
[[File:Student Demonstrations, June 4th and 5th, 1919 2.jpg|left|thumb|Student Demonstrations, June 4th and 5th, 1919 2]]

The [[May Fourth Movement]] helped to rekindle the then-fading cause of republican revolution. In 1917 [[Sun Yat-sen]] had become commander-in-chief of a rival military government in [[Guangzhou]] in collaboration with southern warlords. Sun's efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and in 1920 he turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. But for political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP).[[File:Sino-german cooperation.png|thumb|With [[Sino-German cooperation until 1941]], Chinese industry and military was improved just prior to the war against Japan.|alt=|150x150px]]

In early 1927, the Kuomintang-CCP rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CCP and the left wing of the Kuomintang had decided to move the seat of the Nationalist government from Guangzhou to [[Wuhan]]. But [[Chiang Kai-shek]], whose [[Northern Expedition]] was proving successful, set his forces to destroying the Shanghai CCP apparatus and established an anti-Communist government at Nanjing in [[April 12 Incident|April 1927]].

The interwar period was the period between the end of the First World War and the beginning of the Second World War. This period was marked by turmoil in much of the world, as Europe struggled to recover from the devastation of the First World War.[[File:A flapper girl LCCN2012645724.tif|thumb|227x227px|American, Flapper Girl.

The social and societal upheaval known as the Roaring Twenties began in North America and spread to Europe in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The ''Roaring Twenties'', often called "[[Jazz Age|The Jazz Age]]", saw an exposition of social, artistic, and cultural dynamism. "[[Normalcy]]" returned to politics, [[jazz music]] blossomed, the [[flapper]] redefined modern womanhood, [[Art Deco]] peaked. The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity, a break with traditions. Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology. New technologies, especially automobiles, movies and radio proliferated 'modernity' to a large part of the population. The 1920s saw the general favor of practicality, in architecture as well as in daily life. The 1920s was further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries, extensive industrial growth and the rise in consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].[[File:I Got The Ritz From The One I Love.ogg|left|thumb|''I got the Ritz from the one I love,'' Jazz music radio broadcast 1932]]
Europe spent these years rebuilding and coming to terms with the vast human cost of the conflict. The economy of the United States became increasingly intertwined with that of Europe. In Germany, the [[Weimar Republic]] gave way to episodes of political and economic turmoil, which culminated with the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|German hyperinflation]] of 1923 and the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of that same year. When Germany could no longer afford war payments, Wall Street invested heavily in European debts to keep the European economy afloat as a large consumer market for American mass-produced goods. By the middle of the decade, [[economic development]] soared in Europe, and the Roaring Twenties broke out in Germany, Britain and France, the second half of the decade becoming known as the "[[Golden Twenties]]". In France and francophone Canada, they were also called the "''années folles''" ("Crazy Years")., 1935. German Nazis created large public performances to earn public support. [[File:Depression, Breadlines-long line of people waiting to be fed, New York City, in the absence of substantial government... - NARA - 196506.tif|thumb|[[Great Depression]], Breadlines-long line of people waiting to be fed, [[New York City]], [[United States]] i|alt=|150x150px]]Worldwide prosperity changed dramatically with the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929. The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] served to punctuate the end of the previous era, as ''The Great Depression'' set in. The ''Great Depression'' was a worldwide economic [[Recession|downturn]] starting in most places in 1929 and ending at different times in the 1930s or early 1940s for different countries.&lt;ref name="CRomer1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/243118/Great-Depression "Great Depression"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest and most important [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] in the 20th century, and is used in the 21st century as an example of how far the world's economy can fall.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Duhigg, "Depression, You Say? Check Those Safety Nets", ''New York Times'', March 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The depression had devastating effects in virtually every country, rich or poor. International trade plunged by half to two-thirds, as did personal income, tax revenue, prices and profits. [[Cities in the Great Depression|Cities all around the world]] were hit hard, especially those dependent on [[heavy industry]]. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by roughly 60 percent.&lt;ref name="USBLS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/|title=Commodity Data|publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cochrane, Willard W.|title=Farm Prices, Myth and Reality|year=1958|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[League of Nations]]|title=World Economic Survey 1932–33|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas dependent on [[Primary sector of economic activity|primary sector industries]] suffered the most.

Parket Willis Lecture in Economic Policy", March 2, 2004, FDR Library Web Site.''&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of countries set up relief programs, and most underwent some sort of political upheaval, pushing them to the left or right. In some world states, the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist [[Demagogy|demagogues]]—the most infamous being [[Adolf Hitler]]—setting the stage for the next era of war. The convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted in the rise of [[Nazism]]. In Asia, Japan became an ever more assertive power, especially with regards to China.

===== The League and crises =====
[[File:Another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler.ogg|thumb|U.K Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain|Nevil Chamberline]] attempted to negotiate with [[Adolf Hitler]] as Nazi Germany practiced an expansionist policy .|alt=|left]]
The interwar period was also marked by a radical change in the international order, away from the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] that had dominated pre–World War I Europe. One main institution that was meant to bring stability was the [[League of Nations]], which was created after the First World War with the intention of maintaining world security and peace and encouraging economic growth between member countries. The League was undermined by the bellicosity of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Imperial Japan]], the Soviet Union, and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] Italy, and by the non-participation of the United States, leading many to question its effectiveness and legitimacy.[[File:Battle at Great Wall, Laiyuan, Hebei, autumn 1937.jpg|thumb|[[Kuomintang|Nationalist Chinese]] soldiers defending at the Battle at Great Wall, Laiyuan, [[Hebei]], [[China]] autumn 1937. The [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino-Japanese war]] cost at least twenty millions lives. ]]A series of international crises strained the League to its limits, the earliest being the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] by Japan and the [[Abyssinian crisis]] of 1935/36 in which Italy invaded [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], one of the only free African nations at that time.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69173, Münchener Abkommen, Staatschefs.jpg|left|thumb|The signatories [[Munich Agreement]] where British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain|Nevil Chamberline]] [[Appeasement|appeased]] to the [[Axis powers|Axis Powers]] regarding territorial claims in [[Sudetenland]], [[Czechoslovakia]] to avoid conflict.]]
The League tried to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. The Abyssinian war showed Hitler how weak the League was and encouraged the remilitarization of the Rhineland in flagrant disregard of the Treaty of Versailles. This was the first in a series of provocative acts culminating in the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the beginning of the Second World War.

Few Chinese had any illusions about Japanese designs on China. Hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population, Japan initiated the seizure of [[Manchuria]] in September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor [[Puyi]] as head of the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)]], the loss of Manchuria, and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries, was a blow to the Kuomintang economy. The [[League of Nations]], established at the end of World War I, was unable to act in the face of the Japanese defiance. After 1940, conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the [[Free China (Second Sino-Japanese War)|areas not under Japanese control]]. The Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations, administrative reforms, and the land- and tax-reform measures favoring the peasants—while the Kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence.

===== Tripartite Pact =====
[[File:Shashin Shuho No 151.jpg|left|thumb|141x141px|Japanese poster advocating for Tripartite Pact, 1941.]]

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] had seen tensions rise between Imperial Japan and the United States; events such as the [[Panay incident]] and the [[Nanking Massacre]] turned American public opinion against Japan. With the occupation of [[French Indochina]] in the years of 1940–41, and with the continuing war in China, the United States placed embargoes on Japan of [[strategic material]]s such as scrap metal and oil, which were vitally needed for the war effort. The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of [[South East Asia]]—specifically [[British Malaya]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day [[Indonesia]]). In 1940, Imperial Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

=====World War II=====

{{Main|World War II}}

It is important to note that the [[Empire of Japan]] was not at war with the [[Soviet Union]] despite being part of the [[Tripartite Pact]].]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-012-0037-23A, Polen, Straßenkampf, Infanterie.jpg|left|thumb|The German [[Invasion of Poland]] in 1939 is the official start of [[World War II|WWII]]]]

The Second World War was a global military conflict that took place in 1939–1945. It was the largest and deadliest war in history, culminating in [[the Holocaust]] and ending with the dropping of the [[atom bomb]].

Even though Japan had been invading in China since 1937, the conventional view is that the war began on September 1, 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Poland, the [[Drang nach Osten]]. Within two days the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany, even though the fighting was confined to Poland. Pursuant to a then-secret provision of its non-aggression [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union joined with Germany on September 17, 1939, to conquer Poland and to divide Eastern Europe.
The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were initially made up of Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, as well as [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] countries which were controlled directly by the UK, such as the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]]. All of these countries declared war on Germany in September 1939.
[[File:Children in the Holocaust concentration camp liberated by Red Army.jpg|alt=Holocaust Survivors, January 1945|thumb|Survivors of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] at the infamous German concentration camp of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] located in Occupied Poland. ]]
Following the lull in fighting, known as the "[[Phoney War]]", Germany invaded western Europe in May 1940. Six weeks later, France, in the mean time attacked by Italy as well, surrendered to Germany, which then tried unsuccessfully to conquer Britain. On September 27, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed a mutual defense agreement, the [[Tripartite Pact]], and were known as the [[Axis Powers]].Nine months later, on June 22, 1941, Germany launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union, which promptly joined the Allies. Germany was now engaged in fighting a war on two fronts. This proved to be a mistake by Germany – Germany had not successfully carried out the invasion of Britain and the war turned against the Axis.

On December 7, 1941, [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor]], bringing it too into the war on the Allied side. China also joined the Allies, as eventually did most of the rest of the world. China was in turmoil at the time, and attacked Japanese armies through guerilla-type warfare. By the beginning of 1942, the major combatants were aligned as follows: the British Commonwealth, the United States, and the Soviet Union were fighting Germany and Italy; and the British Commonwealth, China, and the United States were fighting Japan. The United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and China were referred as a "trusteeship of the powerful" during the [[World War II]]&lt;ref name = Justus&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doenecke |first1=Justus D. |last2=Stoler |first2=Mark A. |title=Debating Franklin D.

It is possible that around 62 million people [[World War II casualties|died in the war]]; estimates vary greatly. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, [[genocide]] (in particular, the [[Holocaust]]), and aerial bombing. The former Soviet Union and China suffered the most casualties. Estimates place deaths in the Soviet Union at around 23 million, while China suffered about 10 million. No country lost a greater portion of its population than Poland: approximately 5.6 million, or 16%, of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died.
The Holocaust (which roughly means "burnt whole") was the deliberate and systematic murder of millions of Jews and other "unwanted" during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany. Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the war's beginning, or if the plans for it came about later. Regardless, persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started, such as in the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (Night of Broken Glass). The Nazis used propaganda to great effect to stir up anti-Semitic feelings within ordinary Germans.

After World War II, Europe was informally split into Western and Soviet [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. [[Western Europe]] later aligned as the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and [[Eastern Europe]] as the [[Warsaw Pact]]. There was a shift in power from Western Europe and the [[British Empire]] to the two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. These two rivals would later face off in the [[Cold War]]. In Asia, the defeat of Japan led to its [[democratization]]. [[Chinese Civil War|China's civil war]] continued through and after the war, resulting eventually in the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The former colonies of the European powers began their road to independence.

The mid-20th century is distinguished from most of human history in that its most significant changes were directly or indirectly economic and technological in nature. Economic development was the force behind vast changes in everyday life, to a degree which was unprecedented in human history.

Over the course of the 20th century, the world's per-capita [[gross domestic product]] grew by a factor of five,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bradford DeLong, [http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/2000/TCEH_2.html ''Cornucopia: Increasing Wealth in the Twentieth Century''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230090216/http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/2000/TCEH_2.html |date=2005-12-30 }}. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; much more than all earlier centuries combined (including the 19th with its Industrial Revolution). Many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not available at any price at its beginning.  However, the gulf between the world's rich and poor grew wider,&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Wayne. ''Theoretical criminology: from modernity to post-modernism''. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Program). ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being''. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment series. Washington, DC: Island Press, 2005. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, advancing technology and medicine has had a great impact even in the [[Global South]]. Large-scale industry and more centralized [[Mass media|media]] made brutal dictatorships possible on an unprecedented scale in the middle of the century, leading to wars that were also unprecedented. However, the increased communications contributed to [[democratization]]. Technological developments included the development of airplanes and [[space exploration]], [[nuclear technology]], advancement in [[genetics]], and the dawning of the [[Information Age]].

=== American Peace ===

{{Main|Pax Americana}}
Pax Americana is an appellation applied to the historical concept of relative liberal peace in the Western world, resulting from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States of America starting around the start of the 20th century. Although the term finds its primary utility in the latter half of the 20th century, it has been used in various places and eras. Its modern connotations concern the peace established after the end of World War II in 1945.
{{details|American Century}}

=== Cold War era ===
{{Main|Cold War}}
The Cold War began in the mid-1940s and lasted into the early 1990s. Throughout this period, the conflict was expressed through military coalitions, espionage, weapons development, invasions, propaganda, and competitive technological development. The conflict included costly defense spending, a massive [[Conventional weapon|conventional]] and [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[arms race]], and numerous [[proxy war]]s; the two [[superpower]]s never fought one another directly.

[[File:NATO vs. Warsaw (1949-1990).svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|{{center|Borders of [[NATO]] (blue) and [[Warsaw Pact]] (red) states during the Cold war era.}}]]
The Soviet Union created the [[Eastern Bloc]] of countries that it occupied, annexing some as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] and maintaining others as satellite states that would later form the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The United States and various western European countries began a policy of "[[containment]]" of [[communism]] and forged myriad alliances to this end, including [[NATO]]. Several of these western countries also coordinated efforts regarding the rebuilding of western Europe, including western Germany, which the Soviets opposed. In other regions of the world, such as Latin America and [[Southeast Asia]], the Soviet Union fostered [[communist revolution]]ary movements, which the United States and many of its allies opposed and, in some cases, attempted to "[[rollback|roll back]]". Many countries were prompted to align themselves with the nations that would later form either NATO or the Warsaw Pact, though other movements would also emerge.
[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|left|thumb|US and USSR nuclear stockpiles]]
In China [[Mao Zedong]] (''Máo zé dōng'') utilized [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought. When the [[Communist Party of China]] assumed power in 1959, previous schools of Chinese thought, excepting notably [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], were denounced as backward. Many parts of China's past were even purged during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Though initially friendly with the [[Soviet Union]] the Chinese and Soviet communists diverged in the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of 1960. Through the end of the Cold-War, China would continue on its own path from other communist countries, building better relations with the United States after 1972. China's economy would recover from the Cultural Revolution due to [[Chinese economic reform|market-oriented reforms]] led by [[Deng Xiaoping]].

The Cold War saw periods of both heightened tension and relative calm. International crises arose, such as the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948–1949), the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953), the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–1975), the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962), the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (1979–1989) and [[Able Archer 83|NATO exercises in November 1983]]. There were also periods of reduced tension as both sides sought [[détente]]. Direct military attacks on adversaries were deterred by the potential for [[mutual assured destruction]] using deliverable [[nuclear weapon]]s.

The Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The United States under President [[Ronald Reagan]] increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressure on the Soviet Union, which was already suffering from [[Brezhnev stagnation|severe economic stagnation]]. In the second half of the 1980s, newly appointed Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' reforms. [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|The Soviet Union collapsed]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the dominant military power, though Russia retained much of the massive Soviet nuclear arsenal.

=== Latin America polarization ===

In Latin America in the 1970s, leftists acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right-wing, ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of the individual country's upper class to support coups d'état to avoid what they perceived as a communist threat. This was further fueled by Cuban and United States intervention which led to a political polarization. Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by [[military dictatorship]]s that were supported by the United States of America. In the 1970s, the regimes of the [[Southern Cone]] collaborated in [[Operation Condor]] killing many [[leftist]] dissidents, including some [[urban guerrilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-universal.com.mx/editoriales/34023.html |author=Victor Flores Olea |title=Editoriales – El Universal – 10 de abril 2006 : Operacion Condor |work=[[El Universal (Mexico)|El Universal]] |location=Mexico |accessdate=2009-03-24 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628021303/http://www.el-universal.com.mx/editoriales/34023.html |archivedate=June 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the early 1990s all countries had restored their democracies.

=== Space Age ===

[[File:Neil Armstrong small step.wav|left|thumb|Neil Armstrong small step]]
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Blue Marble]]'', a photograph of Earth as seen from Apollo 17. The second half of the 20th century saw an increase of interest in both [[space exploration]] and the [[environmental movement]].]]
The [[Space Age]] is a period encompassing the activities related to the [[Space Race]], [[space exploration]], space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. The Space Age began with the development of several technologies that culminated with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the Soviet Union in October 1957. This was the world's first artificial satellite, orbiting the Earth in 98.1 minutes and weighing in at 83&amp;nbsp;kg. The launch of Sputnik 1 ushered a new era of political, scientific and technological achievements that became known as the Space Age. The Space Age was characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Space Age brought the first human spaceflight during the [[Vostok programme]] and reached its peak with the [[Apollo program]] which captured the imagination of much of the world's population. The landing of [[Apollo 11]] was an event watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the defining moments of the 20th century. Since then and with the end of the space race due to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], public attention has largely moved to other areas.

== Education and schools ==
The [[humanities]] are academic disciplines which study the [[human condition]], using methods that are primarily [[Analytic induction|analytic]], critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly [[empirical]] approaches of the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social sciences]]. Although many of the subjects of modern history coincide with that of standard history, the subject is taught independently by various systems of education in the world.

=== British education ===
Students can choose the subject at university. The material covered includes from the mid-18th century, to analysis of the present day. Virtually all colleges and sixth forms that do teach modern history do it alongside standard history; very few teach the subject exclusively.

=== Universities ===
&lt;!-- this section is linked from [[List of alumni of Jesus College, Oxford]] --&gt;
At the [[University of Oxford]] 'Modern History' has a somewhat different meaning. The contrast is not with the Middle Ages but with Antiquity. The earliest period that can be studied in the [[Final Honour School]] of Modern History begins in 285.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

A '''non-communicable disease''' ('''NCD''') is a [[disease]] that is not [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible]] directly from one person to another. NCDs include [[parkinson's disease]] [[autoimmune disease]]s, [[stroke]]s, most [[heart disease]]s, most [[cancer]]s, [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[osteoporosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cataract]]s, and others. NCDs may be [[chronic condition|chronic]] or [[acute (medicine)|acute]]. Most are non-[[infection|infectious]], although there are some non-communicable infectious diseases, such as [[parasitic disease]]s in which the parasite's [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] does not include direct host-to-host transmission. 

NCDs are the leading cause of death globally. In 2012, they caused 68% of all deaths (38 million) up from 60% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The top 10 causes of death|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index2.html |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half were under age 70 and half were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noncommunicable diseases |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/topics/noncommunicable_diseases/en/ |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Risk factor]]s such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment increase the likelihood of certain NCDs. Every year, at least 5 million people die because of tobacco use and about 2.8 million die from being overweight. High cholesterol accounts for roughly 2.6 million deaths and 7.5 million die because of [[high blood pressure]].

== Risk factors ==
[[Risk factor]]s such as a person's background; lifestyle and environment are known to increase the likelihood of certain non-communicable diseases. They include age, [[gender]], [[genetics]], exposure to [[air pollution]], and behaviors such as [[smoking]], [[Healthy diet|unhealthy diet]] and [[Sedentary lifestyle|physical inactivity]] which can lead to [[hypertension]] and [[obesity]], in turn leading to increased risk of many NCDs. Most NCDs are considered preventable because they are caused by modifiable risk factors.

The WHO's [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2002'']] identified five important risk factors for non-communicable disease in the top ten leading risks to health. These are raised blood pressure, raised [[cholesterol]], tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and overweight. The other factors associated with higher risk of NCDs include a person's economic and social conditions, also known as the "[social determinants of health]."

It has been estimated that if the primary risk factors were eliminated, 80% of the cases of heart disease, stroke and [[type 2 diabetes]] and 40% of cancers could be prevented. Interventions targeting the main risk factors could have a significant impact on reducing the burden of disease worldwide. Efforts focused on better diet and increased physical activity have been shown to control the prevalence of NCDs .

==Environmental diseases==
NCDs include many environmental diseases covering a broad category of avoidable and unavoidable [[health|human health]] conditions caused by external factors, such as sunlight, nutrition, pollution, and lifestyle choices.  The [[diseases of affluence]] are non-infectious diseases with environmental causes.  Examples include:
* Many types of [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD)
* [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) caused by smoking tobacco
* [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]
* [[Lower back pain]] caused by too little exercise
* [[Malnutrition]] caused by too little food, or eating the wrong kinds of food (e.g. [[scurvy]] from lack of [[Vitamin C]])
* [[Skin cancer]] caused by radiation from the sun
* [[Obesity]]

=== Inherited diseases ===
{{See also|List of genetic disorders}}
[[Genetic disorders]] are caused by errors in genetic information that produce diseases in the affected people.
The origin of these genetic errors can be:
* Spontaneous errors or mutations to the [[genome]]:
:* A change in chromosome [[Chromosomal condition|numbers]], such as [[Down syndrome]].
:* A defect in a gene caused by [[mutation]], such as [[Cystic fibrosis]].
:* An increase in the [[Mosaic (genetics)|amount]] of genetic information, such as [[Chimera (genetics)|Chimerism]] or [[Heterochromia iridum|Heterochromia]].

Cystic fibrosis is an example of an inherited disease that is caused by a mutation on a gene. The faulty gene impairs the normal movement of sodium chloride in and out of cells, which causes the mucus-secreting organs to produce abnormally thick mucus. The gene is recessive, meaning that a person must have two copies of the faulty gene for them to develop the disease. Cystic fibrosis affects the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as the sweat glands. The mucus secreted is very thick and blocks passageways in the lungs and digestive tracts. This mucus causes problems with breathing and with the digestion and absorption of nutrients.
* Inherited genetic errors from [[Kinship#Descent and the family|parents]]:
:* [[Dominance (genetics)|Dominant]] genetic diseases, such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntingtons]], require the inheritance of [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|one]] erroneous gene to be expressed.
:* [[Recessive]] genetic diseases require the inheritance of erroneous genes to be expressed and this is one reason they work together.

== Global health ==

Referred to as a "lifestyle" disease, because the majority of these diseases are preventable illnesses, the most common causes for non-communicable diseases (NCD) include tobacco use (smoking), alcohol abuse, poor diets (high consumption of sugar, salt, saturated fats, and trans fatty acids) and physical inactivity. Currently, NCD kills 36 million people a year, a number that by some estimates is expected to rise by 17–24% within the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Non-Communicable Diseases Deemed Development Challenge of ‘Epidemic Proportions’ in Political Declaration Adopted During Landmark General Assembly Summit |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/ga11138.doc.htm |date=19 September 2011 |website=United Nations |publisher=Department of Public Information |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, many NCDs were associated with economic development and were so-called a "[[diseases of affluence|diseases of the rich]]". The burden of non-communicable diseases in developing countries has increased however, with an estimated 80% of the four main types of NCDs — cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes — now occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Action Plan for the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of non-communicable Diseases and with two-thirds of people who are affected by diabetes now residing in developing nations, NCD can no longer be considered just a problem affecting affluent estimation of the economic impact of chronic non-communicable diseases in selected countries. New WHO report: deaths from non-communicable diseases are on the rise, with developing world hit hardest. As previously stated, in 2008 alone, NCD's were the cause of  63% of deaths worldwide; a number that is expected to rise considerably in the near future if measures are not taken.

If present growth trends are maintained, by 2020, NCDs will attribute to 7 out of every 10 deaths in developing countries, killing 52 million people annually worldwide by 2030. With statistics such as these, it comes as no surprise that international entities such as the World Health Organization &amp; World Bank Human Development Network have identified the prevention and control of NCDs as an increasingly important discussion item on the [[global health]] agenda.

Thus, should policy makers and communities mobilize "and make prevention and targeted treatment of such diseases a priority," sustainable measures can be implemented to stagnate (and eventually even reverse) this emerging global health threat.  Potential measures currently being discussed by the(World Health Organization)-Food and Agriculture Organization includes reducing the levels of salt in foods, limiting inappropriate marketing of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children, imposing controls on harmful alcohol use, raising taxes on tobacco, and curbing legislation to curb smoking in public places.

=== United Nations ===
The [[World Health Organization]] is the specialized agency of the [[United Nations]] (UN) that acts as coordinating authority on international [[public health]] issues, including NCDs. In May 2008, the 193 Member States of the WHO approved a six-year plan to address non-communicable diseases, especially the rapidly increasing burden in low- and middle-income countries. The plan calls for raising the priority given to NCDs in [[international development]] work'.

During the 64th session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2010, a resolution was passed to call for a high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and treatment NCDs with the participation of heads of state and government. The resolution also encouraged UN Member States to address the issue of non-communicable diseases at the 2010 Review Summit for the [[Millennium Development Goals]].

=== Global Non-communicable Disease Network ===
In order to better coordinate efforts around the globe, in 2009 the WHO announced the launch of the ''Global Non-communicable Disease Network'' (NCDnet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New network to combat noncommunicable diseases |date=8 July 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/noncommunicable_diseases_20090708/en/index.html |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCDnet will consist of leading health organizations and experts from around the world in order to fight against diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Ala Alwan, assistant director-general for Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health at the WHO, said: "integrating the prevention of non-communicable diseases and injuries into the national and global development agendas is not only achievable but also a priority for developing countries."&lt;ref name="Business"&gt;{{cite news |title=Who's action against non-communicable diseases|author=Alexander Chiejina|newspaper=Business Day Weekend |date=16 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NCD Alliance ===
The NCD Alliance is a global partnership founded in May 2009 by four international federations representing [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[cancer]], and chronic [[respiratory disease]]. The NCD Alliance brings together roughly 900 national member associations to fight non-communicable disease. Long term aims of the Alliance include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdalliance.org/aboutus |title=About Us |author=The NCD Alliance |publisher=The NCD Alliance |accessdate=4 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504050001/http://ncdalliance.org/aboutus |archivedate=4 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases (UNIATF) ===
The [[United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs|United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases]] (UNIATF) was established by the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] in 2013 in order to provide scaled up action across the UN system to support governments, in particular in low- and middle-income countries, to tackle [[non-communicable diseases]] (NCDs).

=== Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network ===
The Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network, or commonly referred to as YP-CDN, is a global network of roughly 5000 young professionals across 157 countries. The organization aims to mobilize these young people "to take action against social injustice driven by NCDs.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdaction.org/history|title=History |author=YP-CDN |publisher=YP-CDN |accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==
Previously, chronic NCDs were considered a problem limited mostly to [[high income economy|high income countries]], while [[infectious diseases]] seemed to affect [[low income countries]]. The burden of disease attributed to NCDs has been estimated at 85% in industrialized nations, 70% in middle income nations, and nearly 50% in countries with the lowest national incomes.&lt;ref name="WHO2005"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Preventing Chronic Diseases a Vital Investment |journal=Cataloguing-in-Publication Data |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, chronic NCDs accounted for more than 60% (over 35 million) of the 57 million deaths worldwide. Given the global population distribution, almost 80% of deaths due to chronic NCDs worldwide now occur in low and middle income countries, while only 20% occur in higher income countries.

National economies are reportedly suffering significant losses because of premature deaths or inability to work resulting from heart disease, stroke and diabetes. For instance, China is expected to lose roughly $558 billion in national income between 2005 and 2015 due to early deaths. In 2005, heart disease, stroke and diabetes caused an estimated loss in [[international dollar]]s of national income of 9 billion in India and 3 billion in Brazil.&lt;ref name="WHO2005"/&gt;

=== Absenteeism and presenteeism ===
{{main | Absenteeism | Presenteeism}}

The burden of chronic NCDs including [[mental health]] conditions is felt in workplaces around the world, notably due to elevated levels of [[absenteeism]], or absence from work because of illness, and [[presenteeism]], or productivity lost from staff coming to work and performing below normal standards due to poor [[health]]. For example, the United Kingdom experienced a loss of about 175 million days in 2006 to absence from illness among a working population of 37.7 million people. The estimated cost of absences due to illness was over 20 billion pounds in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper C, Dewe P |title=Well-being—absenteeism, presenteeism, costs and challenges |journal=Occup Med (Lond) |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=522–4 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19054749 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqn124|last2=Dewe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost due to presenteeism is likely even larger, although methods of analyzing the economic impacts of presenteeism are still being developed. Methods for analyzing the distinct workplace impacts of NCDs versus other types of health conditions are also still being developed.

=== Cancer ===
{{main | Cancer}}

For the vast majority of cancers, risk factors are environmental or lifestyle-related, thus cancers are mostly preventable NCD.&lt;ref name=Danaei&gt;{{cite journal |author= Danaei G, Vander Hoorn S, Lopez AD, Murray CJ, Ezzati M |title= Causes of cancer in the world: comparative risk assessment of nine behavioural and environmental risk factors |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9499 |pages=1784–93 |year=2005 |pmid=16298215 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67725-2|last2= Vander Hoorn |last3= Lopez |last4= Murray |last5= Ezzati |author6= Comparative Risk Assessment collaborating group (Cancers) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater than 30% of cancer is preventable via avoiding risk factors including: [[tobacco]], being [[overweight]] or [[obesity]], low fruit and vegetable intake, [[physical inactivity]], [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, and [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/ |title=Cancer |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infectious agents are responsible for some cancers, for instance almost all [[cervical cancer]]s are caused by [[human papillomavirus]] infection.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===
{{main | Cardiovascular disease}}

The first studies on cardiovascular health were performed in 1949 by [[Jerry Morris]] using occupational health data and were published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris JN, Crawford MD |title=Coronary heart disease and physical activity of work; evidence of a national necropsy survey |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=5111 |pages=1485–96 |date=December 1958 |pmid=13608027 |pmc=2027542 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5111.1485|last2=Crawford }}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes, prevention, and/or treatment of all forms of cardiovascular disease remain active fields of [[biomedical research]], with hundreds of scientific studies being published on a weekly basis. A trend has emerged, particularly in the early 2000s, in which numerous studies have revealed a link between fast food and an increase in heart disease. These studies include those conducted by the Ryan Mackey Memorial Research Institute, Harvard University and the Sydney Center for Cardiovascular Health. Many major fast food chains, particularly McDonald's, have protested the methods used in these studies and have responded with healthier menu options.

A fairly recent emphasis is on the link between low-grade [[inflammation]] that hallmarks atherosclerosis and its possible interventions. [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) is a common inflammatory marker that has been found to be present in increased levels in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20024640|year=2009|last1=Karakas|first1=M|last2=Koenig|first2=W|title=CRP in cardiovascular disease|volume=34|issue=8|pages=607–13|doi=10.1007/s00059-009-3305-7|journal=Herz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also [[osteoprotegerin]] which involved with regulation of a key inflammatory transcription factor called [[NF-κB]] has been found to be a risk factor of cardiovascular disease and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20448212|year=2010|last1=Lieb|first1=W|last2=Gona|first2=P|last3=Larson|first3=MG|last4=Massaro|first4=JM|last5=Lipinska|first5=I|last6=Keaney Jr|first6=JF|last7=Rong|first7=J|last8=Corey|first8=D|last9=Hoffmann|first9=U|last10=Fox|first10=C.

=== Diabetes ===
{{main | Diabetes}}

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition which is largely preventable and manageable but difficult to cure.  Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal ("euglycemia") as possible without presenting undue [[patient]] danger.  This can usually be with close dietary management, exercise, and use of appropriate medications (insulin only in the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus.  Oral medications may be used in the case of type 2 diabetes, as well as insulin).

Patient education, understanding, and participation is vital since the complications of diabetes are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.&lt;!--

Wider health problems may accelerate the deleterious effects of diabetes. These include [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[hypercholesterolemia|elevated cholesterol]] levels, [[obesity]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and lack of regular [[exercise]].

=== Chronic kidney disease ===
{{main|Chronic kidney disease}}

Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not currently identified as one of WHO's main targets for global NCD control, there is compelling evidence that CKD is not only common, harmful and treatable but also a major contributing factor to the incidence and outcomes of at least three of the diseases targeted by WHO (diabetes, hypertension and CVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang |first=Q.L. |last2=Rothenbacher |first2=D. |title=Prevalence of chronic kidney disease in population-based studies: systematic review|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-8-117 |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=8 |pages=117 |year=2008 |pmid=18405348 |pmc=2377260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CKD strongly predisposes to hypertension and CVD; diabetes, hypertension and CVD are all major causes of CKD; and major risk factors for diabetes, hypertension and CVD (such as obesity and smoking) also cause or exacerbate CKD. In addition, among people with diabetes, hypertension, or CVD, the subset who also have CKD are at highest risk of adverse outcomes and high health care costs. Thus, CKD, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are closely associated conditions that often coexist; share common risk factors and treatments; and would benefit from a coordinated global approach to prevention and control.

=== Chronic respiratory disease ===
''Main Article: [[Respiratory disease#Chronic respiratory disease|Chronic respiratory disease]]''

Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRDs) are diseases of the lungs and airways.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO) hundreds of millions of people suffer daily from CRDs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/about_topic/en/|title=WHO {{!}} About chronic respiratory diseases|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common CRDs are: [[Asthma]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[Occupational lung disease]], and [[Pulmonary hypertension]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/en/|title=Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs)|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While CRDs are not curable, various treatments are available to help improve quality of life for individuals who have them.  Most treatments involve dilating major airways to improve shortness of breath among other symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The main risk factors for developing CRDs are: tobacco smoking, indoor and outdoor air pollution, allergens, and occupational risks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

WHO helped launch the [[Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases]] (GARD) in 2006.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/gard/en/|title=Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GARD is voluntarily composed of national and international organizations and works toward "reducing the global burden of chronic respiratory diseases" and focus mainly on vulnerable populations and low and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/gard/en/|title=Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''North America''' is a [[continent]] entirely within the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and almost all within the [[Western Hemisphere]]; it is also considered by some to be a northern [[subcontinent]] of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name=britannica-northamerica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/418612/North-America|title = North America|publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate = 3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/contnent.htm | title = Map And Details Of All 7 Continents |publisher = worldatlas.com|quote=In some parts of the world students are taught that there are only six continents, as they combine North America and South America into one continent called the Americas.|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered to the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], to the west and south by the [[Pacific Ocean]], and to the southeast by [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]].

North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers&lt;!--spelled out per WP:MOSNUM --&gt; (9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5% of the [[earth|earth's]] land area and about 4.8% of its total surface.
North America is the third largest continent by area, following [[Asia]] and [[Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/nalandst.htm|title=North America Land Forms and Statistics|publisher=World Atlas.com|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of continents by population|fourth]] by population after Asia, Africa, and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/nafacts.htm|title=North America Fast Facts|publisher=World Atlas.com|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in North America|23 independent states]], or about 7.5% of the world's population, if nearby islands (most notably the [[Caribbean]]) are included.

North America was reached by its [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|first human populations]] during the [[last glacial period]], via crossing the [[Bering land bridge]] approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago. The so-called [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]] period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago (the beginning of the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic or Meso-Indian]] period). The [[Classic stage]] spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries. The [[Pre-Columbian era]] ended in 1492, and the [[transatlantic migrations]]—the arrival of European settlers during the [[Age of Discovery]] and the [[Early Modern period]]. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect different kinds of interactions between [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] and their descendants.

European influences are strongest in the northern parts of the continent while indigenous and African influences are relatively stronger in the south.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Because of the history of colonialism, most North Americans speak English, Spanish or French and societies and states commonly reflect [[Western civilization|Western traditions]].

== Name ==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
[[File:Historisch Nordamerika.jpg|thumb|Map of North America, from 1621]]
[[The Americas]] are usually accepted as having been named after the Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] by the German cartographers [[Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626894/Amerigo-Vespucci |title= Amerigo Vespucci |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vespucci, who explored South America between 1497 and 1502, was the first [[Europe]]an to suggest that the Americas were not the [[East Indies]], but a different landmass previously unknown by Europeans. In 1507, Waldseemüller produced a world map, in which he placed the word "America" on the continent of South America, in the middle of what is today Brazil. He explained the rationale for the name in the accompanying book ''Cosmographiae Introductio'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bOg4Nroos4C |title=The Cosmographiæ Introductio of Martin Waldseemüller in Facsimile |others=Translated by Edward Burke and Mario E. Cosenza, introduction by Joseph Fischer and Franz von Wieser |editor-last=Herbermann |editor-first=Charles George |place=New York |publisher=The United States Catholic Historical Society |year=1907 |page=9 |quote={{lang-la|"Quarta pars per Americum Vesputium (ut in sequentibus audietur) inventa est, quam non video, cur quis jure vetet, ab Americo inventore sagacis ingenii viro Amerigen quasi Americi terram sive Americam dicendam, cum et Europa et Asia a mulieribus sua sortita sint nomina."}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|la|... ab Americo inventore ... quasi Americi terram sive Americam}} (from Americus the discoverer ... as if it were the land of Americus, thus America).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Waldseemüller, no one should object to the naming of the land after its discoverer. He used the Latinized version of Vespucci's name (Americus Vespucius), but in its feminine form "America", following the examples of "Europa", "Asia" and "Africa".

Later, other mapmakers extended the name ''America'' to the northern continent, In 1538, [[Gerard Mercator]] used ''America'' on his map of the world for all the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html |title=The Naming of America: Fragments We've Shored Against Ourselves |author=Jonathan Cohen |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that the convention is to use the surname for naming discoveries except in the case of royalty and so a derivation from "Amerigo Vespucci" could be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=John |authorlink=John Lloyd (producer) |last2=Mitchinson |first2=John |title=The Book of General Ignorance |year=2006 |publisher=Harmony Books |isbn=978-0-307-39491-0 |page=95 |quote=New countries or continents were never named after a person's first name, but always after the second ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricardo Palma (1949) proposed a derivation from the "Amerrique" mountains of Central America—Vespucci was the first to discover South America and the ''Amerrique'' mountains of [[Central America]], which connected his discoveries to those of [[Christopher Columbus]].

[[Alfred Hudd|Alfred E. Hudd]] proposed a theory in 1908 that the continents are named after a Welsh merchant named [[Richard Amerike]] from [[Bristol]], who is believed to have financed [[John Cabot]]'s voyage of discovery from England to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1497. A minutely explored belief that has been advanced is that America was named for a Spanish sailor bearing the ancient [[Visigothic]] name of 'Amairick'. Another is that the name is rooted in a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] language.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

== &lt;span id="Usage of the term"&gt;Extent&lt;/span&gt; ==

The United Nations formally recognizes "North America" as comprising three areas: Northern America, Central America, and The Caribbean.

The term ''North America'' maintains various definitions in accordance with location and context. In [[Canadian English]], ''North America'' generally refers to the land mass as a whole consisting of Mexico, the United States, and Canada, although it is generally ambiguous which other countries are included, and is mostly defined by context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/north_america-amerique_nord/index.aspx?lang=eng|title=The North American relationship|last=Government of Canada|first=Global Affairs Canada|website=GAC|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/usmca-aeumc/index.aspx?lang=eng|title=United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)|last=Government of Canada|first=Foreign Affairs Trade and Development Canada|website=GAC|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebusinesscouncil.ca/issues/north-america/|title=North America – Business Council of Canada|work=Business Council of Canada|access-date=1 November 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States of America, usage of the term may refer only to Canada and the USA, and sometimes includes [[Greenland]]&lt;ref name="CIAGreenland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CountryReports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eNotes"/&gt; and Mexico (as in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]),&lt;ref name="CountryReports"&gt;{{cite web|title=Countries in North America – Country Reports |url=http://www.countryreports.org/maps/northamerica.aspx |publisher=Country Reports |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427050055/http://www.countryreports.org/maps/northamerica.aspx |archivedate=27 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trilateral&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Region |url=http://www.trilateral.org/go.cfm?do=Page.View&amp;pid=12 |publisher=The Trilateral Commission |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021204534/http://www.trilateral.org/go.cfm?do=Page.View&amp;pid=12 |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="epa" /&gt;&lt;ref name=About.com /&gt; as well as offshore islands.

In [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Romania]], [[Greece]], and the countries of Latin America, the [[cognate]]s of ''North America'' usually designate a subcontinent of the Americas comprising Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and often Greenland, Saint Pierre et Miquelon, and Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mx.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562468/Norteam%C3%A9rica.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130015145/http://mx.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562468/Norteam%C3%A9rica.html |archivedate=30 January 2009 |title=Norteamérica |trans-title=North America |language=Spanish|quote=In Ibero-America, ''North America'' is considered a subcontinent containing Canada, the United States, Mexico, Greenland, Bermuda and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six or Seven Continents on Earth|url=http://geography.about.com/od/learnabouttheearth/qt/qzcontinents.htm|accessdate=18 December 2016|language=English}} "In Europe and other parts of the world, many students are taught of six continents, where North and South America are combined to form a single continent of America.

North America has been historically referred to by other names. Spanish North America ([[New Spain]]) was often referred to as ''[[Northern America]]'', and this was the [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|first official name]] given to Mexico.&lt;ref name=AGN&gt;{{cite web|title=Acta Solemne de la Declaración de Independencia de la América Septentrional|trans-title=Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|url=http://www.agn.gob.mx/independencia/documentos.html|work=Archivos de la Independencia|publisher=Archivo General de la Nación|accessdate=8 July 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically the North American continent has many regions and subregions. These include cultural, economic, and geographic regions. Economic regions included those formed by trade blocs, such as the North American Trade Agreement bloc and Central American Trade Agreement. Linguistically and culturally, the continent could be divided into [[Anglo-America]] and Latin America. Anglo-America includes most of Northern America, [[Belize]], and Caribbean islands with English-speaking populations (though sub-national entities, such as [[Louisiana]] and [[Quebec]], have large [[Francophone]] populations; in Quebec, French is the sole official language&lt;ref name=language&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html|title=Status of the French language|author=Office Québécois de la langue francaise|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=10 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514153402/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html|archivedate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Original French: http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/charte/charte/clflgoff.html --&gt;).

The southern North American continent is composed of two regions. These are Central America and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name=BritannicaCA&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Central America|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861670266/Central_America.html|publisher=Encarta Encyclopedia|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Caribbean|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well. In contrast to the common definition of "North America", which encompasses the whole continent, the term "North America" is sometimes used to refer only to Mexico, Canada, the United States, and Greenland.&lt;ref name="CIAGreenland"&gt;{{cite web |title= The World Factbook – North America |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/wfbExt/region_noa.html |accessdate=20 June 2011 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CountryReports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eNotes"&gt;{{cite web|title=North America: World of Earth Science |url=http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/north-america |publisher=eNotes Inc. |accessdate=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220133458/http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/north-america |archivedate=20 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trilateral /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons |first=Alan |last2=Schaffer |first2=Jonathan |title=Geopolitics of oil and natural gas |publisher=U.S. Department of State |series=Economic Perspectives |date=May 2004}}{{full citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest countries of the continent, Canada and the United States, also contain well-defined and recognized regions. In the case of Canada these are (from east to west) [[Atlantic Canada]], Central Canada, [[Canadian Prairies]], the [[British Columbia Coast]], and Northern Canada. These regions also contain many subregions. In the case of the United States – and in accordance with the US Census Bureau definitions – these regions are: [[New England]], [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]], [[South Atlantic States]], [[East North Central States]], [[West North Central States]], [[East South Central States]], [[West South Central States]], [[Mountain States]], and [[Pacific States]]. Regions shared between both nations included the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]]. [[Megalopolis (city type)|Megalopolises]] have formed between both nations in the case of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the [[Great Lakes Megaregion]].

=== Geologic history ===
[[File:NorthAmerica-WaterDivides.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Principal hydrological divides of Canada, the United States and Mexico]]

[[Laurentia]] is an ancient [[craton]] which forms the geologic core of North America; it formed between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago during the [[Proterozoic]] eon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dalziel |first=I.W.D. |year=1992 |title=On the organization of American Plates in the Neoproterozoic and the breakout of Laurentia |journal=GSA Today |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=237–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Shield]] is the largest exposure of this craton. From the Late [[Paleozoic]] to Early [[Mesozoic]] eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]], with [[Eurasia]] to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the [[Appalachian Mountains]], which [[Taconic orogeny|formed]] some 480 million years ago, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 million years ago, North America became part of [[Laurasia]], before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-[[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merali |first1=Zeeya |last2=Skinner |first2=Brian J. |title=Visualizing Earth Science |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-41847-5|date=9 January 2009 }}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the [[Laramide orogeny]], between 80 and 55 million years ago. The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 million years ago,&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/50450-when-panama-land-bridge-appeared.html|title=Land Bridge Linking Americas Rose Earlier Than Thought|work=LiveScience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Lakes]] (as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.

North America is the source of much of what humanity knows about [[geologic time]] periods.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-american" /&gt; The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of [[dinosaur]]s than any other modern country.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-american" /&gt; According to [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] Peter Dodson, this is primarily due to stratigraphy, climate and geography, human resources, and history.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-american"/&gt; Much of the Mesozoic Era is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-american"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodson |first=Peter |year=1997 |chapter=American Dinosaurs |title=Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs |editor1-last=Currie |editor1-first=Phillip J. |editor2-last=Padian |editor2-first=Kevin |publisher=Academic Press |pages=10–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant [[Late Jurassic]] dinosaur-bearing fossil deposit in North America is the [[Morrison Formation]] of the western United States.&lt;ref name="jurassicdistribution"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weishampel |first=David B. |year=2004 |title=Dinosaur distribution (Late Jurassic, North America)|editor-last1=Weishampel |editor-first1=David B. |editor2-last=Dodson |editor2-first=Peter |editor3-last=Halszka |editor3-first=Osmólska |series=The Dinosauria |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |pages=543–545 |isbn=978-0-520-24209-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pre-Columbian|Before contact with Europeans]], the natives of North America were divided into many different polities, from small [[Band society|bands]] of a few families to large empires. They lived in several "[[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|culture areas]]", which roughly correspond to [[Geography of North America|geographic and biological zones]] and give a good indication of the main [[lifeway]] or occupation of the people who lived there (e.g., the [[Plains Bison|bison]] [[hunter-gatherer|hunters]] of the [[Plains Indian|Great Plains]], or the farmers of [[Mesoamerica]]). Native groups can also be classified by their [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language family]] (e.g., [[Athabaskan languages|Athapascan]] or [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]]). Peoples with similar languages did not always share the same [[material culture]], nor were they always [[allies]]. Anthropologists think that the Inuit people of the high [[Arctic]] came to North America much later than other native groups, as evidenced by the disappearance of [[Dorset culture]] artifacts from the [[archaeological record]], and their replacement by the [[Thule people]].

During the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. One of the oldest cultures yet found is the [[Clovis culture]] of modern [[New Mexico]]. Later cultures include the [[Mississippian culture]] and related [[Mound builder (people)|Mound building]] cultures, found in the [[Mississippi river]] valley and the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Pueblo culture]] of what is now the [[Four Corners]]. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the [[domestication]] of many common [[crops]] now used around the world, such as tomatoes and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. Perhaps most importantly they domesticated one of the world's major staples, maize (corn).

The earliest verifiable instance of [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]] by any European culture with the landmasses that geologically constitute the "mainland" of modern North America has been dated to the end of the 10th century CE – this site, situated at the northernmost extent of the island named [[Newfoundland]], is known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], where unmistakable evidence of [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement was uncovered in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Ingstad and A. Stine Ingstad, ''The Viking Discovery of America'' (2000), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many important cultural advances were made there. For example, the [[Maya civilization]] developed a [[Maya script|writing system]], built [[Mesoamerican pyramids|huge pyramids and temples]], had a [[Maya calendar|complex calendar]], and developed the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] around 400 CE, a few hundred years after the [[Mesopotamians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-origin-of-zer | title = What is the origin of zero? How did we indicate nothingness before zero? | author = Robert Kaplan | publisher = Scientific American | date = 16 January 2007 | accessdate =19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayan culture was still present in [[Yucatan Peninsula|southern Mexico]] and Guatemala when the [[Conquistadors|Spanish]] explorers arrived, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the [[Aztec Empire]] whose capital city [[Tenochtitlan]] was located further north in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by [[Hernán Cortés]].&lt;ref name=Grunberg&gt;Bernard Grunberg, ''"La folle aventure d'Hernan Cortés''", in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007 {{incomplete short citation|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Discovery]], Europeans explored and staked claims to various parts of North America. Upon their arrival in the "[[New World]]", the Native American population [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|declined substantially]], because of violent conflicts with the invaders and the introduction of European diseases to which the Native Americans lacked immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise History of World Population: An Introduction to Population Processes |last=Massimo Livi Bacci |first=Malden |place=Massachusetts |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2001 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-631-22335-1 |pages=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native culture changed drastically and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed. Several linguistic groups [[Language death|died out]], and others changed quite quickly. The names and cultures that Europeans recorded were not necessarily the same as the names they had used a few generations before, or the ones in use today.

Britain, [[Spain]], and France took over extensive territories in North America – and fought over them. In the late 18th century and beginning of the 19th, independence movements that sprung up across the continent, led to the creation of the modern countries in the area. The 13 British colonies on the North Atlantic coast declared independence in 1776, becoming the [[United States of America]]. Canada was formed from the unification of northern territories controlled by Britain and France. New Spain, a territory that stretched from modern-day southern US to Central America, declared independence in 1810, becoming the [[First Mexican Empire]]. In 1823 the former [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], then part of the Mexican Empire, became the first [[sovereign state|independent state]] in Central America, officially changing its name to the [[Federal Republic of Central America|United Provinces of Central America]].

The [[Gulf of Mexico]] is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by [[Hudson Bay]]. Others include the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the [[Gulf of California]].

Before the Central American isthmus formed, the region had been underwater. The islands of the [[West Indies]] delineate a submerged former [[land bridge]], which had connected North and South America via what are now [[Florida]] and [[Venezuela]].

There are numerous islands off the continent's coasts; principally, the Arctic Archipelago, the [[Bahamas]], [[Turks &amp; Caicos]], the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], the [[Aleutian Islands]] (some of which are in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] proper), the [[Alexander Archipelago]], the many thousand islands of the British Columbia Coast, and Newfoundland. Greenland, a self-governing Danish island, and the [[list of islands by area|world's largest]], is on the same [[tectonic plate]] (the [[North American Plate]]) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island which was formed on the fissure of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] over 100 million years ago. The nearest landmass to it is [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]]. However, Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, political and cultural ties to [[Virginia]] and other parts of the continent.
[[File:Moraine Lake.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moraine Lake]] in [[Banff National Park]]]]
The vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate. Parts of western Mexico, including Baja California, and of [[California]], including the cities of [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], lie on the eastern edge of the [[Pacific Plate]], with the two plates meeting along the [[San Andreas fault]]. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies lie on the [[Caribbean Plate]], whereas the [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]] and [[Cocos Plate|Cocos plates]] border the North American Plate on its western frontier.

The continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the [[Great Plains]] stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]]; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Great Basin]], [[Geography of California|California]] and [[Alaska]]; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the Appalachian Mountains, the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long [[plateau]]s and [[American cordillera|cordilleras]], falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.

The western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|coast ranges]] in California, [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[British Columbia]], with the Great Basin—a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts—in between. The highest peak is [[Denali]] in Alaska.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20120722022527/http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html United States Geographical Survey (USGS)] states that the geographic center of North America is "6 miles [10 km] west of [[Balta, North Dakota|Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota]]" at about {{Coord|48|10|N|100|10|W}}, about {{convert|15|mi|km|order=flip}} from [[Rugby, North Dakota]].

Geologically, Canada is one of the oldest regions in the world, with more than half of the region consisting of [[precambrian]] rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the [[Palaeozoic]] era.&lt;ref name="Marianopolis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace |first=Stewart W. |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/GeologyofCanada.htm |title=Geology Of Canada |series=The Encyclopedia of Canada |volume=III |place=Toronto |publisher=University Associates of Canada |year=1948 |pages=23–26 |via=[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/ Marianopolis College] |accessdate=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704145706/http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/GeologyofCanada.htm |archivedate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive.&lt;ref name="Marianopolis"/&gt; Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, [[zinc]], copper, gold, lead, [[molybdenum]], and [[uranium]] reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/16-12/ff_diamonds_sb |title=Digging for Diamonds 24/7 Under Frozen Snap Lake |publisher=Wired |website=Wired.com |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the [[Sudbury Basin]] is an ancient [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]. The nearby, but less known [[Temagami Magnetic Anomaly]] has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.&lt;ref name="GH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html |title=3-D Magnetic Imaging using Conjugate Gradients: Temagami anomaly |accessdate=13 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711184237/http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html |archivedate=11 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.

=== United States geology ===
The [[Continental United States|lower 48 US states]] can be divided into roughly five [[physiography|physiographic]] provinces:
# The American cordillera
# The Canadian Shield&lt;ref name="Marianopolis"/&gt; Northern portion of the upper midwestern United States.
# The stable platform
# The coastal plain
# The Appalachian [[orogeny|orogenic]] belt

The geology of Alaska is typical of that of the cordillera, while the major islands of Hawaii consist of [[Neogene]] [[volcano|volcanics]] erupted over a [[hotspot (geology)|hot spot]].

=== Central American geology ===
[[File:Tectonic plates Caribbean.png|thumb|right|{{legend|#FAD4AF|Central America rests in the [[Caribbean Plate]].}}]]

Central America is geologically active with [[volcanic eruption]]s and earthquakes occurring from time to time. In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|major earthquake]], killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killing about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated El Salvador, one in 1986 and two in 2001; one [[2009 Costa Rica earthquake|earthquake]] devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009, killing at least 34 people; in [[2009 Honduras earthquake|Honduras]] a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009.

Volcanic eruptions are common in the region. In 1968 the [[Arenal Volcano]], in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.

Central America has many [[mountain range]]s; the longest are the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]], the [[Cordillera Isabelia]], and the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]]. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people; in fact, most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee, beans, and other crops.

North America is a very large continent which surpasses the [[Arctic Circle]], and the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. Greenland, along with the [[Canadian Shield]], is tundra with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|10|to|20|°C}}, but central Greenland is composed of a very large ice sheet. This tundra radiates throughout Canada, but its border ends near the Rocky Mountains (but still contains Alaska) and at the end of the Canadian Shield, near the Great Lakes.

=== Languages ===
{{main article|Languages of North America}}
[[File:Languages of the Americas.PNG|thumb|Languages spoken in the Americas]]
The dominant [[languages in North America]] are English, Spanish, and French. Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], and Dutch is spoken side by side local languages in the [[Netherlands Antilles|Dutch Caribbean]]. The term Anglo-America is used to refer to the [[English language|anglophone]] countries of the Americas: namely Canada (where English and French are co-official) and the United States, but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics, especially the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]]. Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the United States) where the [[Romance language]]s, derived from [[Latin language|Latin]], of Spanish and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (but French speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America (but not always Belize), part of the Caribbean (not the Dutch-, English-, or French-speaking areas), Mexico, and most of South America (except [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[French Guiana]] (France), and the [[Falkland Islands]] (UK)).

The French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially bilingual. French is the official language of the Province of Quebec, where 95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language, and it is co-official with English in the Province of [[New Brunswick]]. Other French-speaking locales include the Province of [[Ontario]] (the official language is English, but there are an estimated 600,000 Franco-Ontarians), the Province of [[Manitoba]] (co-official as ''[[de jure]]'' with English), the [[French West Indies]] and [[Saint-Pierre et Miquelon]], as well as the US state of Louisiana, where French is also an official language. Haiti is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both [[Haitian Creole language|Creole]] and French. Similarly, French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia and the [[Commonwealth of Dominica]] alongside English.

While the United States, Canada, and Mexico maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. There are also large cities in the Caribbean.

These causes included warm temperatures, retirement of [[Baby Boomers]], large industry, and the influx of immigrants. Cities near the United States border, particularly in Mexico, are also experiencing large amounts of growth. Most notable is [[Tijuana]], a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia. Yet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America, they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of [[water shortages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cetron |first1=Marvin J. |last2=O'Toole |first2=Thomas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_VGAAAAMAAJ |title=Encounters with the future: a forecast of life into the 21st century |publisher=Mcgraw-Hill |date=April 1982 |page=34|isbn=9780070103474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight of the top ten [[metropolitan areas]] [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|are located in the United States]].

These [[urban agglomerations]] are observed at their largest and most productive in [[Detroit–Windsor]] and [[San Diego–Tijuana]] and experience large commercial, economic, and cultural activity. The metropolitan areas are responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international freight.

North America has also been witness to the growth of [[megapolitan area]]s. In the United States exists eleven megaregions that transcend international borders and comprise Canadian and Mexican metropolitan regions. These are the [[Arizona Sun Corridor]], Cascadia, Florida, [[Front Range Urban Corridor|Front Range]], Great Lakes Megaregion, [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast Megaregion]], [[Northeast megalopolis|Northeast]], [[Northern California]], [[Piedmont Atlantic]], Southern California, and the [[Texas Triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagler, Yoav (2009). "Defining U.S. Megaregions." New York: [[Regional Plan Association]].{{full citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and Mexico are also the home of megaregions. These include the [[Quebec City – Windsor Corridor]], [[Golden Horseshoe]] – both of which are considered part of the Great Lakes Megaregion – and megalopolis of [[Central Mexico]]. Traditionally the largest megaregion has been considered the Boston-Washington, DC Corridor, or the Northeast, as the region is one massive contiguous area. Yet [[United States megapolitan areas#Megaregions and planning: A brief history|megaregion criterion]] have allowed the Great Lakes Megalopolis to maintain status as the most populated region, being home to 53,768,125 people in 2000.&lt;ref name=RPA08&gt;Regional Plan Association (2008).

The Caribbean trade bloc – CARICOM – came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 Caribbean nations. As of 2000, CARICOM trade volume was US$96 billion. CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a [[CARICOM passport|common passport]] for associated nations. In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on [[Free Trade Agreement]]s and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations (OTN) free trade agreements have been signed into effect.

Integration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in 1961; this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation. Recent implementation of the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) has left the future of the CACM unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Central American Community and Market |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0811094.html |publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate= 3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, and the United States. The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA. In addition to the United States, Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs. Currently under proposal, the [[Canada – Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CA4) would operate much the same as CAFTA with the United States does.

These nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs. Mexico takes a part in the [[G3 Free Trade Agreement]] with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU. The United States has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the [[Transatlantic Free Trade Area]] between itself and the [[European Union]]; the [[US-Middle East Free Trade Area]] between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself; and the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]] between Southeast Asian nations, Australia, and New Zealand.

{{main article|Transportation in North America}}
[[File:PanAmericanHwy.png|thumb|The full [[Pan American Highway]] (including South America), from [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska]] to [[Ushuaia]], Argentina]]

The [[Pan-American Highway]] route in the Americas is the portion of a network of roads nearly {{Convert|48000|km|mi|abbr = on}} in length which travels through the mainland nations. No definitive length of the Pan-American Highway exists because the US and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan-American Highway, and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the US border. However, the total length of the portion from Mexico to the northern extremity of the highway is roughly {{convert|16000|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

[[File:Class1rr.png|thumb|left|2006 map of the North American [[Class I railroad]] network]]

The First Transcontinental Railroad in the United States was built in the 1860s, linking the railroad network of the eastern US with California on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast. Finished on 10 May 1869 at the famous [[golden spike]] event at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the [[U.S. West|American West]], catalyzing the transition from the [[wagon train]]s of previous decades to a modern transportation system.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/ |title = Ceremony at "Wedding of the Rails", May 10, 1869 at Promontory Point, Utah |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 10 May 1869 |accessdate = 20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern US railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR) had, by 1867, already accumulated more than {{convert|2055|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track by connecting Ontario with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as [[Port Huron, Michigan]], through [[Sarnia, Ontario]].

=== Communications ===
A shared telephone system known as the [[North American Numbering Plan]] (NANP) is an integrated [[telephone numbering plan]] of 24 countries and territories: the United States and its [[Insular area|territories]], Canada, Bermuda, and 17 [[Caribbean]] nations.

== Culture ==
Canada and the United States were both [[British America|former British colonies]]. There is frequent cultural interplay between the United States and English-speaking Canada. Greenland shares some cultural ties with the indigenous people of Canada but is considered [[Nordic Countries|Nordic]] and has strong Danish ties due to [[Danish colonization of the Americas|centuries of colonization by Denmark]]. Spanish-speaking North America shares a common past as former [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]]. In Mexico and the Central American countries where civilizations like the Maya developed, indigenous people preserve traditions across modern boundaries. Central American and Spanish-speaking Caribbean nations have historically had more in common due to geographical proximity.

Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of [[Monterrey]], Tijuana, [[Ciudad Juárez]], and [[Mexicali]], is strongly influenced by the [[Culture of the United States|culture]] and [[American way|way of life of the United States]]. Of the aforementioned cities, Monterrey has been regarded as the most [[Americanization|Americanized]] city in Mexico.&lt;ref name="MonterreyFall"&gt;{{cite news |title=Special report: If Monterrey falls Mexico falls – Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=1 June 2011 |last=Emmot |first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immigration to the United States]] and [[Immigration to Canada|Canada]] remains a significant attribute of many nations close to the southern border of the US. The [[Anglophone Caribbean|Anglophone Caribbean states]] have witnessed the decline of the [[British Empire]] and its influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America. In the Anglophone Caribbean. This is partly due to the relatively small populations of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, and also because many of them now have more people [[expatriate|living abroad]] than those remaining at home. Northern Mexico, the Western United States and [[Alberta]], Canada share a [[cowboy]] culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25317">In [[world systems theory]], the '''periphery countries''' (sometimes referred to as just '''the periphery''') are those that are less developed than the [[semi-periphery countries|semi-periphery]] and [[core countries]].  These countries usually receive [[International inequality|a disproportionately small share of global wealth]]. They have weak state institutions and are dependent on – according to some, exploited by – more developed countries. These countries are usually behind because of obstacles such as lack of technology, unstable government, and poor education and health systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/25642636/_Peripheral_Realism_Revisited_in_Revista_Brasileira_de_Pol%C3%ADtica_Internacional_59_1_1-18|title=Peripheral Realism Revisited|first1=Carlos |last1=Escudé|first2=Luis L|last2=Schenoni|publisher=|journal=Revista Brasileira de Política Internacional|volume=59|issue=1|pp=1-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, the exploitation of periphery countries' agriculture, cheap labor, and natural resources aid core countries in remaining dominant. This is best described by [[dependency theory]],&lt;ref name= Shannon&gt;Thomas Shannon. An Introduction to the World-System Perspective. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; which is one [[theory]] on how [[globalization]] can affect the world and the countries in it. It is, however, possible for periphery countries to rise out of their status and move into semi-periphery or core status. This can be done by doing things such as [[Industrialisation|industrializing]], stabilizing the government and political climate, etc.

Based on the list in Dunn, Kawana, Brewer (2000).{{update-inline|date=May 2018}}]]

==Background==

Periphery countries are those that exist on the outer edges of global trade.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} There could be many reasons for a country to be considered peripheral, such as a dysfunctional or inefficient government.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} For example, some nations customs and ports are so inefficient that even though they are geographically closer it is cheaper to ship goods from longer distances.&lt;ref name=dollar&gt;Dollar, David, "Globalization, Inequality, and Poverty since 1980" Development Research Group, World Bank. November 2001, Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons such as wars, non-central location, insufficient infrastructure (rail lines, roads and communications) will keep a country in the periphery of global trade.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Generally the populations tend to be poor and destitute so the core countries will exploit them for cheap labor and will even purposely interfere with their politics to keep things this way.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Usually a peripheral country will specialize in one particular industry, leaving it vulnerable to economic instability and limiting international investment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Sometimes countries decide to isolate themselves, such as 14th century China.&lt;ref name=Before&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet L., "Before European Hegemony" Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
There are a variety of reasons that periphery countries remain the way they are. One important factor that keeps countries in the periphery is the lack of development of [[technology]].&lt;ref name = world&gt;Immanuel Wallerstein. The Modern World System : Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century. Academic press. 1976.http://marriottschool.byu.edu/emp/WPW/Class%209%20-%20The%20World%20System%20Perspective.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Another way periphery countries come to be is either the lack of a central [[government]] or the periphery country is under the control of another country. Periphery countries are known for exporting raw goods to core countries. What tends to happen is the maximum gain a periphery nation could earn is less than needed to maintain an equilibrium between [[cost]]s and [[revenues]]. One thing periphery nations could do is to stop the increase of exports.&lt;ref name = periphery&gt;Raul Prebischb. Commercial Policy in the Underdeveloped Countries. American Economic Association. 1959.https://www.jstor.org/stable/1816120.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 19th century, Asia and Africa were considered periphery and their lack of development enabled the United States and Germany to remain successful core nations.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

Although periphery nations are exploited by core countries, there is a purpose to the unequal exchanges of goods. For instance, the core countries have an incentive to gain a [[Profit (economics)|profit]] and this enables the [[world]] [[Market (economics)|market]] to further grow. At times, there is a change in the balance of trade between the periphery and core countries. This occurs when the prices of [[exports]] from periphery countries decrease at a faster rate than the exports from core nations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In this case, the [[governments]] of the periphery nation are affected in several ways. For instance, there is an increase in [[unemployment]] as well as a decrease in state income. This type of interaction is unique because the core country involved is somewhat weaker than normal. An example of this occurring is the growth of the industrial capabilities of [[Italy]] and [[Russia]] towards the end of the 19th century. This has also occurred in other periphery nations such as [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name= global&gt;Immanuel Wallerstein. Dependence in an Interdependent World: The Limited Possibilities of Transformation within the Capitalist World Economy. African Studies Association. April 1974.https://www.jstor.org/stable/523574.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===15th century and 16th century===
The world system at this time was much different from the world system of today.  Several areas were beginning to develop into trading powers but none were able to gain total control.  For this reason, a core and periphery developed in each region as opposed to a global scale.  Cities began to become the "core" with the more agricultural countryside becoming a sort of "periphery".  The most underdeveloped region that was still involved in trade at the time was Europe.  It had the weakest core and periphery areas.&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;

Two examples of periphery countries in the late 15th century and early 16th century are [[Poland]] and [[Latin America]]. At this time, Poland was mainly exporting wheat to other areas of [[Europe]] and Poland wanted cheap labor.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; As a result, [[landlord]]s enslaved rural workers on their estate lands. Also, Latin America experienced an enslavement of their natives and imports of [[slaves]] from [[Africa]]. Forced mining labor was placed on the slaves, which enabled Latin America to export cheap goods to Europe.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; Both Poland and Latin America were similar during this time period because the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] of these areas became more wealthy due to their interactions with the [[world economy]]. These areas of the world were also different from during medieval times in Europe. They are different because during the late 15th century and early 16th century, Poland and Latin America were producing goods and exporting them rather than simply consuming their raw goods.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

==Interactions==
The relationship that the periphery countries have with the core countries is one that is defined by the exploitation of the periphery countries by the core countries. As many countries began to [[industrialize]] they looked for cheap goods and products.&lt;ref name=Kardulias&gt;P. Nick Kardulias. World Systems Theory in Practice. https://books.google.com/books?id=fFmBTldqTbsC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=core+periphery+interactions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I6Jm-uPMEJ&amp;sig=ZhpHKHMd-vKpAB96Ewbv4T_9EEM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=J6gPTN26FIOC8gaDpvj6CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=core%20periphery%20interactions&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; These [[industrialized]] "core" countries would then look to the less developed "periphery" countries for cheap goods.  In most cases it is much easier and inexpensive to get these goods from other countries.&lt;ref name= Hobsbawm&gt;Eric Hobsbawm. The Age of Empires. Vintage Books, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  Core countries realized this and began to use these cheap resources.

For the core countries to remain at the core, it is necessary that the periphery countries keep producing these cheap goods and remain mostly [[agricultural]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; The core countries are able to get goods very cheaply from the periphery and then are able to [[manufacture]] products and sell them at a relatively high price.&lt;ref name= Shannon /&gt; The periphery countries are unable to make any gains because of this relationship and it is therefore impossible for them to ever industrialize.  It is argued that if these countries are never able industrialize, they will continue to remain on the periphery.&lt;ref name= Shannon /&gt;

===Imperialism's effect on core-periphery interactions===
The current relationship between core countries and periphery countries was mostly defined in the era of [[imperialism]] that occurred in the late 19th through the early 20th centuries.  It was at this time that the countries with the strongest [[economy|economies]] and militaries began to exploit those countries with weaker states.&lt;ref name= Hobsbawm /&gt;  A result of this exploitation was the tendency of underdeveloped states or [[colony|colonies]] to move more towards the production of one type of [[export]] that would then come to  dominate their land, territory and lifestyle economy.  Some examples of the time include Brazil's [[coffee]] production and Cuba's [[cigar]] production.&lt;ref name= Hobsbawm /&gt;

==Economic possibilities==
Periphery countries are continuously exploited by countries due to the exportation of surpluses of raw goods to the more technologically industrialized core countries for manufacturing and distribution.&lt;ref name=Martinez-Vela&gt;Martinez-Vela. [http://marriottschool.byu.edu/emp/WPW/Class%209%20-%20The%20World%20System%20Perspective.pdf World Systems Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306210823/http://marriottschool.byu.edu/emp/WPW/Class%209%20-%20The%20World%20System%20Perspective.pdf |date=2009-03-06 }}. ESD-83. Fall 20001.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently some of the manufacturing has been moved to periphery countries but it is still controlled and owned by the core countries. There are, however, ways in which periphery countries can rise from their poor status and become semi-periphery countries or even core countries. It is crucial for the core countries to keep exploiting the natural resources of the periphery countries and to keep the governments semi-stable or else it could cause economic unrest for the core countries as a whole.&lt;ref name = Soc&gt;Anderson, Taylor. Sociology, the essentials. Cengage Learning. February 2006. [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7s9hvROWjoC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=sociology+core+countries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xkRctPKLVL&amp;sig=_kKfeGYVSKBSGxFEHJG-s5ypyT4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Olz9S9nlA5TKMeHzzd4H&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sociology%20core%20countries&amp;f=false Sociology, the essentials]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ways to improve===
There are several ways in which periphery countries are able to escape their poor status. Some of these ways are stabilizing their governments, becoming more industrialized and using [[natural resource]]s to benefit themselves rather than core countries, and creating a better [[education system]].&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; Developing a banking system that can compete on a global scale is also another way in which periphery countries can help better themselves in the global market.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt;

====Stabilized government====
One main way in which a periphery country can rise to [[semi-periphery]] or core status is through the stabilization of its government. A country with a [[dictatorship]] type government is much easier to exploit and corrupt than one with a well organized, elected government and core countries use this to their advantage.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; Political unrest is usually a cause for military action from the core countries in order to protect their interests and keep a cooperative dictator or government in power.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; Once the citizens of these countries become exploited enough, they can stage a coup in order to overthrow their government and put someone who they feel will help the country into power.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; If this is done successfully and the new leader is stays true to his/her word, the country can take the next necessary step in rising from periphery status and that is to start to industrialize.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt;

Some [[Neo-Marxists]] believe that it would actually be best for periphery countries to cut all economic and political ties with the core countries.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt; This would, in their opinion, allow the periphery countries to develop and industrialize at their own pace instead of being exploited and driven by core countries demands. Doing this would allow these countries to spend their money on industrializing and bettering themselves, rather than importing goods from core countries. It also would allow these countries to become more independent from the core countries, causing them to move to semi-peripheral status.&lt;ref name = Politics&gt;Duncan, Webster, Switky. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mQIy4FjLEC0C&amp;pg=PA416&amp;dq=%22periphery+countries%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22periphery%20countries%22&amp;f=false World Politics in the 21st Century]. page 416. Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Industrializing====
Most periphery countries rely almost entirely on agriculture and other natural resources such as oil, coal, and diamonds in order to gain some sort of profit, but this also keeps them from growing economically. In order for them to grow they must industrialize in order to produce finished goods for exportation around the world, instead of allowing the core countries to profit from their natural resources. Industrializing and adapting newer technology is one of the major ways in which periphery countries can begin to raise their standard of living and help increase the wealth of their citizens.&lt;ref name = Martinez-Vela/&gt; Becoming industrialized also will help to force trade to come to their cities, if they can produce goods at competitive prices, allowing them to reach out to the global market and take hold.&lt;ref name = Martinez-Vela/&gt; Once a periphery country can industrialize, and use its own resources to its own benefit, it will begin to enter semi-periphery status.

In order for a periphery country to industrialize, it must first undergo [[proto-industrialization]].&lt;ref name = proto/&gt; In this stage, a [[market economy|market-based economy]] begins to form, normally in rural areas, using agricultural products. Proto-industrialization also helps to organize the rural market in these country and allows for them to become more capitalistic. Finally, once these countries develop this style of economy, they can begin to build factories and machines.&lt;ref name = proto&gt;John Hicks. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2117187 A Theory of Economic History]. page 141. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education====
One of the final steps for a periphery country to rise to semi-periphery or core status is to educate its citizens.&lt;ref name = Education/&gt; Raising the [[literacy]] rate allows ideas to spread more quickly through a country and also allows people to better communicate with themselves and the rest of the world. Also once universities are developed a country can begin to research new technology. Researching new technology can help a country to better compete in a global market by becoming more efficient or selling new technology and industrial techniques. If education and industry is allowed to become developed enough it is entirely possible for a periphery country to rise to [[core country]] status and become a leader in the global market.&lt;ref name = Education/&gt; Another way in which periphery countries better their education system is by spending money to send university level students and staff abroad to places such as the U.S. and Europe to receive better education.&lt;ref name = Education&gt;Arnove. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1187395 Comparative Education Systems]. page 48. Comparative and International Education Society. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the people in these countries have become educated enough and they realize their place in the world economy, they can also demand help from the core countries. Although unlikely, due to the fact that the core countries rely on the exploitation of the periphery, there have been pushes for core countries to help better the periphery countries. Some of the ideas suggested are to help aid the periphery countries in developing by exploiting them less, help the periphery countries lose some of their debt and raise the prices on goods coming from these countries to allow them to be more profitable.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt; These policies are obviously not beneficial to the core countries and is mostly why they have never been adapted successfully but this is another way in which the periphery could rise to a higher status.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt;

===Examples===

====Russia====
During the early 20th century the economy of the Russian Empire was a primarily agrarian country with isolated pockets of heavy industries. The Empire fell in 1917; the core of its industrial workers shrank from 3.6 million in 1917 to 1.5 million in 1920.&lt;ref name="R141"&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick (2008). ''The Russian Revolution''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-923767-0}}. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the [[Russian Civil War]] the Soviet Union was [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)#Industrialization in practice|industrialized]] under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Industrialization peaked in 1929-1932 in a [[first five-year plan|rapid campaign]] described as "a revolution from above".&lt;ref name = R121&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick (2008). ''The Russian Revolution''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-923767-0}}. p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  Former personal private farms were [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivized]] in the early 1930s and gradually supplied with tractors and other machinery. Mechanization of farm labor, among other factors, contributed to freeing up workers for the newly built factories. In 1928-1932 alone at least ten million peasants migrated to the cities, causing "an unprecedented demographic upheaval".&lt;ref name="R141"/&gt; Industrialization allowed the country to trade in the global trade market. By the 1950s and 60s, only about 30&amp;nbsp;years after it began to industrialize, the Soviet Union was considered by most scholars a core country along with the United States.

===Adaptation===
Once a periphery country rises up to [[core countries status]] it will be more dependent on other periphery countries for natural resources. They may also start to exploit other periphery countries to continue to better themselves. One of the biggest impacts of this rise of status is the effects it has on the people of these countries. [[Health care]] is one of the first major improvements these countries will see, people will no longer die en masse from diseases such as [[malaria]] and will be better treated for [[non-communicable diseases]].&lt;ref name= "Globalization and NC disease"&gt;Beaglehole, Yach. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T1B-49H6JNK-W&amp;_user=88470&amp;_coverDate=09%2F13%2F2003&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1349324087&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000006998&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=88470&amp;md5=e0d7ec9dbc232f5d0749b718023228d1 Globalisation and the prevention and control of non-communicable disease: the neglected chronic disease of adults].  Elsevier Ltd. 13 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Education]] is also another way in which the citizens will benefit.&lt;ref name = Education/&gt; As a [[country]] becomes richer, it is able to build more [[schools]] and better fund the schools already built. This was seen in Russia after the [[October Revolution]]. A better educated public leads to a more efficient [[workforce]], and can also lead the country to technological breakthroughs in [[industry]] and [[manufacturing]]. These countries will also experience much less severe famine now that they are able to trade successfully on a [[world|global]] scale.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10221">'''Political globalization''' refers to the growth of the worldwide [[political system]], both in size and complexity. That system includes [[Government|national government]]s, their [[governmental organizations|governmental]] and [[intergovernmental organizations]] as well as government-independent elements of [[global civil society]] such as [[international non-governmental organizations]] and [[social movement organization]]s. One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the [[nation-state]] and the rise of other actors on the political scene. The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.

Political globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being [[economic globalization]] and [[cultural globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William R. Thompson]] has defined it as "the expansion of a global political system, and its institutions, in which inter-regional transactions (including, but certainly not limited to trade) are managed".&lt;ref name="ModelskiDevezas2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Modelski|author2=Tessaleno Devezas|author3=William R.

Moghadam defined it as "an increasing trend toward [[multilateralism]] (in which the [[United Nations]] plays a key role), toward an emerging 'transnational state apparatus,' and toward the emergence of national and [[international nongovernmental organizations]] that act as watchdogs over governments and have increased their activities and influence".&lt;ref name="Moghadam2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valentine M.

But it also refers to the spread and influence of [[international non-governmental organization]]s, [[social movement organization]]s and transnational advocacy networks operating across borders and constituting a kind of [[global civil society]]."&lt;ref name="AmentaNash2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Crouch|chapter=Democracy and Capitalism in the Wake of the Financial Crisis|editor1=Edwin Amenta|editor2=Kate Nash|editor3=Alan Scott|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8gk5-a5CUC&amp;pg=PT487|date=2 February 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5507-9|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Gerard Delanty]] and [[Chris Rumford]] define it as "a tension between three processes which interact to produce the complex field of [[global politics]]: global [[geopolitics]], global [[normative culture]] and [[polycentric networks]]."&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
[[Salvatore Babones]] discussing sources used by scholars for studying political globalizations noted the usefulness of [[Europa World Year Book]] for data on diplomatic relationships between countries, publications of [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] such as ''The Military Balance'' for matters of military, and US government publication ''Patterns of Global Terrorism'' for matters of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-152"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political globalization is measured by aggregating and weighting data on the number of embassies and high commissioners in a country, the number of the country's membership in international organization, its participation in the UN peacekeeping missions, and the number of international treaties signed by said country. This measure has been used by [[Axel Dreher]], [[Noel Gaston]], [[Pim Martens]] [[Jeffrey Haynes]] and is available from the [[KOF institute]] at [[ETH Zurich]]&lt;ref name="Haynes2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Haynes|title=Religion and Political Change in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z-DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64|date=7 September 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69699-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welfens2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J.J.

==Aspects==
[[Dimensions of globalization|Like globalization itself]], political globalization has several dimensions and lends itself to a number of interpretations. It has been discussed in the context of new emancipatory possibilities, as well as in the context of loss of autonomy and fragmentation of the social world.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"/&gt; Political globalization can be seen in changes such as [[democratization]] of the world, creation of the global [[civil society]],&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-426"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moving beyond the centrality of the [[nation-state]], particularly as the sole actor in the field of politics.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt; Some of the questions central to the discussion of the political globalization are related to the future of the nation-state, whether its importance is diminishing and what are the causes for those changes; and understanding the emergence of the concept of [[global governance]].&lt;ref name="Steger2003-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA57|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annabelle Mooney|author2=Betsy Evans|title=Globalization: The Key Concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCV-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194|date=12 March 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-20472-4|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political actions by non-governmental organizations and social movements, concerned about various topics such as [[environmental protection]], is another example.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt;

[[David Held]] has proposed that continuing political globalization may lead to the creation of a [[world government]]-like [[cosmopolitan democracy]], though this vision has also been criticized as too idealistic.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-68"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA68|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Globalization and Nation State==
There is a heated debate over Political Globalization and Nation State. The question arises whether or not political globalization signifies the decline of the nation-state. Hyper globalists argue that globalization has engulfed today's world in such a way that state boundaries are beginning to lose significance. However, skeptics disregard this as naiveté, believing that the nation-state remains the supreme actor in international relations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://internationalaffairsbd.com/political-globalization-nation-state/|title=Contemporary Debate on Political Globalization and Nation StateYeg=PA68|author=|first=|last2=|date=2017|publisher=International Affairs, UK|year=|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|location=|page=68|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human '''prehistory''' is the period between the use of the first [[stone tools]] {{circa}} 3.3 million years ago by [[hominin]]s and the invention of [[Writing system|writing systems]]. The earliest writing systems appeared {{circa}} 5,300 years ago, but it took thousands of years for writing to be widely adopted and it was not used in some human cultures until the 19th century or even until present. The end of prehistory therefore came at very different dates in different places, and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently.

[[Sumer]] in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus valley civilization]] and [[ancient Egypt]] were the first civilizations to develop their own scripts, and to keep historical records; this took place already during the early [[Bronze Age]]. Neighboring civilizations were the first to follow. Most other civilizations reached the end of prehistory during the [[Iron Age]].  The [[three-age system]] of division of prehistory into the [[Stone Age]], followed by the Bronze Age and Iron Age, remains in use for much of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]], but is not generally used in those parts of the world where [[metalworking|the working of hard metals]] arrived abruptly with contact with [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian cultures]], such as [[the Americas]], [[Oceania]], [[Australasia]] and much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].  These areas also, with some exceptions in [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian civilizations]] in the Americas, did not develop complex writing systems before the arrival of Eurasians, and their prehistory reaches into relatively recent periods; for example 1788 is usually taken as the end of the [[prehistory of Australia]].     

The period when a culture is written about by others, but has not developed its own writing is often known as the [[protohistory]] of the culture.  By definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary Entry|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/prehistory|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no written records from human prehistory, so dating of prehistoric materials is crucial. Clear techniques for dating were not well-developed until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Graslund, Bo. 1987. ''The birth of prehistoric chronology.'' Cambridge:Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is concerned with human prehistory, the time since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appeared until the beginning of recorded history. Earlier periods are also called "prehistoric"; there are separate articles for the overall [[history of the Earth]] and the [[history of life]] before humans.

;Beginning: The term "prehistory" can refer to the vast span of time since the [[big bang|beginning]] of the [[Universe]] or the Earth, but more often it refers to the period since [[life]] appeared on Earth, or even more specifically to the time since human-like beings appeared.&lt;ref name="fagan07"&gt;Fagan, Brian. 2007. ''World Prehistory: A brief introduction'' New York: Prentice-Hall, Seventh Edition, Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="renfrew"&gt;Renfrew, Colin. 2008. ''Prehistory: The Making of the Human Mind.'' New York: Modern Library&lt;/ref&gt;
;End:The date marking the end of prehistory in a particular culture or region, that is, the date when relevant [[List of languages by first written accounts|written historical]] records become a useful academic resource, varies enormously from region to region. For example, in [[Egypt]] it is generally accepted that prehistory ended around 3200 BCE, whereas in [[New Guinea]] the end of the prehistoric era is set much more recently, at around 1900 [[Common Era|common era]]. In Europe the relatively well-documented classical cultures of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] had neighbouring cultures, including the [[Celts]] and to a lesser extent the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], with little or no writing, and historians must decide how much weight to give to the often highly prejudiced accounts of these "prehistoric" cultures in Greek and Roman literature.
;Time periods: In dividing up human prehistory in Eurasia, historians typically use the [[three-age system]], whereas scholars of pre-human time periods typically use the [[chronostratigraphy|well-defined]] [[geologic record]] and its internationally defined [[stratum]] base within the [[era (geology)|geologic time scale]]. The three-age system is the [[periodization]] of human prehistory into three consecutive [[time period]]s, named for their respective predominant tool-making technologies:
:*[[Stone Age]]
:*[[Bronze Age]]
:*[[Iron Age]]&lt;ref name="Minds"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Matthew Daniel Eddy (Ed.) |title=Prehistoric Minds: Human Origins as a Cultural Artefact |date=2011 |publisher=Royal Society of London |url=https://www.academia.edu/3088568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the term===
The notion of "prehistory" began to surface during the Enlightenment in the work of antiquarians who used the word 'primitive' to describe societies that existed before written records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=Matthew Daniel |title=The Line of Reason: Hugh Blair, Spatiality and the Progressive Structure of Language |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society |year=2011 |volume=65 |pages=9–24 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1112084 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0098}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the word prehistory in English, however, occurred in the ''Foreign [[Quarterly Review]]'' in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Prehistoric Mind as a Historical Artefact|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|year=2011|volume=65|pages=1–8|url=https://www.academia.edu/1130650|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the geologic time scale for pre-human time periods, and of the three-age system for human prehistory, is a system that emerged during the late nineteenth century in the work of British, German and Scandinavian [[Archaeology|archeologists]], [[Antiquarian|antiquarians]] and [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref name="Minds"/&gt;

==Means of research==
The main source for prehistory is [[archaeology]], but some scholars are beginning to make more use of evidence from the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name="Iberia"&gt;The Prehistory of Iberia: Debating Early Social Stratification and the State edited by María Cruz Berrocal, Leonardo García Sanjuán, Antonio Gilman. Pg 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge"&gt;Historical Archaeology: Back from the Edge. Edited by Pedro Paulo A. Funari, Martin Hall, Sian Jones. Pg 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pal"&gt;Through the Ages in Palestinian Archaeology: An Introductory Handbook. By Walter E. Ras. Pg 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been articulated by advocates of [[deep history]].

The primary researchers into human prehistory are archaeologists and physical [[anthropologists]] who use excavation, geologic and geographic surveys, and other scientific analysis to reveal and interpret the nature and behavior of pre-literate and non-literate peoples.&lt;ref name="fagan07"/&gt; Human population [[geneticists]] and [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] are also providing valuable insight for these questions.&lt;ref name="renfrew"/&gt; Cultural anthropologists help provide context for societal interactions, by which objects of human origin pass among people, allowing an analysis of any article that arises in a human prehistoric context.&lt;ref name="renfrew"/&gt; Therefore, data about prehistory is provided by a wide variety of natural and social sciences, such as [[paleontology]], [[biology]], [[archaeology]], [[palynology]], [[geology]], [[archaeoastronomy]], [[comparative linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[molecular genetics]] and many others.

Human prehistory differs from history not only in terms of its [[chronology]] but in the way it deals with the activities of [[archaeological culture]]s rather than named [[nation]]s or [[individual]]s. Restricted to material processes, remains and artifacts rather than written records, prehistory is anonymous. Because of this, reference terms that prehistorians use, such as [[Neanderthal]] or [[Iron Age]] are modern labels with definitions sometimes subject to debate.

== Stone Age ==
The concept of a "Stone Age" is found useful in the archaeology of most of the world, though in the [[archaeology of the Americas]] it is called by different names and begins with a [[Lithic stage]], or sometimes [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]].  The sub-divisions described below are used for Eurasia, and not consistently across the whole area. 

=== Palaeolithic ===
{{main|Paleolithic}}
[[File:Map-of-human-migrations.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Map of early human &lt;!--don't link to hum. mig. article, only covers modern--&gt;migrations, according to [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[population genetics]]. Numbers are [[millennia]] before the present (accuracy disputed).]]

"Palaeolithic" means "Old Stone Age", and begins with the first use of [[stone tool]]s. The Paleolithic is the earliest period of the [[Stone Age]].

The early part of the Palaeolithic is called the [[Lower Palaeolithic]], which predates ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', beginning with ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (and related species) and with the earliest stone tools, dated to around 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;The Essence of Anthropology 3rd ed. By William A. Haviland, Harald E. L. Prins, Dana Walrath, Bunny McBrid. Pg 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of [[control of fire]] by early humans during the Lower Palaeolithic Era is uncertain and has at best limited scholarly support. The most widely accepted claim is that ''H. erectus'' or ''[[Homo ergaster|H. ergaster]]'' made fires between 790,000 and 690,000&amp;nbsp;BP (before the present period) in a site at [[Bnot Ya'akov Bridge]], [[Israel]]. The use of fire enabled early humans to cook food, provide warmth, and have a light source at night.

[[Early Homo sapiens|Early ''Homo sapiens'']] originated some 200,000 years ago, ushering in the [[Middle Palaeolithic]]. Anatomic changes indicating modern language capacity also arise during the Middle Palaeolithic.&lt;ref&gt;Race and Human Evolution. By Milford H. Wolpoff. Pg 348.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Palaeolithic Era, there is the first definitive evidence of human use of fire. Sites in Zambia have charred bone and wood that have been dated to 61,000 B.P. The systematic [[Paleolithic religion|burial of the dead]], [[origin of music|music]], [[prehistoric art|early art]], and the use of increasingly sophisticated multi-part tools are highlights of the Middle Paleolithic.

Throughout the Palaeolithic, humans generally lived as [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s. [[Hunter-gatherer#Social structure|Hunter-gatherer societies]] tended to be very small and egalitarian,&lt;ref&gt;Vanishing Voices : The Extinction of the World's Languages. By Daniel Nettle, Suzanne Romaine Merton Professor of English Language University of Oxford. pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; though hunter-gatherer societies with abundant resources or advanced food-storage techniques sometimes developed sedentary lifestyles with complex social structures such as chiefdoms{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, and [[social stratification]]. Long-distance contacts may have been established, as in the case of [[Indigenous Australian]] "highways" known as [[songlines]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Mesolithic ===
{{Main|Mesolithic}}
[[File:Dugout boats Kierikki Centre Oulu 20130526.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Dugout canoe]]]]
The "Mesolithic", or "Middle Stone Age" (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "''mesos''", "middle", and "''lithos''", "stone") was a period in the development of human [[technology]] between the Palaeolithic and [[Neolithic]] periods of the Stone Age.

The Mesolithic period began at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, some 10,000 BP, and ended with [[Agriculture#History|the introduction of agriculture]], the date of which varied by geographic region. In some areas, such as the [[Near East]], agriculture was already underway by the end of the [[Pleistocene]], and there the Mesolithic is short and poorly defined. In areas with limited [[glacial]] impact, the term "[[Epipalaeolithic]]" is sometimes preferred.

Regions that experienced greater environmental effects as the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] ended have a much more evident Mesolithic era, lasting millennia. In [[Northern Europe]], societies were able to live well on rich food supplies from the [[marsh]]lands fostered by the warmer climate. Such conditions produced distinctive human behaviours that are preserved in the material record, such as the [[Maglemosian]] and [[Azilian]] cultures. These conditions also delayed the coming of the Neolithic until as late as 4000 BCE (6,000 [[Before Present|BP]]) in northern Europe.

Remains from this period are few and far between, often limited to [[midden]]s. In forested areas, the first signs of [[deforestation]] have been found, although this would only begin in earnest during the Neolithic, when more space was needed for [[agriculture]].

The Mesolithic is characterized in most areas by small composite [[flint]] tools — [[microlith]]s and [[microburin]]s. [[Fishing tackle]], stone [[adze]]s and wooden objects, e.g. [[canoe]]s and [[bow (weapon)|bows]], have been found at some sites. These technologies first occur in Africa, associated with the Azilian cultures, before spreading to Europe through the [[Ibero-Maurusian]] culture of Northern Africa and the [[Kebaran]] culture of the [[Levant]]. Independent discovery is not always ruled out.

Early Neolithic farming was limited to a narrow range of plants, both wild and domesticated, which included [[einkorn wheat]], [[millet]] and [[spelt]], and the keeping of [[origin of the domestic dog|dogs]], [[sheep]] and [[goat#History|goats]]. By about 6,900–6,400 BCE, it included domesticated [[cattle]] and [[domesticated pig|pigs]], the establishment of permanently or seasonally inhabited settlements, and the use of [[pottery]]. The Neolithic period saw the development of early [[village]]s, [[agriculture]], animal [[domestication]], [[tool]]s and the onset of the earliest recorded incidents of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perfectirishgifts.com/blog/2008/06/prehistoric_massacres_the_twin.html The Perfect Gift: Prehistoric Massacres.

It ended when metal tools became widespread (in the [[chalcolithic|Copper Age]] or [[Bronze Age]]; or, in some geographical regions, in the [[Iron Age]]).The term ''Neolithic'' is commonly used in the [[Old World]], as its application to cultures in the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]] that did not fully develop metal-working technology raises problems.

Settlements became more permanent with some having circular houses with single rooms made of [[mudbrick]]. Settlements might have a surrounding stone wall to keep domesticated animals in and protect the inhabitants from other tribes. Later settlements have rectangular mud-brick houses where the family lived together in single or multiple rooms. Burial findings suggest an [[ancestor cult]] where people [[Plastered human skulls|preserved skulls]] of the dead. The [[Vinča culture]] may have created the earliest system of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Pre-writing in Southeastern Europe: The Sign System of the Vinča Culture ca. 4000 BC|last = Winn|first = Shan|publisher = Western Publishers|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Calgary|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[megalith]]ic temple complexes of [[Ġgantija]] are notable for their gigantic structures.

===Chalcolithic===
{{Main|Chalcolithic}}
[[File:Los Millares recreacion cuadro.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a Copper Age walled city, [[Los Millares]], [[Iberia]]]]
In Old World archaeology, the "Chalcolithic", "Eneolithic" or "Copper Age" refers to a transitional period where early [[copper]] metallurgy appeared alongside the widespread use of stone tools. During this period, some weapons and tools were made of copper. This period was still largely Neolithic in character. It is a phase of the [[Bronze Age]] before it was discovered that adding [[tin]] to [[copper]] formed the harder [[bronze]]. The Copper Age was originally defined as a transition between the [[Neolithic]] and the Bronze Age. However, because it is characterized by the use of metals, the Copper Age is considered a part of the Bronze Age rather than the Stone Age.
[[File:TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Chalcolithic copper mine in [[Timna Valley]], [[Negev Desert]], [[Israel]]]]
An archaeological site in [[Serbia]] contains the oldest securely dated evidence of copper making at high temperature, from 7,500 years ago. The find in June 2010 extends the known record of copper smelting by about 800 years, and suggests that copper smelting may have been invented in separate parts of Asia and Europe at that time rather than spreading from a single source.&lt;ref name="archaeology.ws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbian site may have hosted first copper makers|author=|date=July 17, 2010|work=ScienceNews|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/60563/description/Serbian_site_may_have_hosted_first_copper_makers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[metallurgy]] may have occurred first in the [[Fertile Crescent]], where it gave rise to the Bronze Age in the [[4th millennium BCE]] (the traditional view), though finds from the [[Vinča culture]] in Europe have now been securely dated to slightly earlier than those of the Fertile Crescent. [[Timna Valley]] contains evidence of copper mining 9,000 to 7,000 years ago. The process of transition from [[Neolithic]] to Chalcolithic in the Middle East is characterized in archaeological stone tool assemblages by a decline in high quality raw material procurement and use. North Africa and the Nile Valley imported its iron technology from the [[Near East]] and followed the Near Eastern course of Bronze Age and [[Iron Age]] development. However the [[Iron Age]] and Bronze Age occurred simultaneously in much of Africa.

== Bronze Age ==
{{Main|Bronze Age}}
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|[[Ox]]-drawn [[plow]], [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], c. 1200 BCE.]]

The Bronze Age is the earliest period in which some civilizations have reached the end of prehistory, by introducing written records. The Bronze Age or parts thereof are thus considered to be part of prehistory only for the regions and civilizations who adopted or developed a system of keeping written records during later periods.  The [[History of writing|invention of writing]] coincides in some areas with the early beginnings of the Bronze Age. Soon after the appearance of writing, people started creating texts including written accounts of events and records of administrative matters.

The term Bronze Age refers to a period in human cultural development when the most advanced [[metalworking]] (at least in systematic and widespread use) included techniques for [[smelting]] [[copper]] and [[tin]] from naturally occurring outcroppings of ores, and then combining them to cast [[bronze]]. These naturally occurring ores typically included arsenic as a common impurity. Copper/tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before 3000 BCE. The Bronze Age forms part of the [[three-age system]] for prehistoric societies. In this system, it follows the [[Neolithic]] in some areas of the world.

While copper is a common ore, deposits of tin are rare in the [[Old World]], and often had to be traded or carried considerable distances from the few mines, stimulating the creation of extensive trading routes.  In many areas as far apart as China and England, the valuable new material was used for weapons but for a long time apparently not available for agricultural tools.  Much of it seems to have been hoarded by social elites, and sometimes deposited in extravagant quantities, from [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s and [[Copper Hoard Culture|Indian copper hoards]] to European [[hoard]]s of unused axe-heads.

By the end of the Bronze Age large states, which are often called empires, had arisen in Egypt, China, [[Anatolia]] (the [[Hittites]]) and [[History of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], all of them literate.

== Iron Age ==
{{Main|Iron Age|Classical antiquity}}

The Iron Age is not part of prehistory for all civilizations who had introduced written records during the Bronze Age. Most remaining civilizations did so during the Iron Age, often through conquest by the empires, which continued to expand during this period.  For example, in most of Europe conquest by the [[Roman Empire]] means that the term Iron Age is replaced by "Roman", "[[Gallo-Roman]]" and similar terms after the conquest.

In archaeology, the Iron Age refers to the advent of [[ferrous metallurgy]]. The adoption of [[iron]] coincided with other changes in some past cultures, often including more sophisticated agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles, which makes the archaeological Iron Age coincide with the "[[Axial Age]]" in the history of philosophy.  Although iron ore is common, the metalworking techniques necessary to use iron are very different from those needed for the metal used earlier, and iron was slow-spreading and for long mainly used for weapons, while bronze remained typical for tools, as well as art.

The '''President's Malaria Initiative''' (PMI) is a U.S. Government initiative to control and eliminate [[malaria]], one of the leading global causes of premature death and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/can-malaria-be-eradicated|title=Can Malaria Be Eradicated?|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was originally launched by U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] in 2005, and has been continued by each successive U.S. president.&lt;ref name="AboutPMI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmi.gov/about|title=About {{!}} PMI|publisher=President's Malaria Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMI was originally created with a mission to "reduce malaria-related mortality by 50 percent across 15 high-burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa".&lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt; PMI has since expanded to 24 malaria-endemic countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and 3 additional countries in the [[Greater Mekong Subregion]] of Southeast Asia, where it seeks to further reduce malaria burden and assist countries in achieving malaria elimination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pmi.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/pmi-reports/2018-pmi-twelfth-annual-report.pdf|title=The President's Malaria Initiative, 12th Annual Report to Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=PMI.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

PMI works closely with national malaria programs and global partners including the [[World Health Organization]], [[RBM Partnership To End Malaria|Roll Back Malaria]], and [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|Global Fund]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-12-08|title=The US President's Malaria Initiative: 2 years on|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673607617954|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=370|issue=9603|pages=1893–1894|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61795-4|pmid=18074434|issn=0140-6736|last1=Loewenberg|first1=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global malaria efforts, led largely part by PMI, have cut malaria mortality by over 60%, saved nearly 7 million lives, and prevented more than 1 billion malaria cases between 2000 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report/en/|title=WHO {{!}} World malaria report|website=WHO|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; PMI currently supports malaria prevention and control for over 500 million at-risk people in Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The ''U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003'' originally authorized the U.S. Government to provide 5 years of malaria funding to bilateral partners and the Global Fund. PMI was subsequently launched by President George W. Bush in 2005. In 2008, PMI was reauthorized for another 5 years of funding by the ''Lantos-Hyde Act,'' which also called for development of a comprehensive U.S. Global Malaria Strategy, the latest version of which is the U.S. Global Malaria Strategy 2015-2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-government-and-global-malaria/|title=The President’s Malaria Initiative and Other U.S. Government Global Malaria Efforts|date=2018-04-10|work=The Henry J.

== Structure and Governance ==
PMI is interagency initiative overseen by the [[U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator]] in consultation with an Interagency Advisory Group composed of representatives from [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and [[Office of Management and Budget]]. The initiative is led by USAID and implemented together with CDC. In addition to US-based staff at USAID and CDC headquarters, PMI maintains resident advisors from both agencies in each focus country.&lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt;

== Countries ==
PMI currently provides direct support to 24 "focus" countries and 3 additional country programs in the Great Mekong Subregion. At the time of its launch in 2005, PMI provided support to just three countries: Angola, Tanzania, and Uganda. Four additional countries (Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Senegal) were added the following year. By 2007, PMI had added Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, and Zambia—bringing the total number of focus countries to the originally envisioned total of 15 high-burden nations.&lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In 2010, PMI added the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Guinea, Zimbabwe, and the Mekong Subregion. &lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt;

In 2017, with additional funding from Congress, PMI expanded to 5 more countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger, and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Results ==
PMI is estimated to have prevented 185 million malaria cases and nearly 1 million deaths between 2005 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winskill|first=Peter|last2=Slater|first2=Hannah C.|last3=Griffin|first3=Jamie T.|last4=Ghani|first4=Azra C.|last5=Walker|first5=Patrick G.

The presence of a PMI program in a country has also been associated with a significant reduction in all-cause under-5 child mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jakubowski|first=Aleksandra|last2=Stearns|first2=Sally C.|last3=Kruk|first3=Margaret E.|last4=Angeles|first4=Gustavo|last5=Thirumurthy|first5=Harsha|date=2017-06-13|title=The US President's Malaria Initiative and under-5 child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa: A difference-in-differences analysis|journal=PLOS Medicine|language=en|volume=14|issue=6|pages=e1002319|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002319|issn=1549-1676|pmc=5469567|pmid=28609442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board]] was first chartered under the [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title I - Reform of the Intelligence Community|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/108-796/titlei_reform_intel.pdf|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|accessdate=December 5, 2012|date=December 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of the board is to provide advice and review of whether adequate supervision, guidelines, and oversight exist and to "continually review" regulations, policies, procedures, and information sharing practices to ensure privacy and civil liberties considerations are protected.&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Roger Z.|author2=Robert D. Kline|title=Intelligence and the National Security Strategist|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2005|page=572|isbn=978-0-7425-4039-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To carry out these roles, the board does not have [[subpoena]] power, but is able to request subpoenas subject to the [[U.S. Attorney General]]'s discretion "to protect sensitive law enforcement or counterterrorism information or ongoing operations."  The [[U.S. Director of National Intelligence]] also has the power to override requests "to protect the national security interests of the United States"&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;

A report by former members of the [[9/11 commission]] in December 2005 noted there was "little urgency" in creation of the board, whose first meeting was in 2006.&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;  It was initially composed of a chair, vice chair, and three other members.  As these members served at the pleasure of the President, "Critics... maintained that the board appeared to be a presidential appendage, devoid of the capability to exercise independent judgment and assessment or to provide impartial findings and recommendations", according to the [[Congressional Research Service]].&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;  Subsequently member Lanny Davis resigned in protest over the board's lack of independence, citing "extensive redlining by Administration officials of the board's first report to Congress" that was accepted by the other members.&lt;ref name=Hatch2011&gt;{{citation |title=Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board: New Independent Agency Status |author=Garrett Hatch |date=November 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34385.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The board was then reconstituted under the [[Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007]] (H.R. 1), beginning in January 2008, as an independent agency with appointments subject to [[Senate confirmation]].  Four members of the board were nominated by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2011, and confirmed by the Senate in August 2012.&lt;ref name=Hatch2011 /&gt;  Board chairman David Medine was finally confirmed in May 2013 in the wake of the Snowden disclosures in a party-line vote with 53 Democrats supporting and 45 Republicans opposing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressivepunch.org/vote.htm?vote=2347201&amp;topic=R10|title = On the nomination of David Medine as chairman of the federal Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board: Senate Roll Call 114|publisher=ProgressivePunch|date=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global surveillance disclosures==
{{main|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)}}
The Board's report follows a series of highly publicized leaks about the operations of the [[global surveillance]] program conducted by the [[National Security Agency]] in the United States working with a number of other countries (see [[Five Eyes]]).  While the program's nominal focus was on foreign nationals, the disclosures also revealed the large-scale surveillance of communications by United States citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Barton Gellman]]|title=Edward Snowden, after months of NSA revelations, says his mission’s accomplished|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/edward-snowden-after-months-of-nsa-revelations-says-his-missions-accomplished/2013/12/23/49fc36de-6c1c-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html|date=December 24, 2013|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These leaks were largely the work of [[Edward Snowden]], a [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] employee with access to a wide range of [[top secret]] documents.  Publications of the documents by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' began in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|title=NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order|work=The Guardian|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report called for a "Special Advocate" to be involved in some cases before the FISA court judge.&lt;ref name="accessnow1"/&gt; The Board also contained the recommendation to release future and past FISC decisions “that involve novel interpretations of FISA or other significant questions of law, technology or compliance.”&lt;ref name="accessnow1"/&gt;

The report also recommended against an alternate proposal, which President [[Barack Obama]] had ordered Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] to formulate within 60 days, which would force third parties including telephone companies to conduct data retention.  The panel's majority spokesman said this was due to cost and legal exposure for the companies involved, and that it was not an "easy out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-01-23/nsa-phone-data-program-called-illegal-by-privacy-oversight-board|title=NSA’s Spying on Phone Calls Illegal: U.S. Privacy Board|publisher=Bloomsburg News|author=Margaret Talev and Chris Strohm|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PCLOB /&gt;

==Reactions==
Sen. [[Ron Wyden]], a senior member of the intelligence committee and long-time critic of the programs, released a statement in reaction to the report. Said Wyden: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The privacy board's findings closely mirror many of the criticisms made by surveillance reform advocates. The bulk collection program was built on a murky legal foundation that raises many constitutional questions and has been proven to be an ineffective tool for collecting unique intelligence information. Moreover, as the board wrote in its report, a program where the government collects the telephone records of millions of law-abiding Americans 'fundamentally shifts the balance of power between the state and its citizens.' The board goes on to say that with the government's 'powers of compulsion and criminal prosecution,' collection of data on its own citizens 'poses unique threats to privacy,' and is expected to have a 'chilling effect on the free exercise of speech and association.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Albany Tribune |url=http://www.albanytribune.com/23012014-wyden-statement-pclob-report-bulk-collection-phone-records/ |title=Wyden Statement On PCLOB Report On Bulk Collection Of Phone Records |publisher=Albanytribune.com |date=January 23, 2014 |accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Asked by [[Patrick Mächler]] to what extent the report will have an impact, [[Edward Snowden]] stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;I don’t see how Congress could ignore it, as it makes it clear there is no reason at all to maintain the 215 program. Let me quote from the official report:

“Cessation of the program would eliminate the privacy and civil liberties concerns associated with bulk collection without unduly hampering the government’s efforts, while ensuring that any governmental requests for telephone calling records are tailored to the needs of specific investigations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.freesnowden.is/asksnowden/ |title=Live Q&amp;A with Edward Snowden |last=Snowden |first=Edward |date=January 23, 2014 |publisher=Courage Foundation |accessdate=January 24, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124015739/http://www.freesnowden.is/asksnowden/ |archivedate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Soft power''' is the ability to attract and [[Co-option|co-opt]], rather than [[coerce]] ([[hard power]]). Soft power is the ability to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. A defining feature of soft power is that it is non-coercive; the currency of soft power is culture, political values, and foreign policies. Recently, the term has also been used in changing and influencing social and public opinion through relatively less transparent channels and [[lobbying]] through powerful political and non-political organizations. In 2012, [[Joseph Nye]] of [[Harvard University]] explained that with soft power, "the best [[propaganda]] is not propaganda", further explaining that during the [[Information Age]], "credibility is the scarcest resource."&lt;ref name=WSJmay2012&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nye |first1=Joseph |title=China's Soft Power Deficit To catch up, its politics must unleash the many talents of its civil society |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304451104577389923098678842 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nye coined the term in a 1990 book, ''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''. In this book, he wrote: “when one country gets other countries to want what it wants-might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants.”&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"&gt;Nye, Joseph.''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''(New York: Basic Books, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; He further developed the concept in his 2004 book, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''. The term is now widely used in international affairs by analysts and statesmen. For example, [[US Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] spoke of the need to enhance American soft power by "a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of [[national security]] – [[diplomacy]], [[strategic communications]], foreign assistance, civic action and [[economic reconstruction]] and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |author=Robert M.

According to the Soft Power 30, an annual index published by [[Portland Communications]] and the [[USC Center on Public Diplomacy]] for 2018, the [[United Kingdom]] is the leading sovereign state in soft power. Other leading countries in soft power include [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Switzerland]], [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClory|first=Jonathan|title=''The Soft Power 30: A Global Ranking of Soft Power, 2017''|url=http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Soft-Power-30-Report-2017-Web-1.pdf|date=18 July 2017|publisher=Portland|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2016/17 [[Monocle (UK magazine)|''Monocle'']] Soft Power Survey, ranks the United States as the leading country in soft power.

== Description ==
[[File:Soft Power (2004) by Joseph Nye.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Nye's 2004 book describing the concept of "soft power"]]

[[Joseph Nye]] introduced the concept of "soft power" in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Power-Means-Success-Politics/dp/1586482254/&lt;/ref&gt; For Nye, power is the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want. There are several ways one can achieve this: you can coerce them with threats; you can induce them with payments; or you can attract and co-opt them to want what you want. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"/&gt;

It can be contrasted with '[[hard power]]', which is the use of coercion and payment. Soft power can be wielded not just by states but also by all actors in international politics, such as [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Nye, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered the "second face of power" that indirectly allows you to obtain the outcomes you want. A country's soft power, according to Nye, rests on three resources: "its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when others see them as legitimate and having moral authority)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Future_of_Power.html?id=AH08y1Bi1Y0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"A country may obtain the outcomes it wants in world politics because other countries – admiring its values, emulating its example, aspiring to its level of prosperity and openness – want to follow it. In this sense, it is also important to set the agenda and attract others in world politics, and not only to force them to change by threatening military force or economic sanctions. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes that you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Soft power resources are the assets that produce attraction which often leads to acquiescence.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"/&gt; Nye asserts that, "Seduction is always more effective than coercion, and many values like democracy, human rights, and individual opportunities are deeply seductive."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004) p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelo Codevilla]] observed that an often overlooked essential aspect of soft power is that different parts of populations are attracted or repelled by different things, ideas, images, or prospects.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008"&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power is hampered when policies, culture, or values repel others instead of attracting them.

In his book, Nye argues that soft power is a more difficult instrument for governments to wield than hard power for two reasons: many of its critical resources are outside the control of governments, and soft power tends to "work indirectly by shaping the environment for policy, and sometimes takes years to produce the desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008.) pp. 59–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The book identifies three broad categories of soft power: "culture", "political values", and "policies."

In ''The Future of Power'' (2011), Nye reiterates that soft power is a descriptive, rather than a normative, concept.&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, soft power can be wielded for nefarious purposes. "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Josef Stalin|Stalin]], and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] all possessed a great deal of soft power in the eyes of their acolytes, but that did not make it good. It is not necessarily better to twist minds than to twist arms."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81" /&gt; Nye also claims that soft power does not contradict the international relations theory of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]]. "Soft power is not a form of idealism or liberalism. It is simply a form of power, one way of getting desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 82"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations of the concept ==
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
Soft power has been criticized as being ineffective by authors such as [[Niall Ferguson]] in the preface to ''Colossus''. [[Neorealism (international relations)|Neorealist]] and other rationalist and neorationalist authors (with the exception of [[Stephen Walt]]) dismiss soft power out of hand as they assert that actors in international relations respond to only two types of incentives: economic incentives and force.

As a concept, it can be difficult to distinguish between soft power from hard power. For example, Janice Bially Mattern argues that [[George W. Bush]]'s use of the phrase "you are either with us or with the terrorists" was in fact an exercise of hard power. Though military and economic force was not used to pressure other states to join its coalition, a kind of force – representational force – was used. This kind of force threatens the identity of its partners, forcing them to comply or risk being labelled as evil. This being the case, soft power is therefore not so soft.&lt;ref&gt;Janice Bially Mattern, "Why 'Soft Power' Isn't So Soft: Representational Force and the Sociolinguistic Construction of Attraction in World Politics," ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies'' 33, no. 3 (2005): 586.&lt;/ref&gt; However, rationalist authors{{Who|date=May 2013}} would merely see this as an 'implied threat', and that direct economic or military sanctions would likely follow from being 'against us'.

== Measurement ==
The first attempt to measure soft power through a composite index was created and published by the [[Institute for Government]] and the media company ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=McClory|title=The new persuaders: an international ranking of soft power|date=2010-12-07|publisher=Institute for Government|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|work=Institute for Government website|page=13|accessdate=2011-05-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724053803/http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IfG-Monocle Soft Power Index combined a range of statistical metrics and subjective panel scores to measure the soft power resources of 26 countries. The metrics were organized according to a framework of five sub-indices including culture, diplomacy, education, business/innovation, and government. The index is said to measure the soft power resources of countries, and does not translate directly into ability influence. ''Monocle'' has published an annual ''Soft Power Survey'' since then. As of 2016/17, the list is calculated using around 50 factors that indicate the use of soft power, including the number of cultural missions (primarily language schools), [[Olympic medals]], the quality of a country's [[architecture]] and business brands.&lt;ref name="monocle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2016-17/|title=Soft Power Survey 2016/17|date=2016|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Soft Power 30'', which includes a foreword by Joseph Nye, is a ranking of countries' soft power produced and published by the media company ''Portland'' in 2015. The ranking is based on "the quality of a country’s political institutions, the extent of their cultural appeal, the strength of their diplomatic network, the global reputation of their higher education system, the attractiveness of their economic model, and a country’s digital engagement with the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Soft Power 30 - A Global Ranking of Soft Power|url=http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/pdfs/the_soft_power_30.pdf|publisher=Portland|accessdate=17 July 2015|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Softly does it|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21657655-oxbridge-one-direction-and-premier-league-bolster-britains-power-persuade-softly-does-it|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=The Economist|date=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In ‘soft power’ terms, Japan ranks eighth out of 30 countries in U.K. consultancy report|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/15/national/soft-power-terms-japan-ranks-eighth-30-u-k-consultancy-gauge/#.Value4u-ra4|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=Japan Times|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Elcano Global Presence Report'' scores the [[European Union]] first for soft presence when its member states are excluded and the EU is considered as a whole.&lt;ref name=ElcanoEU /&gt;

Soft power, then, represents the third behavioral way of getting the outcomes you want. Soft power is contrasted with hard power, which has historically been the predominant realist measure of national power, through [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] such as [[population]] size, concrete [[military]] assets, or a nation's [[gross domestic product]]. But having such resources does not always produce the desired outcomes, as the United States discovered in the Vietnam War. The extent of attraction can be measured by public opinion polls, by elite interviews, and case studies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Nye argues that soft power is more than influence, since influence can also rest on the hard power of threats or payments. And soft power is more than just persuasion or the ability to move people by argument, though that is an important part of it. It is also the ability to attract, and attraction often leads to acquiescence.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In [[international relations]], soft power is generated only in part by what the government does through its policies and public diplomacy. The generation of soft power is also affected in positive (and negative) ways by a host of non-state actors within and outside the country. Those actors affect both the general public and governing elites in other countries, and create an enabling or disabling environment for government policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In some cases, soft power enhances the probability of other elites adopting policies that allow one to achieve preferred outcomes. In other cases, where being seen as friendly to another country is seen as a local political kiss of death, the decline or absence of soft power will prevent a government from obtaining particular goals. But even in such instances, the interactions of civil societies and non-state actors may help to further general milieu goals such as democracy, liberty, and development. Soft power is not the possession of any one country or actor.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The success of soft power heavily depends on the actor's [[reputation]] within the [[international community]], as well as the flow of information between actors. Thus, soft power is often associated with the rise of [[globalization]] and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|neoliberal international relations theory]]. [[Popular culture]] and [[mass media]] are regularly identified as a source of soft power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|title=Economic warfare on the silver screen|publisher=FRANCE 24|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=2012-01-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the spread of a national language or a particular set of [[norm (sociology)|normative]] structures; a nation with a large amount of soft power and the good will that engenders it inspire others to [[acculturation|acculturate]], avoiding the need for expensive [[hard power]] expenditures.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} More particularly, [[World news|international news]] was found crucial in shaping the image and reputation of foreign countries. The high prominence of the US in international news, for example, has been linked to its soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blondheim|first1=Menahem|last2=Segev|first2=Elad|title=Just Spell US Right: America’s News Prominence and Soft Power|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2015|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1114899|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1114899|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive news coverage was associated with positive international views, while negative news coverage with negative views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|year=2016|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=9781433129841|pages=139–153|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=85473&amp;concordeid=312985|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611205324/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=85473&amp;concordeid=312985|archivedate=2016-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because soft power has appeared as an alternative to raw power politics, it is often embraced by ethically-minded scholars and policymakers. But soft power is a descriptive rather than a normative concept. Like any form of power, it can be wielded for good or bad purposes. While soft power can be used with bad intentions and wreak horrible consequences, it differs in terms of means. It is on this dimension that one might construct a normative preference for greater use of soft power.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Research ==

Academics have engaged in several debates around soft power. These have included:
* Its usefulness (Giulio Gallarotti, Niall Ferguson, Josef Joffe, Robert Kagan, Ken Waltz, Mearsheimer vs Nye, Katzenstein, Janice Bially Mattern, Jacques Hymans, Alexander Vuving, Jan Mellisen)
* How soft power and hard power interact (Giulio Gallarotti, Joseph Nye)
* Whether soft power can be coercive or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], (Janice BIally Mattern, Katzenstein, Duvall &amp; Barnet vs Nye, Vuving)
* How the relationship between [[structure and agency]] work (Hymans vs Nye)
* Whether soft balancing is occurring (Wohlforth &amp; Brooks vs Walt ''et al''.)
* Soft power and normative power in Europe (Ian Manners, A Ciambra, Thomas Diez, A Hyde Pryce, Richard Whitman)
* How [[civil resistance]] (i.e., non-violent forms of resistance) can often involve certain uses of soft power, but remains a distinct concept (Adam Roberts, Timothy Garton Ash)
* The ways through which states' attempts at soft power can backfire, leading to instances of 'soft disempowerment' (Paul Michael Brannagan and Richard Giulianotti)

One study finds that a state's soft power has a measurable effect on its exports. Countries that are admired for their positive global influence export more, holding other things constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Soft power raises exports|url = http://www.voxeu.org/article/soft-power-raises-exports|website = VoxEU.org|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Throughout the world ===
The Soviet Union competed with the U.S. for influence throughout the [[Cold War]]. The Soviets were engaged in a broad campaign to convince the world of the attractiveness of its Communist system. In 1945, the Soviet Union was very effective in attracting many in Europe from its resistance to Hitler, and in colonized areas around the world because of its opposition to European imperialism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004). Ch 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets also employed a substantially large [[public diplomacy]] program that included: promoting their high culture, broadcasting, disseminating disinformation about the West, and sponsoring nuclear protests, peace movements, and youth organizations. Despite all of this, the Soviets' closed system and lack of popular culture impeded the ability of the Soviet Union to compete with the U.S. in terms of soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Soviet soft power in Poland : culture and the making of Stalin's new empire, 1943-1957 |last=Babiracki |first=Patryk |date=2015 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=9781469623085 |location=Chapel Hill |oclc=911173017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Autocracy|non-democratic governments]] have attempted to use [[Human migration|migration]] as an instrument of soft power: [[Egypt]] under the rule of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] trained and dispatched thousands of teachers across the [[Arab world]] in an effort to spread ideas of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialism]] and [[anti-Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tsourapas |first=Gerasimos |date= |title=Authoritarian emigration states: Soft power and cross-border mobility in the Middle East |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192512118759902 |journal=International Political Science Review |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=400-416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cuba]], the [[Fidel Castro]] regime's [[Cuban medical internationalism|medical internationalism]] programme has dispatched thousands of medical professionals abroad for cultural diplomacy purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cuban medical internationalism : origins, evolution, and goals |last=Kirk |first=John M. |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |last2=Erisman |first2=H.

After [[Pope John Paul II]] visited [[Poland]] in 1979, some political commentators said his visit influenced events against Poland's communist government, the [[Soviet Union]], and ultimately [[communism]], which promoted [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt;

{{quote|"The Pope won that struggle by transcending politics. His was what Joseph Nye calls "soft power" – the power of attraction and repulsion. He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated. He was a Pole, but beyond the regime’s reach. By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime. And so they came to him by the millions. They listened. He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. "Be not afraid," he said. Millions shouted in response, "We want God! We want God! We want God!" The regime cowered. Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood. Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, they were finished." &lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Besides the Pope's visit, American-government broadcasting and propaganda into Soviet-occupied Europe, particularly Poland, contributed to the rise of the [[Solidarity]] movement and to the collapse of the Soviet-backed governments there and in the rest of the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance.&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"/&gt;

The United States and Europe have consistently been sources of influence and soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joseph Nye|title=Europe’s Soft Power|url=http://www.theglobalist.com/europes-soft-power/|publisher=The Globalist|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=3 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European culture]]'s art, literature, music, design, fashion, and even food have been global magnets for some time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Europe and the U.S. have often claimed to support [[human rights]] and [[international law]] throughout the world. Unlike the U.S., Europeans' love of football enhances their soft power globally, whereas the primary sports of the U.S. such as American football and baseball are largely unpopular on the world stage. In 2012, the [[European Union]] was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] "for over six decades [it has] contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2012 - European Union (EU)|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/eu-facts.html|publisher=Nobel Prize|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From war to peace: European Union accepts Nobel Prize|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/10/world/nobel-peace-prize/|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has the largest diplomatic network in the world,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globaldiplomacyindex.lowyinstitute.org/country_rank.html|title=Global Diplomacy Index – Country Rank|last=|first=|date=|website=Lowy Institute|language=|access-date=2018-04-01|ref=Lowy2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest number of foreign journalists based in the country,&lt;ref name="Monocle2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Soft Power Survey 2012|url=http://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2012/|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most popular destination for international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study in the USA|url=http://www.internationalstudent.com/study_usa/|publisher=International Student|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cinema of the United States|American films]], among other influences, have contributed to the [[Americanization]] of other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fluck|first1=Prof. Dr. Winfried|title=The Americanization of Modern Culture: A Cultural History of the Popular Media*|url=http://www.jfki.fu-berlin.de/en/v/publications_fluck/2000/Romance_with_America/Fluck__Winfried_-_The_Americanization_of_Modern_Culture.pdf|publisher=John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies, Berlin|accessdate=5 December 2015|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asia and more recently China have been working to use the potential soft power assets that are present in the admiration of their ancient cultures, arts, fashion and cuisine. China is presenting itself as a defender of national sovereignty,&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, Aaron L. ''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which became an issue after the [[NATO]] air campaign to oust Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and NATO's support of the rebels in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;Felgenhauer, Pavel. "The Fall of Gaddafi Angers Many In Moscow". ''Eurasia Daily Monitor'' Volume: 8 Issue: 164. September 8, 2011. http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38374&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese are also competing with the United States to gain influence throughout the South Pacific, however some commentators have said their recent assertiveness in this region has created an appeal for nations in this region to align with the United States thus increasing U.S. soft power in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, Aaron L. ''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft power extends beyond the operations of government, to the activities of the private sector and to society and culture at large.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008) p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power has gained more influence because it addresses the underlying dispositions of the people who have increasingly become more active in their governments.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt; This is true even in authoritarian countries where people and institutions are increasingly able to shape the debate.&lt;ref&gt;Defense Science Board, Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Strategic Communication (Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, September 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[information age]] has also led to the rise of soft power resources for non-state actors, Primarily, through the use of global media, and to a greater extent the internet using tools such as the [[World Wide Web]], non-state actors have been able to increase their soft power and put pressure on governments that can ultimately affect policy outcomes. Instead of front organizations, non-state actors can create cyber advocacy organizations &lt;ref&gt;Steele, Robert D. ''The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, &amp; Political: Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs and Corruption''. Oakton, Virginia: OSS International Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; to recruit members and project their voice on the global stage.

=== China ===
{{Main|Soft power of China}}
China's traditional culture has been a source of attraction, building on which it has created several hundred [[Confucius Institute]]s around the world to teach its language and culture. The enrollment of foreign students in China has increased from 36,000 a decade before to at least 240,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye Jr. Why China Is Weak on Soft Power; Jan, 17, 2012 https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/opinion/why-china-is-weak-on-soft-power.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; China's [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]] has attracted many western countries to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With New Bank, China Shows U.S. It's Got Soft Power|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/23/with-new-bank-china-shows-u-s-its-got-soft-power/print/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, China had the second largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A spring 2014 Global Attitudes survey from Pew Research Center states China receives mostly positive reviews in the sub-Saharan African nations polled, although South Africans are closely divided (45% favorable, 40% unfavorable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America’s Image|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/chapter-2-chinas-image/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China's increasing soft power can be explained by looking at China's economic growth and regarding economic engagement with many African countries. China's expansion of trade and investment on the African continent and the spread of Chinese-led infrastructure projects gives positive impressions of China to people in Africa. China's economic engagement in African countries is considered as much more pragmatic and in consistency with the priorities of many African countries. Moreover, China's increasing role as a global superpower seems appealing and this drives a desire to tie African economies more closely to China's economy.

China has made a systematic effort to expand and give greater profile to its soft-power policies in Africa ever since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2000. The commitments of China's soft power ranges from health, humanitarian assistance to academic, professional and cultural exchange. China's assistance to Africa, however, is not near the U.S. assistance in Africa.

Cultural exchange between China and Africa can be a representative example of how China has been spreading its soft power.
In 2005, the first Confucius Institute was established in Africa. The institute is funded by the Chinese government and it provides Chinese language and cultural programming to the public. There are 19 institutes today in Africa and China has planned to spend 20 million renminbi for education projects in South Africa, including the teaching of Mandarin in 50 local high schools.

Furthermore, there is an increasing support for cultural visitors programs which gained momentum in 2004 when the African Cultural Visitors Program was established. There is a rising number of African entrepreneurs who choose to move to China and there are also diaspora communities in many Chinese cities that have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer G. Cooke. China's soft power in Africa; {{cite web |url=http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324122951/http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Africa, Chinese soft power extends to countries like [[Barbados]]. Barbadian Prime Minister [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]] expressed admiration for the Chinese economic model and sought to emulate the way Chinese state controlled banks guided development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/03/09BRIDGETOWN144.html# Wikileaks 09Barbados144]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
[[France]] has long exerted a great amount of soft power. The country and [[French culture|its culture]] have for centuries been admired in many parts of the world; so much so that [[Thomas Jefferson]] is famously quoted as saying "Every man has two countries, his own and France."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|title=Americans in France|publisher=[[U.S. Embassy Paris]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418070413/http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|archivedate=2015-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very term "culture" comes from France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/39149-french-culture.html French Culture: Customs &amp; Traditions], [[LiveScience]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, France had the third largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

France was a focal point of the [[Age of Enlightenment]];&lt;ref&gt;"Enlightenment thought culminates historically in the political upheaval of the French Revolution, in which the traditional hierarchical political and social orders (the French monarchy, the privileges of the French nobility, the political power and authority of the Catholic Church) were violently destroyed and replaced by a political and social order informed by the Enlightenment ideals of freedom and equality for all, founded, ostensibly, upon principles of human reason." [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/ Enlightenment], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; its attachment to the ideals of [[liberty]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[reason]] was notably embodied in the writing and publishing of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The [[French Revolution]] was one of the most significant events in European and world history. France has since then been instrumental in spreading [[Republicanism in France|Republican ideals]]. The [[Napoleonic Code]], which influenced much of the rest of Europe and beyond, is regarded as one of the most important law document of the [[modern era]].&lt;ref name="Robert B. Holtman 1981"&gt;Robert B. Holtman, ''The Napoleonic Revolution'' (Baton Rouge: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French language]] has for centuries been an important diplomatic language. For example, French has to be used  &amp;ndash; on par with English &amp;ndash; for all documents issued by the [[United Nations Treaty Series]], ensuring that all UN treaties are equally valid in their English and French versions.&lt;ref&gt;"Treaties registered with the United Nations Treaty Series are always translated into French and English. Documents are always provided in French and English. This city’s Geneva Conventions, written in equally authentic French and English versions, laid part of the groundwork for the international system." [https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy Languages of diplomacy - Towards a fairer distribution], [[The Economist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

France has also followed for decades a very active diplomatic and cultural policy. The ''[[Alliance Française]]'', whose aim is to promote the French language and French culture, was created as early as [[1883]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |title=Who are we? |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120094935/http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Alliance Française]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'''s 2015 "Soft Power 30" report, France was ranked first in the "engagement" criteria, which is intended to measure "the reach of states’ diplomatic network and their commitment to major challenges like development and the environment." ''Monocle'' further noted that "In terms of influential reach, France is the best networked state in the world and is member of more multi-lateral organisations than any other country." Overall, France ranked fourth in that study.&lt;ref name="francemonocle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |title=The Soft Power 30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120204008/http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's [[laïcité]], [[secularism]], policy has inspired some countries over time. For instance, France was [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]]'s main role model for [[Westernization]] as part of the major reform efforts that he spearheaded when he was President of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Soner Cagaptay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V8vQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=french+laicit%C3%A9+turkey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gz_UaAWfWN&amp;sig=NAEle23Sl5HmUbOS2mjT-NnAl0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA45fHrbXJAhXH8RQKHfvKAIwQ6AEIWzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20laicit%C3%A9%20turkey&amp;f=false The Rise of Turkey: The Twenty-First Century's First Muslim Power], pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

France, and in particular [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sonia-gil/myths-and-truths-romantic-cities_b_4777532.html Myths and Truths: The Most Romantic Cities Around the World], [[The Huffington Post]], 2014&lt;/ref&gt; has long been considered one of the most romantic places to be. France was in 2014 [[Tourism in France|the most visited country in the world]].&lt;ref name="WTO Tourism Highlights 2015 Edition"&gt;{{cite press release |title= UNWTO Tourism Highlights 2015 Edition |publisher=UNWTO |date=25 June 2015 |url=http://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284416899 |accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
The annual soft power rankings by ''Monocle'' magazine and the Institute for Government ranks 30 countries which “best attract favor from other nations through culture, sport, cuisine, design, diplomacy and beyond.”
''Monocle'' magazine said: “[[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] may be painted as a stern taskmaster but it seems she has a softer side, or the country she leads does.”
It said Germany’s rise as a soft power should not come as a surprise.
“The country is traditionally excellent at pursuing its ideas, values and aims using diplomatic, cultural and economic tools," it said. “By quietly doing the simple things well it is a country that has become a global power and the rest of us can feel comfortable with that.”
Germans had been understandably wary about depicting a dominant image abroad, the magazine added, but it said that the country’s rise should not make everyone else feel uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Germany tops world 'soft power' rankings; http://www.thelocal.de/20131121/germany-number-one-for-soft-power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerhard Schröder: 'Germany Can Only Lead Europe the Way Porcupines Mate'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/interview-former-german-chancellor-gerhard-schroeder-on-foreign-policy-a-891839.html|publisher=Spiegel Online International|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama sets off on farewell trip to Europe in shadow of president-elect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/barack-obama-faces-awkward-task-on-sad-farewell-visit-to-europe|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=Reuters|date=14 November 2016|quote=As the Americans see it, Merkel – and certainly not the vainglorious European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker – runs the EU.

=== Italy ===
The famous elements of Italian soft culture are its art, music, fashion, and iconic food. Italy was the birthplace of [[opera]],&lt;ref&gt;Kimbell, David R. B. [https://books.google.com/books?id=C37Gq2GagZIC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Italian Opera.''] Cambridge University Press, 1994. p. 1. Web. 22 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and for generations the language of opera was [[Italian language|Italian]], irrespective of the nationality of the composer. Popular tastes in drama in Italy have long favored comedy; the improvisational style known as the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'' began in Italy in the mid-16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=it |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/commedia-dell-arte/ |title=Commedia dell'arte |work=Treccani, il portale del sapere |access-date=24 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still performed today. Before being exported to France, the famous [[Ballet]] dance genre also originated in Italy.
The country boasts several world-famous cities. [[Rome]] was the ancient capital of the Roman Empire and seat of the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Florence]] was the heart of the [[Renaissance]], a period of great achievements in [[the arts]] that ended the Dark Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Zirpolo, Lilian H. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QPqWxHwdMNAC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The A to Z of Renaissance Art.''] Scarecrow Press, 2009. pp. 154-156. Web. 16 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important cities include [[Turin]], which used to be the capital of Italy, and is now one of the world's great centers of automobile engineering. [[Milan]] is a  [[fashion capital]] of the World. [[Venice]], with its intricate canal system, attracts tourists from all over the world especially during the [[Venetian Carnival]] and the [[Biennale]].
Italy is home to the greatest number of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s (51) to date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list |title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date=25 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=it |url=http://www.sitiunesco.it/beni-italiani.html |title=Beni Italiani Unesco |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716051913/http://www.sitiunesco.it/beni-italiani.html |archive-date=2012-07-16 |work=Associazione Città e Siti Unesco |access-date=17 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to one estimate the country is home to half the world's great art treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbot |first=Charles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGuWGa48iQMC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Italy |publisher=Morellini Editore |year=2006 |page=101 |access-date=24 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (churches, cathedrals, archaeological sites, houses and statues).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvYobEC-wtEC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Italy |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Ltd |year=2012 |pages=23-24 |access-date=1 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
{{Main article|Cool Japan}}
"'''Cool Japan'''" is a concept coined in 2002 as an expression of [[Culture of Japan|Japan’s popular culture]]. The concept has been adopted by the Japanese government as well as trade bodies seeking to exploit the commercial capital of the country’s culture industry.&lt;ref&gt;Japan's Soft Power-Squaring the Cool, June 14, 2014; https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2014/06/japans-soft-power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cool Japan Illustrated, http://www.cool-jp.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a form of soft power, "the ability to indirectly influence behavior or interests through cultural or ideological means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christine R.

In a 2002 article in the journal ''Foreign Policy'' titled “Japan’s Gross National Cool”, Douglas McGray wrote of Japan “reinventing superpower” as its cultural influence expanded internationally despite the economic and political problems of the “lost decade.” Surveying youth culture and the role of J-pop, manga, anime, fashion, film, consumer electronics, architecture, and cuisine, McGray highlighted Japan’s considerable soft power, posing the question of what message the country might project. He also argued that Japan’s recession may even have boosted its national cool, due to the partial discrediting of erstwhile rigid social hierarchies and big-business career paths.&lt;ref name="McGray"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglasmcgray.com/cool-japan.html |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2002/05/01/japans_gross_national_cool |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |url-access=subscription |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"'''Hallyu'''", also known as the "'''Korean Wave'''", is a [[neologism]] referring to the spread of South Korean culture since the late 1990s.

In 2012, the [[BBC]]'s country rating poll revealed that public opinion of [[South Korea]] has been improving every year since the first rating poll for the country was conducted in 2009.

First driven by the spread of [[Korean drama]]s televised across [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] during its initial stages, the ''Korean Wave'' evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon due to the proliferation of Korean pop ([[K-pop]]) music videos on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Yoon, Lina.

=== United States ===
The [[United States]] has long had a great deal of soft power. Examples include [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[four freedoms]] in Europe at the end of [[World War II]], young people behind the [[Iron Curtain]] listening to the government's foreign propaganda arm [[Radio Free Europe]], Chinese students symbolizing their protests in [[Tiananmen Square]] by creating a replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]] that they called "Goddess of Democracy", newly liberated Afghans in 2001 asking for a copy of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and young Iranians today surreptitiously watching banned American videos and satellite television broadcasts in the privacy of their homes.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X" /&gt; America's early commitment to religious toleration, for example, was a powerful element of its overall appeal to potential immigrants; and American aid in the reconstruction of Europe after World War II was a propaganda victory to show off the prosperity and the generosity of the people of the United States.

Studies of American broadcasting into the [[Soviet bloc]], and testimonials from Czech President [[Václav Havel]], Polish President [[Lech Wałęsa]], and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] support that soft power efforts of the United States and its allies during the Cold War were ultimately successful in creating the favorable conditions that led to the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnes Lord, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Satellite TV is actively promoting American soft power in the Arab world in ways that the United States has been incapable of doing. The launch of the Arabic-language [[Alhurra]] satellite channel in early 2004 to provide news and entertainment in ways more beneficial to the U.S., marked an important turning point in U.S. public diplomacy development. Though it calls itself the largest Arabic-language news organization in the world, the Virginia-based Alhurra lacks the cachet and brand recognition of Al Jazeera, but its balanced presentation of news has earned it a small but significant viewership. Controversial innovations in radio broadcasting that target young mass audiences through a mix of light news and mild American popular music – [[Radio Sawa]] in [[Arabic]] and [[Radio Farda]] in [[Persian language|Persian]] – have captured a substantial market share in their target regions."&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71" /&gt;

[[File:Debris-GEO1280.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Earth from space, surrounded by small white dots|A computer-generated image representing space debris as could be seen from [[high Earth orbit]]. The two main debris fields are the ring of objects in [[geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous Earth orbit]] (GEO) and the cloud of objects in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO).]]

Initially, the term '''space debris''' referred to the natural debris found in the solar system: [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteoroid]]s. However, with the 1979 beginning of the NASA Orbital Debris Program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/ NASA Orbital Debris Program]&lt;/ref&gt; the term also refers to the debris (alt. '''space waste''' or '''space garbage''') from the mass of defunct, artificially created objects in space, especially [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]]. These include old [[satellite]]s and spent [[rocket stage]]s, as well as the fragments from their disintegration and [[collision]]s. 

As of December 2016, five [[satellite collision]]s have generated space debris.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  Space debris is also known as ''orbital debris'', ''space junk'', ''space waste'', ''space trash'', ''space litter'' or ''space garbage''.&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/debris/debris.htm GUIDE TO SPACE DEBRIS from the spaceacademy.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt;
   
{{as of|2016|7|5}}, the [[United States Strategic Command]] tracked a total of 17,852 artificial objects in orbit above the Earth,&lt;ref name=ODQN-201607&gt;{{cite newsletter |url=https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/quarterly-news/pdfs/odqnv20i3.pdf |title=Orbital Debris Quarterly News |volume=20 |issue=3 |page=8 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=July 2016 |access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 1,419 operational satellites.&lt;ref name=ucs&gt;{{cite web |title=UCS Satellite Database |date=11 August 2016 |work=Nuclear Weapons &amp; Global Security |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these are just objects large enough to be tracked. {{as of|July 2013}}, more than 170 million bits of debris smaller than {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, about 670,000 pieces of debris 1–10 cm, and around 29,000 larger pieces were estimated to be in orbit around the earth.&lt;ref name="esadebris2013"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Clean_Space/How_many_space_debris_objects_are_currently_in_orbit "How many space debris objects are currently in orbit?"] ''ESA'', July 2013. Retrieved 6 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Collisions with debris have become a hazard to spacecraft; they cause damage akin to [[sandblasting]], especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or [[star tracker]]s that cannot be covered with a [[hypervelocity ballistic shield|ballistic]] [[Whipple shield]] (unless it is transparent).&lt;ref name=nasa20090428&gt;

Below {{convert|2000|km|abbr=on}} Earth-[[orbital altitude|altitude]], pieces of debris are denser than [[meteoroid]]s; most are dust from solid rocket motors, surface erosion debris like paint flakes, and frozen coolant from [[RORSAT]] (nuclear-powered satellites).

The [[Kessler syndrome]], a runaway [[chain reaction]] of collisions exponentially increasing the amount of debris, has been hypothesized to ensue beyond a critical density. This could affect useful polar-orbiting bands, increases the cost of protection for spacecraft missions and could destroy live satellites. Whether Kessler syndrome is already underway has been debated.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Grossman, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/kessler-syndrome/ "NASA Considers Shooting Space Junk with Lasers"], ''wired'', 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement, mitigation, and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the [[space industry]].

== Characterization ==

=== {{anchor|Large vs. small}}Size ===
There are estimated to be over 51 million pieces of debris smaller than {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on}} as of July 2013. There are approximately 670,000 pieces from one to ten cm. The current count of large debris (defined as 10&amp;nbsp;cm across or larger&lt;ref name="technasa"&gt;[http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/UN_Report_on_Space_Debris99.pdf "Technical report on space debris"], p. 15, United Nations, New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;) is 29,000.&lt;ref name="esadebris2013"/&gt; The technical measurement cutoff is c. {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="nasadebris2012"&gt;[http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/faqs.html#3 "Orbital Debris FAQ: How much orbital debris is currently in Earth orbit?"] ''NASA'', March 2012. Retrieved 31 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Over 98 percent of the 1,900 tons of debris in low Earth orbit (as of 2002) was accounted for by about 1,500 objects, each over {{convert|100|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Carroll, [http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/800Carroll.pdf "Space Transport Development Using Orbital Debris"], NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, 2 December 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Total mass is mostly constant despite addition of many smaller objects, since they reenter the atmosphere sooner. Using a 2008 figure of 8,500 known items, it is estimated at {{convert|5500|t|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Robin McKie and Michael Day, [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/24/spaceexplorationspacejunk "Warning of catastrophe from mass of 'space junk'"] ''The Observer'', 24 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris in LEO}}Low Earth orbit (LEO) ===
[[File:Space Junk.jpg|thumb|alt=Earth from space, with space debris enhanced|Space debris in LEO, with sizes exaggerated]]

In LEO there are few "universal orbits" which keep spacecraft in particular rings (in contrast to GEO, a single widely used orbit). The closest are [[sun-synchronous orbit]]s that keep a constant angle between the Sun and the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]; they are [[Polar orbit|polar]], meaning they cross over the polar regions. LEO satellites orbit in many planes, up to 15 times a day, causing frequent approaches between objects (the density of objects is much higher in LEO).&lt;ref&gt;Matt Ford, [https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/02/orbiting-space-junk-heightens-risk-of-satellite-catastrophes.ars "Orbiting space junk heightens risk of satellite catastrophes."] ''Ars Technica'', 27 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbits are further changed by [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] (which in LEO include unevenness of the Earth's gravitational field), and collisions can occur from any direction. For these reasons, the Kessler syndrome applies mostly to the LEO region; impacts occur at up to 16&amp;nbsp;km/s (twice the [[orbital speed]]) if head-on – the [[2009 satellite collision]] occurred at 11.7&amp;nbsp;km/s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Debris/1112600510257_0.html "What are hypervelocity impacts?"] ''ESA'', 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; creating much [[spall]] in the critical size range. These can cross other orbits and lead to a cascade effect. A large-enough collision (e.g. between a space station and a defunct satellite) could make [[low Earth orbit]] impassable.&lt;ref name="k09"&gt;{{cite web |  url = http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  title = The Kessler Syndrome |  date = 8 March 2009 |  author = Donald J. Kessler |  access-date = 22 September 2009 |  archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527195029/http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  archive-date = 27 May 2010 |  dead-url = yes |  df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manned missions are mostly at {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} and below, where air drag helps clear zones of fragments. Atmospheric expansion as a result of [[space weather]] raises the critical altitude by increasing drag; in the 90s, it was a factor in reduced debris density.&lt;ref name=k9165 /&gt; Another was fewer launches by Russia; the USSR made most of their launches in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=k7&gt;Klinkrad, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris at higher altitudes}}Higher altitudes ===
At higher altitudes, where air drag is less significant, orbital decay takes longer. Slight [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]], [[Lunar theory|lunar perturbations]], Earth's gravity perturbations, [[solar wind]] and solar [[radiation pressure]] can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes (where it decays), but at very high altitudes this may take millennia.&lt;ref name=kam68&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than LEO and the onset of the problem is slower, the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly.{{contradict-inline|date=December 2015}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| bibcode=2005ESASP.587..113S | title=Optical observation of space debris in high-altitude orbits | journal=Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Space Debris (ESA SP-587). 18–20 April 2005 | volume=587 | page=113 | author1=Schildknecht | first1=T. | last2=Musci | first2=R. | last3=Flury | first3=W. | last4=Kuusela | first4=J. | last5=De Leon | first5=J. | last6=Dominguez Palmero | first6=L. De Fatima | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many communications satellites are in [[geostationary orbit]]s (GEO), clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path. Although velocities are low between GEO objects, when a satellite becomes derelict (such as [[Telstar 401]]) it assumes a [[geosynchronous orbit]]; its [[orbital inclination]] increases about .8° and its speed increases about {{convert|100|mph}} per year. Impact velocity peaks at about {{convert|1.5|km/s|abbr=on}}. [[Perturbation (astronomy)|Orbital perturbations]] cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and [[precession]] of the orbital plane. Close approaches (within 50 meters) are estimated at one per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231404/http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/ISSFD_89085.pdf "Colocation Strategy and Collision Avoidance for the Geostationary Satellites at 19 Degrees West."] ''CNES Symposium on Space Dynamics'', 6–10 November 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The collision debris pose less short-term risk than from an LEO collision, but the satellite would likely become inoperable. Large objects, such as [[Space-based solar power|solar-power satellites]], are especially vulnerable to collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Ha | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Hechler | first2 = M. | year = 1981| title = The Collision Probability of Geostationary Satellites | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981rome.iafcR....V | journal = 32nd International Astronautical Congress | volume = 1981 | issue = | page = 23 | bibcode=1981rome.iafcR....V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] now requires proof a satellite can be moved out of its orbital slot at the end of its lifespan, studies suggest this is insufficient.&lt;ref name= Anselmo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anselmo | first1 = L. | last2 = Pardini | first2 = C. | year = 2000 | title = Collision Risk Mitigation in Geostationary Orbit | url = | journal = Space Debris | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 67–82 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021255523174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since GEO orbit is too distant to accurately measure objects under {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}}, the nature of the problem is not well known.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites could be moved to empty spots in GEO, requiring less maneuvring and making it easier to predict future motion.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites or boosters in other orbits, especially stranded in [[geostationary transfer orbit]], are an additional concern due to their typically high crossing velocity.

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The [[European Space Agency]] telecom satellite [[Olympus-1]] was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a [[graveyard orbit]].&lt;ref name="The Olympus failure"&gt;[http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html "The Olympus failure"] ''ESA press release'', 26 August 1993.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911181644/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html |date=11 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 March 2006, the Russian [[Express (satellite)|Express-AM11]] communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;&lt;ref name=srdc20060419&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=20320 "Notification for Express-AM11 satellite users in connection with the spacecraft failure"] ''Russian Satellite Communications Company'', 19 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit.

In 1958, the United States launched [[Vanguard I]] into a [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO). {{As of|2009|10}}, it, and the upper stage of its launch rocket, are the oldest surviving man-made space objects still in orbit.&lt;ref name="usaweekend"&gt;Julian Smith, [http://www.usaweekend.com/07_issues/070826/070826space.html#junk "Space Junk"]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} ''USA Weekend'', 26 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-03/nrl-vic031308.php Vanguard 50 years]&lt;/ref&gt; In a catalog of known launches until July 2009, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] listed 902 operational satellites&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html "UCS Satellite Database"] ''Union of Concerned Scientists'', 16 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; from a known population of 19,000 large objects and about 30,000 objects launched.

An example of additional dead satellite debris are the remains of the 1970s/80s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RORSAT]] naval surveillance satellite program. The satellite's BES-5 [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] were cooled with a coolant loop of [[NaK|sodium-potassium alloy]], creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life. While many satellites were nominally boosted into medium-altitude [[graveyard orbit]]s, not all were. Even satellites which had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy,&lt;ref name=wiedemann2009&gt;C. Wiedemann et al, "Size distribution of NaK droplets for MASTER-2009", ''Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Space Debris'', 30 March-2 April 2009, (ESA SP-672, July 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; forming additional debris.&lt;ref name=rossi1997&gt;A.

These events continue to occur.  For example, in February 2015, the [[USAF]] [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program]] Flight 13 (DMSP-F13) exploded on orbit, creating at least 149 debris objects, which were expected to remain in orbit for decades.&lt;ref name=sn20150506&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gruss|first1=Mike |title=DMSP-F13 Debris To Stay On Orbit for Decades |url=http://spacenews.com/dmsp-f13-debris-to-stay-on-orbit-for-decades/ |accessdate=7 May 2015 |work=Space News |date=2015-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In characterizing the problem of space debris, it was learned that much debris was due to rocket upper stages (e.g. the [[Inertial Upper Stage]]) which end up in orbit, and break up due to decomposition of [[Passivation (spacecraft)|unvented]] unburned fuel.&lt;ref name=loftus1989&gt;{{cite book |last=Loftus|first=Joseph P. |title=Orbital Debris from Upper-stage Breakup |year=1989 |publisher=AIAA |page=227 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RehH7b_kmNEC |isbn=978-1-60086-376-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a major known impact event involved an (intact) [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane]] booster.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2" /&gt; Although NASA and the [[United States Air Force]] now require upper-stage passivation, other launchers{{vague|date=January 2016}} do not.

Satellites are believed to have been destroyed by micrometeorites and orbital debris (MMOD). The earliest suspected loss was of Kosmos 1275, which disappeared on 24 July 1981 (a month after launch). Kosmos contained no volatile propellant, therefore, there appeared to be nothing internal to the satellite which could have caused the destructive explosion which took place. However the case has not been proven and another hypothesis forwarded is that the battery exploded. Tracking showed it broke up, into 300 new objects.

Many impacts have been confirmed since.

From the early [[Space Shuttle]] missions, NASA used NORAD to monitor the Shuttle's orbital path for debris. In the 1980s, this used much of its capacity.&lt;ref name=s50 /&gt; The first collision-avoidance maneuver occurred during [[STS-48]] in September 1991,&lt;ref name=encounters&gt;Rob Matson, [http://www.satobs.org/satclose.html "Satellite Encounters"] ''Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page''.&lt;/ref&gt; a seven-second [[reaction control system|thruster burn]] to avoid debris from [[Kosmos 955]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/52642978/STS-48-Space-Shuttle-Mission-Report "STS-48 Space Shuttle Mission Report"], NASA, NASA-CR-193060, October 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar maneuvers followed on missions 53, 72 and 82.&lt;ref name=encounters /&gt;

One of the first events to publicize the debris problem occurred on [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]'s second flight, [[STS-7]]. A fleck of paint struck its front window, creating a pit over {{Convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on}} wide. On [[STS-59]] in 1994, [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']]'s front window was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts increased from 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christiansen | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Hyden | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Bernhard | first3 = R.

Window chipping and minor damage to [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system tiles]] (TPS) was already common by the 1990s. The Shuttle was later flown tail-first to take the debris load mostly on the engines and rear cargo bay (not used in orbit or during descent, and less critical for post-launch operation). When flying to the [[International Space Station|ISS]], the two connected spacecraft were flipped around so the better-armored station shielded the orbiter.&lt;ref name=threat /&gt;

A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;William Harwood, [http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090416debris/ "Improved odds ease NASA's concerns about space debris"], ''CBS News'', 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tracking and measurement ==

=== Tracking from the ground ===
Radar and optical detectors such as [[lidar]] are the main tools for tracking space debris. Although objects under {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} have reduced orbital stability, debris as small as 1&amp;nbsp;cm can be tracked,&lt;ref&gt;D.

=== Gabbard diagrams ===
A debris cloud resulting from a single event is studied with [[scatter plot]]s known as Gabbard diagrams, where the [[perigee]] and [[apogee]] of fragments are plotted with respect to their [[orbital period]]. Gabbard diagrams of the early debris cloud prior to the effects of perturbations, if the data were available, are reconstructed. They often include data on newly observed, as yet uncatalogued fragments. Gabbard diagrams can provide important insights into the features of the fragmentation, the direction and point of impact.&lt;ref name=portree&gt;David Portree and Joseph Loftus.

When originally proposed in 2015, the [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb constellation]], initially planned to have ~700 satellites anticipated on orbit after 2018, would only state that they would re-enter the atmosphere within 25 years of retirement.&lt;ref name=sn20150615&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacenews.com/airbus-wins-oneweb-contract/ |title=OneWeb Taps Airbus To Build 900 Internet Smallsats |work=SpaceNews |accessdate=19 June 2015 |date=2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By October 2017, both OneWeb—and also SpaceX, with their large [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink constellation]]—had filed documents with the US [[FCC]] with more aggressive space debris mitigation plans.

With a "one-up, one-down" launch-license policy for Earth orbits, launchers would rendezvous with, capture and de-orbit a derelict satellite from approximately the same orbital plane.&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902 /&gt; Another possibility is the [[Mission Extension Vehicle|robotic]] [[Space Infrastructure Servicing|refueling]] of satellites.

Another approach to debris mitigation is to explicitly design the mission architecture to always leave the rocket second-stage in an [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] [[geocentric orbit]] with a low-[[perigee]], thus ensuring rapid [[orbital decay]] and avoiding long-term orbital debris from spent rocket bodies.  Such missions require the use of a small [[Apogee kick motor|kick stage]] to circularize the orbit, but the kick stage itself may be designed with the excess-propellant capability to be able to self-deorbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/ https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-removal ===
Although the ITU requires geostationary satellites to move to a graveyard orbit at the end of their lives, the selected orbital areas do not sufficiently protect GEO lanes from debris.&lt;ref name= Anselmo /&gt; Rocket stages (or satellites) with enough propellant may make a direct, controlled de-orbit, or if this would require too much propellant, a satellite may be brought to an orbit where atmospheric drag would cause it to eventually de-orbit.

Passive methods of increasing the orbital decay rate of spacecraft debris have been proposed. Instead of rockets, an [[electrodynamic tether]] could be attached to a spacecraft at launch; at the end of its lifetime, the tether would be rolled out to slow the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Christensen, [http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/technovel_tether_041117.html "The Terminator Tether Aims to Clean Up Low Earth Orbit"], space.com.

=== External removal ===
A consensus of speakers at a meeting in Brussels on 30 October 2012 organized by the Secure World Foundation (a U.S. think tank) and the French International Relations Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/article/experts-active-removal-key-countering-space-junk-threat#.Ub3dSuce2Zc "Experts: Active Removal Key To Countering Space Junk Threat"] Peter B. de Selding, Space.com 31 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that removal of the largest debris would be required to prevent the risk to spacecraft becoming unacceptable in the foreseeable future (without any addition to the inventory of dead spacecraft in LEO). Removal costs and legal questions about ownership and the authority to remove defunct satellites have stymied national or international action. Current space law retains ownership of all satellites with their original operators, even debris or spacecraft which are defunct or threaten active missions.

=== Micrometeoroids ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}
{{Main|Micrometeoroid}}
In 1946 during the [[Giacobinids|Giacobinid meteor shower]], [[Helmut Landsberg]] collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.pnas.org/content/36/12/687.full.pdf?ck=nck "The Theory of Micro-Meteorites, Part I: In an Isothermal Atmosphere"], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', Volume 36 Number 12 (15 December 1950), pp. 667 – 695.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Whipple]] was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the [[upper atmosphere]]. Instead, they quickly decelerated and then fell to Earth unmelted. In order to classify these sorts of objects, he coined the term "[[micrometeorite|micro-meteorite]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1949PA.....57..517W "The Theory of Micrometeorites."], ''Popular Astronomy'', Volume 57, 1949, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipple, in collaboration with Fletcher Watson of the [[Harvard Observatory]], led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen. At the time the source of the micro-meteorites was not known. Direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors, demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from [[comet]] tails, and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin.&lt;ref name=whipple1951&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whipple | first1 = Fred | year = 1951 | title = A Comet Model. II.

E. | last2 = Tomandl | first2 = D.

The early studies were based on optical measurements only. In 1957, Hans Pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the Earth, estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Pettersson, "Cosmic Spherules and Meteoritic Dust." ''Scientific American'', Volume 202 Issue 2 (February 1960), pp. 123–132.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations. Such a high flux presented a very serious risk to missions deeper in space, specifically the high-orbiting [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] capsules. To determine whether the direct measurement was accurate, a number of additional studies followed, including the [[Pegasus satellite program]]. These showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere, or flux, was in line with the optical measurements, at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Snelling and David Rush, [http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf "Moon Dust and the Age of the Solar System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174406/http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf |date=12 May 2011 }} ''Creation Ex-Nihilo Technical Journal'', Volume 7 Number 1 (1993), p. 2–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micrometeoroid shielding ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}&lt;!-- I don't think so; it needs a copyedit but the material is about shielding spacecraft from space debris of the small size.  Probably a mistake to name it "micrometeoroid", since none of the small orbital stuff, natural or manmade, is a micrometeoroid until in reenters the atmosphere. --&gt;
[[File:Hypervelocity Impact Demonstration.jpg|left|thumb|The "energy flash" of a [[hypervelocity]] impact during a simulation of what happens when a piece of orbital debris hits a spacecraft in orbit.]]

Whipple's work pre-dated the [[space race]] and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later. His studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote. However, a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites, about the size of dust grains.&lt;ref name=whipple1951 /&gt;

Whipple had already developed a solution to this problem in 1946. Originally known as a "meteor bumper" and now termed the [[Whipple shield]], this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecraft's body. When a micrometeoroid strikes the foil, it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads. By the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft, it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below.&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;Brian Marsden, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-fred-whipple-533019.html "Professor Fred Whipple: Astronomer who developed the idea that comets are 'dirty snowballs'."] ''The Independent'', 13 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The shield allows a spacecraft body to be built to just the thickness needed for structural integrity, while the foil adds little additional weight. Such a spacecraft is lighter than one with panels designed to stop the meteoroids directly.

For spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit, some variety of the Whipple shield has been almost universal for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/289/5480/728 "Of Comets and Meteors"] ''Science'', Volume 289 Number 5480 (4 August 2000), p. 728.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Reustle (curator), [http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm "Shield Development: Basic Concepts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927133616/http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm |date=27 September 2011 }}, NASA HVIT.

=== NORAD, Gabbard and Kessler ===
To avoid artificial space debris, many—but not all—research satellites are launched on [[elliptical orbit]]s with perigees inside Earth's atmosphere so they will destroy themselves. [[Willy Ley]] predicted in 1960 that "In time, a number of such accidentally too-lucky shots will accumulate in space and will have to be removed when the era of manned space flight arrives".&lt;ref name="ley196008"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy |date=August 1960 |title=How to Slay Dragons |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v18n06_1960-08#page/n55/mode/2up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=57–72 |department=For Your Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957, the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) began compiling a database (the [[Space Object Catalog]]) of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit: satellites, protective shields and upper- and lower-stage booster rockets. [[NASA]] published modified versions of the database in [[two-line element set]],&lt;ref name="Hoots"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felix Hoots | first1 = Paul Schumacher Jr. | last2 = Glover | first2 = Robert | year = | title = History of Analytical Orbit Modeling in the U.S. Space Surveillance System | url = | journal = Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 174–185 | doi=10.2514/1.9161| bibcode = 2004JGCD...27..174H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the early 1980s the CelesTrak [[bulletin board system]] re-published them.&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Kelso, [http://celestrak.com/NORAD/archives/ CelesTrak BBS: Historical Archives], 2-line elements dating to 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gabbard diagram.png|thumb|alt=Debris graph of altitude and orbital period|Gabbard diagram of almost 300 pieces of debris from the disintegration of the five-month-old third stage of the Chinese Long March 4 booster on 11 March 2000]]
The trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions.&lt;ref name=s48&gt;Schefter, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were deliberately caused during 1960s [[anti-satellite weapon]] (ASAT) testing, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. To improve tracking, NORAD employee John Gabbard kept a separate database. Studying the explosions, Gabbard developed a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products, and Gabbard diagrams (or plots) are now widely used. These studies were used to improve the modelling of orbital evolution and decay.&lt;ref name=portree /&gt;

When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s, NASA scientist [[Donald J. Kessler]] applied the technique developed for the asteroid-belt study to the database of known objects. In 1978 Kessler and Burton Cour-Palais co-authored "Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt",&lt;ref name=Kessler78&gt;Kessler 1978&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that the process controlling asteroid evolution would cause a similar collision process in LEO in decades rather than billions of years. They concluded that by about 2000, space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

At the time, it was widely thought that drag from the [[Atmosphere of Earth|upper atmosphere]] would de-orbit debris faster than it was created. However, Gabbard was aware that the number and type of objects in space were under-represented in the NORAD data and was familiar with its behaviour. In an interview shortly after the publication of Kessler's paper, Gabbard coined the term "[[Kessler syndrome]]" to refer to the accumulation of debris;&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; it became widely used after its appearance in a 1982 ''[[Popular Science]]'' article,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Schefter&lt;/ref&gt; which won the Aviation-Space Writers Association 1982 National Journalism Award.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

=== Follow-up studies ===
[[File:Baker-Nunn camera.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Large camera, with a man standing next to it for scale|[[Schmidt camera#Baker-Nunn|Baker-Nunn cameras]] were widely used to study space debris.]]
The lack of hard data about space debris prompted a series of studies to better characterize the LEO environment. In October 1979, [[NASA]] provided Kessler with funding for further studies.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; Several approaches were used by these studies.

Optical telescopes or short-wavelength radar was used to measure the number and size of space objects, and these measurements demonstrated that the published population count was at least 50% too low.&lt;ref name=k9165&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, it was believed that the NORAD database accounted for the majority of large objects in orbit. Some objects (typically, U.S. military spacecraft) were found to be omitted from the NORAD list, and others were not included because they were considered unimportant. The list could not easily account for objects under {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} in size—in particular, debris from exploding rocket stages and several 1960s anti-satellite tests.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

Returned spacecraft were microscopically examined for small impacts, and sections of [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] which were recovered were found to be pitted. Each study indicated that the debris flux was higher than expected and debris was the primary source of collisions in space. LEO already demonstrated the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1978 Kessler found that 42 percent of cataloged debris was the result of 19 events, primarily explosions of spent rocket stages (especially U.S. [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rockets]]).&lt;ref name=kessler81&gt;Kessler 1981&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered this by first identifying those launches that were described having a large number of objects associated with a payload, then researching the literature to determine the rockets used in the launch.  In 1979, this finding resulted in establishment of the NASA Orbital Debris Program after a briefing to NASA senior management, overturning the previously held belief that most unknown debris was from old ASAT tests, but from US upper stage rocket explosions and could be easily managed by depleting the unused fuel following the payload injection the upper stage Delta rocket.  Beginning in 1986, when it was discovered that other international agencies were possibly experiencing the same type of problem, NASA expanded its program to include international agencies, the first being the European Space Agency.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2"&gt;Klinkrad, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other Delta components in orbit (Delta was a workhorse of the U.S. space program) had not yet exploded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== {{anchor|A new Kessler Syndrome}}A new Kessler syndrome ===
During the 1980s, the U.S. Air Force conducted an experimental program to determine what would happen if debris collided with satellites or other debris. The study demonstrated that the process differed from micrometeoroid collisions, with large chunks of debris created which would become collision threats.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1991, Kessler published "Collisional cascading: The limits of population growth in low Earth orbit"&lt;ref&gt;[http://meteor.uwo.ca/kessler/Critical%20Density%201991.pdf pdf of article]&lt;/ref&gt; with the best data then available. Citing the USAF conclusions about creation of debris, he wrote that although almost all debris objects (such as paint flecks) were lightweight, most of its mass was in debris about {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}} or heavier. This mass could destroy a spacecraft on impact, creating more debris in the critical-mass area.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; According to the National Academy of Sciences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A 1-kg object impacting at 10&amp;nbsp;km/s, for example, is probably capable of catastrophically breaking up a 1,000-kg spacecraft if it strikes a high-density element in the spacecraft. In such a breakup, numerous fragments larger than 1&amp;nbsp;kg would be created.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kessler's analysis divided the problem into three parts. With a low-enough density, the addition of debris by impacts is slower than their decay rate and the problem is not significant. Beyond that is a critical density, where additional debris leads to additional collisions. At densities beyond this critical mass production exceeds decay, leading to a cascading [[chain reaction]] reducing the orbiting population to small objects (several cm in size) and increasing the hazard of space activity.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; This chain reaction is known as the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In an early 2009 historical overview, Kessler summed up the situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aggressive space activities without adequate safeguards could significantly shorten the time between collisions and produce an intolerable hazard to future spacecraft. Some of the most environmentally dangerous activities in space include large constellations such as those initially proposed by the Strategic Defense Initiative in the mid-1980s, large structures such as those considered in the late-1970s for building solar power stations in Earth orbit, and anti-satellite warfare using systems tested by the USSR, the U.S., and China over the past 30 years. Such aggressive activities could set up a situation where a single satellite failure could lead to cascading failures of many satellites in a period much shorter than years.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Debris growth ===
During the 1980s, NASA and other U.S. groups attempted to limit the growth of debris. One effective&lt;!-- see Kessler's estimate above about debris from exploding boosters --&gt; solution was implemented by [[McDonnell Douglas]] on the Delta booster,{{when|date=December 2014}} by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks. This eliminated the pressure buildup in the tanks which caused them to explode in the past.&lt;ref name=s50&gt;Schefter, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries were slower to adopt this measure and, due especially to a number of launches by the [[Soviet Union]], the problem grew throughout the decade.&lt;ref name=h7&gt;See charts, Hoffman p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new battery of studies followed{{when|date=December 2014}} as NASA, NORAD and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment, with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward. Although in 1981 (when Schefter's article was published) the number of objects was estimated at 5,000,&lt;ref name=s48 /&gt; new detectors in the [[Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance]] system found new objects. By the late 1990s, it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;See chart, Hoffman p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects,&lt;ref&gt;In the time between writing Chapter 1 (earlier) and the Prolog (later) of ''Space Debris'', Klinkrad changed the number from 8,500 to 13,000 – compare p. 6 and ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an [[Anti-satellite weapon|ASAT]] test and a satellite collision.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hoffman, [http://defensenews.com/blogs/space-symposium/ "It's getting crowded up there."] ''Space News'', 3 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, NASA said that 22,000 objects were being tracked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/04/06/space-junk-threat-grow-astronauts-satellites/ "Space Junk Threat Will Grow for Astronauts and Satellites"], Fox News, 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings. According to Kessler's 1991 derivation and 2001 updates,&lt;ref&gt;Kessler 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the LEO environment in the {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} altitude range should be cascading. However, only one major incident has occurred: the [[2009 satellite collision]] between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. The lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Technical&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}} According to Kessler a cascade would not be obvious until it was well advanced, which might take years.&lt;ref name=graph&gt;Jan Stupl et al, [http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf "Debris-debris collision avoidance using medium power ground-based lasers"], 2010 Beijing Orbital Debris Mitigation Workshop, 18–19 October 2010, see graph p. 4  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309055302/http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf |date=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 NASA model suggested that if no new launches took place the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055, when it would increase on its own.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;Stefan Lovgren, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0119_060119_space_junk.html "Space Junk Cleanup Needed, NASA Experts Warn."] ''National Geographic News'', 19 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.-C Liou and N. L. Johnson, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/311/5759/340 "Risks in Space from Orbiting Debris"], ''Science'', Volume 311 Number 5759 (20 January 2006), pp. 340 – 341&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Crowther of Britain's [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] said in 2002 that he believed the cascade would begin about 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Milne, ''Sky Static: The Space Debris Crisis'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-275-97749-8}}, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academy of Sciences, summarizing the professional view, noted widespread agreement that two bands of LEO space—900 to {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}}—were already past  critical density.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 European Air and Space Conference, [[University of Southampton]] researcher Hugh Lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years. {{asof|2009}}, more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marks, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18050-space-debris-threat-to-future-launches.html "Space debris threat to future launches"], 27 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[National Research Council (United States)|U.S. National Research Council]] warned [[NASA]] that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level. According to some computer models, the amount of space debris "has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures". The report called for international regulations limiting debris and research of disposal methods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14757926 Space junk at tipping point, says report], BBC News, 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The plot of episode 4 ("Conflict") of Gerry Anderson's 1970 TV series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' includes routine missions for the disposal of spent satellites by bombing.

''[[Salvage 1]]'' (1979 TV series) deals humorously with a scrap dealer who establish a space junk salvage company.

''[[Planetes]]'' is a manga (1999-2004) and anime series (2003-2004) that gives focus on a team which is responsible for the collection and disposal of space debris. The DVDs for the TV series include interviews with NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office.

In 2009, [[Rhett and Link|Rhett &amp; Link]] wrote a song called "Space Junk" and made an accompanying music video for the TV series ''[[Brink (TV series)|Brink]]''.  The lyrics refer to two men tasked to clean up debris such as satellites and expended rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fy7psIuJjc |author=Rhett &amp; Link |author-link=Rhett and Link |title=Space Junk Song |website=YouTube |type=video |accessdate=18 August 2018 |date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' is a 2013 survival film, directed by Alfonso Cuaron, about a disaster on a space mission caused by [[Kessler syndrome]].

'''Global communication''' is the term used to describe ways to connect, share, relate and mobilize across geographic, political, economic, social and cultural divides. It redefines soft and hard power as well as information power and diplomacy in ways not considered by traditional theories of [[International relations theory|international relations]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Global Communication implies a transfer of knowledge and ideas from centers of power to peripheries and the imposition of a new intercultural hegemony by means of the "[[soft power]]" of global news and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tehranian|first1=Maijd|title=Global Communication and international relations: changing paradigms and policies|journal=The International Journal of Peace Studies|url=http://www.gmu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''study of global communication''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies the continuous flows of information used in transferring values, opinions, knowledge, culture across boundaries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=="International" Or "Global"==
With the end of the twentieth century and the turn of a new millennium, the global arena and the field of international communication were undergoing significant changes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some authors started to use the term global communication because it goes beyond the bounds of individual states and emphasizes communication between and among peoples across borders and, importantly, the rise of transnational media corporations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[International communication]] traditionally refers to communication between and among nation-states and connotes issues of national sovereignty, control of national information resources, and the supremacy of national governments.

Nevertheless, earlier International communication theories have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The old theories only explain part of the global picture and the theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term "global", implies a declining role of the state and state sovereignty. As a term, "international" has within it notions of bilateral or multilateral decisions. "Global" could be seen as an aspiration, also as a fear, of the weakening of the state. In addition, global may imply something more pervasive, more geographically inclusive than international. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

The study of global communication increased dramatically after World War II due to military considerations coupled with their economic and political implications. Earlier attempts at theorizing have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

More global communication research was written in the decade from 1945–1955; most of the research of the 1950s dealt with propaganda and the cold war. By 1970, global communication research had grown to include a great variety of subjects, especially comparative mass communication systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |edition=1st |title=The Handbook of Comparative Communication Research |url= |publisher=Routledge |date=2012-03-21 |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-415-80275-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; communication and national development and propaganda and public opinion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frederick |first1=Howard H. |title=Global communication and international relations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RBsQAQAAMAAJ|isbn=9780534193447 |date=1993-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of global communication scholars, previous theories of [[Modernization theory|modernization]], dependency, and [[cultural imperialism]] have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication.

The emergence of global communication technologies may be considered the origin of the field of global communication in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Numerous technical advances such as the creation of a new major global communication phenomenon, [[Telecommunication convergence|convergence]], digital environments and the internet are some of the major engines driving the change from [[international communication]] to global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Global power shifts===
With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union's collapse|Soviet Union]], the shadow of [[Cold War]] has lifted to reveal shifting political, economic, and cultural alliances and conflicts. The increasing importance of these currents, especially in the cultural sphere, demands a reconsideration of the nature of the international communication field within the rubric of international relations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Communication in Transition: The End of Diversity?|url = https://www.amazon.com/Global-Communication-Transition-Diversity-Values-ebook/dp/B00YFRD9G6/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450650195&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=global+communication+in+transition|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc|date = 1996-02-05|first = Hamid|last = Mowlana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News agencies and propaganda===
Three key players are usually recognized as the founders of the international [[News agency|news agencies]]. In 1835, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] created the world's first news agency; In 1849, [[Bernhard Wolff]] started publishing stock market news and daily reports from Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt; In 1849, [[Paul Reuter|Paul Julius Freiherr von Reuter]] established his own commercial service, the [[Reuters|Reuter]] agency, and organized a worldwide exchange of news in 1870.

In 1859, Reuter, [[Havas]] and the German [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau|Wolff]] agency reached an agreement to exchange news from all over the world, which was known as the League of Allied Agencies, or the " Ring Combination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "The Ring Combination": Information, Power, and the World News Agency Cartel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YDVlAAAAMAAJ|publisher = University of Chicago, Department of History|date = 1999-01-01|first = Alexander Scott|last = Nalbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Associated Press|American News Agency Associated Press]] was founded and was formally admitted into the "Ring Combination" in 1887.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are some major factors that point to the growing importance of global communication in the world of the twenty-first century:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# world population explosion

# from [[geopolitics]] to [[Gaia philosophy|gaiapolitics]]

# increased [[cross-cultural communication]]
# changing concept of community
# greater [[Centralisation|centralization of control]]
# information explosion
# changes in technologies
# greater dependence on global communication
# greater [[interdependence]] and democracy
# impact of communication on peace and war

== Theoretical approaches and perspectives ==

=== Transcultural political economy ===

Transcultural Political Economy is a concept that is presented in Global Communications by Paula Chakravartty and Yeuzhi Zhao. This concept looks at global communications and media studies in three major areas: global flows of information and culture, decentralizing the conceptual parameters of global information and media studies, and the normative debates in global communications in the context of neoliberalism. Transcultural Political Economy is a multidisciplinary study that focuses on the tensions between political economy and cultural studies. It "integrate[s] institutional and cultural analyzes and address urgent questions in global communications in the context of economic integration, empire formation, and the tensions associated with adapting new privatized technologies, neoliberalized and globalized institutional structures, and hybrid cultural forms and practices". Transcultural Political Economy addresses the issues surrounding the practice of neoliberalism and its creation of unequal power structures within the world system.

=== Globalization theory ===
{{See also|Globalization}}

Globalization theory was popularized in the 1990s as a model for understanding global communication. The concept of [[globalization]] inspired a number of theories from various schools of thought in communication studies that each emphasize different aspects of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization, development and the mass media |last=Sparks |first=Colin |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7619-6161-1 |location=Thousand Oaks, California |pages=126–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many globalization theories highlight actors in the business sector as leaders in the processes of global integration. Transnationalizing business is often celebrated as progression toward a more interconnected world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Globalization theories are often associated with theories of modernity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some scholars view globalization as the social, political, economic, and cultural integration of societies into a capitalist system; Others see globalization as a successor to modernity, while some see it as an iteration of imperialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some question the usefulness and legitimacy of globalization theory, arguing that it does not adequately conceptualize current international relations or function as a lens through which to examine everyday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Globalization Theory: A Post Mortem |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/pal/ip/2005/00000042/00000001/art00002 |journal=International Politics |date=2005-03-01 |pages=2–74 |volume=42 |issue=1 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800098 |first=Justin |last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars criticize globalization theories as overzealous toward and unrealistic about the extent of global integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why the World Isn't Flat in International Politics: Enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last=Ghemawat |first=Pankaj |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-205-77876-8 |location=United States |pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars criticize social theorists for offering opinions and predictions based on theory with little practical evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, some scholars work to dispute the pessimistic views of globalization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Art |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Jervis |editor2-first=Robert |title=International politics: enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last1=Micklethwait |first1=John |last2=Woolridge |first2=Adrian |chapter=Why the Globalization Backlash is Stupid in International Politics |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn= |location=United States |pages=348–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World systems theory ===
World-system theory is a macro-sociological perspective that seeks to explain the dynamics of the "capitalist world economy" as a "total social system". A world-system is what Wallerstein terms a "world-economy", integrated through the market rather than a political centre, in which two or more regions are interdependent with respect to necessities like food, fuel, and two or more polities compete for domination without the emergence of one single centre forever.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfrank, Walter L. (2000). "Paradigm Regained? The Rules of Wallerstein's World-System Method. Journal of World-Systems Research. Vol. 6. N. 2 pp. 150-195&lt;/ref&gt; World-system theory was first articulated by Immanuel Wallerstein. There are three major sources of the world-system theory which conceived by Wallerstein: the Annales school's general methodology, Marx's focus on accumulation process and competitive class struggles and so on, and dependence theory's neo-Marxist explanation of development processes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y The dictionary of anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell]'', {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the transnational division of labor, world-system divides the world into core countries, peripheral countries, semi-peripheral countries and external areas. The core countries usually developed a strong central governments, extensive bureaucracies and large mercenary armies, which permit the local bourgeoisie to obtain control over international commerce and extract capital surpluses from the trade for benefits.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Paul Halsall(1997) [https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Wallerstein.asp Modern History Sourcebook: ''Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral countries often lack strong central governments or been controlled by core countries, they export raw materials and rely on coercive labor practices.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Semi-peripheries which served as buffers between the core and the peripheries. They retain limited but declining access to international banking and the production of high-cost high-quality manufactured goods.[3] External areas such as Russia maintain their own economic systems, they want to remain outside the modern world economy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modernisation theory ===

The theory of modernization was developed by Daniel Lerner (1958) in the "Passing of traditional society." Lerner's description of "modernised" is an individual having the ability to be empathetic and being able to see oneself in another person's situation. This concept has come from the transition of traditional societies to modern societies, where modern societies is distinctively industrial, urban, literate, and participant. This theory looks at development in a linear fashion, concluding that nations need to develop into a modern society to make it a sustainable and flourishing nation. Developing modernized societies include technological advancement, and developing media sectors to help create a participatory culture. 
&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, D. (1958). The passing of traditional society: Modernising the Middle East. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-colonialism ===
''See also:'' [[Post-structuralism]], [[imperialism]], [[modernity]],

Post-colonialism is a theoretical approach to looking at literature that examines the colonizer-colonized experience. It deals with the adaptation of formerly colonized nations and their development in cultural, political, economical aspects. Some Notable theoreticians include: [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Edward Said]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[R Siva Kumar]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[Derek Gregory]].

=== Cultural imperialism ===
Cultural imperialism is a mighty civilization exerts culture influence over another. Less economically prominent cultures often import culture from Western countries, which have the economic means to produce a majority of the world's cultural media, mostly via the global transmission of media.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ketchum, [http://classroom.synonym.com/meaning-cultural-imperialism-7841.html What Is the Meaning of Cultural Imperialism?]&lt;/ref&gt; The weak civilization adopts the mighty civilization's customs, philosophies, worldviews and general ways of life. The theoretical foundations of the academic study of cultural imperialism mostly come from Michel Foucault's concept of biopower, governmentality and Edward Saïd's concept of Post-colonialism, which theories see cultural imperialism as the cultural legacy of colonialism or forms of Western hegemony. Media effect study which integrated with political-economy traditional is the core argument of cultural imperialism. There are two opposite effects of media study. The negative one is that Western media imposes socio-political conflicts to the developing country and the latter one's resistance to the media effects to preserve their traditional cultural identities.&lt;ref&gt;G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), ''American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects are the issues of the process of civilization such as women's right or racial equality with exposing to Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). ''Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; Now the term of cultural imperialism usually refers to America's global culture expansion to the rest of world, which include brand name products, video media, fast food and so on.

=== Communication for development (C4D) ===
[[Communication for Development|Communication for Development (C4D)]] is a [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] oriented aspect of global communication studies that approaches [[Global Development|global development]] with a focus on action and participation for social change enacted through communication systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evaluating Communication for Development: A Framework for Social Change|last = Lennie &amp; Tacchi|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D underlines "voice, citizenship and collective action" as central values that promote citizen-led development where the visiting party provides guidance rather than direction within the host community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speaking up and talking back?: Media empowerment and civic engagement among east and southern African youth|last = Tufte, Wildermuth, Hansen-Skovmoes, &amp; Mitullah|first = |publisher = [UNESCO] International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, Nordicom.|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Göteborg, Sweden|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D often incorporates bottom-up theories of social change with the aim to create sustainable change which is believed to be more likely to occur if the efforts are planned, implemented, and sustained by community members themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some development workers and academics suggest that a shared definition of communication for development should be clarified, because disagreement within the field can detract from the characteristics that most scholars view as central to current development, including [[participatory action research]] (PAR).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many C4D projects revolve around media systems as a central site for social change,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which differentiates C4D from other approaches to development. Theories behind C4D highlight that development projects should be contextually situated and that communication technology will affect different types of social change accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Global media studies ===
Global media studies is a field of media study in a global scope. Media study deals with the content, history and effects of media. Media study often draws on theories and methods from the disciplines of cultural studies, rhetoric, philosophy, communication studies, feminist theory, political economy and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan, Daniel and Katz, Elihu (1992). ''Media Events''. London, England: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-55956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these study approaches, political economic analysis is non-ignorable in understanding the current media and communication developments. But the political economic research has become more resilient because of stronger empirical studies, and the potential connections to policy-making and alternative praxis.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Wasko (2009). Global Media Studies. Television &amp; New Media. Volume 10 Number 1 January 2009 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country has its own distinct media ecosystem. The media of mainland China is state-run, so the political subjects are under the strict regulations set by the government while other areas such as sports, finance, and increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face less regulation from government.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cfr.org/about/ Council on Foreign Relations.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has a well-developed media sector, but the mass media is threatened by the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism which hinder the form of Canada's media identity.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, John A. (1969). ''Mass Media in Canada''. The Ryerson Press. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the media in America are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenues from advertisings, subscriptions and the sale of copyrighted materials. Currently, six corporations (Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom and CBS Corporation) have controlled roughly 90% of the America media.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Lutz (2012) ''[http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6 These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America.]'' Business Insider. 14 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Such successes come from the policies of the federal government or the tendency to natural monopolies in the industry.

== Central debates ==

=== Global power shifts ===

[[Frog#Locomotion|Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s world system theory develops a basic framework to understand global power shifts in the rise of the modern world. Wallerstein proposes four different categories: '''core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external''', in terms of different region's relative position in the world system. The core regions are the ones that benefited the most from the capitalist world economy, such as England and France. The peripheral areas relied on and exported raw materials to the core, such as Eastern Europe and Latin America. The semi-peripheries are either core regions in decline or peripheries attempting to improve their relative position in the world system, such as Portugal and Spain. The external areas managed to remain outside the modern world economy, such as Russia.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/wallerstein_summary.php/ Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of global power shifts in the 21st century. One is traditional power transition amongst states, which follows Wallerstein's world system theory. For instance, the global power shifts from the West to the East since the rise of Asia. The other is power diffusion, the way that power move from states to non-states actors. For instance, "climate change, drug trade, financial flows, pandemics, all these things that cross borders outsider the control of governments."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/joseph_nye_on_global_power_shifts/transcript?language=en#t-832180/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global public sphere ===
[[Public sphere]] theory, attributed to [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]], is a theory that in its basic premise conceives of [[democratic governments]] as those that can stand criticism that comes from public spheres. [[Public sphere]]s are places, physical or imagined, where people discuss any kind of topic, particularly topics of a societal or political nature. Global public sphere is, therefore, a public that is made of people from across the globe, who come together to discuss and act on issues that concern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of global public sphere is linked to the shift of public sphere, from restricted to nation-state, to made of individuals and groups connected across as well as within borders.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, it can be argued that philosophers have been thinking about versions of a common space for all people to debate in; however, a global public sphere that can fit the description above began to appear much later. In the second half of the 20th century, the legacy of World War II and technological advancements created a new sense of the global and started the economic and political phenomena that we now call [[globalization]]. This includes the expansion of humankind into space, which gave individuals the sense of a global unity, the growth of satellite technology, which allowed for people across the globe to view the same television channels, and the internet, which can provide access to an unprecedented amount of information and spaces to connect with other people.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Cultural industries ===
The term "[[culture industry]]" appeared in the [[post-war period]]. At that time, culture and industry were argued to be opposites.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditctab20103_en.pdf|title = Creative Economy 2010 Report|date = 2010|publisher = UNCTAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural industry|Cultural industries]]" are also referred to as the "[[Creative industries]].

==== Definitions and scope of cultural industries ====

In the present day, there remain different interpretations of culture as an industry. For some, cultural industries are simply those industries that produce cultural goods and services.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the cultural industries are regarded as those industries that "combine the creation, production and commercialization of contents which are intangible and cultural in nature. These contents are typically protected by copyright and they can take the form of goods or services". According to [[UNESCO]], an essential part of cultural industries is that they are "central in promoting and maintaining cultural diversity and in ensuring democratic access to culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity |title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cultural industries" combines the cultural and economic, which gives the cultural industries a distinctive profile.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, the "cultural industries" have recently been defined as a set of economic activities that combine the functions of conception, creation and production of culture with more industrial functions in the large-scale manufacture and commercialization cultural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Politiques-ministerielles/Etudes-et-statistiques|title = de la prospective et des statistiques|last = |first = |date = 2006|journal = Département des études|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, economic activities involved in the preservation of heritage are also included in the definition of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/87-542-x/2011001/section/s3-eng.htm|title=Defining culture|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global cultural industries ====
Since the rise of the cultural industries has occurred simultaneously with [[economic globalization]], cultural industries have close connections with globalization and global communication.

[[Herbert Schiller]] argued that the 'entertainment, communications and information (ECI) complex were having a direct impact on culture and human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Culture Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science Press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Herbert Schiller|Schiller]] argued, the result of transnational corporate expansion is the perpetuation of [[cultural imperialism]], defined as "the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Cultural Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of transnational corporate expansion, which began in the 1970s with the emergence of [[Free trade zone|Export Processing Zones]] in developing countries, is focused on the development of [[global production networks]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Creative Industries|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Polity Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7456-4839-2|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=19–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was described as a "new international division of labour" (NIDL) by the German political economists Frӧbel et al. (1980).

Ernst and Kim have argued that GPNs are changing the nature of the multinational corporation itself, from "stand alone overseas investment projects, to "global network [[flagship]]s" that integrate their dispersed supply, knowledge and customer bases into global and regional production networks", entailing a shift from top-down hierarchical models of corporate control to increasingly networked and collective forms of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Production Networks, Knowledge Diffusion, and Local Capacity Formation|last = Ernst |first=D. |last2=Kim |first2=L. |date = 2002|journal = Research Policy |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global media empires ====
The largest firms in media and media-related industries have a very high international profile.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Global media empires such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[News Corporation]], [[Time Warner|Time-Warner]] and [[Viacom]]-[[CBS]] now derive 25-45 per cent of their revenues outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Global Media|last = Flew.T|first = |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Basingstoke, UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often argued that the global media are dominated by a small number of powerful media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Herman and McChesney (1997) argued that the global media were "dominated by three or four dozen large [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporations]] (TNCs) with fewer than ten mostly US-based media conglomerates towering over the global market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Global Media: The New Missionaries of Global Capitalism|last = Herman,E.S &amp; McChesney, R.W|first = |publisher = Cassell|year = 1997|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Manfred Steger]] has observed that " to a very large extent, the global cultural flows of our time are generated and directed by global media empires that rely on powerful communication technologies to spread their message."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last = Steger.M|first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that during the last two decades, a few very large TNCs would come to dominate the global market for entertainment, news, television, and film.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Diaspora ===
[[Diaspora]] is often confused with [[wikt:exodus|exodus]]. Diasporas are minority groups that have a sense of connection with a larger community outside of the borders they currently inhabit, and through diasporic media create a sense of a larger identity and community, whether imagined or real.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In scholarly work about diaspora in communication studies, the view of nation and culture as interchangeable terms is no longer prevalent. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] theorized of hybridity, which he distinguished from "old style pluralism", "nomadic voyaging of the postmodern", and "global homogenization". Hybridity is the retention of an original identity and strong ties to an original country and tradition, but with the understanding that there is no unchanged, ideal nation of the past that they can return to. To be hybrid is to also adapt to a new culture and tradition without simply assimilating in it, but rather negotiating a place between the "original" and "new" cultures.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In Communication studies, diaspora is discussed as the identity that unifies people across time and space, sometimes existing in physical spaces and other times existing in imagined 'non-spaces'. However, it has been argued that the concept of 'diaspora' implies ethnic homogeneity and essentializes identity to only ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; One of the most cited and well-known works in the field of diasporic media is [[Hamid Naficy]]'s work on exiled Iranian Americans' creation of cable television in the United States.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Diasporic media refer to media that address the needs of particular ethnic, religious, and/or linguistic groups that live in multicultural settings {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . Diasporic media can be in the diaspora's traditional language or in another language, and they can include news or media from the "origin" country or they can contain the diaspora's local news or media. Diasporic media can be created in radio, television, film, music, in newspapers, magazines, and other publishing, as well as online. It can be argued that the development and spread of satellite television is an instrumental element of the growth of diasporic media today. Satellite television allowed migrants to access the news and popular culture from their homeland, as well as allowing people who speak the same language to access the same channels that might be produced outside of the "homeland"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diasporic Media Across Europe: Multicultural Societies and the Universalism–Particularism Continuum|journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|pages = 481–498|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/13691830500058794|first = Myria|last = Georgiou|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary studies of diaspora show that diasporic media are part of the change in the tendency Immanuel Wallerstein described in his world systems theory. The world systems theory postulates that much of the flow of people in the world has been from the 'periphery', or economically-developing states, towards the centre; which are often metropolitan, economically-wealthy states that grew their wealth in colonialist entrepreneurship. However, contrary to the movement of people, the flow of information (including media products), has tended to be from the centre to the periphery.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Go with the Flow: Diasporas and Media|last = Sinclair|first = John|date = February 2000|journal = Television &amp; New Media|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Cunningham|first2 = Stuart|issue = 1:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology and media ===
The advancement of media and technology have played the pivotal role in process of [[globalization]] and global communication.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding the media|last = Devereux|first = Eoin|publisher = SAGE|year = 2007|isbn = 9781412929912|location = London, Los Angeles|pages = 28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cable television]], [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[digitalization]], direct broadcast [[satellite]]s as well as the [[Internet]] have created a situation where vast amounts of information can be transferred around the globe in a matter of seconds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

During the early 20th century, [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephony]], and [[radio]] started the process of global communication.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Media, Historic Development of|last = Monroe|first = E. Price|date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, Volume 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As media technologies developed intensely, they were thought to create, in Marshall McLuhan’ s famous words, a ‘‘global village.’’&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the world’ s first [[artificial satellite]], on October 4, 1957, marked the beginning of technologies that would further interconnect the world.  The first live global television broadcast occurred when [[Neil Armstrong]] stepped onto the moon in July 1969.  In November 1972, pay TV caused expansion of cable when [[Service Electric]] offered Home Box Office over its cable system. By 2000, over direct broadcast satellite, a household could receive channels from all over the world. Now with the [[World Wide Web]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablet devices]], smart televisions and other digital media devices, billions of people are now able to access media content that was once tied to particular communications media ([[Input/output|print]], broadcast) or platforms ([[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], [[Film|cinema]]).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Justice ===
Justice in communication studies includes, but is not limited to, the concern with democratic process and fostering democratic publics  {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]] theorized of [[public sphere]] (in ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'') as the space that is created whenever matters of common concern are discussed between the state and civil society. Thus, public sphere includes not only the media, but also public protest in the form of marches, demonstrations, et cetera. There are, however, critiques of political economy in whose view it is impossible to work within the current system to produce democratic publics. Such a critique is that produced by [[Karl Marx]], who saw institutions such as parliament, the state, the 'acceptable' public sphere, economic enterprises, and so on as structurally produced and perpetuated by a capitalist system, and thus they can not be mobilized to change it. In such a system, there can only be illusory justice, which is fair only within the logic of the system. This illusion of justice is produced through dominating [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Justice and Communication: Mill, Marx, and Habermas|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|journal = Social Justice Research|date = 2009-02-19|issn = 0885-7466|pages = 134–155|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|language = en|first = Martin|last = Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue of justice in communication studies is the question of decolonizing research methods and theoretical discourse {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . The idea of decolonizing research comes from a rejection of the functionalist approach, which assumed that research can be conducted in a vacuum, free of ideology or the researcher's biases. This approach assumed cultures to be unchanging, homogenous, and isolated from each other. The purpose of decolonizing research and discourse is to 'uncloak' research as an unbiased power structure, and produce research that is more self-aware. The approach in decolonizing research methods attempts to create methodologies that treat the people in the study as participants or partners, rather than subjects - which is a term that in itself carries strong connotations of colonialism. Decolonizing research also involves moving away from Eurocentric models that are assumed to work anywhere else, and instead to create work that is more useful in local contexts. Decolonial approaches specifically seek to produce knowledge about the mechanisms and effects of colonialism. These approaches allow former subjects to 'talk back', which is a reflection of independent agency, on the colonizer's own terms of research, rather than to be 'given' a voice, which is an unequal power structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decolonial Methodologies: Social Justice Perspectives in Intercultural Technical Communication Research|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2190/TW.44.3.e|journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|pages = 297–327|volume = 44|issue = 3|doi = 10.2190/tw.44.3.e|first = Godwin Y.|last = Agboka|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''super-spreader''' is a host—an organism [[infection|infected]] with a [[pathogen|disease]]—that infects, disproportionally, more secondary contacts than other hosts who are, also, infected with the same disease.  A sick human can be a super-spreader; they would be more likely to infect others than most people with the disease.  Super-spreaders are thus of high concern in [[epidemiology]] (the study of the spread of diseases).

Some cases of super-spreading conform to the [[20/80 rule]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galvani | first1 = Alison P. | last2 = May | first2 = Robert M. | title = Epidemiology: Dimensions of superspreading | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 438 | issue = | pages = 293–295 | pmid = 16292292 | doi=10.1038/438293a}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, approximately, 20% of infected individuals are responsible for 80% of transmissions, although super-spreading can still be said to occur when super-spreaders account for a higher or lower percentage of transmissions.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lloyd-Smith | first1 = JO | last2 = Schreiber | first2 = SJ | last3 = Kopp | first3 = PE | last4 = Getz | first4 = WM | year = 2005 | title = Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 438 | issue = | pages = 355–359 | doi = 10.1038/nature04153 | pmid=16292310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[epidemic]]s with super-spreading, the majority of individuals infect relatively few [[contact tracing|secondary contacts]].

Super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors including a decline in [[herd immunity]], [[nosocomial infection]]s, [[virulence]], [[viral load]], [[misdiagnosis]], [[Droplet infection|airflow dynamics]], [[immune suppression]], and [[co-infection]] with another [[pathogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stein | first1 = Richard A. | year = 2011 | title = Superspreaders in Infectious Disease | url = | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 15 | issue = 8| pages = 510–513 | pmid = 21737332 | doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2010.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining a super-spreading event==
Although loose definitions of super-spreading exist, some effort has been made at defining what qualifies as a super-spreading event (SSE) more explicit. Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) define a protocol to identify a super-spreading event as follows:&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;
# estimate the effective reproductive number, ''R'', for the disease and population in question;
# construct a [[Poisson distribution]] with mean ''R'', representing the expected range of ''Z'' due to [[stochasticity]] without individual variation;
# define an SSE as any infected person who infects more than ''Z&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt; others'', where ''Z&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the nth percentile of the Poisson(''R'') distribution.

This protocol defines a 99th-percentile SSE as a case which causes more infections than would occur in 99% of infectious histories in a homogeneous population.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;

During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Beijing, China, epidemiologists defined a super-spreader as an individual with transmission of SARS to at least eight contacts.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Shen, F. Ning, W. Zhou, L.He, C. Lin, D. Chin, Z. Zhus, A. Schuchat. Superspreading events, Beijing, 2003. Emerging Infectious Diseases. Vol. 10, No. 2. Feb. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Super-spreaders may or may not show any symptoms of the disease.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=Richard A.|title=Super-spreaders in infectious diseases|journal=International Journal of Infectious Diseases|date=August 2011|volume=15|issue=8|pages=e510-e513|doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2010.06.020|pmid=21737332| quote=The minority of individuals who infect disproportionately more susceptible contacts, as compared to most individuals who infect few or no others, became known as super-spreaders, and their existence is deeply rooted in history: between 1900 and 1907, Typhoid Mary infected 51 individuals, three of whom died, even though she only had an asymptomatic infection.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cory|first=David C. Wiley, Amy C.|title=Encyclopedia of School Health|date=2013|publisher=SAGE|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|isbn=9781412996006 |quote=Historically, one of the most famous examples of super-spreading was that of Mary Mallon, better known as Typhoid Mary, who infected many contacts, several of whom died, through food she prepared and consequently contaminated, even thought she did not show symptoms. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors in transmission==
[[Image:Herd_immunity.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|How an infection spreads in a community with immunized and non-immunized members.]]
Super-spreaders have been identified who excrete a higher than normal number of pathogens during the time they are infectious. This causes their contacts to be exposed to higher viral/bacterial loads than would be seen in the contacts of non-superspreaders with the same duration of exposure.&lt;ref name="Kenneth J. Rothman 2008. page 561"&gt;Kenneth J. Rothman, Sander Greenland, and Timothy L. Lash. Modern Epidemiology, 3rd Edition. 2008. page 561. Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins. Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic reproductive number===
The [[basic reproduction number]] R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[statistical mean|average]] number of secondary infections caused by a typical infective person in a totally susceptible population.&lt;ref name=nature1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galvani|first=Alison P.|author2=Robert M. |title=Epidemiology: Dimensions of super-spreading|journal=Nature|date=17 November 2005|volume=438|issue=7066|pages=239–295|doi=10.1038/438293a|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7066/full/438293a.html|accessdate=18 April 2014|pmid=16292292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reproductive number is found by multiplying the average number of contacts by the average probability that a susceptible individual will become infected, which is called the shedding potential. &lt;center&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Number of contacts X Shedding potential &lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Individual reproductive number===
The individual reproductive number represents the number of secondary infections caused by a specific individual during the time that individual is infectious. Some individuals have significantly higher than average individual reproductive numbers and are known as super-spreaders. Through [[contact tracing]], epidemiologists have identified super-spreaders in measles, tuberculosis, rubella, monkeypox, smallpox, Ebola hemorrhagic fever and SARS.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Serres | first1 = G | last2 = Markowski | first2 = F | last3 = Toth | first3 = E | last4 = Landry | first4 = M | last5 = Auger | first5 = D | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = Largest measles epidemic in North America in a decade–Quebec, Canada, 2011: contribution of susceptibility, serendipity, and superspreading events | url = | journal = J Infect Dis | volume = 207 | issue = | pages = 990–998 | doi = 10.1093/infdis/jis923 | pmid=23264672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Co-infections with other pathogens===
Men with HIV who were co-infected with at least one other sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea, hepatitis C, and herpes simplex 2 virus, were found to have an eight-fold higher HIV shedding rate than men without co-infection. This shedding rate was calculated in men with similar HIV viral loads. Once treatment for the co-infection had been completed, the HIV shedding rate returned to levels comparable to men without co-infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = M.S.

===Lack of herd immunity===
[[Herd immunity]], or herd effect, refers to the indirect protection that immunized community members provide to non-immunized members in preventing the spread of contagious disease. The greater the number of immunized individuals, the less likely an outbreak can occur because there are fewer susceptible contacts. In epidemiology, herd immunity is known as a ''dependent happening'' because it influences transmission over time. As a pathogen that confers immunity to the survivors moves through a susceptible population, the number of susceptible contacts declines. Even if susceptible individuals remain, their contacts are likely to be immunized, preventing any further spread of the infection.&lt;ref name="Kenneth J. Rothman 2008. page 561"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fine P 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fine | first1 = P | year = 1993 | title = Herd immunity: history, theory, practice | url = | journal = Epidemiol Rev | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 265–302 | pmid = 8174658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of immune individuals in a population above which a disease may no longer persist is the ''herd immunity threshold''. Its value varies with the virulence of the disease, the efficacy of the vaccine, and the contact parameter for the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Jamison DT, Breman JG, Measham AR |title=Priorities in Health: Disease Control Priorities Companion Volume |publisher=World Bank Publications |year=2006  |chapter=Chapter 4: Cost-Effective Strategies for the Excess Burden of Disease in Developing Countries&lt;br/&gt;Section: Vaccine-preventable Diseases |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10258/#A151 |isbn=0-8213-6260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is not to say that an outbreak can't occur, but it will be limited.

== Super-spreaders during outbreaks ==

===SARS outbreak 2003===
[[File:Guangdong in China (+all claims hatched).svg|thumb|Guangdong Province in Southeastern China where the first outbreak of SARS occurred in 2003.]]
The first cases of [[SARS]] occurred in mid-November 2002 in the [[Guangdong]] Province of China. This was followed by an outbreak in [[Hong Kong]] in February, 2003. A Guangdong Province doctor, Liu Jianlun, who had treated SARS cases there, had contracted the virus and was symptomatic. Despite his symptoms, he traveled to Hong Kong to attend a family wedding. He stayed on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel in [[Kowloon]], infecting 16 other hotel guests also staying on that floor (pictured above). The guests then traveled to Canada, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam, spreading SARS to those locations and transmitting what became a global epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/v81n8/v81n8a14.pdf |title=How SARS changed the world in less than six months|accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405125444/http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/v81n8/v81n8a14.pdf |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case during this same outbreak, a 54-year-old male was admitted to a hospital with coronary heart disease, chronic renal failure and type two diabetes. He had been in contact with a patient known to have SARS. Shortly after his admission he developed fever, cough, myalgia and sore throat. The admitting physician suspected SARS. The patient was transferred to another hospital for treatment of his coronary artery disease. While there, his SARS symptoms became more pronounced. Later, it was discovered he had transmitted SARS to 33 other patients in just two days. He was transferred back to the original hospital where he died of SARS.

The SARS pandemic was eventually contained, but not before it caused 8,273 cases and 775 deaths. Within two weeks of the original outbreak in Guangdong Province, SARS had spread to 37 countries.&lt;ref name=ncbi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shen|first=Zhuang|author2=Fang Ning |title=Superspreading SARS Events, Beijing 2003|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=February 2004|volume=10|issue=2|pages=256–260|doi=10.3201/eid1002.030732|pmid=15030693|pmc=3322930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measles outbreak 1989===
[[File:Measles vaccination coverage world.svg|thumb|Rates of measles vaccination worldwide]]
Measles is a highly contagious, air-borne virus that reappears even among vaccinated populations. In one Finnish town in 1989, an explosive school-based outbreak resulted in 51 cases, several of whom had been previously vaccinated. One child alone, infected 22 others. It was noted during this outbreak that when vaccinated siblings shared a bedroom with an infected sibling, seven out of nine became infected as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paunio | first1 = Mikko | last2 = Peltola | first2 = Heikki | last3 = Davidkin | first3 = Irja | last4 = Virtanen | first4 = Martti | last5 = Heinonen | first5 = Olli P. | last6 = Valle | first6 = Martti | year = 1998 | title = Explosive School-based Measles Outbreak Intense Exposure May Have Resulted in High Risk, Even among Revaccinees | url = | journal = Am J Epidemiol | volume = 148 | issue = | pages = 1103–10 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typhoid fever===
[[File:Riverside Hospital North Brother Island crop.jpg|thumb|200px|Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island, where Mary Mallon, aka Typhoid Mary, was involuntarily quarantined. 2006.]]
[[Typhoid fever]] is a human-specific disease caused by the bacterium   ''[[Salmonella typhi]]''. It is highly contagious and becoming resistant to antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Roger Highfield|title=Typhoid is with us to stay|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=28 November 2006|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3345526/Typhoid-is-with-us-to-stay.html|accessdate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; S. typhi is susceptible to creating [[asymptomatic carrier]]s. The most famous carriers are [[Mary Mallon]], known as Typhoid Mary, from New York City, and Mr. N. the Milker, from Folkstone, England.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, PP. Mr. N. the Milker and Dr. Koch's concept of the healthy carrier. ''The Lancet''. 1999; 353:1354-1356.&lt;/ref&gt; Both were active around the same time. Mallon infected 51 people from 1902 to 1909. Mr. N. infected more than 200 people over 14 years from 1901 to 1915. At the request of health officials, Mr. N. gave up working in food service. Mallon refused to give up working in food service and eventually was involuntarily quarantined at [[North and South Brother Islands, East River|Brothers Island]] in New York, where she stayed until she died in November 1938, aged 69.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, J. Typhoid Mary. ''The Lancet''. 1999; 353:1714&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been found that ''Salmonella typhi'' persists in infected mice macrophages that have cycled from an inflammatory state to a non-inflammatory state. The bacteria remain and reproduce without causing further symptoms in the mice, and that this explains why carriers are asymptomatic.&lt;ref&gt;TM, Ng, DM Monack.

Documents leaked by Edward Snowden that were seen by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' (SZ) and ''[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]]'' revealed that several [[Telecommunication|telecom]] operators have played a key role in helping the British intelligence agency [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) tap into worldwide [[fiber-optic communication]]s.

Each of them were assigned a particular area of the international [[fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic network]] for which they were individually responsible. The following networks have been infiltrated by the GCHQ: [[TAT-14]] (Europe-USA), [[Atlantic Crossing 1]] (Europe-USA), [[Circe (cable system)|Circe South]] (France-UK), [[Circe (cable system)|Circe North]] (The Netherlands-UK), [[Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe#Segment FLAG Atlantic 1 (FA-1)|Flag Atlantic-1]], [[Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe#Segment FLAG Europe Asia (FEA)|Flag Europa-Asia]], [[SEA-ME-WE 3]] (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe), [[SEA-ME-WE 4]] (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe), Solas (Ireland-UK), UK-France 3, UK-Netherlands 14, [[ULYSSES (cable system)|ULYSSES]] (Europe-UK), [[AC-2|Yellow]] (UK-USA) and [[PEC (cable system)|Pan European Crossing]].&lt;ref name="SZAug28"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://international.sueddeutsche.de/post/59603415442/british-officials-have-far-reaching-access-to-internet|title=British Officials Have Far-Reaching Access To Internet And Telephone Communications|author1=John Goetz, Hans Leyendecker  |author2=Frederik Obermaier |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]''|date=August 28, 2013|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telecommunication companies who participated were "forced" to do so and had "no choice in the matter".&lt;ref name=SZAug28/&gt; Some of the companies were subsequently paid by GCHQ for their participation in the infiltration of the cables.&lt;ref name="SZAug28"/&gt; According to the SZ the GCHQ has access to the majority of internet and telephone communications flowing throughout Europe, can listen to phone calls, read emails and text messages, see which websites internet users from all around the world are visiting. It can also retain and analyse nearly the entire European internet traffic.&lt;ref name="SZAug28"/&gt;

The GCHQ is collecting all data transmitted to and from the United Kingdom and Northern Europe via the undersea fibre optic telecommunications cable [[SEA-ME-WE 3]]. The [[Security and Intelligence Division]] ('''SID''') of Singapore co-operates with Australia in accessing and sharing communications carried by the SEA-ME-WE-3 cable. The [[Australian Signals Directorate]] ('''ASD''') is also in a partnership with British, American and Singaporean intelligence agencies to tap undersea fibre optic telecommunications cables that link Asia, the Middle East and Europe and carry much of Australia's international phone and internet traffic.&lt;ref name="smhaug28"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dorling|first=Philip|title=Australian spies in global deal to tap undersea cables|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/australian-spies-in-global-deal-to-tap-undersea-cables-20130828-2sr58.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama Administration secretly won permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2011 to reverse restrictions on the National Security Agency’s use of intercepted phone calls and e-mails, permitting the agency to search deliberately for Americans’ communications in its massive databases. The searches take place under a surveillance program Congress authorized in 2008 under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under that law, the target must be a foreigner “reasonably believed” to be outside the United States, and the court must approve the targeting procedures in an order good for one year. But a warrant for each target would thus no longer be required. That means that communications with Americans could be picked up without a court first determining that there is probable cause that the people they were talking to were terrorists, spies or “foreign powers.” The FISC extended the length of time that the NSA is allowed to retain intercepted U.S. communications from five years to six years with an extension possible for foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Both measures were done without public debate or any specific authority from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakashima|first=Ellen|title=Obama administration had restrictions on NSA reversed in 2011|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-administration-had-restrictions-on-nsa-reversed-in-2011/2013/09/07/c26ef658-0fe5-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_print.html|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2013, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' jointly reported that the NSA and the GCHQ have made repeated attempts to spy on anonymous Internet users who have been communicating in secret via the anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]. Several of these surveillance operations involve the implantation of malicious code into the computers of Tor users who visit particular websites. The NSA and GCHQ have partly succeeded in blocking access to the anonymous network, diverting Tor users to insecure channels. The government agencies were also able to uncover the identity of some anonymous Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secret NSA documents show campaign against Tor encrypted network|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secret-nsa-documents-show-campaign-against-tor-encrypted-network/2013/10/04/610f08b6-2d05-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013|author1=Barton Gellman, Craig Timberg  |author2=Steven Rich |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA slideshow on 'The TOR problem'|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-slideshow-on-the-tor-problem/499/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013|author1=Steven Rich  |author2=Matt DeLong |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Timothy B.|title=Everything you need to know about the NSA and Tor in one FAQ|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-nsa-and-tor-in-one-faq/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA report on the Tor encrypted network|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-research-report-on-the-tor-encryption-program/501/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GCHQ report on 'MULLENIZE' program to 'stain' anonymous electronic traffic|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/gchq-report-on-mullenize-program-to-stain-anonymous-electronic-traffic/502/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA and GCHQ target Tor network that protects anonymity of web users|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013|author1=James Ball, Bruce Schneier  |author2=Glenn Greenwald |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|title=Attacking Tor: how the NSA targets users' online anonymity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Tor Stinks' presentation – read the full document|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-stinks-nsa-presentation-document|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tor: 'The king of high-secure, low-latency anonymity'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-high-secure-internet-anonymity|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly sensitive signals intelligence collection program known as '''[[Stateroom (surveillance program)|Stateroom]]''' involves the interception of radio, telecommunications and internet traffic. It is operated out of the diplomatic missions of the [[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]] (Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, United States) in numerous locations around the world. The program conducted at U.S. diplomatic missions is run in concert by the U.S. intelligence agencies NSA and CIA in a joint venture group called "'''[[Special Collection Service]]'''" (SCS), whose members work undercover in shielded areas of the American Embassies and Consulates, where they are officially accredited as diplomats and as such enjoy special privileges. Under diplomatic protection, they are able to look and listen unhindered. The SCS for example used the American Embassy near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to monitor communications in Germany's government district with its parliament and the seat of the government.&lt;ref name="Spiegel20131027"&gt;{{cite news|title=Der Spiegel Cover Story: How NSA Spied on Merkel Cell Phone from Berlin Embassy - Embassy Espionage: The NSA's Secret Spy Hub in Berlin|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cover-story-how-nsa-spied-on-merkel-cell-phone-from-berlin-embassy-a-930205.html|accessdate=November 1, 2013|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=October 27, 2013|author=Jacob Appelbaum, Nikolaus Blome, Hubert Gude, Ralf Neukirch, René Pfister, Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, Jörg Schindler, Gregor Peter Schmitz and Holger Stark.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that the NSA carries out an eavesdropping effort, dubbed Operation Dreadnought, against the [[Iran]]ian leader [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]]. During his 2009 visit to [[Iranian Kurdistan]], the agency collaborated with the GCHQ and the U.S.'s [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], collecting radio transmissions between aircraft and airports, examining Khamenei's convoy with satellite imagery, and enumerating military radar stations. According to the story, an objective of the operation is "communications fingerprinting": the ability to distinguish Khamenei's communications from those of other people in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="omnivore"&gt;{{cite news

The same story revealed an operation code-named Ironavenger, in which the NSA intercepted e-mails sent between a country allied with the United States and the government of "an adversary". The ally was conducting a [[spear-phishing]] attack: its e-mails contained [[malware]]. The NSA gathered documents and [[login]] credentials belonging to the enemy country, along with knowledge of the ally's capabilities for [[Cyberwarfare|attacking computers]].&lt;ref name="omnivore"/&gt;

According to the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'', the British intelligence agency GCHQ maintains a listening post on the roof of the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Berlin|British Embassy in Berlin]] that is capable of intercepting mobile phone calls, wi-fi data and long-distance communications all over the German capital, including adjacent government buildings such as the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] (seat of the German parliament) and the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] (seat of Germany's head of government) clustered around the [[Brandenburg Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Duncan|title=Revealed: Britain's 'secret listening post in the heart of Berlin'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/revealed-britains-secret-listening-post-in-the-heart-of-berlin-8921548.html|accessdate=November 5, 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating under the code-name "Quantum Insert", the GCHQ set up a fake website masquerading as [[LinkedIn]], a social website used for [[professional network]]ing, as part of its efforts to install surveillance software on the computers of the telecommunications operator [[Belgacom]].&lt;ref name=gchqlinkin&gt;{{cite news|last=Tony Paterson|title=GCHQ used 'Quantum Insert' technique to set up fake LinkedIn pages and spy on mobile phone giants|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/gchq-used-quantum-insert-technique-to-set-up-fake-linkedin-pagesand-spy-on-mobile-phone-giants-8931528.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the headquarters of the oil cartel [[OPEC]] were infiltrated by the GCHQ as well as the NSA, which bugged the computers of nine OPEC employees and monitored the [[List of Secretaries General of OPEC|General Secretary of OPEC]].&lt;ref name=gchqlinkin/&gt;

For more than three years the GCHQ has been using an automated monitoring system code-named "Royal Concierge" to infiltrate the [[hotel reservation system|reservation systems]] of at least 350 upscale hotels in many different parts of the world in order to target, search and analyze reservations to detect diplomats and government officials.&lt;ref name="spirgelconcierge"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach  |author2=Holger Stark |lastauthoramp=yes |title='Royal Concierge': GCHQ Monitors Hotel Reservations to Track Diplomats|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/gchq-monitors-hotel-reservations-to-track-diplomats-a-933914.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=November 17, 2013|date=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; First tested in 2010, the aim of the "Royal Concierge" is to track down the travel plans of diplomats, and it is often supplemented with surveillance methods related to [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection)|human intelligence]] (HUMINT). Other covert operations include the wiretapping of room telephones and fax machines used in targeted hotels as well as the monitoring of computers hooked up to the hotel network.&lt;ref name="spirgelconcierge"/&gt;

In November 2013, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' revealed that the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] ('''DSD''') had attempted to listen to the private phone calls of the [[president of Indonesia]] and his wife. The Indonesian foreign minister, [[Marty Natalegawa]], confirmed that he and the president had contacted the ambassador in Canberra. Natalegawa said any tapping of Indonesian politicians’ personal phones “violates every single decent and legal instrument I can think of—national in Indonesia, national in Australia, international as well”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/indonesia-recalls-ambassador-yudhoyono-phone-tapping-australia Indonesia recalls Canberra ambassador over Yudhoyono phone tapping attempt, Foreign minister demands explanation after documents reveal Australian agencies targeted phones of president and his wife] The Guardian 18 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrying the title "[[3G]] impact and update", a classified presentation leaked by Snowden revealed the attempts of the ASD/DSD to keep up to pace with the rollout of 3G technology in Indonesia and across [[Southeast Asia]].

Under a secret deal approved by British intelligence officials, the NSA has been storing and analyzing the internet and email records of UK citizens since 2007. The NSA also proposed in 2005 a procedure for spying on the citizens of the UK and other [[UKUSA Agreement|Five-Eyes nations alliance]], even where the partner government has explicitly denied the U.S. permission to do so. Under the proposal, partner countries must neither be informed about this particular type of surveillance, nor the procedure of doing so.&lt;ref name="ukusaball"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=James|title=US and UK struck secret deal to allow NSA to 'unmask' Britons' personal data|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The culture of compliance, which has allowed the American people to entrust NSA with extraordinary authorities, will not be compromised in the face of so many demands, even as we aggressively pursue legal authorities..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Strategy for Surveillance Powers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/11/23/us/politics/23nsa-sigint-strategy-document.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The report, titled "[[signals intelligence|SIGNT]] Strategy 2012–2016", also said that the U.S. will try to influence the "global commercial encryption market" through "commercial relationships", and emphasized the need to "revolutionize" the analysis of its vast data collection to "radically increase operational impact".&lt;ref name="nytimessignt2016"/&gt;

According to the classified documents leaked by Snowden, the [[Australian Signals Directorate]], formerly known as the Defence Signals Directorate, had offered to share information on Australian citizens with the other intelligence agencies of the [[UKUSA Agreement]].

''[[The Washington Post]]'' revealed that the NSA has been tracking the locations of mobile phones from all over the world by tapping into the cables that connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as well as foreign ones. In the process of doing so, the NSA collects more than five billion records of phone locations on a daily basis.

The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. He further ruled that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment. He also concluded that the controlling precedent is [[Smith v. Maryland]]: “Smith’s bedrock holding is that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information provided to third parties,” Judge Pauley wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Upholds N.S.A.’s Bulk Collection of Data on Calls|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/nsa-phone-surveillance-is-lawful-federal-judge-rules.html?ref=us&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=28 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 December 2013|author1=Adam Liptak  |author2=Michael S.

According to the New York Times the NSA is monitoring approximately 100.000 computers worldwide with spy software named Quantum. Quantum enables the NSA to conduct surveillance on those computers on the one hand and can also create a digital highway for launching cyberattacks on the other hand. Among the targets are the Chinese and Russian military, but also trade institutions within the European Union. The NYT also reported that the NSA can access and alter computers which are not connected with the internet by a secret technology in use by the NSA since 2008. The prerequisite is the physically insertion of the radio frequency hardware by a spy, a manufacturer or an unwitting user.  The technology relies on a covert channel of radio waves that can be transmitted from tiny circuit boards and USB cards inserted surreptitiously into the computers. In some cases, they are sent to a briefcase-size relay station that intelligence agencies can set up miles away from the target. The technology can also transmit malware back to the infected computer.&lt;ref name="NYT20140114" /&gt;

In a separate 20-page report dated 2012, the GCHQ cited the popular smarphone game "[[Angry Birds]]" as an example of how an application could be used to extract user data. Taken together, such forms of data collection would allow the agencies to collect vital information about a user's life, including his or her home country, current location (through [[geolocation]]), age, gender, [[ZIP code]], [[marital status]], [[income]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], education level, number of children, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=James|title=NSA and GCHQ target 'leaky' phone apps like Angry Birds to scoop user data|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/nsa-gchq-smartphone-app-angry-birds-personal-data|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=27 January 2014|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=JAMES GLANZ, JEFF LARSON  |author2=ANDREW W.

The [[Communications Security Establishment Canada]] (CSEC) has been tracking Canadian air passengers via free [[Wi-Fi]] services at a major Canadian airport. Passengers who exited the airport terminal continued to be tracked as they showed up at other [[Wi-Fi]] locations across Canada. In a CSEC document dated May 2012, the agency described how it had gained access to two communications systems with over 300,000 users in order to pinpoint a specific imaginary target. The operation was executed on behalf of the NSA as a trial run to test a new technology capable of tracking down "any target that makes occasional forays into other cities/regions."

According to research by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and TV network [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] the mobile phone of former German chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] was monitored from 2002 onwards, reportedly because of his government's opposition to [[Iraq War|military intervention in Iraq]]. The source of the latest information is a document leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The document, containing information about the '''National Sigint Requirement List''' (NSRL), had previously been interpreted as referring only to [[Angela Merkel]]'s mobile. However ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' and NDR claim to have confirmation from NSA insiders that the surveillance authorisation pertains not to the individual, but the political post – which in 2002 was still held by Schröder. According to research by the two media outlets, Schröder was placed as number 388 on the list, which contains the names of persons and institutions to be put under surveillance by the NSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA hatte auch Gerhard Schröder im Visier|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ausspaehung-des-bundeskanzlers-nsa-hatte-auch-gerhard-schroeder-im-visier-1.1880004|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=4 February 2014|author=Stefan Kornelius, Hans Leyendecker und Georg Mascolo|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ottermann|first=Philip|title=NSA tapped German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder's phone – report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/04/us-nsa-gerhard-schroeder-surveillance|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 February 2014|location=[[Berlin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: NSA spied on Merkel's predecessor too |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |work=Associated Press (AP) |publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |accessdate=5 February 2014 |date=4 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205020031/http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |archivedate=February 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smale|first=Alison|title=German Paper Says U.S. Kept Tabs on Leader|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/world/europe/german-paper-says-us-kept-tabs-on-leader.html?src=recg|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== March 2014 ==
The NSA has built an infrastructure which enables it to covertly hack into computers on a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human oversight in the process. The NSA relies on an automated system codenamed [[TURBINE (US government project)|TURBINE]] which in essence enables the automated management and control of a large network of implants (a form of remotely transmitted malware on selected individual computer devices or in bulk on tens of thousands of devices). As quoted by ''The Intercept'', TURBINE is designed to "allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individually."&lt;ref name="TC20140312"&gt;{{cite news|title=How the NSA Plans to Infect 'Millions' of Computers with Malware|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014|author=Ryan Gallagher and Greenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA has shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance – the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

Among other things due to TURBINE and its control over the implants the NSA is capable of:

* breaking into targeted computers and to siphoning out data from foreign Internet and phone networks
* infecting a target's computer and exfiltrating files from a hard drive
* covertly recording audio from a computer’s microphone and taking snapshots with its webcam
* launching cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites
* exfiltrating data from removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer

The TURBINE implants are linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine surveillance "sensors" that the NSA has installed at locations across the world, including the agency's headquarters in Maryland and eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan and Menwith Hill, England. Codenamed as TURMOIL, the sensors operate as a sort of high-tech surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent across the Internet. When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems, the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL system can be used to send alerts or "tips" to TURBINE, enabling the initiation of a malware attack. To identify surveillance targets, the NSA uses a series of data "selectors" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors can include email addresses, IP addresses, or the unique "cookies" containing a username or other identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites such as Google, Facebook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Twitter, unique Google advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique encryption key fingerprints that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs that are sent across the Internet when a Windows computer crashes or updates.&lt;ref name="TC20140312" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Ryan|title=Compare the NSA’s Facebook Malware Denial to its Own Secret Documents|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/15/nsa-facebook-malware-turbine-non-denial-denial/ |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|title=NSA's automated hacking engine offers hands-free pwning of the world|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/nsas-automated-hacking-engine-offers-hands-free-pwning-of-the-world/|accessdate=March 23, 2014|publisher=Ars Technica|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Implants|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Industrial-Scale Exploitation|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/industrial-scale-exploitation/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA Technology Directorate Analysis of Converged Data|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-technology-directorate-analysis-converged-data/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=There Is More Than One Way to Quantum|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/one-way-quantum/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA Phishing Tactics and Man in the Middle Attacks|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-phishing-tactics-man-middle-attacks/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quantum Insert Diagrams|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/quantum-insert-diagrams/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TURBINE and TURMOIL|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/turbine-turmoil/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The NSA and GCHQ’s QUANTUMTHEORY Hacking Tactics|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-gchqs-quantumtheory-hacking-tactics/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Menwith Hill Station Leverages XKeyscore for Quantum Against Yahoo and Hotmail|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/menwith-hill-station-leverages-xkeyscore-quantum-yahoo-hotmail/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Eyes Hacking Large Routers|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/five-eyes-hacking-large-routers/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Selector Types|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/selector-types/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VPN and VOIP Exploitation With HAMMERCHANT and HAMMERSTEIN|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/vpn-voip-exploitation-hammerchant-hammerstein/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Implants|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/|accessdate=March 13, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of March 2014, [[Der Spiegel]] and ''The Intercept'' published, based on a series of classified files from the archive provided to reporters by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, articles related to espionage efforts by GCHQ and NSA in Germany.&lt;ref name="TI20140329" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL20140328"&gt;{{cite news|title='A' for Angela Merkel: GCHQ and NSA Targeted Private German Companies|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gchq-and-nsa-targeted-private-german-companies-a-961444.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=March 28, 2014|author1=Laura Poitras |author2=Marcel Rosenbach |author3=Holger Stark }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British GCHQ targeted three German internet firms for information about Internet traffic passing through internet exchange points, important customers of the German internet providers, their technology suppliers as well as future technical trends in their business sector and company employees.&lt;ref name="TI20140329" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL20140328" /&gt; The NSA was granted by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] the authority for blanket surveillance of Germany, its people and institutions, regardless whether those affected are suspected of having committed an offense or not, without an individualized court order specifying on March 7, 2013.&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL20140328" /&gt; In addition Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel was listed in a surveillance search machine and database named Nymrod along with 121 others foreign leaders.&lt;ref name="TI20140329" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL20140328" /&gt; As ''The Intercept'' wrote: "The NSA uses the Nymrod system to 'find information relating to targets that would otherwise be tough to track down,' according to internal NSA documents.

== April 2014 ==
Towards the end of April, Edward Snowden said that the United States surveillance agencies spy on Americans more than anyone else in the world, contrary to anything that has been said by the government up until this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Volz Dustin|first=Dustin|title=Edward Snowden: NSA Spies Most on Americans|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/edward-snowden-nsa-spies-most-on-americans-20140430|accessdate=May 5, 2014|newspaper=National Journal|date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published by Ars Technica shows NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) employees intercepting a Cisco router.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher |first=Sean |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/ |title=Photos of an NSA "upgrade" factory show Cisco router getting implant |publisher=Ars Technica |date=May 14, 2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Intercept'' and [[WikiLeaks]] revealed information about which countries were having their communications collected as part of the [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]] surveillance program. On May 19, ''The Intercept'' reported that the NSA is recording and archiving nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas with a system called SOMALGET, a subprogram of [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]]. The mass surveillance has been occurring without the Bahamian government's permission.&lt;ref name="data pirates"&gt;{{cite web| first1=Ryan |last1=Devereaux |first2=Glenn |last2=Greenwald |first3=Laura |last3=Poitras| url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/ |title=Data Pirates of the Caribbean: The NSA Is Recording Every Cell Phone Call in the Bahamas |work=[[The Intercept]] |publisher=[[First Look Media]] |date=May 19, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the Bahamas, ''The Intercept'' reported NSA interception of cell phone metadata in [[Kenya]], the [[Philippines]], [[Mexico]] and a fifth country it did not name due to "credible concerns that doing so could lead to increased violence." WikiLeaks released a statement on May 23 claiming that [[Afghanistan]] was the unnamed nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Zach |last=Schonfeld |title=The Intercept Wouldn’t Reveal a Country the U.S. Is Spying On, So WikiLeaks Did Instead |url=http://www.newsweek.com/intercept-wouldnt-reveal-country-us-spying-so-wikileaks-did-instead-252320 |work=Newsweek |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement responding to the revelations, the NSA said "the implication that NSA's foreign intelligence collection is arbitrary and unconstrained is false."&lt;ref name="data pirates" /&gt;

Through its global surveillance operations the NSA exploits the flood of images included in emails, text messages, social media, videoconferences and other communications to harvest millions of images. These images are then used by the NSA in sophisticated [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition programs]] to track suspected terrorists and other intelligence targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Risen|first1=James|last2=Poitras|first2=Laura|title=N.S.A.

[[Vodafone]] revealed that there were secret wires that allowed government agencies direct access to their networks.&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/06/vodafone-reveals-secret-wires-allowing-state-surveillance|title=Vodafone reveals existence of secret wires that allow state surveillance|last=Garside|first=Juliette|work=The Guardian|date=June 6, 2014|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This access does not require warrants and the direct access wire is often equipment in a locked room.&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; In six countries where Vodafone operates, the law requires telecommunication companies to install such access or allows governments to do so.&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; Vodafone did not name these countries in case some governments retaliated by imprisoning their staff.&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; [[Shami Chakrabarti]] of [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] said "For governments to access phone calls at the flick of a switch is unprecedented and terrifying.  Snowden revealed the internet was already treated as fair game. Bluster that all is well is wearing pretty thin – our analogue laws need a digital overhaul."&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; Vodafone published its first Law Enforcement Disclosure Report on June 6, 2014.&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; Vodafone group privacy officer Stephen Deadman said "These pipes exist, the direct access model exists. We are making a call to end direct access as a means of government agencies obtaining people's communication data. Without an official warrant, there is no external visibility. If we receive a demand we can push back against the agency. The fact that a government has to issue a piece of paper is an important constraint on how powers are used."&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; Gus Hosein, director of [[Privacy International]] said "I never thought the telcos would be so complicit. It's a brave step by Vodafone and hopefully the other telcos will become more brave with disclosure, but what we need is for them to be braver about fighting back against the illegal requests and the laws themselves."&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt;

Above-[[Top Secret|top-secret]] documentation of a covert surveillance program named Overseas Processing Centre 1 (OPC-1) (codenamed "CIRCUIT") by [[GCHQ]] was published by ''[[The Register]]''. Based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, GCHQ taps into undersea fiber optic cables via secret spy bases near the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and Yemen. [[BT Group|BT]] and [[Vodafone]] are implicated.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Campbell, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/03/revealed_beyond_top_secret_british_intelligence_middleeast_internet_spy_base/ "Revealed: Beyond top secret British intelligence Middleeast Internet spy base"], ''[[The Register]]'', June 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish newspaper Dagbladet Information and ''The Intercept'' revealed on June 19, 2014, the NSA mass surveillance program codenamed [[RAMPART-A]]. Under RAMPART-A, 'third party' countries tap into fiber optic cables carrying the majority of the world's electronic communications and are secretly allowing the NSA to install surveillance equipment on these fiber-optic cables. The foreign partners of the NSA turn massive amounts of data like the content of phone calls, faxes, e-mails, internet chats, data from virtual private networks, and calls made using Voice over IP software like Skype over to the NSA. In return these partners receive access to the NSA's sophisticated surveillance equipment so that they too can spy on the mass of data that flows in and out of their territory. Among the partners participating in the NSA mass surveillance program are Denmark and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA 'third party' partners tap the Internet backbone in global surveillance program|accessdate=June 19, 2014|work=Dagbladet Information|date=June 19, 2014|url=http://www.information.dk/501280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jensen|first1=Kristian|title=Documentation: The Snowden files|url=http://www.information.dk/databloggen/501278|accessdate=June 19, 2014|work=Dagbladet Information|date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Ryan|title=How Secret Partners Expand NSA's Surveillance Dragnet|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/06/18/nsa-surveillance-secret-cable-partners-revealed-rampart-a|accessdate=June 18, 2014|work=The Intercept|date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== July 2014 ==
During the week of July 4, a 31-year-old male employee of [[Germany]]'s intelligence service [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] was arrested on suspicion of [[espionage|spying]] for the [[United States]]. The employee is suspected of spying on the [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28160767 |title=Germany arrests man suspected of spying for US |publisher=BBC |date=July 4, 2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former NSA official and whistleblower [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] spoke at a [[Centre for Investigative Journalism]] conference in London. According to Binney, "at least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores." He also stated that the majority of [[Optical fiber cable|fiber optic cables]] run through the U.S., which "is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowenstein|first1=Antony|title=The ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control|journal=The Guardian|date=July 10, 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/11/the-ultimate-goal-of-the-nsa-is-total-population-control|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' released a review of a cache provided by Snowden containing roughly 160,000 text messages and e-mails intercepted by the NSA between 2009 and 2012. The newspaper concluded that nine out of ten account holders whose conversations were recorded by the agency "were not the intended surveillance targets but were caught in a net the agency had cast for somebody else." In its analysis, ''The Post'' also noted that many of the account holders were Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gellman|first1=Barton|last2=Tate|first2=Julie|last3=Soltani|first3=Ashkan|title=In NSA-intercepted data, those not targeted far outnumber the foreigners who are|journal=The Washington Post|date=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, former State Department official [[John Tye (whistleblower)|John Tye]] released an editorial in ''The Washington Post'', highlighting concerns over data collection under [[Executive Order 12333]]. Tye's concerns are rooted in classified material he had access to through the State Department, though he has not publicly released any classified materials.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web | last = Farivar | first = Cyrus | title = Meet John Tye: the kinder, gentler, and by-the-book whistleblower | work = [[Ars Technica]] | date = August 20, 2014  |accessdate= April 11, 2015| url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/08/meet-john-tye-the-kinder-gentler-and-by-the-book-whistleblower/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== August 2014 ==
''The Intercept'' reported that the NSA is "secretly providing data to nearly two dozen U.S. government agencies with a 'Google-like' search engine" called ICREACH. The database, ''The Intercept'' reported, is accessible to domestic law enforcement agencies including the FBI and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and was built to contain more than 850 billion metadata records about phone calls, emails, cellphone locations, and text messages.&lt;ref name="Intercept"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gallagher | first = Ryan | title = The Surveillance Engine: How the NSA Built Its Own Secret Google | work = [[The Intercept]] | date = August 25, 2014 | url = https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/25/icreach-nsa-cia-secret-google-crisscross-proton/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web | last = Pullam-Moore | first = Charles | title = Google-like NSA search engine implemented to learn about civilians | work = [[PBS]] | date = August 25, 2014 | url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/google-like-nsa-search-engine-icreach-used-learn-civilians/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== February 2015 ==
Based on documents obtained from Snowden, ''The Intercept'' reported that the [[NSA]] and [[GCHQ]] had broken into the internal computer network of [[Gemalto]] and stolen the encryption keys that are used in [[Subscriber identity module|SIM cards]] no later than 2010. {{As of|2015}}, the company is the world's largest manufacturer of SIM cards, making about two billion cards a year. With the keys, the intelligence agencies could eavesdrop on cell phones without the knowledge of mobile phone operators or foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/02/19/great-sim-heist/ |title=The Great SIM Heist – How Spies Stole the Keys to the Encryption Castle|publisher=The Intercept|date=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] revealed that it had been collecting metadata records for all telephone calls made by Americans to 116 countries linked to drug trafficking.

! Ranking !! Summary
|-
| Individual UCI World Ranking || This ranking system is calculated on a 52 week rolling basis, rankings are updated each Monday. The ranking at the end of the calendar year will be utilised to award an annual winner. Unlike previous ranking systems the UCI World Classification will include &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; male riders from the World Tour down to U23 riders. Points will be awarded on all races from World Tour level down to 1.2 and 2.2 races.
|-
| UCI World Ranking by nations || This is based on the world ranking with the best eight riders from each country contributing towards their nation's overall score.
|-
|UCI WorldTour Rankings || This is the UCI WorldTour ranking of riders, teams and nations taking part in the events of the UCI WorldTour. Only riders being part of a UCI WorldTeam obtain points in UCI WorldTour races.
|-
| Continental Ranking || There will be subsets of rankings which are made up from points scored in non-World Tour races (i.e, UCI Europe Tour, UCI Asia Tour etc) for individuals, teams and nations. This will therefore allow one rider to appear in more than one ranking, for example a rider who won Strade Bianchi and a stage in the Tour of California would be part of the Europe Tour and America Tour rankings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2384">'''World Health Organization Collaborating Centres''' are institutions such as research institutes, parts of universities or academies from "over 700 institutions in 80 countries" that work with [[World Health Organization|WHO]] in disciplines such as [[occupational health]], [[food safety]], and [[communicable disease]] prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/collaboratingcentres/en/ WHO Collaborating Centres]. World Health Organization. Accessed September 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The participating institutions partner with WHO to perform research, provide training, or offer other services in furthering the WHO health agenda. These partners are designated by the WHO director-general as a part of a collaborative network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/collaboratingcentres/cc_historical/en/index1.html Collaborating Centres, Definition]. World Health Organization. Accessed September 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By using networks of established organizations, WHO is able to strengthen the scientific validity of its work and lower the costs of research.

==Centres worldwide==
The World Health Organization has established networks related to a variety of health topics. For example, WHO has put in place centres focused on organ transplants, hearing loss prevention, hepatitis, leprosy, ethics, and maternal health. To move the work forward, WHO has numerous designated centres in each inhabited continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/whocc/Reports.aspx WHO Collaborating Centres global database]. Accessed September 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The network of [[National Influenza Centers|centres for reference and research on influenza]] draws upon resources from Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The network of [[WHO collaborating centres in occupational health]] is chaired by [[John Howard (public health administrator)|Dr. John Howard]], director of the U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], and contains more than 60 designated organizations from across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/CCC/CCCnewsV1N1.html Collaborating Centre Connection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025054435/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/CCC/CCCnewsV1N1.html |date=2012-10-25 }} newsletter, volume 1, number 1, March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23488">The '''WTA Rankings''' are the [[Sports rating system|ratings]] defined by the [[Women's Tennis Association]], introduced in November 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/rankings |title=WTA Rankings |publisher=Women's Tennis Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranking method==
The WTA rankings are based on a rolling 52-week, cumulative system. A player's ranking is determined by her results at a maximum of 16 tournaments for singles and 11 for doubles  and points are awarded based on how far a player advances in a tournament. The basis for calculating a player's ranking are those tournaments that yield the highest ranking points during the rolling 52-week period with the condition that they must include points from the 4 Grand Slams, the 4 Premier Mandatory tournaments and the WTA Finals. In addition, for Top 20 players, their best two results at Premier 5 tournaments will also count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTA – All About Rankings|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/all-about-rankings#|publisher=WTA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 2016, the WTA also distributed ranking points, for singles players only, who competed at the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanjing.itftennis.com/olympics/players/ranking-points.aspx|accessdate=16 September 2014|title=Ranking Points|publisher=itftennis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has since been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/sports/tennis/points-and-prize-money-mean-more-to-olympic-tennis-holdouts.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The points distribution for tournaments in 2017 is shown below. [[2013 WTA Tour#Points distribution|Points earned in 2013]] were a little different in some cases and retained their value until they expired after 52 weeks.

[[File:International Association for World Englishes.jpg|thumb|380px|alt=International Association for World Englishes|International Association for World Englishes]]

'''World Englishes''' is a term for emerging localized or [[Indigenous language|indigenized]] varieties of English, especially varieties that have developed in territories influenced by the United Kingdom or the United States. The study of World Englishes consists of identifying varieties of English used in diverse sociolinguistic contexts globally and analyzing how sociolinguistic histories, multicultural backgrounds and contexts of function influence the use of English in different regions of the world.

The issue of World Englishes was first raised in 1978 to examine concepts of regional Englishes globally. Pragmatic factors such as appropriateness, comprehensibility and interpretability justified the use of English as an international and intra-national language. In 1988, at a [[TESOL Inc.|Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)]] conference in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], the International Committee of the Study of World Englishes (ICWE) was formed. In 1992, the ICWE formally launched the International Association for World Englishes (IAWE) at a conference of "World Englishes Today", at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois]], USA.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;International Association of World Englishes [http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214100854/http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php# |date=2010-12-14 }}, Retrieved on 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now an academic journal devoted to the study of this topic, titled ''World Englishes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467971x|title=World Englishes - Wiley Online Library|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are approximately 75 territories where English is spoken either as a [[first language]] (L1) or as an unofficial or institutionalized [[second language]] (L2) in fields such as government, law and education. It is difficult to establish the total number of Englishes in the world, as new varieties of English are constantly being developed and discovered.&lt;ref name="Crystal"&gt;Crystal, D. (2007). ''English as a Global Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==World English vs. World Englishes vs. Global Englishes==
The notions of [[International English|World English]] and World Englishes are far from similar, although the terms are often mistakenly {{Citation needed|reason=How does one know this isn't just some arbitrary distinction just on Wikipedia?|date=December 2014}} used interchangeably. ''World English'' refers to the English language as a [[lingua franca]] used in business, trade, diplomacy and other spheres of global activity, while ''World Englishes'' refers to the different varieties of English and [[English-based creole languages|English-based creoles]] developed in different regions of the world. Alternatively, the term ''Global Englishes'' has been used by scholars in the field to emphasise the more recent spread of English due to [[globalization]], which has resulted in increased usage of [[English as a lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, N. &amp; Rose, H. (2015). ''Introducing Global Englishes.'' Arbingdon, UK: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradowski|first=Michał B.|title=Barbara Seidlhofer: Understanding English as a Lingua Franca: A Complete Introduction to the Theoretical Nature and Practical Implications of English used as a Lingua Franca (Review article)|url=https://www.academia.edu/3318842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

===History of English===
{{Main|History of the English language}}

'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic invaders]] into [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms of England. Eventually, one of these dialects, [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|Late West Saxon]], came to dominate.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;Baugh, A. C. and Cable. T. (1993). ''A History of the English Language''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two further waves of invasion: the first by speakers of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian branch]] of the Germanic language family, who conquered and colonized parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second by the [[Norman conquest of England|Normans in the 11th century]], who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed a Norman variety called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. For two centuries after the Norman Conquest, [[French language|French]] became the language of everyday life among the upper classes in England. Although the language of the masses remained English, the [[bilingual]] character of England in this period was thus formed.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Middle English]] period, France and England experienced a process of separation. This period of conflicting interests and feelings of resentment was later termed the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By the beginning of the 14th century, English had regained universal use and become the principal tongue of all England, but not without having undergone significant change.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], patriotic feelings regarding English brought about the recognition of English as the national language of England. The language was advocated as acceptable for learned and literary use. With the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the language in this period matured to a standard and differed significantly from the [[Middle English]] period, becoming recognizably "[[Early Modern English|modern]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, R. (2002). "How much shifting actually occurred in the historical English vowel shift?", Minkova, Donka; Stockwell, Robert. ''Studies in the History of the English Language: A Millennial Perspective''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Modern English|18th century]], three main forces were driving the direction of the English language: (1) to reduce the language to rule and effect a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine the language by removing supposed defects and introducing certain improvements; and (3) to fix English permanently in the desired form. This desire for system and regularity in the language contrasted with the individualism and spirit of independence characterized by the previous age.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

By the 19th century, the expansion of the [[British Empire]], as well as global trade, had led to the spread of English around the world. The rising importance of some of England's larger colonies and former colonies, such as the rapidly developing United States, enhanced the value of the English varieties spoken in these regions, encouraging the belief, among the local populations, that their distinct varieties of English should be granted equal standing with the standard of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

===Global spread of English===
;The First dispersal: English is transported to the 'new world'
The first [[diaspora]] involved relatively large-scale [[Human migration|migrations]] of mother-tongue English speakers from [[England]], Scotland and Ireland predominantly to [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], Australia, [[South Africa]] and New Zealand. Over time, their own English dialects developed into modern American, Canadian, West Indian, South African, Australian, and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] Englishes. In contrast to the [[British English|English of Great Britain]], the varieties spoken in modern North America and Caribbean, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand have been modified in response to the changed and changing sociolinguistic contexts of the migrants, for example being in contact with indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Khoisan]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] or [[Māori people|Maori]] populations in the colonies.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins"&gt;[[Jenkins, Jennifer]]. (2003). ''World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students.'' London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Second dispersal: English is transported to Asia and Africa
The second [[diaspora]] was the result of the colonization of Asia and Africa, which led to the development of '[[New Englishes]]', the second-language varieties of English. In [[colonial Africa]], the history of English is distinct between West and East Africa. English in [[West Africa]] began with trade. particularly the [[slave trade]]. English soon gained official status in what are today [[Gambia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and some of the [[pidgin]] and [[creole language|creoles]] which developed from English contact, including [[Krio language|Krio]] (Sierra Leone) and [[Cameroon Pidgin]], have large numbers of speakers now.

As for [[East Africa]], extensive British settlements were established in what are now [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], where English became a crucial language of the government, education and the law. From the early 1960s, the six countries achieved independence in succession; but English remained the official language and had large numbers of second language speakers in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi (along with [[Chewa language|Chewa]]).

English was formally introduced to the sub-continent of [[South Asia]] (India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]) during the second half of the eighteenth century. In India, English was given status through the implementation of Macaulay 'Minute' of 1835, which proposed the introduction of an English educational system in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the process of '[[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]]' led to the development of a distinctive national character of English in the Indian sub-continent.

British influence in [[South-East Asia]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] began in the late eighteenth century, involving primarily the territories now known as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Hong Kong]]. [[Papua New Guinea]], also a [[British protectorate]], exemplified the English-based [[pidgin]] - [[Tok Pisin]].

The Americans came late in [[South-East Asia]] but their influence spread like wildfire as their reforms on education in the [[Philippines]] progressed in their less than half a century colonization of the islands. English has been taught since the American period and is one of the official languages of the Philippines. Ever since English became the official language, a localized variety gradually emerged - [[Philippine English]]. Lately, linguist Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wilkinson_Daniel_Wong_Gonzales?ev=hdr_xprf&amp;_sg=mCNszti2YtJXBcgvTb_FFtSXL3-s4zdYcFDgMf1MYf5IPlslU5e-unjgtlDoLAPc|title=Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales {{!}} Master of Arts, English Language and Linguistics {{!}} National University of Singapore, Singapore {{!}} NUS {{!}} Department of English Language &amp; Literature {{!}} ResearchGate|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that this variety has in itself more varieties, suggesting that we move towards [[Philippine Englishes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307896694|title=a to A��o Social Salesiana em rede... {{!}} Browse publications|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; paradigm to progress further in Schneider's dynamic model after gathering evidences of such happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Villanueva|first=Rey John Castro|title=The Features of Philippine English across Regions|date=2016|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=2750&amp;shelfbrowse_itemnumber=6284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, English is also learnt in other countries in neighbouring areas, most notably in [[Taiwan]], Japan and [[Korea]], with the latter two having begun to consider the possibility of making English their official second language.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

==Classification of Englishes==
The spread of English around the world is often discussed in terms of three distinct groups of users, where English is used respectively as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Jennifer|title=World englishes : a resource book for studens|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-25806-7|pages=14–15|edition=1. edition, 3. reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# a [[native language]] (ENL); the [[primary language]] of the majority population of a country, such as in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.
# a [[second language]] (ESL); an additional language for ''intra''national as well as ''inter''national communication in communities that are [[multilingual]], such as in India, [[Nigeria]], and [[Singapore]]. Most of these Englishes developed as a result of imperial expansion that brought the language to various parts of the world.
# a [[foreign language]] (EFL); used almost exclusively for international communication, such as in Japan.

===Kachru's Three Circles of English===
[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.jpg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English''.]] The most influential model of the spread of English is [[Braj Kachru]]'s model of World Englishes. In this model the diffusion of English is captured in terms of three Concentric Circles of the language: The Inner Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Expanding Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). ''The Other Tongue: English across cultures''. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Inner Circle''''' refers to English as it originally took shape and was spread across the world in the first [[diaspora]]. In this transplantation of English, speakers from England carried the language to Australia, New Zealand and North America. The Inner Circle thus represents the traditional historical and sociolinguistic bases of English in regions where it is now used as a primary language: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and [[South Africa]], and some of the [[Caribbean]] territories. English is the [[native language]] or [[mother tongue]] of most people in these countries. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle is as high as 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States.

The '''''Outer Circle''''' of English was produced by the second [[diaspora]] of English, which spread the language through imperial expansion by [[Great Britain]] in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In these regions, English is not the native tongue, but serves as a useful [[lingua franca]] between [[ethnic]] and language groups. Higher education, the [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]], national commerce and so on may all be carried out predominantly in English. This circle includes [[India]], [[Nigeria]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], non-Anglophone [[South Africa]], the [[Philippines]] (colonized by the US) and others. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, Y. (2006). ''World Englishes in Asian Contexts''. (Larry E. Smith Eds.) Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], while in the Outer Circle, may be drifting into the Inner Circle as English becomes more often used as a home language (see [[Languages of Singapore]]), much as Ireland did earlier. Countries where most people speak an [[English-based creole]] and retain standard English for official purposes, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], are also in the Outer Circle.

Finally, the '''''Expanding Circle''''' encompasses countries where English plays no historical or governmental role, but where it is nevertheless widely used as a medium of international communication. This includes much of the rest of the world's population not categorized above, including territories such as China, Russia, Japan, non-Anglophone [[Europe]] (especially the [[Netherlands]] and [[Nordic countries]]), [[South Korea]], [[Egypt]] and [[Indonesia]]. The total in this expanding circle is the most difficult to estimate, especially because English may be employed for specific, limited purposes, usually in a business context. The estimates of these users range from 100 million to one billion.

The inner circle (UK, US etc.) is 'norm-providing'; that means that English language [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] are developed in these countries. The outer circle (mainly [[Commonwealth countries|New Commonwealth countries]]) is 'norm-developing'. The expanding circle (which includes much of the rest of the world) is 'norm-dependent', because it relies on the standards set by [[native speakers]] in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). World Englishes: approaches, issues and resources. ''Language Teaching'', 25: 1-14. Cambridge UP''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schneider's Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes===
{{Main|Schneider's Dynamic Model}}
Edgar Werner Schneider tries to avoid a purely geographical and historical approach evident in the 'circles' models and incorporates [[sociolinguistic|sociolinguistic concepts]] pertaining to acts of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="y2"&gt;Le Page, R. B. and Tabouret-Keller, A. (1985). ''Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
He outlines five characteristic stages in the spread of English:

'''''Phase 1 - Foundation''''': This is the initial stage of the introduction of English to a new territory over an extended period of time. Two linguistic processes are operative at this stage: (a) [[language contact]] between English and [[indigenous language]]s; (b) contact between different [[dialects of English]] of the settlers which eventually results in a new stable [[dialect]] (see [[Koiné language|koiné]]). At this stage, [[bilingualism]] is marginal. A few members of the local populace may play an important role as interpreters, translators and guides. Borrowings are limited to lexical items; with local place names and terms for local fauna and flora being adopted by the English.&lt;ref name="y5"&gt;Schneider, E. W. (2007). ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 2 - Exonormative stabilization''''': At this stage, the settler communities tend to stabilize politically under British rule. English increases in prominence and though the [[colloquial]] English is a colonial [[Koiné language|koiné]], the speakers look to England for their formal norms. Local vocabulary continues to be adopted. Bilingualism increases amongst the [[indigenous population]] through education and increased contacts with English settlers. Knowledge of English becomes an asset, and a new indigenous [[elite]] develops.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 3 - Nativisation''''': According to Schneider, this is the stage at which a transition occurs as the English settler population starts to accept a new [[identity (social science)|identity]] based on present and local realities, rather than sole allegiance to their 'mother country'. By this time, the indigenous strand has also stabilized an [[Second language|L2]] system that is a synthesis of substrate effects, interlanguage processes and features adopted from the settlers' [[Koiné language|koiné]] English. [[Neologisms]] stabilize as English is made to adapt to local sociopolitical and cultural practices.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization''''': This stage is characterized by the gradual acceptance of local [[Norms (sociology)|norms]], supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events have made it clear that the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of [[nation]]hood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new [[identity (social science)|identity]]. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] (and not always for localized grammar). [[Literary genre|Literary creativity]] in local English begins to flourish.&lt;ref name="y1"&gt;Mesthrie, Rajend and Bhatt, Rakesh M. (2008). ''World Englishes: The Study of New Linguistic Varieties''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 5 - Differentiation''''': At this stage there is a change in the dynamics of [[identity (social science)|identity]] as the young nation sees itself as less defined by its differences from the [[British Empire|former colonial power]] as a composite of subgroups defined on regional, social and ethnic lines. Coupled with the simple effects of time in effecting [[language change]] (with the aid of [[social differentiation]]) the new English [[Koiné language|koiné]] starts to show greater differentiation.&lt;ref name="y1" /&gt;

===Other models of classification===
====Strevens's world map of English====
The oldest map of the spread of English is Strevens's world map of English.  His world map, even predating that of Kachru's three circles, showed that since American English became a separate variety from British English, all subsequent Englishes have had affinities with either one or the other.&lt;ref name="y3"&gt;Strevens, P. (1980). ''Teaching English as an International Language''. Oxford: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====McArthur's circle of World English====
McArthur's "wheel model" has an idealized central variety called "World Standard English," which is best represented by "written international English." The next circle is made of regional standards or standards that are emerging. Finally, the outer layer consists of localized varieties which may have similarities with the regional standards or emerging standards.

Although the model is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three different types of English&amp;nbsp;— ENL, [[ESL]] and [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]], are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes [[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and [[Second language|L2]] Englishes. Most scholars would argue that [[Pidgin English|English pidgins]] and [[English creoles|creoles]] do not belong to one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, A. (1987). "The English Languages?" ''English Today'': 11:9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Görlach's circle model of English====
Manfred Görlach's and McArthur's models are reasonably similar. Both exclude English varieties in Europe. As Görlach does not include [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]]s at all, his model is more consistent, though less comprehensive. Outside the circle are mixed varieties ([[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and mixed languages involving English), which are better categorized as having partial membership.&lt;ref&gt;Görlach, M.

====Modiano's model of English====
In Modiano's model of English, the center consists of users of English as an International Language, with a core set of features which are comprehensible to the majority of native and competent [[non-native speakers]] of English. The second circle consists of features which may become internationally common or may fall into obscurity. Finally, the outer area consists of five groups ([[American English]], [[British English]], other major varieties, local varieties, foreign varieties) each with features peculiar to their own speech community and which are unlikely to be understood by most members of the other four groups.&lt;ref&gt;Modiano, M. (1999). "Standard English(es) and educational practices for the world's lingua franca". ''English Today'': 15/4: 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and varieties==
 {{main|List of dialects of the English language}}

The World Englishes paradigm is not static, and neither are rapidly changing realities of language use worldwide. The use of English in the Outer and Expanding Circle societies (refer to '''Kachru's Three Circles of English''') continues its rapid spread, while at the same time new patterns of [[language contact]] and variety differentiation emerge. The different varieties range from English in the Inner circle societies such as the United States, Canada, [[South Africa]], Australia and New Zealand, to the Outer circle post-colonial societies of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].
The World Englishes initiative, in recognizing and describing the New Englishes of the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], [[African English|Africa]] and [[Asia]], has been partly motivated by a consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by a consideration of the wider [[cultural]] and [[political]] contexts of [[language acquisition]] and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. B., Kachru, Y. and Nelson, C. (2009). ''The Handbook of World Englishes''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[language]]'' and ''[[dialect]]'' are not easily defined concepts. It is often suggested that languages are [[Autonomous language|autonomous]], while dialects are [[Heteronomous language|heteronomous]]. It is also said that dialects, in contrast with languages, are mutually intelligible, though this is not always the case. Dialects are characteristically spoken, do not have a codified form and are used only in certain domains.&lt;ref name ="Melchers"&gt;Melchers, G. and Shaw, P. (2003) World Englishes. ''The English Language Series''. Department of English, Stockholm University, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to avoid the difficult dialect-language distinction, linguists tend to prefer a more neutral term, ''variety'', which covers both concepts and is not clouded by popular usage. This term is generally used when discussing World Englishes.

==The future of World Englishes==
Two scenarios have been advanced about English's future status as the major [[world language]]: it  will ultimately fragment into a large number of [[mutually unintelligible]] varieties (in effect, [[languages]]), or it will converge so that differences across groups of speakers are largely eliminated.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

===English as the language of 'others'===
If English is, numerically speaking, the language of 'others', then the center of gravity of the language is almost certain to shift in the direction of the 'others'. In the words of [[Henry Widdowson|Widdowson]], there is likely to be a paradigm shift from one of language distribution to one of language spread:&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H. G. (1997). "EIL, ESL, EFL: Global Issues and Local Interests". ''World Englishes'', 16: 135–146.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When we talk about the spread of English, then, it is not that the conventionally coded forms and meanings are transmitted into different environments and different surroundings, and taken up and used by different groups of people. It is not a matter of the actual language being distributed but of the virtual language being spread and in the process being variously actualized. The distribution of the actual language implies adoption and conformity. The spread of virtual language implies adaptation and nonconformity. The two processes are quite different.}}

In this new paradigm, English spreads and adapts according to the linguistic and cultural preferences of its users in the Outer and Expanding circles (refer to Kachru's Three Circles of English). However, if English is genuinely to become the language of 'others', then the 'others' have to be accorded&amp;nbsp;– or perhaps more likely, accord themselves&amp;nbsp;– at least the same English language rights as those claimed by mother-tongue speakers.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, M.B. 2008, Apr. Winds of change in the English language&amp;nbsp;– Air of peril for native speakers? Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language) 2(1), 92–119. http://www.novitasroyal.org/paradowski.pdf However, it remains to be seen whether such a [[paradigm shift]] will take place.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A different world language===
The other potential shift in the linguistic center of gravity is that English could lose its [[International English|international role]] altogether, or come to share it with a number of equals. Although this would not happen mainly as a result of native-speaker resistance to the spread of non-native speaker Englishes and the consequent abandoning of English by large numbers of non-native speakers, the latter could play a part.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

As evidence that English may eventually give way to another language (or languages) as the world's [[lingua franca]], [[David Crystal]] cites [[Internet]] data:&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2001) Language and the Internet. Cambridge UP.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When the internet started it was of course 100 percent English because of where it came from, but since the 1980s that status has started to fall away. By 1995, it was down to about 80 per cent present of English on the internet, and the current figures for 2001 are that it is hovering somewhere between 60 percent and 70 percent, with a significant drop likely over the next four or five years.}}
On the other hand, there are at least 1500 languages present on the internet now and that figure is likely to increase.  Nevertheless, Crystal predicts that English will retain its dominant presence.

WHITIA's vision is to facilitate the deployment of thousands of digital medical imaging systems worldwide, providing one billion people with access to diagnostic imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldhealthimaging.org/ |title=Welcome to WHITIA &amp;#124; Homepage |publisher=Worldhealthimaging.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHITIA was formerly known as the World Health Imaging Alliance (WHIA) until it formally expanded its scope in June 2009.

WHITIA's first formal public launch was in April 2009 at the [[HIMSS|Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS)]] Annual Conference &amp; Exhibition in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. WHITIA announced strategic partners including [[SEDECAL]], [[Carestream Health]] and [[Merge Healthcare]], receiving extensive coverage in [[Health IT]] magazines and publications.&lt;ref name="HIMSS09"&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS111037+06-Apr-2009+BW20090406 | title = Not-for-Profit Has a Vision to Help a Billion People | publisher= Reuters | date=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoofinance1"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Merge-Healthcare-Commits-1-bw-14855801.html?x=1&amp;.v=1 | title = World Health Imaging Alliance Poised to Bring Imaging Diagnostics and Data to the Developing World | publisher= Yahoo Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 Annual  Conference of the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) in [[Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], WHITIA announced its partnership with [[Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine|SIIM]], which will allow both organizations to collaborate on specific initiatives.&lt;ref name="SIIM09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090605005136/en | title = World Health Imaging Alliance (WHIA) Announces Support From The Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) | publisher= Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IE09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.imagingeconomics.com/news/2009-06-17_01.asp | title = World Health Imaging Alliance poised to bring imaging diagnostics and data to the developing world | publisher= Imaging Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHITIA was recently ranked #15 of the top 25 most influential people, institutions, and organizations in the radiology industry.&lt;ref name="rt-image"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-10-22 | url = http://www.rt-image.com/25_Most_Influential_in_Radiology_Recognizing_the_movers_and_shakers_in_the_radio/content=9004J05E48B6A084409698724488B0441 | title = 25 Most Influential in Radiology | publisher= rt Image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2009 [[Radiological Society of North America|RSNA]] Annual Meeting, WHITIA launched, '''Remi-d''', a remote-operated screening X-ray system for use in the developing world. Its strengths in these areas stem from the higher burden of [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) and [[Tuberculosis]] (TB) co-infection, high incidences of [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|Black Lung disease]], or outbreaks of other infectious [[respiratory diseases]]. The teleradiology and remote-controlled features of Remi-d allow resource-limited areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America and Southeast Asia, where [[Radiologist]]s and [[Radiographer]]s are in short supply to have a functioning X-ray service.&lt;ref name="RSNA09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | url = http://www.news-medical.net/news/20091130/WHITIA-launches-digital-medical-X-ray-device-for-screening-infectious-diseases-in-developing-countries.aspx | title = WHITIA launches digital medical X-ray device for screening infectious diseases in developing countries | publisher= THE MEDICAL NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHITIA currently has [[Pilot (experiment)|pilot]] [[System integration|integrated]] [[digital X-ray]] sites in [[South Africa]] and [[Guatemala]] at established [[clinics]] in need and is expanding to new qualified sites in [[partnership]] with [[NGOs]] such as [[Rotary International]] while cooperating with the [[local government|local]] and [[Central government|national governments]].&lt;ref name="HTW09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.healthtechwire.com/The-Industry-s-News-unb.146+M5a262949a06.0.html | title = SIIM to Support World Health Imaging Alliance | publisher= HealthTech Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guatemala clinics ==
The Guatemala pilot sites in urban [[Guatemala City]] and [[rural]] [[Río Hondo, Zacapa|Río Hondo]] provide essential healthcare technology to thousands of people in the communities served. They are designed to be models for the wider expansion of the WHITIA network throughout the clinics in need in urban and rural Guatemala. The system's specific design for Guatemala City is an integration of some of WHITIA's partners' strengths and generosity:

* [[SEDECAL]] provides the X-ray generator and controls
* [[Carestream Health]] donates the [[Photostimulated luminescence|computed radiography]] (CR) digital scanner and plates
* [[Kane X-ray]] donates personnel to perform installation and set up of the CR and [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]]

This project was largely funded by several US and Guatemalan [[Rotary International|Rotary clubs]] along with the key resource support of the Guatemalan municipal and national governments.&lt;ref name="GUATE11"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2011-01-09 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110104006502/en/WHITIA-Announces-Completion-Digital-X-ray-Pilot-Sites | title = WHITIA Announces the Completion of Digital X-ray Pilot Sites in Urban and Rural Guatemala | publisher= Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Health Organization''' ('''WHO''') is a [[list of specialized agencies of the United Nations|specialized agency of the United Nations]] that is concerned with international [[public health]]. It was established on 7 April 1948, and is headquartered in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The WHO is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]]. Its predecessor, the Health Organization, was an agency of the [[League of Nations]].

The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by 61 countries on 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the [[World Health Assembly]] finishing on 22 July 1946. It incorporated the {{lang|fr|[[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]]|italic=no}} and the League of Nations Health Organization. Since its establishment, it has played a leading role in the [[eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] of [[smallpox]]. Its current priorities include [[communicable disease]]s, in particular [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Ebola]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]]; the mitigation of the effects of [[non-communicable disease]]s such as sexual and [[reproductive health]], development, and aging; nutrition, [[food security]] and healthy eating; occupational health; substance abuse; and driving the development of reporting, publications, and networking.

The WHO is responsible for the [[World Health Report]], the worldwide [[World Health Survey]], and [[World Health Day]]. The current Director-General of the WHO is [[Tedros Adhanom]], who started his five-year term on 1 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/tedros-director-general/en/ |title=Dr Tedros takes office as WHO Director-General |date=1 July 2017 |publisher=World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Origins ===
The [[International Sanitary Conferences]], originally held on 23 June 1851, were the first predecessors of the WHO. A series of 14 conferences that lasted from 1851 to 1938, the International Sanitary Conferences worked to combat many diseases, chief among them [[cholera]], [[yellow fever]], and the [[bubonic plague]]. The conferences were largely ineffective until the seventh, in 1892; when an International Sanitary Convention that dealt with cholera was passed. Five years later, a convention for the plague was signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/62873/1/14549_eng.pdf |title=The scientific background of the International Sanitary Conferences, 1851–1938 |last=Howard-Jones |first=Norman |publisher=World Health Organization |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In part as a result of the successes of the Conferences, the [[Pan-American Sanitary Bureau]], and the {{lang|fr|Office International d'Hygiène Publique|italic=no}} were soon founded in 1902 and 1907, respectively. When the [[League of Nations]] was formed in 1920, they established the Health Organization of the League of Nations. After [[World War II]], the United Nations absorbed all the other health organizations, to form the WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=Michael |date=October 2002 |title=A brief history of the World Health Organization |url=http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS014067360211244X.pdf |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=360 |issue=9340 |pages=1111–12 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)11244-x|pmid=12387972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment===
During the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, [[Szeming Sze]], a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, [[Alger Hiss]], the Secretary General of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Sze and other delegates lobbied and a declaration passed calling for an international conference on health.&lt;ref name="Pitt ULS"&gt;[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=Szeming%20Sze;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-ua90f141 Sze Szeming Papers, 1945–2014, UA.90.F14.1], University Archives, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word "world", rather than "international", emphasized the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"&gt;{{cite journal |title=World Health Organization |journal=The British Medical Journal |volume=2 |number=4570 |date=7 August 1948|pages=302–303 |jstor=25364565 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4570.302|pmc=1614381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries, on 22 July 1946.&lt;ref name=chronicle_1947&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Move towards a New Health Organization: International Health Conference |journal=Chronicle of the World Health Organization |volume=1 |issue=1–2 |pages=6–11 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf |format=PDF |year=1947 |accessdate=18 July 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809031008/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus became the first specialized agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed.&lt;ref name="shimkin"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The World Health Organization |first=Michael B. |last=Shimkin|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=104 |number=2700 |date=27 September 1946 |pages=281–283 |jstor=1674843 |doi=10.1126/science.104.2700.281|pmid=17810349 |pmc=1614381 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1016.3166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its constitution formally came into force on the first [[World Health Day]] on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state.&lt;ref name=chronicle_1947/&gt; The first meeting of the [[World Health Assembly]] finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of {{US$|5 million}} (then {{GBP|1250000}}) for the 1949 year. [[Andrija Stampar]] was the Assembly's first president, and [[G. Brock Chisholm]] was appointed Director-General of WHO, having served as Executive Secretary during the planning stages.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"/&gt; Its first priorities were to control the spread of [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, and to improve [[maternal health|maternal]] and [[child health]], nutrition and environmental hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Origins, history, and achievements of the World Health Organization  |journal=BMJ  |pmc=1985854 |pmid=4869199 |volume=2 |issue=5600  |year=1968 |author=Charles J |pages=293–6 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5600.293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first legislative act was concerning the compilation of accurate statistics on the spread and morbidity of disease.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"/&gt; The logo of the World Health Organization features the [[Rod of Asclepius]] as a symbol for healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.org.ph/ |title=World Health Organization Philippines |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational history===
[[File:Directors of Global Smallpox Eradication Program.jpg|thumb|Three former directors of the [[Smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Programme]] read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980]]
In 1947 the WHO established an [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] information service via [[telex]], and by 1950 a mass [[tuberculosis]] inoculation drive using the [[BCG vaccine]] was under way. In 1955, the malaria eradication programme was launched, although it was later altered in objective. 1965 saw the first report on [[diabetes mellitus]] and the creation of the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]].&lt;ref name="at60"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/who60/media/exhibition_brochure.pdf |title=WHO at 60 |format=PDF |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Viktor Zhdanov]], Deputy Minister of Health for the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], called on the [[World Health Assembly]] to undertake a global initiative to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate]] smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54.&lt;ref name= Fenner2&gt;{{cite book |last=Fenner |first=Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication |series=History of International Public Health |volume=6 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva|year=1988 |chapter=Development of the Global Smallpox Eradication Programme |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf|pages=366–418 |isbn=978-92-4-156110-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 1966, the WHO moved its headquarters from the Ariana wing at the [[Palace of Nations]] to a newly constructed HQ elsewhere in Geneva.&lt;ref name="at60"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/archives/exhibits/galleries/building/en/|title=Construction of the main WHO building|year=2016|website=who.int|publisher=WHO|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611011659/http://www.who.int/archives/exhibits/galleries/building/en/|archive-date=2018-06-11|dead-url=no|access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing $2.4&amp;nbsp;million annually to the effort and adopted a new [[disease surveillance]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-10-full.pdf |first=Vladimír |last=Zikmund  |title=Karel Raška and Smallpox |format=PDF |journal=Central European Journal of Public Health |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=55–56 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20586232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-11-full.pdf |last1=Holland |first=Walter W. |title=Karel Raška – The Development of Modern Epidemiology.

In 1974, the [[Expanded Programme on Immunization]] and the control programme of [[onchocerciasis]] was started, an important partnership between the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and the [[World Bank]].

In 1977, the first list of [[essential medicines]] was drawn up, and a year later the ambitious goal of "[[Health For All]]" was declared.

In 1986, the WHO began its global programme on [[HIV/AIDS]]. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 [[UNAIDS]] was formed.

In 1988, the [[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] was established.&lt;ref name="at60" /&gt;

In 1998, WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced [[infant mortality]], increased life expectancy and reduced rates of "scourges" such as smallpox and [[polio]] on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. He, did, however, accept that more had to be done to assist maternal health and that progress in this area had been slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1998/WHD_98.1-13.pdf |title=World Health Day: Safe Motherhood |date=7 April 1998 |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[Stop TB Partnership]] was created along with the UN's formulation of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. In 2001 the [[measles]] initiative was formed, and credited with reducing global deaths from the disease by 68% by 2007. In 2002, [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] was drawn up to improve the resources available.&lt;ref name="at60"/&gt; In 2006, the organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for a global prevention, treatment and support plan to fight the [[AIDS pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor=Mu Xuequan |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-10/04/content_5167991.htm |title=Zimbabwe launches world's 1st AIDS training package |website=chinaview.cn |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=4 October 2006 |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overall focus===
The WHO's Constitution states that its objective "is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|title=Constitution of the World Health Organization |accessdate=11 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution: (a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work; (b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate; (c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services; (d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments; (e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services; (g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries; (i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

{{As of |2012}}, the WHO has defined its role in public health as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/role/en/index.html |title=The role of WHO in public health |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and evidence-based policy options;
* providing technical support, catalyzing change, and building sustainable institutional capacity; and
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.
* [[CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistic)|CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistics)]] to provide monitoring of vital events (birth, death, wedding, divorce).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/civil_registration/en/|title=Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS)|website=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communicable diseases===
The 2012–2013 WHO budget identified 5 areas among which funding was distributed.&lt;ref name="20123budget"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of those five areas related to [[communicable diseases]]: the first, to reduce the "health, social and economic burden" of communicable diseases in general; the second to combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] in particular.&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

As of 2015, the WHO has worked within the [[UNAIDS]] network and strived to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |publisher=WHO  |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |year=2011 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |publisher=WHO |year=2011 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. As of 2012, the WHO was to report as to whether [[RTS,S]]/AS01, were a viable [[malaria vaccine]]. For the time being, [[insecticide]]-treated [[mosquito net]]s and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are [[antimalarial drugs]] – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/index.html |title=Malaria Fact Sheet |website=WHO Media Centre |publisher=WHO |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2010, WHO's help has contributed to a 40% decline in the number of deaths from [[tuberculosis]], and since 2005, over 46 million people have been treated and an estimated 7&amp;nbsp;million lives saved through practices advocated by WHO. These include engaging national governments and their financing, early diagnosis, standardising treatment, monitoring of the spread and effect of tuberculosis and stabilising the drug supply. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/index.html |title=Tuberculosis Fact Sheet |website=WHO work mediacenter|publisher=WHO |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to eradicate [[polio]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} It has also been successful in helping to reduce cases by 99% since which partnered WHO with [[Rotary International]], the [[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), and smaller organizations. {{As of| 2011}}, it has been working to immunize young children and prevent the re-emergence of cases in countries declared "polio-free".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/ |title=Poliomyelitis Fact Sheet |website=WHO Media Centre |publisher=WHO |date=October 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a study was conducted where why Polio Vaccines may not be enough to eradicate the Virus &amp; conduct new technology. Polio is now on the verge of extinction, thanks to a Global Vaccination Drive. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Non-communicable diseases===
Another of the thirteen WHO priority areas is aimed at the prevention and reduction of "disease, disability and premature deaths from chronic [[noncommunicable disease]]s, [[mental disorder]]s, violence and [[injury prevention|injuries]], and [[visual impairment]]".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/en/ |title=WHO Violence and Injury Prevention |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Division of Noncommunicable Diseases for Promoting Health through the Life-course Sexual and Reproductive Health has published the magazine, ''Entre Nous'', across Europe since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Entre Nous'' | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715203751/http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous | archive-date = 15 July 2017 | url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous | website = euro.who.int | publisher = [[WHO]]/Europe | oclc = 782375711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental health===
The WHO estimates that 12.6&amp;nbsp;million people died as a result of living or working in an unhealthy environment in 2012 –  this accounts for nearly 1 in 4 of total global deaths. Environmental risk factors, such as air, water and soil pollution, chemical exposures, climate change, and ultraviolet radiation, contribute to more than 100 diseases and injuries. This can result in a number of [[List of pollution-related diseases|pollution-related diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= An estimated 12.6&amp;nbsp;million deaths each year are attributable to unhealthy environments |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/deaths-attributable-to-unhealthy-environments/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life course and life style===
WHO works to "reduce [[morbidity]] and [[Death|mortality]] and improve health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the [[Infant|neonatal period]], [[childhood]] and adolescence, and improve [[Sexual health|sexual]] and [[reproductive health]] and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/index.html |title=Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction |publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218011849/http://www.who.int/hrp/en/index.html |archive-date=18 February 2012 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also tries to prevent or reduce risk factors for "health conditions associated with use of tobacco, alcohol, [[drugs]] and other psychoactive substances, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and [[unsafe sex]]".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/tobacco/en/ |title=Tobacco |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/en/ |title=Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health |publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO works to improve nutrition, [[food safety]] and [[food security]] and to ensure this has a positive effect on [[public health]] and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

===Surgery and trauma care===

The WHO promotes road safety as a means to reduce traffic-related injuries.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/roadsafety/decade_of_action/en/ Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO has also worked on global initiatives in surgery, including emergency and essential surgical care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/surgery/globalinitiative/en/ |title=Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care |publisher=WHO |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; trauma care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/emergencycare/trauma/essential-care/en/ |title=Essential trauma care project |publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and safe surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/ |title=Safe Surgery Saves Lives |publisher=WHO |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]] is in current use worldwide in the effort to improve patient safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/ |title=Safe Surgery Saves Lives |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency work===
The World Health Organization's primary objective in natural and man-made emergencies is to coordinate with member states and other stakeholders to "reduce avoidable loss of life and the burden of disease and disability."&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

On 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] was a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered "extraordinary".&lt;ref name="AP-20140505"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff Writer--&gt; |title=UN: Spread of polio now an world health emergency |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140505/eu-med-polio-emergency-6e6900dc37.html |date=5 May 2014 |location=London |agency=[[AP News]] |publisher=Mindspark Interactkookve Network, Inc. |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140505"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gladstone |first=Rick |title=Polio Spreading at Alarming Rates, World Health Organization Declares |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/health/world-health-organization-polio-health-emergency.html |date=5 May 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 2014, WHO declared that the spread of [[Ebola]] was a public health emergency; an outbreak which was believed to have started in Guinea had spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first1=Kate |last1=Kelland |first2=Felix |last2=Onuah |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/08/us-health-ebola-africa-idUSKBN0G81Q820140808 |title=WHO declares Ebola an international health emergency |location=London/Lagos |agency=[[Reuters]]  |date=8 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health policy===
WHO addresses government [[health policy]] with two aims: firstly, "to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health through policies and programmes that enhance health equity and integrate pro-poor, gender-responsive, and human rights-based approaches" and secondly "to promote a healthier environment, intensify primary prevention and influence public policies in all sectors so as to address the root causes of environmental threats to health".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

The organization develops and promotes the use of evidence-based tools, norms and standards to support member states to inform [[health policy]] options. It oversees the implementation of the [[International Health Regulations]], and publishes a series of [[medical classification]]s; of these, three are over-reaching "reference classifications": the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases]] (ICD), the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF) and the [[International Classification of Health Interventions]] (ICHI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/en/FamilyDocument2007.pdf |title=Family of International Classifications: definition, scope and purpose |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |year=2007 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]] (adopted in 1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infantfeeding/9241541601/en/ |title=International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (adopted in 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/about/en/index.html |title=About the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Health Human Resources#Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel|Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel]] (adopted in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/migration/code/WHO_global_code_of_practice_EN.pdf |title=WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel  |publisher=WHO |year=2010 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of health services, WHO looks to improve "governance, financing, staffing and management" and the availability and quality of evidence and research to guide policy. It also strives to "ensure improved access, quality and use of medical products and technologies".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt; WHO – working with donor agencies and national governments – can improve their use of and their reporting about their use of research evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, S.J., Lavis, J.N. &amp; Bennett, S., 2009. The Use of Research Evidence in Two International Organizations' Recommendations about Health Systems. Healthcare Policy, 5(1), pp.66–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance and support===
The remaining two of WHO's thirteen identified policy areas relate to the role of WHO itself:&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;
* "to provide leadership, strengthen governance and foster partnership and collaboration with countries, the United Nations system, and other stakeholders in order to fulfill the mandate of WHO in advancing the global health agenda"; and
* "to develop and sustain WHO as a flexible, learning organization, enabling it to carry out its mandate more efficiently and effectively".

====Partnerships====
The WHO along with the [[World Bank]] constitute the core team responsible for administering the [[International Health Partnership]] (IHP+). The IHP+ is a group of partner governments, development agencies, civil society and others committed to improving the health of citizens in [[developing country|developing countries]]. Partners work together to put international principles for [[aid effectiveness]] and development co-operation into practice in the health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/ |title=International Health Partnership |publisher=IHP+ |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization relies on contributions from renowned scientists and professionals to inform its work, such as the [[WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/biologicals/expert_committee/en/ |title=WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/bookorders/anglais/detart1.jsp?codlan=1&amp;codcol=10&amp;codcch=874 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231145418/http://apps.who.int/bookorders/anglais/detart1.jsp?codlan=1&amp;codcol=10&amp;codcch=874|archivedate=31 December 2016|title=WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy: Seventh Report |website=WHO Press Office |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Interprofessional education#WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education &amp; Collaborative Practice|WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education &amp; Collaborative Practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/professionals/coordination/en/index.html |title=WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education and Collaborative Practice |publisher=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO runs the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, targeted at improving [[health policy]] and [[health system|systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/alliance-hpsr/en/index.html |title=Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO also aims to improve access to health research and literature in developing countries such as through the [[HINARI]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hinari/en/ |title=HINARI Access to Research in Health Programme |publisher=Who.int |date=13 October 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO collaborates with the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. 

WHO created the Civil Society Reference Group on HIV&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which brings together other networks that are involved in policy making and the dissemination of guidelines.

WHO, a sector of the United Nations, partners with UNAIDS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to contribute to the development of HIV responses in different areas of the world.

WHO facilitates technical partnerships through the Technical Advisory Committee on HIV&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=Technical Advisory Committee on HIV|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which they created to develop WHO guidelines and policies.

====Public health education and action====
Each year, the organization marks [[World Health Day]] and other observances focusing on a specific [[health promotion]] topic. World Health Day falls on 7 April each year, timed to match the anniversary of WHO's founding. Recent themes have been [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne diseases]] (2014), healthy ageing (2012) and [[drug resistance]] (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/world-health-day/en/ |title=World Health Day – 7 April |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other official global public health campaigns marked by WHO are [[World Tuberculosis Day]], [[World Immunization Week]], [[World Malaria Day]], [[World No Tobacco Day]], [[World Blood Donor Day]], [[World Hepatitis Day]], and [[World AIDS Day]].

As part of the United Nations, the World Health Organization supports work towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/about/en/index.html |title=Millennium Development Goals |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/MDG-NHPS_brochure_2010.pdf |title=Accelerating progress towards the health-related Millennium Development Goals |year=2010 |format=PDF |page=2 |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data handling and publications===
The World Health Organization works to provide the needed health and well-being evidence through a variety of data collection platforms, including the World Health Survey covering almost 400,000 respondents from 70 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/en/ |title=WHO World Health Survey |publisher=WHO |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health|Study on Global Aging and Adult Health]]'' (SAGE) covering over 50,000 persons over 50 years old in 23 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/sage/en/index.html |title=WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) |publisher=WHO |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Country Health Intelligence Portal (CHIP), has also been developed to provide an access point to information about the health services that are available in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Health Policy Process|url=http://www.healthintelligenceportal.org/|accessdate=4 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121222652/http://www.healthintelligenceportal.org/|archivedate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it.

The WHO has published various tools for measuring and monitoring the capacity of national [[health system]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Monitoring the building blocks of health systems: a handbook of indicators and their measurement strategies |publisher=WHO |year=2010 |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/monitoring/en/index.htm |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Health Human Resources|health workforces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health |publisher=WHO |year=2009 |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/handbook/en/index.html |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Health Observatory (GHO) has been the WHO's main portal which provides access to data and analyses for key health themes by monitoring health situations around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Health Observatory|url=http://www.who.int/gho/en/index.html|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems'' (WHO-AIMS), the ''WHO Quality of Life Instrument'' (WHOQOL), and the ''Service Availability and Readiness Assessment'' (SARA) provide guidance for data collection.&lt;ref&gt;See respectively:*{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/WHO-AIMS/en/index.html |title=Mental Health: WHO-AIMS |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}} *{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/76.pdf  |title=WHOQOL-BREF: Introduction, Administration, Scoring and Generic Version of the Assessment |format=PDF |year=1996 |accessdate=27 March 2012}} *{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/sara_introduction/en/ |title=Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative efforts between WHO and other agencies, such as through the [[Health Metrics Network]], also aim to provide sufficient high-quality information to assist governmental decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthmetrics/about/whatishmn/en/index.html |title=What is HMN? |website=Health Metrics Network |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO promotes the development of capacities in member states to use and produce research that addresses their national needs, including through the [[Evidence-Informed Policy Network]] (EVIPNet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/rpc/evipnet/en/ |title=Evidence-Informed Policy Network |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1414&amp;Itemid=931 |title=Policy on Research for Health |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2013, a new WHO database, known as [[MiNDbank]], went online. The database was launched on [[Human Rights Day]], and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. The new database presents a great deal of information about mental health, substance abuse, disability, human rights, and the different policies, strategies, laws, and service standards being implemented in different countries.&lt;ref name=MiNDbank&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2013/mindbank-20131210/en/ |title=Mental health information at your fingertips – WHO launches the MiNDbank |publisher=Who.int |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains important international documents and information. The database allows visitors to access the health information of WHO member states and other partners. Users can review policies, laws, and strategies and search for the best practices and success stories in the field of mental health.&lt;ref name="MiNDbank"/&gt;

The WHO regularly publishes a ''[[World Health Report]]'', its leading publication, including an expert assessment of a specific [[global health]] topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WHO |url=http://www.who.int/whr/en/index.html |title=The World Health Report |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications of WHO include the ''[[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/en/ |title=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal]]'' (overseen by EMRO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emro.who.int/emhj.htm |title=Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Human Resources for Health]]'' (published in collaboration with [[BioMed Central]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.human-resources-health.com/ |title=Human Resources for Health |publisher=BioMed Central |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Pan American Journal of Public Health]]'' (overseen by PAHO/AMRO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.paho.org/journal/ |title=Revista Panamericana de Salud Pública/Pan American Journal of Public Health |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the World Health Organization drafted a global health sector strategy on HIV. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/strategy2016-2021/ghss-hiv/en/|title=Global health sector strategy on HIV, 2016–2021|website=World Health Organization|access-date=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with interim targets for the year 2020. In order to make achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that countries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health coverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and efforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with HIV and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters, etc. Among the points made, it seems clear that although the prevalence of HIV transmission is declining, there is still a need for resources, health education, and global efforts to end this epidemic. 

==Structure==
The World Health Organization is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |title=UNDG Members |publisher=Undg.org |accessdate=9 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
[[File:World Health Organization membership status map.png|thumb|right|Countries by World Health Organization membership status]]
{{As of|2016}}, the WHO has 194 member states: all of them Member States of the United Nations except for the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]].&lt;ref name="countries"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WHO |url=http://www.who.int/countries/en/ |title=Countries |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization.) {{As of|2013}}, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and [[Tokelau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendix 1, Members of the World Health Organization (at 31&amp;nbsp;May 2009)|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/members-en.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other countries have been granted [[observer status]]. [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] is an observer as a "national liberation movement" recognized by the [[League of Arab States]] under United Nations Resolution 3118. The [[Holy See]] also attends as an observer, as does the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]].&lt;ref name="observerWHO"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xou_nD9jJF0C |title=World Health Organization |first1=Gian Luca |last1=Burci |first2=Claude-Henri  |last2=Vignes |publisher= Kluwer Law International |year=2004 |isbn=978-90-411-2273-5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Taiwan was invited under the name of "Republic of China".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xitem=103148&amp;ctnode=427&amp;mp=9 |title=Taiwan Today, Taiwan delegation to participate in WHA |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO Member States appoint delegations to the [[World Health Assembly]], WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN Member States are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, "other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly".&lt;ref name="countries"/&gt; Liechtenstein is currently the only UN member not in the WHO membership.

In addition, the UN observer organizations [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] have entered into "official relations" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the [[World Health Assembly]] they are seated alongside the other NGOs.&lt;ref name="observerWHO"/&gt;

===World Health Assembly and Executive Board===
[[File:World Health Organisation building south face 2.jpg|thumb|WHO Headquarters in Geneva]]
The [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) is the legislative and supreme body of WHO. Based in Geneva, it typically meets yearly in May. It appoints the Director-General every five years and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. It also reviews reports of the Executive Board and decides whether there are areas of work requiring further examination. The Assembly elects 34 members, technically qualified in the field of health, to the Executive Board for three-year terms. The main functions of the Board are to carry out the decisions and policies of the Assembly, to advise it and to facilitate its work.&lt;ref name="governance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/governance/en/index.html |title=Governance |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current chairman of the executive board is Dr. [[Assad Hafeez]].

The regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to "establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area". Many decisions are made at regional level, including important discussions over WHO's budget, and in deciding the members of the next assembly, which are designated by the regions.&lt;ref name="burci53"&gt;{{harvnb|Burci|Vignes|2004|pages=53–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each region has a Regional Committee, which generally meets once a year, normally in the autumn. Representatives attend from each member or associative member in each region, including those states that are not fully recognized. For example, [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] attends meetings of the [[Eastern Mediterranean Regional office of World Health Organization|Eastern Mediterranean Regional office]]. Each region also has a regional office.&lt;ref name="burci53"/&gt; Each Regional Office is headed by a Regional Director, who is elected by the Regional Committee. The Board must approve such appointments, although as of 2004, it had never over-ruled the preference of a regional committee. The exact role of the board in the process has been a subject of debate, but the practical effect has always been small.&lt;ref name="burci53"/&gt; Since 1999, Regional Directors serve for a once-renewable five-year term, and typically take their position on 1 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf|title=A year of change: Reports of the Executive Board on its 102nd and 103rd sessions|website=|publisher=WHO|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011220426/http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Regional Committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. Aside from electing the Regional Director, the Regional Committee is also in charge of setting the guidelines for the implementation, within the region, of the health and other policies adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]]. The Regional Committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of WHO within the Region.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The Regional Director is effectively the head of WHO for his or her Region. The RD manages and/or supervises a staff of health and other experts at the regional offices and in specialized centres. The RD is also the direct supervising authority—concomitantly with the WHO Director-General—of all the heads of WHO country offices, known as WHO Representatives, within the Region.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

It also operates the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] in [[Lyon]], France, and the [[WHO Centre for Health Development]] in [[Kobe]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/who_offices/en/index.html |title=WHO liaison and other offices |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional offices include those in [[Pristina]]; the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and the Northern Micronesia office.&lt;ref name="detailedinformation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/countryfocus/country_offices/details/en/index.html |title=Detailed information of WHO offices in countries, territories and areas |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question.

The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). {{As of|2010}}, the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] ("Libya"); all other staff were international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as Head of Country Office, and are nationals with the exception of Serbia; there are also Heads of Country Office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="detailedinformation"/&gt; The WR is member of the [[United Nations System|UN system]] country team which is coordinated by the UN System [[Resident Coordinator]].

The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff.&lt;ref name="peopleandoffices" /&gt; The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/where-we-work/member-states/hungary/who-country-office |title = WHO Country Office (Hungary) |publisher=WHO EURO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financing and partnerships ===
The WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. {{As of|2012}}, the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110&amp;nbsp;million), Japan ($58&amp;nbsp;million), Germany ($37&amp;nbsp;million), United Kingdom ($31&amp;nbsp;million) and France ($31&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/2012_2013_AC_summary.pdf |title = Assessed Contributions payable by Member States and Associate Members – 2012–2013 |publisher=WHO |format = PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined 2012–2013 budget has proposed a total expenditure of $3,959&amp;nbsp;million, of which $944&amp;nbsp;million (24%) will come from assessed contributions. This represented a significant fall in outlay compared to the previous 2009–2010 budget, adjusting to take account of previous underspends. Assessed contributions were kept the same. Voluntary contributions will account for $3,015&amp;nbsp;million (76%), of which $800&amp;nbsp;million is regarded as highly or moderately flexible funding, with the remainder tied to particular programmes or objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012 |pages=10, 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the WHO's work has involved increasing collaboration with external bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |title=WHO's interactions with Civil Society and Nongovernmental Organizations |website=WHO/CSI/2002/WP6 |publisher=WHO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104615/http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|year=2002 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2002}}, a total of 473 non-governmental organizations (NGO) had some form of partnership with WHO. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal "official relations" – the rest being considered informal in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |title=WHO's interactions with Civil Society and Nongovernmental Organizations |website=WHO/CSI/2002/WP6 |publisher=WHO |year=2002 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |page=10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104615/http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partners include the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gatesfoundation.org/livingproofproject/Pages/gavi.aspx |title=Living Proof Project: Partner Profile |publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundations |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/what-we-do/current-work/transforming-health-systems/grants-grantees/world-health-oganizations-alliance |title=World Health Organization's Alliance for Health Systems and Policy Research |publisher=Rockefeller Foundation |accessdate=31 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710062352/https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/what-we-do/current-work/transforming-health-systems/grants-grantees/world-health-oganizations-alliance|archivedate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== IAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 ===
[[File:Alexei Yablokov, Rosa Goncharova, Vassili Nesterenko.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexey Yablokov]] (left) and [[Vassili Nesterenko]] (farthest right) protesting in front of the World Health Organization headquarters in [[Geneva]], Switzerland in 2008.]]
[[File:Devant OMS 5.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration on [[Chernobyl disaster]] day near WHO in [[Geneva]]]]
In 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). A selective reading of this document (clause 3) can result in the understanding that the IAEA is able to prevent the WHO from conducting research or work on some areas, as seen hereafter. The agreement states here that the WHO recognizes the IAEA as having responsibility for peaceful nuclear energy without prejudice to the roles of the WHO of promoting health. However, the following paragraph adds that 

"whenever either organization proposes to initiate a programme or activity on a subject in which the other organization has or may have a substantial interest, the first party shall consult the other with a view to adjusting the matter by mutual agreement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=World Health Organization|title=Agreements with Other Intergovernmental Organizations |url = http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/agreements-with-other-inter-en.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The nature of this statement has led some pressure groups and activists (including [[Women in Europe for a Common Future]]) to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the [[Acute radiation syndrome|effects on human health of radiation]] caused by the use of [[nuclear power]] and the continuing effects of [[Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents|nuclear disasters]] in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]. They believe WHO must regain what they see as "independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Independence for WHO|title=Appeal by Health Professionals for Independence of the World Health Organization|url=http://www.ippnw-europe.org/commonFiles/pdfs/Atomenergie/appeal_healthprofessionals.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Women in Europe for a Common Future|title=Open letter on the WHO/IAEA Agreement of 1959|url=http://www.wecf.eu/download/2010/04/letterIAEA-WHO.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.activistmagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=703 |title=World Health Organization Accomodates &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Atomic Agency |date=3 June 2007 |work=Activist Magazine |accessdate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928232353/http://www.activistmagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=703 |archivedate=28 September 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However as pointed out by Foreman&lt;ref&gt;M.R.StJ. Foreman, Cogent Chemistry, Reactor accident chemistry an update, 2018, 
10.1080/23312009.2018.1450944, https://www.cogentoa.com/article/10.1080/23312009.2018.1450944&lt;/ref&gt; in clause 2 it states.

“2. In particular, and in accordance with the Constitution of the World Health Organization and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency and its agreement with the United Nations together with the exchange of letters related thereto, and taking into account the respective co-ordinating responsibilities of both organizations, it is recognized by the World Health Organization that the International Atomic Energy Agency has the primary responsibility for encouraging, assisting and co- ordinating research and development and practical application of atomic energy for peaceful uses throughout the world without prejudice to the right of the World Health Organization to concern itself with promoting, developing, assisting and co-ordinating international health work, including research, in all its aspects.”

Clearly suggesting that the WHO is free to do as it sees fit on nuclear, radiation and other matters which relate to health.

===Roman Catholic Church and AIDS===
{{Main|Roman Catholic Church and AIDS}}
In 2003, the WHO denounced the [[Roman Curia]]'s health department's opposition to the use of [[condom]]s, saying: "These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20&amp;nbsp;million people, and currently affects at least 42&amp;nbsp;million."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/09/aids |title=Vatican: condoms don't stop Aids |work=The Guardian |date=9 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}}, the [[Catholic Church]] remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/17/pope-africa-condoms-aids |title=Pope claims condoms could make African Aids crisis worse |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister [[Leslie Ramsammy]], has condemned [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict's]] opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to "create confusion" and "impede" proven strategies in the battle against the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hsk4RI5cPLSsvXTY9ZEyWSMrVElg |title=World Health Assembly: Pope Benedict "wrong" |publisher=Google News|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermittent preventive therapy ===
The aggressive support of the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] for [[intermittent preventive therapy]] of [[malaria]] triggered a memo from the former WHO malaria chief Akira Kochi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNeil |first=Donald G. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html |title=Gates Foundation's Influence Criticized |website=The New York Times |date=16 February 2008 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet and sugar intake ===
Some of the research undertaken or supported by WHO to determine how people's lifestyles and environments are influencing whether they live in better or worse health can be controversial, as illustrated by a 2003 joint WHO/FAO report on nutrition and the prevention of chronic [[non-communicable disease]],&lt;ref&gt;Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Consultation. ''Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases''. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2003 (WHO Technical Report Series 916).&lt;/ref&gt; which recommended that sugar should form no more than 10% of a [[healthy diet]]. The report led to lobbying by the sugar industry against the recommendation, to which the WHO/FAO responded by including in the report this statement: "The Consultation recognized that a population goal for free sugars of less than 10% of total energy is controversial". It also stood by its recommendation based upon its own analysis of scientific studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=Mann |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/81/8/editorial2.pdf |format=pdf |title=Sugar revisited – again |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |year=2003 |volume=81 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, WHO reduced recommended sugar levels by half and said that sugar should make up no more than 5% of a healthy diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC News: WHO: Daily sugar intake 'should be halved'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-26449497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 swine flu pandemic===
{{Main|2009 flu pandemic}}
In 2007, the WHO organized work on pandemic [[influenza vaccine]] development through [[clinical trial]]s in collaboration with many experts and health officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/influenza/clinical_evaluation_tables/en/|title=Tables on clinical evaluation of influenza vaccines|website=World Health Organization|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pandemic involving the [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|H1N1 influenza virus]] was declared by the then Director-General [[Margaret Chan]] in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2009/06/who-declares-pandemic-novel-h1n1-virus|title=WHO declares pandemic of novel H1N1 virus|work=CIDRAP|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margret Chan declared in 2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/|title=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009|website=World Health Organization|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the post-pandemic period critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading "fear and confusion" rather than "immediate information".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36421914/ ''WHO admits errors in handling flu pandemic: Agency accused of overplaying danger of the virus as it swept the globe.''] Posted by msnbc.com&lt;/ref&gt; Industry experts countered that the 2009 pandemic had led to "unprecedented collaboration between global health authorities, scientists and manufacturers, resulting in the most comprehensive pandemic response ever undertaken, with a number of vaccines approved for use three months after the pandemic declaration. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abelina A | year = 2011 | title = Lessons from pandemic influenza A(H1N1) The research-based vaccine industry's perspective | url = http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Vaccine | volume = 29 | issue =  6| pages = 1135–1138 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.11.042 | display-authors = etal | pmid = 21115061 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111009120413/http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf | archivedate = 9 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–2016 Ebola outbreak and reform efforts===
Following the [[2014 Ebola outbreak]] in West Africa, the organization was heavily criticized for its bureaucracy, insufficient financing, regional structure, and staffing profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=SJ|last2=Røttingen|first2=JA|title=Split WHO in two: strengthening political decision-making and securing independent scientific advice|journal=Public Health Journal|date=February 2014|volume=128|issue=2|pages=188–194|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2013.08.021|pmid=24434035|url=http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506(13)00291-6/pdf|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of "core capacity" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system.  At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100&amp;nbsp;million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_21-en.pdf|title=Report of the Review Committee on the Role of the International Health Regulations (2005) in the Ebola Outbreak and Response|date=13 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/21/408289115/who-calls-for-100-million-emergency-fund-doctor-swat-team|title=WHO Calls For $100 Million Emergency Fund, Doctor 'SWAT Team'}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which it had received $26.9&amp;nbsp;million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement).  WHO has budgeted an additional $494&amp;nbsp;million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140&amp;nbsp;million by April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_30-en.pdf|title=Reform of WHO's work in health emergency management / WHO Health Emergencies Programme|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities.  In comparison, billions of dollars have been spent by developed countries on the 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic and 2015–16 Zika epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/25/479228380/who-aims-to-reform-itself-but-health-experts-arent-yet-impressed|title=WHO Aims To Reform Itself But Health Experts Aren't Yet Impressed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FCTC implementation database===
The WHO has a Framework Convention on Tobacco implementation database which is one of the only mechanisms to help enforce compliance with the FCTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/fctc/reporting/database |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220023429/http://apps.who.int/fctc/reporting/database/ |archivedate=20 February 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been reports of numerous discrepancies between it and national implementation reports on which it was built. As researchers Hoffman and Rizvi report "As of July 4, 2012, 361 (32·7%) of 1104 countries' responses were misreported: 33 (3·0%) were clear errors (eg, database indicated “yes” when report indicated “no”), 270 (24·5%) were missing despite countries having submitted responses, and 58 (5·3%) were, in our opinion, misinterpreted by WHO staff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hoffman S.J. |author2=Rizvi Z. | year = 2012 | title = WHO's Undermining Tobacco Control | journal = The Lancet | volume = 380 | issue = 9843| pages = 727–728 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61402-0 | pmid=22920746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IARC controversies ===
{{Further|International Agency for Research on Cancer}}
The World Health Organization sub-department, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), has been criticized for the way it analyses the tendency of certain substances and activities to cause cancer and for having a politically motivated bias when it selects studies for its analysis. Ed Yong, a British science journalist, has criticized the agency and its "confusing" category system for misleading the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/why-is-the-world-health-organization-so-bad-at-communicating-cancer-risk/412468/|title=Beefing With the World Health Organization's Cancer Warnings|last=Yong|first=Ed|work=The Atlantic|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel Kuntz, a French director of research at the&amp;nbsp;[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Centre for Scientific Research]], criticized the agency for its classification of potentially carcinogenic substances. He claimed that this classification did not take into account the extent of exposure: for example, red meat is qualified as probably carcinogenic, but the quantity of consumed red meat at which it could become dangerous is not specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.slate.fr/story/126602/pourquoi-fausses-sciences-gouvernent-monde|title=Pourquoi les fausses sciences gouvernent le monde (et pourquoi il faut mettre un terme à ce règne)|work=Slate|access-date=29 April 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies have erupted multiple times when the IARC has classified many things as Class 2a (probable carcinogens), including cell phone signals, [[glyphosate]], drinking hot beverages, and working as a barber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-iarc-idUSKCN1261WS|title=Exclusive: U.S. lawmakers to investigate funding of WHO cancer agency|last=Kelland|first=Kate|date=6 October 2016|agency=Reuters|location=London, U.K.|access-date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Block of Taiwanese participation===
Political pressure from China has led to Taiwan being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in both 2017 and 2018 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the [[World Health Assembly|WHO annual assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China warns Taiwan of continued lockout from WHO assembly|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/china-warns-taiwan-of-continued-lockout-from-who-assembly/2017/05/21/0a486d66-3e58-11e7-b29f-f40ffced2ddb_story.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=26 May 2017|date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Bows to China Pressure, Contravenes Human Rights in Refusing Taiwan Media|url=https://international.thenewslens.com/article/95982|website=international.thenewslens.com|accessdate=22 May 2018|date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, 172 members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] wrote to the Director General of the World Health Organization to argue for Taiwan's inclusion as an observer at the WHA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=172 Members Push for Taiwan's Participation at World Health Assembly|url=https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/172-members-push-for-taiwans-participation-at-world-health-assembly/|website=foreignaffairs.house.gov|accessdate=22 May 2018|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel expenses===
According to [[Associated Press|The Associated Press]], the WHO routinely spends about $200&amp;nbsp;million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Tuberculosis]] and [[Malaria]] combined. In 2016, [[Margaret Chan]], Director-General of WHO from November 2006 to June 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Assembly elects Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as new WHO Director-General|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/director-general-elect/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=25 May 2017|location=Geneva|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stayed in a $1000 per night hotel room while visiting West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/1cf4791dc5c14b9299e0f532c75f63b2/AP-Exclusive:-Health-agency-spends-more-on-travel-than-AIDS| title=Health agency spends more on travel than AIDS| first=Maria| last=Cheng| date=22 May 2017| accessdate=27 June 2017| agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Mugabe's role as a goodwill ambassador ===
On 21 October 2017, the Director General [[Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus]] appointed former Zimbabwean president [[Robert Mugabe]] as a [[World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador|WHO Goodwill Ambassador]] to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment address praised Mugabe for his commitment to public health in Zimbabwe.

The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41702662|title=Robert Mugabe's WHO appointment condemned as 'an insult'|date=21 October 2017|work=''BBC News''|access-date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://theglobeandmail.com/news/world/shock-as-zimbabwes-mugabe-named-who-goodwill-ambassador/article36681266/ | title=WHO chief 'rethinking' appointment of Zimbabwe's Mugabe as 'goodwill ambassador' after widespread condemnation | work=The Globe and Mail | date=21 October 2017 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the outcry, the following day the appointment was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41713919 | title=WHO cancels Robert Mugabe goodwill ambassador role |work=''BBC News''| date=22 October 2017 |  accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World headquarters ==
The seat of the organization is in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. It was designed by Swiss architect Jean Tschumi and inaugurated in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/about/structure/modernizing-who-headquarters.pdf|title=MODERNIZING THE WHO HEADQUARTERS IN GENEVA|website=who.int|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the organization launched an international competition to redesign and extend its headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/design-contest-opens-for-world-health-organisation-headquarters/8664906.article|title=Design contest opens for World Health Organisation headquarters|work=Architects Journal|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47235">This article lists estimates of [[world population]], as well as projections of [[Projections of population growth|future developments]].
In summary, estimates for the progression of world population since the late medieval period are in the following ranges:
{|class="wikitable"

[https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/ UN World Population Prospect 2017] gives a "median" estimate of 11.2 billion for 2100, with a "95% confidence interval" between 10 and 13 billion.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Estimates for pre-modern times are necessarily fraught with great uncertainties, and few of the published estimates have [[confidence interval]]s; in the absence of a straightforward means to assess the error of such estimates, a rough idea of expert consensus can be gained by comparing the values given in independent publications. Population estimates cannot be considered accurate to more than two decimal digits;
for example, world population for the year 2012 was estimated at
7.02,  7.06 and 7.08 billion by the  [[United States Census Bureau]], the [[Population Reference Bureau]]  and the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], respectively, corresponding to 
a spread of estimates of the order of 0.8%.

==Deep prehistory==
{{further|Paleodemography}}
[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|350px|Graph of world population over the past 12,000 years ([[Holocene]]).]]
As a general rule, the confidence of estimates on historical world population decreases for the more distant past. 
Robust population data only exists for the last two or three centuries. Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in [[Census in Egypt|Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt, A. (1995). ''The Ancient Near East, c. 3000–330 BCE''. Vol. 2. London: Routledge. p. 695.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Published estimates for the 1st century ("[[AD 1]]") suggest an uncertainty of the order of 50% (estimates range between 150 and 330 million).
Some estimates extend their timeline into deep prehistory, to "[[10,000 BC]]", i.e. the  [[Holocene|early Holocene]],  when world population estimates range roughly between one and ten million (with an uncertainty of up to an order of magnitude).&lt;ref&gt;Thomlinson (1975): "one to ten million".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22560092 | doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.04.003 | pmc=3376494 | volume=90 | title=Mitochondrial DNA signals of late glacial recolonization of Europe from near eastern refugia | year=2012 | journal=Am.

Estimates for yet deeper prehistory, into the [[Paleolithic]], are of a different nature. At this time human populations consisted entirely of non-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] populations, with [[anatomically modern humans]] existing alongside [[Archaic humans|archaic human varieties]], some of which are still ancestral to the modern human population due to  [[archaic human admixture with modern humans|interbreeding with modern humans]] during the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. 
Estimates of the size of these populations are a topic of [[paleoanthropology]]. A late human [[population bottleneck]] is postulated by some scholars at approximately 70,000 years ago, during the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba catastrophe]], when ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' population may have dropped to as low as between 1,000 and 10,000 individuals.&lt;ref name=ambrose1998&gt;{{cite journal

For the time of speciation of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', some 200,000 years ago,  an [[effective population size]] of the order of 10,000  to 30,000 individuals has been estimated, with an actual "census population" of early ''Homo sapiens'' of roughly 100,000 to 300,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Per Sjödin, Agnès E Sjöstrand, Mattias Jakobsson and Michael G B Blum, "Resequencing data provide no evidence for a human bottleneck in Africa during the penultimate glacial period" Mol ''Biol Evol'' (2012) doi: 10.1093/molbev/mss061. "A small human effective population size, on the order of 10,000 individuals, which is smaller than the effective population size of most great apes, has been interpreted as a result of a very long history, starting ∼ 2 mya, of a small population size, coined as the long-necked bottle model (Harpending et al. 1998; Hawks et al. 2000). Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis, but, depending on the mutation rate, we find either an effective population size of NA = 12,000 (95% C.I. = 9,000–15,500 when averaging over all three demographic models) using the mutation rate calibrated with the human-chimp divergence or an effective population size of NA = 32,500 individuals (95% C.I. = 27,500–34,500) using the mutation rate given by whole-genome trio analysis (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2010) (supplementary figure 4 and table 6, Supplementary Material online). Not surprisingly, the estimated effective mutation rates θ = 4NAµ are comparable for the two mutation rates we considered, and are equal to 1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;/bp/generation (95% C.I. = (1.1–1.7) × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). Relating the estimated effective population size to the census population size during the Pleistocene is a difficult task because there are many factors affecting the effective population size (Charlesworth 2009). Nevertheless, based on published estimates of the ratio between effective and census population size, a comprehensive value on the order of 10% has been found by Frankham (1995). This 10% rule roughly predicts that 120,000−325,[0]00 individuals (depending on the assumed mutation rate)"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Cumulative population}}{{anchor|Number of humans who have ever lived}}
The question of "how many people have ever lived?" or "what percentage of people who have ever lived are alive today" can be traced to the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Haub (1995): "at some time back in the 1970s, some now-forgotten writer made the statement that 75 percent of the people who had ever been born were alive at that moment." 
Haub (1995) is the basis of a 2007 article in Scientific American, {{cite web|title=Fact or Fiction|website=Scientificamerican.com|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-living-outnumber-dead/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The more dramatic phrasing of "the living outnumber the dead" also dates to the 1970s, a time of [[population explosion]] and growing fears of [[human overpopulation]] in the wake of [[decolonization]] and before the adoption of China's [[one-child policy]].
The claim that "the living outnumber the dead" was never accurate (although it may be roughly accurate if only [[Effective population size|ancestral population]] is considered). [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) has the claim that "Behind every man now alive stand 30 ghosts, for that is the ratio by which the dead outnumber the living", which was roughly accurate at the time of writing.&lt;ref&gt;
Wesley Stephenson, [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16870579 Do the dead outnumber the living?], BBC News 4 February 2012.
Ciara Curtin, [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-living-outnumber-dead/ Fact or Fiction?: Living People Outnumber the Dead], Scientific American,  1 March  2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the "total number of people who have ever lived" is 107.6 billion as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Kapitza, 'The phenomenological theory of world population growth', ''Physics-Uspekhi'' 39(1) 57–71 (1996) cites estimates ranging between 80 and 150 billion (Sergei P Kapitza, 'The phenomenological theory of world population growth', ''Physics-Uspekhi'' 39(1) 57–71, 1996), citing K. M. Weiss, ''Human Biology'' 56637, 1984, and N. Keyfitz, ''Applied Mathematical Demography'', New York: Wiley, 1977). 
Haub (1995) cited 105 billion, updated to 107 billion as of 2011 in {{Cite web |last=Haub |first=Carl |date=October 2011 |title=How Many People Have Ever Lived on Earth? |publisher=[[Population Reference Bureau]] |url=http://www.prb.org/Articles/2002/HowManyPeopleHaveEverLivedonEarth.aspx |accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The answer naturally depends on the definition of "people", i.e. is only ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' to be counted, or all of genus ''[[Homo]]'', but due to the small population sizes in the Lower Paleolithic, the order of magnitude of the estimate is not affected by the choice of cut-off date substantially more than by the uncertainty of estimates throughout the Neolithic to Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Haub (1995): "Clearly, the period 8000 B.C. to 1 A.D. is key to the magnitude of our number, but, unfortunately, little is known about that era. ... of course, pushing the date of humanity's arrival on the planet before 50,000 B.C. would also raise the number, although perhaps not by terribly much."&lt;/ref&gt;
The estimate is more crucially affected by the estimate of [[infant mortality|infant mortalities]] vs. [[stillborn]] infants, due to the very high infant mortality throughout the pre-modern period. An estimate on the "total number of people who have ever lived" as of 1995 was calculated by Haub (1995) at "about 105 billion births since the dawn of the human race" with a cut-off date at 50,000 BC (beginning of the Upper Paleolithic), and an inclusion of a high infant mortality rate throughout pre-modern history.&lt;ref&gt;Haub (1995): "Life expectancy at birth probably averaged only about 10 years for most of human history.  Estimates of average life expectancy in Iron Age France have been put at only 10 or 12 years. Under these conditions, the birth rate would have to be about 80 per 1,000 people just for the species to survive. ... Our birth rate assumption will greatly affect the estimate of the number of persons ever born. Infant mortality in the human  race's earliest days is thought to have been very high—perhaps 500 infant deaths per 1,000 births, or even higher. ...
Birth rates were set at 80 per 1,000 per year through 1 A.D. and at 60 per 1,000 from 2 A.D. to 1750. Rates then declined to the low 30s by the modern period.  (For a brief bibliography of sources consulted in the course of this alchemy, see [Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones 1978])."
"So, our estimate here is that about 5.5 percent of all people ever born are alive today."
Using the UN estimates for birth rates ({{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=world+population&amp;d=PopDiv&amp;f=variableID%3A53%3BcrID%3A900 |title=UNdata: Crude birth rate  |publisher=United Nations |date=25 August 2011}}) and world population (U.S. Census Bureau, International Data Base), there were an estimated 3.0 billion births during 1995–2016, so that based on the estimate by Haub (1995), the figures for 2017 would be "about 108 billion births" and "about 7 percent of all people ever born are alive today."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical population ==

&lt;!-- 
The population of the world reached 1 billion in 1804, 2 billion in 1927, 3 billion in 1960, 4 billion in 1974, 5 billion in 1987, and 6 billion in 1999. The population of the world is projected to reach 7 billion in 2012, 8 billion in 2025, and 9 billion in 2040. An estimated 91% of the world's population is made up of Russian prostitutes, while the other 9% are not. Source: ''Russia's Greatest Accomplishments'', ''circa. 1784''

===Before 1950===
The following table uses [[astronomical year numbering]] for dates, negative numbers corresponding roughly to the corresponding year BC (i.e. -10000 = 10,001 BC, etc.). The table starts counting around the [[Late Glacial Maximum]] period, in which ice retreated and humans started to spread into the northern hemisphere.

From the beginning of the [[early modern period]] until the 20th century, world population has been characterized by a faster-than-exponential growth.
For the period of [[Classical Antiquity]] to the [[Middle Ages]], roughly 500 BC to AD 1500, there has also been a general tendency of growth (estimated at roughly a factor 4 to 5 over the  2,000 year period), but not strictly [[Monotonic function|monotonic]]: A noticeable dip in world population is assumed due to the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century.&lt;ref name=Haub1650/&gt;

===1950 to present===
For times after [[World War II]], demographic data of some accuracy becomes available for a significant number of countries, and population estimates are often given as grand totals of numbers (typically given by country) of widely diverging accuracies. Some sources give these numbers rounded to the nearest million or the nearest thousand, while others give them without any rounding.

Taking these numbers at face value would 
be [[false precision]]; in spite of being stated to four, seven or even ten digits, they should not be interpreted as accurate to more than three digits at best (estimates by the [[United States Census Bureau]] and by the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|United Nations]] differ by about 0.5&amp;ndash;1.5%).

[[File:World-Population-1800-2100.svg|thumb|300px|World population estimates from 1800 to 2100, based on "high", "medium" and "low" [http://esa.un.org/wpp/unpp/panel_population.htm United Nations projections in 2010] (colored red, orange and green) and [https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html US Census Bureau historical estimates] (in black). Actual recorded population figures (as of 2010) are colored in blue. According to the highest estimate, the world population may rise to 16 [[thousand million|billion]] by 2100; according to the lowest estimate, it may decline to 6 billion.]]

{{asof|2015}}, the population of the world is projected to reach 8 billion in 2025, and 9 billion by about 2040/42. Kapitza (1996) estimated an asymptotic limit of population growth of 14 billion,  90% of which (12.6 billion) expected to be reached by 2135.&lt;ref&gt;"The expression for growth (6) indicates a limit for world population  N=πK&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=14×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, in the foreseeable future. Of this asymptotic limit 90% will be reached for Model III by year 2135, or in 3T years after T1 = 2007."
Sergei P. Kapitza, 'The phenomenological theory of world population growth', ''[[Physics-Uspekhi]]'' 39(1) 57-71 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasonable predictions of population development are possible for the next 30 years or so, representing the period of fertility of the children alive today. Projections of population reaching more than one generation into the future are highly speculative: Thus, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs report of 2004 projected the world population to peak at 9.22 billion in 2075 and then stabilise at a value close to 9 billion;&lt;ref name=un-esa1&gt;United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.  ''[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf World Population to 2300]''.  2004. Executive Summary, Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 
By contrast, a 2014 projection by the United Nations Population Division predicts a population close to 11 billion by 2100 without any declining trend in the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name = Science&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1257469| pmid = 25301627| title = World population stabilization unlikely this century| journal = Science| volume = 346| issue = 6206| pages = 234–7| publisher  = AAAS| date = September 14, 2014| url  = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/09/17/science.1257469| issn  =  1095-9203| last1 = Gerland | first1 = P.| last2 = Raftery | first2 = A.

Population estimates for world regions based on Maddison (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Angus Maddison, The World Economy: Historical Statistics,   Statistical Appendix (2007, ggdc.net).
Estimates cited are for the beginning of the 1st millennium ("year 0"), the beginning of the 2nd millennium ("year 1000"), and for the beginning each century since the 16th (years 1820 and 1913 are given for the 19th and 20th century, respectively, as Maddison presents detailed estimates for these years), and a projection for the year 2030.&lt;/ref&gt;  in millions.
The row showing total world population includes the average growth rate per year over the period separating each column from the preceding one.

When considering population estimates by world region, it is worth noting that [[population history of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]] before the 1492 voyage of Christopher Columbus has proven difficult to establish, with many historians arguing for an estimate of 50 million people throughout the Americas, and some estimating that populations may have reached 100 million people or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPoAQRgkrOcC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=pre-Columbian+population+million&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=pre-Columbianpopulationmillion&amp;f=false|title=American Colonies|last=Taylor|first=Alan|date=2002|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780142002100|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore estimated by some that populations in Mexico, Central, and South America could have reached 37 million by 1492.&lt;ref&gt;"La catastrophe démographique" (The Demographic Catastrophe"), ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the population estimate of 2 million for North America for the same time period represents the low end of modern estimates, and some estimate the population to have been as high as 18 million.&lt;ref&gt;Dobyns, Henry (1983).
