'''Abby Kelley Foster''' (January 15, 1811 &amp;ndash; January 14, 1887) was an American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and radical social [[Reform movement#United States reform movements of the 1840s – 1930s|reformer]] active from the 1830s to 1870s. She became a fundraiser, lecturer and committee organizer for the influential [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], where she worked closely with [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and other radicals. She married fellow abolitionist and lecturer [[Stephen Symonds Foster]], and they both worked for [[Women's rights|equal rights for women]] and for slaves/ African Americans.{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|pp=1--3, 14}}

Her former home of [[Liberty Farm]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name=libfarm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/pwwmh/ma42.htm |title=Liberty Farm |author= |pages= |date= |accessdate=2010-07-23 |quote= |publisher=NPS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
On January 15, 1811, Abigail (Abby) Kelley was born the seventh daughter of Wing and Lydia Kelley,  farmers in [[Pelham, Massachusetts]].  Kelley grew up helping with the family farms in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]  where she received a loving, yet strict [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] upbringing. Kelley and her family were members of the [[Monthly meeting|Quaker Meeting]] in nearby [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="quaker2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Valley Sites - Millville, Uxbridge: Friends Meetinghouse |publisher=NPS |url=http://home.nps.gov/blac/planyourvisit/valley-sites-millville-uxbridge.htm |accessdate=2010-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027195655/http://home.nps.gov/blac/planyourvisit/valley-sites-millville-uxbridge.htm |archivedate=2011-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackstonedaily.com/quaker.htm |title=The Uxbridge Meeting House |author= |pages= |date= |accessdate=2010-07-23 |quote= |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818172214/http://www.blackstonedaily.com/quaker.htm |archivedate=18 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|pp=14--18}}  She began her education in a single-room schoolhouse in the Tatnuck section of Worcester. Foster's daughter later wrote that Abby "attended the best private school for girls in Worcester."{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|p=19}}  In 1826, as Worcester had no high school for girls and her parents could not afford a private seminary, Kelley continued her education at the New England Friends Boarding School in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].  After her first year of school, Kelley taught for two years to make enough money to further her education.  In 1829, she attended her final year of schooling, having received the highest form of education any [[New England]] woman of her relatively moderate economic standing could hope to obtain.{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|pp=19--25}}

Abby returned to her parents' home to teach in local schools and, in 1835, helped her parents move to their new home in [[Millbury, MA|Millbury]].  Then in 1836, she moved to [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], where she taught at a local school.  There she met fellow Quakers who preached the ideas of dietary restriction, temperance, pacifism, and [[abolitionism in the United States|antislavery]].  She became interested in the health theories of [[Sylvester Graham]] and gained a general interest in the abolition of slavery after hearing a lecture by [[William Lloyd Garrison]], editor of the abolitionist publication ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]''.  Kelley joined the Female Anti-Slavery Society of Lynn and was soon elected to a committee charged with collecting signatures for petitions to the Federal government to end slavery in the [[District of Columbia]].  Kelley passionately carried out her assignment, and in 1837 collected the signatures of nearly half the women of Lynn.{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|pp=26--35}}

==Radicalization==
Kelley's views became progressively more radical as she worked with abolitionists such as [[Angelina Grimké]].  She became an "ultra", advocating not only the abolition of slavery, but also full [[Equality before the law|civil equality]] for blacks.  In addition, Garrison's influence led her to adopt the position of "non-resistance", which went beyond [[anti-war|opposing war]] to opposing all forms of government coercion.  Radical abolitionists led by Garrison refused to serve on juries, join the military, or vote.  The Garrisonian call for the end of slavery and the extension of civil rights to African Americans caused controversy.  Kelley's advocacy of the radical abolitionist movement prompted some opponents to call her a "Jezebel", as what she proposed threatened their sense of social structure.  On the other hand, many fellow abolitionists praised her public speaking skills and her dedication to the cause.  Kelley's influence was shown by activist women being called "Abby Kelleyites".  Radical abolitionism became known as "Abby Kelleyism."{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|pp=1--3, 41--59, 230}}{{Sfn|Morin|1994|pp=19--20}}

==Anti-slavery activity==

Following the financial [[Panic of 1837]], Kelley took charge of fundraising for the Lynn Female Society.  She donated a generous portion of her own money to the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]].  With the encouragement of Angelina Grimke, Abby served as the Lynn Female Society's first delegate to the national convention of the Anti-Slavery Society in New York.{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|pp=37--43}}  There she spoke out about fundraising, and participated in drafting the Society's declaration for abolition.  After the convention, Kelley became even more engaged in the Anti-Slavery Society, for which she distributed petitions, raised funds, and participated in conferences to raise public awareness.

In 1838, Kelley gave her first public speech to a "promiscuous" (mixed-gender) audience at the women's anti-slavery convention in [[Philadelphia]].  At this time women generally did not address such audiences in public forums.  Despite vociferous protesters, Kelley eloquently proclaimed the doctrine of abolitionism.  In the following months, she further established herself as a public figure by speaking to more mixed-gender crowds, such as that at the New England Anti-Slavery Convention.&lt;ref name=seneca1843&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/wori/historyculture/in-defense-of-woman-and-the-slave.htm |title=In defense of Woman and the Slave... |author= |pages= |date= |accessdate=2010-07-23 |quote= |publisher=NPS }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also worked on a committee composed of both genders.

Later in 1838, she moved to [[Connecticut]] to spread the anti-slavery message.  By 1839, Kelley was fully involved in the Anti-Slavery Society, while still acknowledging Quaker tradition by refusing payment for her efforts. In 1841, however, she resigned from the Quakers over disputes about not allowing anti-slavery speakers in meeting houses (including the Uxbridge monthly meeting where she had attended with her family), and the group disowned her.{{Sfn|Morin|1994|p=19}}{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|p=123}}&lt;ref name="Buffum"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buffum|first=Lucille|title=Elizabeth Buffum Chase- Her Life and its Environment|publisher=W. B. Clarke Co.|year=1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_IoEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=abby+kelley+uxbridge+ma+society+of+friends&amp;source=web&amp;ots=J9lzVz9u6M&amp;sig=yp-5r06OUOPih9idmple9m-YqMg#PPA264,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, Kelley contributed to the Anti-Slavery Society as a lecturer and fundraiser.  Although she encountered constant objections to her public activism as a woman working closely with and presenting public lectures to men, Kelley continued her work.  She often shared her platform with ex-slaves despite disapproval by some in the audience.  "I rejoice to be identified with the despised people of color.  If they are to be despised, so ought their advocates to be".{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|p=86}} In October 1849, Kelley wrote to her friend, Milo Townsend, and told of the work she was doing for the anti-slavery society: "We know our cause is steadily onward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwhp.org/Resources/Biographies/KelleyFoster/lecturing.html |title=Abby Kelley Foster resumes lecturing |author= |pages= |date= |accessdate=2010-07-23 |quote= |publisher=Worcester Women's History Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some male members of the Society objected to the ideas propounded by Garrison, Kelley, and other radicals.  As a result, when Kelley was elected to the national business committee of the Anti-Slavery Society, conservative members left in protest.  The two groups of abolitionists officially severed.  Pacifist radical abolitionists controlled the Society, who promoted complete egalitarianism, to be obtained without the aid of any government, as all such institutions were constructed on the violence of war.  In 1854 Kelley became the Anti-Slavery Society's chief fundraiser and general financial agent, and in 1857 she took the position of general agent in charge of lecture and convention schedules.{{Sfn|Morin|1994|pp=19--20}}

==Women's rights==
Fighting for [[women's rights]] soon became a new priority for many ultra abolitionists and Kelley was among them speaking on women's rights in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]] five years before the [[Seneca Falls convention]] would be held there.&lt;ref name=seneca1843/&gt;  Kelley influenced future suffragists such as [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Lucy Stone]] by encouraging them to take on a role in political activism.  She helped organize and was a key speaker at the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850. (The Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, held in 1848, was not national).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwhp.org/Resources/Biographies/KelleyFoster/1850.html |title=Abby Kelley Foster at First National Woman's Rights Convention |author= |pages= |date= |accessdate=2010-07-23 |quote= |publisher=Worcester Women's History Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[American Civil War]], Kelley supported passage of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] to the Constitution.  Some female activists resisted any amendment that did not include women's suffrage.  Kelley split with [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] due to their strong opposition to the amendment.  After the amendment passed and Garrison dissolved the Anti-Slavery Society, Kelley continued to work for equal rights for both African Americans and women.{{Sfn|Morin|1994|pp=25--27}}

In 1872, Kelley and her husband [[Stephen Symonds Foster]] refused to pay taxes on their jointly owned property; they argued that as Kelley could not vote, she was a victim of taxation without representation.  Although their farm was consequently seized and sold and repurchased for them by friends,&lt;ref name=libfarm/&gt; Kelley continued her activism in the face of financial difficulties and poor health.  She wrote letters to fellow radicals and other political figures until her death in 1887.

==Marriage and family==
After a four-year courtship, Kelley  married fellow abolitionist Stephen Symonds Foster in 1845. In 1847, she and her husband purchased a farm in the Tatnuck region of Worcester, Massachusetts and named it "Liberty Farm". She gave birth to their only daughter in 1847.&lt;ref name=libfarm/&gt; The farm served both as a stop on the [[Underground railroad]] and as a refuge for fellow reformers.{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|p=3}}  Kelley continued her efforts as a lecturer and fundraiser throughout the North until 1850, when declining health forced her to reduce traveling.&lt;ref name=libfarm/&gt;  She carried on an active correspondence and local meetings to work for the cause.

Abby Kelley Foster died January 14, 1887, one day before her 76th birthday.{{Sfn|Morin|1994|p=27}}

==Legacy and honors==
Liberty Farm in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], the home of Abby Kelley and Stephen Symonds Foster, was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] because of its association with their lives of working for abolitionism.  It is privately owned and not open for visits.&lt;ref name=libfarm/&gt;

Abby's House, a shelter for women that opened in Worcester in 1976, is named in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Who Is Abby Kelley Foster? | publisher = Abby's House | url = http://abbyshouse.org/abbyshouse/abby_kelley_foster| accessdate = 2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, she was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatwomen.org/women-of-the-hall/search-the-hall/details/2/244-Foster National Women's Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10316">'''Agricultural philosophy''' (or '''philosophy of agriculture''') is, roughly and approximately, a discipline devoted to the systematic critique of the philosophical frameworks (or ethical world views) that are the foundation for decisions regarding agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;C. Taliaferro and S. Carpenter. (2010) "Farms" in ''Life Science Ethics.'' ed. Gary L. Comstock.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these views are also used to guide decisions dealing with land use in general. (Please see the Wikipedia article on [[environmental philosophy]].) In everyday usage, it can also be defined as the love of, search after, and wisdom associated with agriculture, as one of humanity's founding components of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lindsay Falvey]] (2005) Religion and Agriculture: Sustainability in Christianity and Buddhism. c.350pp. [[Institute for International Development]], Adelaide and Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view is more aptly known as [[agrarianism]]. In actuality, agrarianism is only one philosophy or normative framework out of many that people use to guide their decisions regarding agriculture on an everyday basis. The most prevalent of these philosophies will be briefly defined below.

==Utilitarian approach==
This view was first put forth by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Though there are many varieties of [[utilitarianism]], generally the view is that a morally right action is an action that produces the maximum good for people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/ History of Utilitarianism]&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is a form of [[consequentialism]]; which basically means that the correct action is understood entirely in terms of the consequences of that action. Utilitarianism is often used when deciding farming issues. For example, farmland is commonly valued based upon its capacity to the grow crops that people want. This approach to valuing land is called Asset Theory (in contrast to Location Theory) and it is based upon utilitarian principles. Another example is when a community decides on what to do with a particular parcel of land. Let's say that this community must decide to use it for industry, residential uses, or for farming. By using a utilitarian approach, the council would judge which use would benefit the greatest number of people in the community and then make their choice based upon that information. Finally, it also forms the foundation for industrial farming; as an increase in yield, which would increase the number of people able to receive goods from farmed land, is judged from this view to be a good action or approach. Indeed, a common argument in favor of [[industrial agriculture]] is this it is a good practice because it increases the benefits for humans; benefits such as food abundance and a drop in food prices.&lt;ref&gt;Conkin, Paul. (2009) ''Revolution Down on the Farm: The Transformation of American Agriculture since 1929.'' Raleigh: The University of Kentucky Press; Kingsolver, Barbara. (2007)''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life.'' New York: HarperCollins Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, several scholars and writers, such as [[Peter Singer]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], and [[Wendell Berry]] have argued against this view. For example, Singer argues that the suffering of animals (farm animals included) should be included in the cost/benefit calculus when deciding whether or not to do an action such as industrial farming.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. (2002) ''Animal Liberation.'' New York: Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been challenged on the grounds that farmland and farm animals are instrumentalized in this view and not valued in and of themselves.&lt;ref name="publishing1"&gt;Thompson, Paul. (2010) "Land." "Life Science Ethics." ed. Gary L. Comstock. Raleigh: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, systems thinkers, deep ecologists, and agrarian philosophers (such as [[Aldo Leopold]] &amp; [[Wendell Berry]]) critique this view on the grounds that it ignores aspects of farming which are morally applicable and/or intrinsically valuable.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. (1948) ''A Sand County Almanac.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press; Berry, Wendell. (2002) ''The Art of the Commonplace: The Agrarian Essays of Wendell Berry.'' Berkeley: Counterpoint Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Slow Food Movement]] and the Buy Local Agricultural Movements are also built upon philosophical views morally opposed to extreme versions of this approach. Other critiques will be explored below when different philosophical approaches to agriculture are briefly explained. However, it is important to note that the Utilitarian approach to agriculture is currently the most widespread approach within the modern Western World.

==Libertarian approach==

Another philosophical approach often used when deciding land or farming issues is [[Libertarianism]]. Libertarianism is, roughly, the moral view that agents own themselves and have certain moral rights including the right to acquire property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/libertarianism/ Vallentyne, Peter, "Libertarianism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; In a looser sense, Libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each person has a right to a maximum amount of liberty when this liberty does not interfere with other people's freedom. A well known Libertarian theorist is [[John Hospers]]. Within this view, property rights are natural rights. Thus, it would be acceptable for a farmer to inefficiently farm their land as long as they don't harm others while doing it. In 1968, Garrett Harden applied this philosophy to land/farming issues when he argued that the only solution to the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]" was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, Garrett. (1968) "The Tragedy of the Commons." Science, 162, 1243-1248&lt;/ref&gt; He then supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument and, indeed, you could argue that Libertarianism is rooted in utilitarian ideals. However, this leaves Libertarian based land ethics open to the above critiques lodged against Utilitarian approaches to agriculture. Even excepting these critiques, the Libertarian view has been specifically challenged by the critique that people making self-interested decisions can cause large ecological and social disasters such as the [[Dust Bowl]] disaster.&lt;ref name="publishing1"/&gt; Even so, it is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and, especially, by U.S. ranchers and farmers.

==Egalitarian approach==

Egalitarian based views are often developed as a response to Libertarianism. This is because, while Libertarianism provides for the maximum amount of human freedom, it does not require a person to help others. In addition, it also leads to the grossly uneven distribution of wealth. A well known Egalitarian philosopher is [[John Rawls]]. When focusing on agriculture, what this translates into is the uneven distribution of land and food.&lt;ref name="publishing1"/&gt; While both Utilitarian and Libertarian approaches to agriculture ethics could conceivably rationalize this mal-distribution, an Egalitarian approach typically favors equality whether that be equal entitlement and/or opportunity to employment or access to food.&lt;ref&gt;Arneson, Richard, "Egalitarianism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2009/entries/egalitarianism/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, if you recognize that people have a right to something, then someone has to supply this opportunity or item; whether that be an individual person or the government. Thus, the Egalitarian view links land and water with the right to food. With the growth of human populations and the decline of soil and water resources, Egalitarianism could provide a strong argument for the preservation of soil fertility and water.&lt;ref name="publishing1"/&gt;

==Ecological or systems approach==

In addition to Utilitarian, Libertarian, and Egalitarian philosophies, there are also normative views that are based upon the principle that land has intrinsic value and positions coming out of an ecological or systems view. Two main examples of this are [[James Lovelock]]'s [[Gaia hypothesis]] which postulates that the Earth is an organism&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James (2009). The Vanishing Face of Gaia: A Final Warning: Enjoy It While You Can. Allen Lane. {{ISBN|978-1-84614-185-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[deep ecology|deep ecologists]] who argue that human communities are built upon a foundation of the surrounding ecosystems or the biotic communities.&lt;ref&gt;Naess, Arne (1973) 'The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement.' Inquiry 16: 95-100&lt;/ref&gt; While the above philosophies can be useful for guiding decision making on issues concerning land in general, they have limited usefulness when applied to agriculture because these philosophies privilege natural ecosystems and agricultural ecosystems are often considered not natural. One philosophy grounded in the principle that land has intrinsic value which is directly applicable to agriculture is [[Aldo Leopold]]'s stewardship ethic or [[land ethic]].&lt;ref name="university1948"&gt;Leopold, A. (1948) A Sand County Almanac. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; For Leopold, an action is correct if it tends to "preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community".&lt;ref name="university1948"/&gt; Similar to Egalitarian-based land ethics, many of the above philosophies were also developed as alternatives to utilitarian and libertarian based approaches. Leopold's ethic is currently one of the most popular ecological approaches to agriculture commonly known as [[agrarianism]]. Other agrarianists include [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur]] (1735–1813), [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882), [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862), [[John Steinbeck]] (1902–1968), [[Wendell Berry]] (b. 1934), [[Gene Logsdon]] (b. 1932), [[Paul B. Thompson (philosopher)|Paul B. Thompson]], and [[Barbara Kingsolver]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12163">[[File:Enfantin.png|thumb|right|Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin (1796–1864)]]
'''Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin''' (8 February 1796{{snd}}1 September 1864) was a [[France|French]] [[Reform movement|social reformer]], one of the founders of [[Saint-Simonianism]]. He was also a proponent of a [[Suez canal]].

== Early life ==
Enfantin was born in [[Paris]], the son of a banker of [[Dauphiné]]. After receiving his early education at a [[lyceum]], he was sent in 1813 to the [[École polytechnique]]. In March 1814 he was one of the band of students who, on the heights of [[Montmartre]] and [[Saint-Chaumont]], attempted resistance to the armies of the [[Sixth Coalition]] which had engaged in the invasion of Paris. In consequence of this outbreak of [[Patriotism|patriotic]] enthusiasm, the school was soon after closed by [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], and the young student was compelled to seek another career.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

Initially, he began working for a country wine merchant, travelling to [[German Confederation|Germany]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. In 1821 he entered a banking-house newly established at [[Saint Petersburg]], but returned two years later to Paris, where he was appointed [[cashier]] to the ''[[Caisse Hypothécaire]]''. At the same time, he became a member of the [[secret society]] of the ''[[Carbonari]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

In 1825 a new turn was given to his thoughts and his life by the friendship which he formed with [[Olinde Rodriguez]], who introduced him to the [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Comte de Saint-Simon]]. He affiliated to Saint-Simon's version of [[utopian socialism]], and, by 1829, he had become one of the acknowledged heads of the [[Sectarianism|sect]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

== Preaching and politics ==
After the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 Enfantin resigned his office of cashier, and devoted all his energy to the cause. Besides contributing to ''[[Le Globe]]'', he made appeals to the people by systematic [[Sermon|preaching]], and organized centres of action in some of the main cities of France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

The headquarters in Paris were moved from the modest rooms in the Rue Taranne to the large halls near the [[Boulevard des Italiens]]. Enfantin and [[Amand Bazard]] were proclaimed ''Pères Suprêmes'' ("Supreme Fathers") – a union which was, however, only nominal, as a divergence was already manifest. Bazard, who concentrated on organizing the group, had devoted himself to political reform, while Enfantin, who favoured teaching and preaching, dedicated his time to social and moral change. The antagonism was widened by Enfantin's announcement of his theory of the relation of man and woman, which would substitute a system of "[[free love]]" for the "tyranny of [[marriage]]".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

Bazard and his disciples broke with Enfantin's group. The latter became sole "father", leading a chiefly religiously-oriented movement, joined by new converts (according to Enfantin's estimate, the total number of followers would have reached 40,000). He wore on his breast a badge with his title of ''Père'', was referred to by his preachers as "the living law", declared himself to be the [[Messiah|chosen of God]], and sent out emissaries in a quest of a woman predestined to be the "female Messiah," and the mother of a new [[Salvation|Saviour]] (the latter quest was very costly and altogether fruitless).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

== Success and repression ==
Meanwhile, the new religion gathered believers in all parts of [[Europe]]. His extravagances and success at length brought him to the attention of authorities, who argued that he was endangering [[public morality]] - Enfantin had announced that the gulf between the sexes was too wide and this social inequality would impede rapid growth of society. Enfantin called for the abolition of prostitution and for the ability for women to divorce and obtain legal rights. This was considered radical for the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=29|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1832 the halls of the new sect were closed by the government, and the ''Père'', with some of his followers, appeared before the tribunals. He then retired to his estate at [[Menilmontant]], near Paris, where with forty disciples, all of them men, he continued to carry out his socialist views. In August of the same year he was again arrested, and on his appearance in court he desired his defence to be undertaken by two women who were with him, alleging that the matter was of special concern to women; the request was promptly refused. The trial occupied two days and resulted in a verdict of guilty, and a sentence of imprisonment for a year with a small fine.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

This prosecution discredited the new society. Enfantin was released in a few months.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}} 

==Turkey and Egypt==
Then, accompanied by twenty of his followers, many of whom were also engineers from the [[Ecole Polytechnique]], including [[:fr:Charles Joseph Lambert|Charles Joseph Lambert]], also known as Lambert-Bey, and some women, he went first to [[Constantinople]]. Enfantin had declared 1933 the Year of the Mother, and upon arrival in Constantinople the group began to strongly preach their views about gender relations and New Christianity. The [[Ottoman Empire]] told them to leave to avoid prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=31|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enfantin and his group then arrived in [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali and his successors|Egypt]], where he planned to penetrate the feminine [[Orient]] with the masculine [[Occident]] in a consumation of progression - build a canal connecting the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the [[Red Sea]]. In Egypt at that time, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], the Egyptian Viceroy, was at odds with the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, and also practiced public-private contracts known as concessions with mostly European companies to build cheap infrastructure. Ali did not agree to a project linking the two seas because he did not want to cut out the duties he collected from overland trade in Egypt, but did allow Enfantin's group to work on the [[Delta Barrage]] - a type of [[Barrage (dam)|dam]] - north of [[Cairo]] - with unpaid laborers - that would act to limit Nile flooding and create predictable crop yields. During his time in Egypt, Enfantine also established technical schools based on the Ecole Polytechnique model with Ali's blessing. Also in Egypt he encountered and influenced [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]. Enfantine returned to France in 1836, lacking the patience to finish the Nile barrage project that was encountering delays.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|pp=31-37|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to France ==
[[File:Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin.jpg|thumb|left]]
On his return to France, he occupied minor offices. He became first a [[postmaster]] near [[Lyon]], and in 1841 was appointed, through the influence of some of his friends who had risen to posts of power, member of a scientific commission on [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], which led him to engage in researches concerning [[North Africa]] and [[French colonial empires|colonization]] in general.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=402-403}}

In 1845 he was appointed a director of the Paris &amp; Lyons [[Rail transport|railway]]. Three years later he established, in conjunction with Duveyrier, a daily journal, entitled ''Le Credit'', which was discontinued in 1850. He was afterwards attached to the administration of the railway from Lyons to the Mediterranean. 

==Société d'Études du Canal de Suez==
Father Enfantin held fast by his ideal to the end, but he had renounced the hope of giving it a local habitation and a name in the degenerate obstinate world. His personal influence over those who associated with him was immense. "He was a man of a noble presence, with finely formed and expressive features. He was gentle and insinuating in manner, and possessed a calm, graceful and winning delivery" (''Gent. M .'' Jan. 1865). His evident sincerity, his genuine enthusiasm, gave him his marvellous ascendancy. The [[Société d'Études du Canal de Suez]] was established by Enfantin in 1846 to continue study of the Suez Canal. Its members included [[François Barthélemy Arlès-Dufour|Arlès-Dufour]], Jules, Lon and [[Paulin Talabot]], the British [[Robert Stephenson]] and Edward Starbuck, the Austrian [[Alois Negrelli]], inspector of the [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway]], and Feronce and Sellier of Leipzig as representatives of the German interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/suezcanal032262mbp Wilson, Arnold T. (1939). ''The Suez Canal''. 2nd ed., London: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Société sent surveying teams to Egypt, developed engineering plans, determined that the elevation difference between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea was negligible, but Muhammad Ali was still reticent to the idea of a canal. Upon his death in 1848, the activities of the Société were minimized until his successor was assassinated in 1854 and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] took up the initiative to build a canal. Lessups had corresponded at least once with the Société in the intervening years and had known the new Egyptian viceroy, [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id]], when he was a young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pp=58-61,65,70-71,76|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enfantin was listed by Lessups as a founder of the [[Suez Canal Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|date=2003|pp=81-82|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not a few of his disciples ranked afterwards amongst the most distinguished men of France. Enfantin died suddenly at Paris on September 1, 1864.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=403}}

== Literary works ==
Amongst his works are: ''Doctrine de Saint-Simon'' (written in conjunction with several of his followers), published in 1830, and several times republished; ''Economie politique et politique Saint-Simonienne'' (1831); ''{{lang|fr|Correspondance politique}}'' (1835–1840); ''Corresp. philos. et religieuse'' (1843–1845); and ''La Vie eternelle passee, presente, future'' (1861). A large number of articles by his hand appeared in ''Le Producteur'', ''L'Organisateur'', ''[[Le Globe]]'', and other periodicals. He also wrote in 1832 ''Le Livre nouveau'', intended as a substitute for the Christian Scriptures, but it was not published.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=403}}

Along these lines, one can see the biosphere — the [[earth]] as it is affected by the [[human]] — as the adaptation of the natural to the human and biocultures as the inter-adaptation of the human to the new technologies and ways of knowing characterized by the 21st century’s attitude toward the [[Human body|body]]. It assumes that in bioculture there's a diverse way to know the workings of the body and mind, and that these are primarily culturally derived, and an expert's way of knowing produces specific strong results. However the results do not have an exclusive purview over the body and [[mind]]. Plus it seeks to develop and encourage not only the experts but also parts of people's bodies and minds as the subject of study.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd B, "Getting it all wrong - Bioculture critiques cultural critique" American Scholar  75 (4): 18-30 Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melby MK, Smith EO "PMS: A bioculture-bound syndrome."

An alternative definition of the term bioculture is all the practical aspects of the use of [[living things in culture]], including agriculture, production of food and clothing, forestry, animal breeding and training, the pet trade, use of living things in science, zoos and aquariums, animal sports, and the raising of game for sport hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Paul W. |title=Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics |edition=25th Anniversary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TdcnC98eRwC&amp;pg=PA53 |year=2011 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=1-4008-3853-3 |pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2970">'''Civic application''' is [[application software]] aiming at users' activation to participate in [[public good]] development through this application. In [[Civil society|civil societies]], civic applications are created to enhance [[public good]], [[civic engagement]], and generally [[social capital]].

Civic applications can for example aim at:
* development of engaged citizenship,
* strengthening of local communities,
* growth of democracy,
* supporting entrepreneurship,
* protection of nature and a common living space, etc.

Civic applications are to some extent often [[Social network service|social networking services]], but what distinguishes them is the civic goal, the mission funding its existence.

Interaction between the user and the application is what differentiates civic applications from any IT service (website, portal) speaking about any citizen's topics, where interaction is not necessary and if exists often takes form of commenting under articles.

Civic application can be accessed from a server via an Internet browser (online) or using mobile devices, such as mobile phones or tablets (mobile), less often from user's local drive (offline).

Non-Governmental Organisations and public national institutions are noticing the value of the civic apps and invite people working in Information Technology domain to participate in their development (e.g. in Greater Portland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=civicapps.org for Greater Portland|url=http://civicapps.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open City - Civic apps built with open data|url=http://opencityapps.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harris: A selection of civic apps that aid Chicagoans|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-07/business/ct-biz-0707-confidential-civic-apps-sidebar-20130707_1_food-poisoning-health-department-local-government}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boston, Boulder, Washington D.C, Seattle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Cities Get Free Civic Apps Through Code for America|url=http://mashable.com/2010/05/04/code-for-america/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other American cities as part of the Code For America initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code for America Apps and APIs|url=http://codeforamerica.org/apps/}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Civic applications are part of a greater concept of '''[[Civic technology|civic technologies]]''', which encompass variety of civic applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hundreds of developers use open data to create civic apps|url=http://www.socrata.com/civic-apps/}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with any software tools and platforms, enabling its development or hosting, and the software supporting local and national governments in performing their public functions.

==Brief history==
In 1991, an international group of 20 leaders from [[Non governmental organisations|Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs)]] and social movements met to explore how to support citizen participation in governmental decision-making processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Getting a world alliance started – my four years at CIVICUS|url=http://www.alliancemagazine.org/feature/getting-a-world-alliance-started-my-four-years-at-civicus/|accessdate=7 December 2014|publisher=Alliance Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process culminated in 1993 when a founding board established CIVICUS from the Latin term meaning "of the community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reaching across sectors and building bridges|url=http://www.pdac.ca/docs/default-source/publications---communique/reaching-across-sectors-and-building-bridges-(december-2012).pdf?sfvrsn=0|website=www.pdac.ca/|publisher=Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and Values==

The '''Cyprus Civil Society Awards''' were established in 2008 as part of a [[United Nations]]-funded project aiming to strengthen the role of civil society in Cyprus. One organization from the [[Greek Cypriot]] and one organization from the [[Turkish Cypriot]] community was each presented an award for their contribution to social development in six unique categories:

# education and culture
# environment
# gender issues
# health
# youth
# social inclusion

The awards have been established in order to promote reconciliation and facilitate interactions between the non-governmental organization between the two conflicting communities on the island. The awards are managed and presented by a consortium consisting of [http://www.mc-med.eu/ The Management Centre] from the Turkish Cypriot community, the [http://www.ngo-sc.org/ NGO Support Centre]&lt; from the Greek Cypriot community and INTRAC from the UK.

{{short description|a person's choice to deny reality, as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable truth}}
In the psychology of [[human behavior]], '''denialism''' is a person's choice to [[denial|deny]] [[reality]], as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable [[truth]].{{sfn|Maslin|2009}} Denialism is an essentially [[irrational]] action that withholds the validation of a historical experience or event, when a person refuses to accept an [[empirical]]ly verifiable reality.{{sfn|O'Shea|2008|p=20}} In the sciences, denialism is the rejection of basic facts and concepts that are undisputed, well-supported parts of the [[scientific consensus]] on a subject, in favor of radical and controversial ideas.{{sfn|Scudellari|2010}} The terms ''[[Holocaust denialism]]'' and ''[[AIDS denialism]]'' describe the denial of the facts and the reality of the subject matters,&lt;ref&gt;Usages of Holocaust and AIDS denialism:
{{harvnb|Kim|2007}}; {{harvnb|Cohen|2007}}; {{harvnb|Smith|Novella|2007|p=e256}}; {{harvnb|Watson|2006|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Nature Medicine's editor|2006|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''[[climate change denial]]'' describes denial of the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that the [[climate change]] of planet Earth is a real and occurring event primarily caused by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;Usages of global-warming denialism: {{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|page=425}} {{harvnb|Colquhoun|2009|p=b3658}}; {{harvnb|Connelly|2007}}; {{harvnb|Goodman|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms of denialism present the common feature of the person rejecting overwhelming evidence and the generation of political controversy with attempts to deny the existence of consensus.{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}}
The motivations and causes of denialism include religion and self-interest (economic, political, financial) and [[defence mechanisms]] meant to protect the psyche of the denialist against mentally disturbing facts and ideas.{{sfn|Hambling|2009}}{{sfn|Monbiot|2006}}

==Orthodoxy and heterodoxy==
Anthropologist [[Didier Fassin]] distinguishes between ''[[denial]]'', defined as "the empirical observation that reality and truth are being denied", and ''denialism'', which he defines as "an ideological position whereby one systematically reacts by refusing reality and truth".&lt;ref name="Fassin-115"&gt;Didier Fassin, ''When bodies remember: experiences and politics of AIDS in South Africa'', Volume 15 of California Series in Public Anthropology, [[University of California Press]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25027-7}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jn9yoyuEV1YC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;f=false p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons and social groups who reject propositions on which there exists a mainstream and [[scientific consensus]] engage in ''denialism'' when they use [[rhetoric]]al tactics to give the appearance of argument and legitimate debate, when there is none.{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}} Rick Stoff quoted [[Chris Hoofnagle]]—a senior staff attorney at the [[Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic]] and a senior fellow at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the [[UC Berkeley School of Law]]—as follows:
{{quote|Then there are those who engage in denialist tactics because they are protecting some "overvalued idea" which is critical to their identity. Since legitimate dialogue is not a valid option for those who are interested in protecting bigoted or unreasonable ideas from scientific facts, their only recourse is to use these types of rhetorical tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoff |first=Rick |date=June 2007 |title='Denialism' and muddying the waters |journal=St. Louis Journalism Review |volume=37 |issue=296 |pages=21–33, 2p.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2003 newspaper article, [[Edwin Cameron]]—a senior South African judge who has [[AIDS]]—described the tactics used by those who deny the Holocaust and by those who deny that the [[AIDS pandemic]] is due to infection with HIV. He states that "For denialists, the facts are unacceptable. They engage in radical controversion, for ideological purposes, of facts that, by and large, are accepted by almost all experts and lay persons as having been established on the basis of overwhelming evidence".&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/apic-90503.html The dead hand of denialism] [[Edwin Cameron]]. [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] (Johannesburg), April 17, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this they employ "distortions, half-truths, misrepresentation of their opponents' positions and expedient shifts of premises and logic."&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"/&gt;  Edwin Cameron notes that a common tactic used by denialists is to "make great play of the inescapable indeterminacy of figures and statistics",&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"/&gt; as scientific studies of many areas rely on probability analysis of sets of data, and in historical studies the precise numbers of victims and other facts may not be available in the primary sources.

A 2009 article published in the journal ''[[Globalization and Health]]'' also notes "recourse to data debates and [[pseudo-scientific]] 'evidence{{'"}} as a common feature of several types of denialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chazan M, Brklacich M, Whiteside A |title=Rethinking the conceptual terrain of AIDS scholarship: lessons from comparing 27 years of AIDS and climate change research |journal=[[Global Health]] |volume=5 |issue= |page=12 |year=2009 |pmid=19807923 |pmc=2764568 |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-5-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an area which British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] mentioned as part of his analysis of the [[David Irving]]'s work which he presented for the defence when Irving sued  [[Deborah Lipstadt]] for libel:
{{quote|Reputable and professional historians do not suppress parts of quotations from documents that go against their own case, but take them into account, and, if necessary, amend their own case, accordingly. They do not present, as genuine, documents which they know to be forged just because these forgeries happen to back up what they are saying. They do not invent ingenious, but implausible, and utterly unsupported reasons for distrusting genuine documents, because these documents run counter to their arguments; again, they amend their arguments, if this is the case, or, indeed, abandon them altogether. They do not consciously attribute their own conclusions to books and other sources, which, in fact, on closer inspection, actually say the opposite. They do not eagerly seek out the highest possible figures in a series of statistics, independently of their reliability, or otherwise, simply because they want, for whatever reason, to maximize the figure in question, but rather, they assess all the available figures, as impartially as possible, in order to arrive at a number that will withstand the critical scrutiny of others. They do not knowingly mistranslate sources in foreign languages in order to make them more serviceable to themselves. They do not willfully invent words, phrases, quotations, incidents and events, for which there is no historical evidence, in order to make their arguments more plausible.&lt;ref name="Evans-Pgrph-6-20"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]. David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition, [http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/evans/6 6. General Conclusion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012140414/http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/evans/6 |date=October 12, 2007 }} Paragraphs 6.20,6.21&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Mark Hoofnagle]] (brother of [[Chris Hoofnagle]]) has described denialism as "the employment of rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none".{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}}{{efn|"AIDS denialism is one of several incarnations of denialism. All denialism is defined by rhetorical tactics designed to give the impression of a legitimate debate among experts when in fact there is none. [[Holocaust deniers]] claim that historians disagree about the evidence for Nazi mass gassings and systematic murder of Jews. Global warming denialists say that climatologists are torn by the evidence about climate change. [[9/11 Truth movement|9/11 'Truth Seekers']], as clever a piece of branding as '[[pro-life]]', say the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] resulted from controlled demolition. Vaccine hysterics tell us that the science is split on whether vaccinations cause autism. And AIDS denialists say that scientists are in disagreement about whether HIV causes AIDS" {{harv|Kalichman|2009}}.}} It is a process that operates by employing one or more of the following five tactics in order to maintain the appearance of legitimate controversy:{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/mar/10/climate-change-denier |title= Climate change deniers: failsafe tips on how to spot them |publisher= ''[[The Guardian]]'' |author= Mark Hoofnagle |date= 11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Conspiracy theories]] – Dismissing the data or observation by suggesting opponents are involved in "a conspiracy to suppress the truth".
# [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|Cherry picking]] – Selecting an anomalous critical paper supporting their idea, or using outdated, flawed, and discredited papers in order to make their opponents look as though they base their ideas on weak research.
# [[False attribution|False experts]] – Paying an expert in the field, or another field, to lend supporting evidence or credibility.
# [[Moving the goalpost]] – Dismissing evidence presented in response to a specific claim by continually demanding some other (often unfulfillable) piece of evidence.
# Other [[logical fallacies]] – Usually one or more of [[false analogy]], [[appeal to consequences]], [[straw man]], or [[red herring]].

Tara Smith of the [[University of Iowa]] also stated that moving goalposts, conspiracy theories, and cherry-picking evidence are general characteristics of denialist arguments, but went on to note that these groups spend the "majority of their efforts critiquing the mainstream theory" in an apparent belief that if they manage to discredit the mainstream view, their own "unproven ideas will fill the void".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=310459&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The fanaticism of denial that must be exposed |publisher=''Times Higher Education'' |author=Tara Smith |date=14 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 author [[Michael Specter]] defined group denialism as "when an entire segment of society, often struggling with the trauma of change, turns away from reality in favor of a more comfortable lie".&lt;ref name="Specter 2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prescriptive and polemic==
If one party to a debate accuses the other of ''denialism'' they are framing the debate. This is because an accusation of denialism is both prescriptive and [[polemic]]. Prescriptive because it carries implications that there is truth to the denied claim; [[polemic]] since the accuser implies that continued denial in the light of presented evidence raises questions about the other's motives.&lt;ref name="Fassin-115"/&gt;

Some people have suggested that because denial of the Holocaust is well known, advocates who use the term "denialist" in other areas of debate may intentionally or unintentionally imply that their opponents are little better than holocaust deniers. For example, in an essay discussing the general importance of skepticism, [[Clive James]] objected to the use of the word denialist to describe climate change skeptics, stating that it "calls up the spectacle of a fanatic denying the Holocaust";{{sfn|James|2009}} and [[Celia Farber]] has objected to the term ''AIDS denialists'', arguing that it is unjustifiable to place this belief on the same moral level with the Nazi crimes against humanity.{{sfn|Farber|2006}} However, [[Robert Gallo]] ''et al.'' defended this latter comparison, stating that AIDS denialism is similar to Holocaust denial since it is a form of [[pseudoscience]] that "contradicts an immense body of research".{{sfn|Gallo|Geffen|Gonsalves|Jefferys|2006}}

Edward Skidelsky, a lecturer in philosophy at [[Exeter University]], has suggested that this is a new use for the word denial and it may have its origins in an old sense of "deny", akin to "disown" (as in the [[Apostle Peter]] [[Denial of Peter|denying Jesus]]), but that its more immediate antecedence is from the Freudian sense of deny as a refusal to accept a painful or humiliating truth. He writes that "An accusation of 'denial' is serious, suggesting either deliberate dishonesty or self-deception. The thing being denied is, by implication, so obviously true that the denier must be driven by perversity, malice or wilful blindness." He suggests that, by the introduction of the word ''denier'' into further areas of historical and scientific debate, "One of the great achievements of [[The Enlightenment]]—the liberation of historical and [[scientific enquiry]] from [[dogma]]—is quietly being reversed", and that this should worry liberal-minded people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Edward |last=Skidelsky |date=27 January 2010 |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/01/words-that-think-for-us-3/ |title=Words that think for us: The tyranny of denial |work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]| accessdate=10 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of use: scientific denialism==

===Flat Earth===
{{main|Flat Earth|Modern flat Earth societies}}

The [[superseded scientific theories|superseded belief]] that the [[Earth]] is [[flat Earth|flat]], and [[denial]] of all of the overwhelming evidence that supports an approximately [[spheroid]] [[globe]] that rotates around its axis and revolves around the [[Sun]], persists into the [[21st century]]. Modern proponents of flat-Earth [[cosmology]] (or [[flat-earther]]s) refuse to accept any kind of contrary evidence, dismissing all [[spaceflight]]s and images from space as [[hoax]]es and accusing all organizations and even private citizens of [[conspiracy theory|conspiring]] to "hide the truth". They also claim that no actual [[satellite]]s are [[orbit]]ing the Earth, that the [[International Space Station]] is fake, and that these are lies from all governments involved in this grand [[cover-up]].

[[belief perseverance|Adherents]] of the modern flat-Earth model propose that a dome-shaped [[firmament]] encloses a disk-shaped Earth. They commonly claim that the Sun is only [[Samuel Rowbotham|3,000 miles]] above the Earth and that the [[Moon]] and the Sun orbit above, but not around, a flat Earth. Modern flat-earthers believe that [[Antarctica]] is not a continent but a massive [[ice flow]], with a wall 150 feet or higher, which circles the perimeter of the Earth and keeps everything (including all the oceans' water) from falling off the edge.

Flat-earthers also assert that no one is allowed to fly over or explore [[Antarctica]], despite contrary evidence. According to them, all photos and videos of ships sinking under the horizon and of the bottoms of city [[skyline]]s and clouds below the horizon, revealing the [[curvature of the Earth]], have been [[photo manipulation|manipulated]], [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or somehow faked. Therefore, regardless of any scientific or [[empirical evidence]] provided, flat-earthers will [[delusion|stubbornly conclude]] it is fabricated or altered in some way.&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listverse.com/2016/02/01/10-absurd-claims-of-modern-flat-earth-conspiracy-theorists/ |title=10 Absurd Claims of Modern Flat Earth Conspiracy Theorists |last=Nixon |first=Eli |publisher=Listverse |date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When linked to other observed phenomena such as gravity, sunsets, tides, eclipses, distances and other measurements that challenge the flat earth model, claimants replace commonly-accepted explanations with piecemeal models that distort how perspective, mass, boyancy, light or other physical systems work.  These piecemeal replacements rarely conform with each other, finally leaving many flat-Earth claimants to agree that such phenomena remain "mysteries" and more investigation is to be done.  In this conclusion, adherents remain open to all explanations except the commonly accepted globular Earth model, shifting the debate from ignorance to denialism.

===AIDS===
{{main|HIV/AIDS denialism}}
[[AIDS denialism]] is the denial that the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chigwedere P, Essex M |title=AIDS denialism and public health practice |journal=AIDS Behav |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=237–47 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20058063 |doi=10.1007/s10461-009-9654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIDS denialism has been described as being "among the most vocal anti-science denial movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalichman SC, Eaton L, Cherry C |title="There is no Proof that HIV Causes AIDS": AIDS Denialism Beliefs among People Living with HIV/AIDS |journal=J Behav Med |volume= 33|issue= 6|pages= 432–40|date=June 2010 |pmid=20571892 |doi=10.1007/s10865-010-9275-7 |pmc=3015095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some denialists reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that the virus exists but say that it is a harmless [[passenger virus]] and not the cause of AIDS. Insofar as denialists acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of [[recreational drug use]], malnutrition, poor sanitation, and side effects of [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral medication]], rather than infection with HIV.

===Climate change===
{{main|Climate change denial}}
{{see also|Politicization of science}}
Some international corporations, such as [[ExxonMobil]], have contributed to "fake citizens' groups and bogus scientific bodies" that claim that the [[scientific opinion on climate change|science]] of [[global warming]] is inconclusive, according to a criticism by [[George Monbiot]].{{sfn|Monbiot|2006}} ExxonMobil did not deny making the financial contributions, but its spokesman stated that the company's financial support for scientific reports did not mean it [[funding bias|influenced the outcome]] of those studies. "The recycling of this type of discredited [[conspiracy theory]] diverts attention from the real challenge at hand: how to provide the energy needed to improve global living standards while also [[mitigation of global warming|reducing]] [[greenhouse gas]] emissions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]: ''[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/08/07/gore-exxon.html Gore takes aim at corporately funded climate research].''

===Evolution===
{{main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
Religious beliefs may prompt an individual to deny the validity of the scientific theory of evolution. [[Evolution]] is still considered an undisputed fact within the [[scientific community]] and in [[academia]], where the [[level of support for evolution]] is essentially universal, yet this view is often met with opposition by biblical literalists.{{sfn|Myers|2006}}{{sfn|NSTA|2007}}{{sfn|IAP|2006}}{{sfn|AAAS|2006}}{{sfn|Pinholster|2006}} The alternative view is often presented as a literal interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]]'s [[creation myth]]. Many [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Christians teach [[creationism]] as if it were fact under the banners of [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]]. Beliefs that typically coincide with creationism include the belief in the global [[flood myth]], [[geocentrism]], and the belief that the [[Young Earth creationism|Earth is only 6,000-10,000]]  [[Age of the Earth|years old]].&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Edwards v.

The BMA shares the view that there is no robust evidence to prove that GM foods are unsafe but we endorse the call for further research and surveillance to provide convincing evidence of safety and benefit."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/|title=Public and Scientists' Views on Science and Society|first1=Cary|last1=Funk|first2=Lee|last2=Rainie|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=January 29, 2015|accessdate=February 24, 2016|quote="The largest differences between the public and the AAAS scientists are found in beliefs about the safety of eating genetically modified (GM) foods.

However, [[Genetically modified food controversies|opponents have objected to GM foods]] on grounds including safety.

===Animal pain and suffering===
{{quote box

|quote = The absence of a [[neocortex]] does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing affective states. Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit [[Intention|intentional behaviors]]. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the [[neurological substrate]]s that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf|title=The Cambridge declaration on consciousness|date=July 7, 2012|author=Low, P.|editor1=Jaak Panksepp |editor2=Diana Reiss |editor3=David Edelman |editor4=Bruno Van Swinderen |editor5=Philip Low |editor6=Christof Koch |publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite wide scientific consensus that [[pain in animals|some animals can experience pain]] and suffering,&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt; this is often denied when it is convenient for people to do so. Such denial occurs for animals on farms, in laboratories, and those used for entertainment,&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wicks, D.|title=Silence and denial in everyday life - The case of animal suffering|journal=Animals|volume=1|issue=1|year=2011|pages=186–199|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/1/1/186/htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reus"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reus, E.  |author2=Olivier, D.|year=2007|title=Mind-matter for animals matters: Science and the denial of animal consciousness|journal=[[Between the Species]]|volume=13|issue=7|pages=6|url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&amp;context=bts|doi=10.15368/bts.2007v13n7.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sollund"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sollund, R.|editor=Sollund, R.|year=2008|chapter=Causes for speciesism: Difference, distance and denial|title=Global Harms: Ecological Crime and Speciesism|publisher=New York: Nova Science Publishers|pages=109–131|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=7439}}&lt;/ref&gt; where animals may come to be viewed as [[Commodity status of animals|commodities]]. A study in 2013 reported that male undergraduates in the US denied animal suffering to justify eating meat.&lt;ref name="Rothgerber"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rothgerber, H.|year=2013|title=Real men don’t eat (vegetable) quiche: Masculinity and the justification of meat consumption|journal=Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity|volume=14|issue=4|pages=363–375|doi=10.1037/a0030379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The denial of animal pain and suffering is often inconsistent between related species. Such beliefs have led to the publication of books such as ''[[Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows]]'' written by social psychologist [[Melanie Joy]] in which she popularised the term ''[[carnism]]''.&lt;ref name="Joy2011"&gt;{{cite book|year=2010|author=Joy, M.|title=Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows: An Introduction to Carnism|publisher=Conari Press|isbn=1573245054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denial of animal pain and suffering can also lead to denial of broader concepts, such as denial of moral status&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wilson, S.D.|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/|accessdate=July 9, 2016|publisher=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|title=Animals and ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the existence of "mind"&lt;ref name="Bastian"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bastian, B., Loughnan, S., Haslam, N. and Radke, H.R.|year=2012|title=Don’t mind meat?

===The Holocaust===
{{main|Holocaust denial}}
The term has been used with "[[Holocaust denial]]ism" as "the refusal to accept an [[empiricism|empirically]] verifiable reality. It is an essentially [[Emotional|irrational]] action that withholds validation of a historical experience or event."&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Shea, ''A Cross Too Heavy: Eugenio Pacelli, Politics and the Jews of Europe 1917-1943'', Rosenberg Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|1-877058-71-8}}.

'''Media Lab Asia''' (MLAsia) was founded in 2001 as a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit research entity]] as a result of cooperation between the [[MIT Media Lab]] and the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|Ministry of Communications and Information Technology]] of the [[Government of India]]. The objectives of MLAsia are to bring the benefits of [[Information and communications technology]] (ICT) to the people in Asia and around the world.

==Research focus==
Media Lab Asia started with the projects such as World Computer (affordable computing and access devices), Bits for All (low cost, high bandwidth connectivity) and Tomorrow's Tool (rurally relevant applications). It later switched to application development, including ICT for Healthcare, Education, Livelihood and Empowerment of Disabled. Since then, MLAsia has taken up 75 development projects. After development, the new technology is taken from the lab to pilot testing, and then for large scale deployment through a scheme of provider/user membership.

==Functional model==
MLAsia utilizes a way of growth by working with a network of  research academic and private organizations for undertaking development work. It serves as a research hub for the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IITs). The other partners are a combination of academic and industry R&amp;D institutions, NGOs and governmental agencies. The projects are sponsored by corporate bodies, non-profits and the government. The list of project partners has grown to more than 58.

===In the United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the widow of a [[peerage|peer]] may continue to use the style she had during her husband's lifetime, e.g. "[[Count|Countess]] of [[placeholder name|Loamshire]]", provided that his successor, if any, has no wife to bear the plain title.  Otherwise she more properly prefixes either her [[given name|forename]] or the word ''Dowager'', e.g. "Jane, Countess of Loamshire" or "Dowager Countess of Loamshire" (In any case she would continue to be called "Lady Loamshire").

The term ''[[queen dowager]]'' is used in the United Kingdom and several other countries for the widow of a king.

=== In other countries===

[[File:Sir Edwin Chadwick2.jpg|thumb|Sir Edwin Chadwick]]
[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|Sir Edwin Chadwick]]
'''Sir Edwin Chadwick''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] (24 January 1800 – 6 July 1890) was an English social reformer who is noted for his leadership in reforming the [[Poor Law]]s in England and instituting major reforms in urban [[sanitation]] and [[public health]].  A disciple of Utilitarian philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]], he was most active between 1832 and 1854; after that he held minor positions, and his views were largely ignored. Chadwick pioneered the use of scientific surveys to identify all phases of a complex social problem, and pioneered the use of systematic long-term inspection programmes to make sure the reforms operated as planned.

==Early life==
Edwin Chadwick was born on 24 January 1800 at [[Longsight]], [[Manchester]], to James Chadwick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finer|first=Samuel Edward|title=The Life and Times of Sir Edwin Chadwick|year=1952|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-416-17350-5 |p=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JycOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA6|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died when he was still a young child, yet to be named. His father, James Chadwick, tutored the scientist [[John Dalton]] in music and botany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schiff |first=Andrew |year=2008 |title="The Father of Baseball": A Biography of Henry Chadwick |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3216-5 |p=25 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered an advanced liberal politician, thus exposing young Edwin to political and social ideas. His grandfather, Andrew Chadwick, had been a close friend of the Methodist theologian [[John Wesley]].{{sfn |Schiff |2008 |p=24}}

He began his education at a small school in [[Lancashire]] and moved to a boarding school in [[Stockport]], where he studied until he was 10. When his family moved to London in 1810, Chadwick continued his education with the help of private tutors, his father and a great deal of self-teaching.

His father remarried in the early 1820s and Edwin's younger half-brother was baseball icon [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]], born in 1824.&lt;ref name="Birkett"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-33239318 | title=The Englishman dubbed 'the father of baseball' | work=[[BBC News]] | date=6 July 2015 | accessdate=6 July 2015 | author=Birkett, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 18, he decided to pursue a career in law and undertook an apprenticeship at an attorney's office. In 1823, he enrolled in law school at [[Inns of Court|The Temple in London]]. On 26 November 1830 he was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]], becoming a [[barrister]], also known as a court lawyer.

Called to the bar without independent means, he sought to support himself by literary work such as his work on ''Applied Science and its Place in Democracy'', and his essays in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', mainly on different methods of applying scientific knowledge to the practice of government. He became friends with two of the leading philosophers of the day, [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]. Bentham engaged him as a literary assistant and left him a large legacy.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}} He also became acquaintances with [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], [[Neil Arnott]], and [[James Kay-Shuttleworth]], all doctors.

From his exposure to social reform and under the influence of his friends, he began to devote his efforts to sanitary reform. In 1832, Chadwick began on his path to make improvements with sanitary and health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dunkley, Peter. |title=England's "Prussian Minister": Edwin Chadwick and the Politics of Government Growth, 1832–1854|doi=10.1086/ahr/95.4.1194 |journal=American Historical Review|volume= 95|issue=4|year=1990|pages=1194–1195|jstor=2163556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformer==
[[File:Chadwick's Bethnal Green Parish map. Wellcome L0009782.jpg|thumb|Chadwick's 1838 [[Bethnal Green]] parish map showing mortality from four diseases]]
In 1832, he was employed by the [[Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832|Royal Commission]] appointed to inquire into the operation of the [[Poor Law]], and in 1833, he was made a full member of that commission. Chadwick and [[Nassau William Senior]] drafted the famous report of 1834, recommending the reform of the old law. Under the 1834 system, individual parishes were formed into [[Poor Law Unions]], and each Poor Law Union was to have a union [[workhouse]]. Chadwick favoured a more centralised system of administration than the one adopted, and he felt the [[Reform movement|Poor Law reform]] of 1834 should have provided for the management of poor law relief by salaried officers controlled from a central board, with the boards of guardians acting merely as inspectors.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}}

In 1834, he was appointed secretary to the Poor Law commissioners. Unwilling to administer an act of which he was largely the author in any way other than as he thought best, he found it hard to get along with his superiors. The disagreement, among others, contributed to the dissolution of the [[Poor Law Commission]] in 1847. His chief contribution to political controversy was his belief in entrusting certain departments of local affairs to trained and selected experts instead of to representatives, elected on the principle of local self-government.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}}

===Sanitation===
Following a serious outbreak of [[typhus]] in 1838, Chadwick convinced the Poor Law Board that an enquiry was required, and this was initially carried out by his doctor friends Arnot and Southwood Smith, assisted by another doctor from Manchester, James Kay Shuttleworth. This was the first time in British history that doctors were employed to look at the conditions which might contribute to ill health in the population. Chadwick sent questionaires to every Poor Law Union, and talked to surveyors, builders, prison governors, police officers and factory inspectors to obtain additional data about the lives of the poor. He edited the information himself, and prepared it for publication.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=4-5}} His ''Report on The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'',&lt;ref&gt;S.E. Finer, ''The life and times of Sir Edwin Chadwick'' (1952) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nOQcDQAAQBAJ  excerpt] 209-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EdwinChadwick1842"&gt;{{cite book | title=excerpt from ''Report... from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'' (pp.369–372) (online source)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html| last=Chadwick| first=Edwin | chapter=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions | year=1842| publisher=to The Victorian Web  | location=added by Laura Del Col| pages=|accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; begun in 1839 and published in 1842,&lt;ref name=rh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Richard W.|title=The Aesthetic Interior as Incubator of Health and Well-Being|journal=Architectural History|volume=60|year=2017|pages=277–301|issn=0066-622X|doi=10.1017/arh.2017.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; was researched and published at his own expense, and became the best-selling publication produced by [[Office of Public Sector Information|the Stationery Office]] to date.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=5}} A supplementary report was also published in 1843.&lt;ref name="EdwinChadwick1843"&gt;{{cite book | title=Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain. A Supplementary Report on the results of a Special Inquiry into The Practice of Internment in Towns|url=https://archive.org/details/reportonsanitary00chaduoft| last= Chadwick| first= Edwin | edition= | year=1843| publisher=Printed by R. Clowes &amp; Sons, for Her Majesty's Stationery Office| location= London| page=|accessdate=8 November 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

He employed John Roe, the surveyor for the district of Holborn and Finsbury who had invented the egg-shaped sewer, to conduct experiments on the most efficient ways to construct drains, the results of which were incorporated into the report, and the summary included eight points, including the absolute necessity of better water supplies and of a drainage system to remove waste, as ways to diminish premature mortality.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=7-8}} Evidence given by Dr Dyce Guthrie convinced Chadwick that every house should have a permanent water supply, rather than the intermittent supplies from standpipes that were often provided.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=9}} The report caught the public imagination, and the government had to set up a Health of Towns Commission to consider the issues and recommend legislation. Its chairman was the Duke of Baccleuch, and there were thirteen members, including then engineers [[Robert Stephenson]] and [[William Cubitt]]. Chadwick acted as secretary in an unofficial capacity, and seems to have dominated the proceedings.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=8}}

The Commission took evidence from [[Robert Thom (engineer)|Robert Thom]], who had designed a water supply system for [[Greenock]], [[Thomas Wicksteed]], who was the engineer for the [[East London Waterworks Company]], and [[Thomas Hawksley]] from the Trent Waterworks, [[Nottingham]].{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=10-11}} These confirmed his ideas about constant water supplies, and he developed a model which he called the "venous and arterial system." Each house would have a constant water supply, and [[water-closet]]s would ensure that soil was discharged into egg-shaped sewers, to be carried away and spread on the land as manure, preventing rivers from becoming polluted.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=12}} Followed the publication of the Commission's report, the [[Health of Towns Association]] was formed and various city-based branches were created.&lt;ref name="Ashton-Ubido"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chadwick later helped to ensure that the Waterworks Clauses Act 1847 became law, to limit the profits that water supply companies could make to 10 percent, and requiring them to comply with reasonable demands for water. This included a constant supply of wholesome water for houses, and a supply for cleansing sewers and watering streets.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=11}}

Chadwick wanted to see his ideas implemented over a wide area, and set about forming a company to supply water to towns, to ensure their drainage and cleansing, and to use the refuse for agricultural production. It was to have the grandiose title "The British, Colonial and Foreign Drainage, Water Supply and Towns Improvement Company", with an initial capital of £1 million, but it was the time of the [[Railway Mania]], and he struggled to raise the finance against such competition. The company when it was eventually registered became the more modest Towns Improvement Company.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=17-19, 27}} Railways continued to dominate the money market, and the company was wound up after just three years.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=30}} Chadwick understood that both water supply and drainage were important, since replacing [[earth-closet]]s with water closets resulted in cesspools overflowing and making sanitary conditions worse, unless there were sewers to carry the waste away. This let to a rift forming between him and Hawksley, who had initially worked closely with him but who later took on water supply projects which did not include any requirement for drainage.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=22-23}}

===Public Health Act===
Chadwick's report led to the [[Public Health Act 1848]], which was the first instance of the British government taking responsibility for the health of its citizens.&lt;ref name=rh/&gt; It had been introduced by Lord Morpeth in 1847, with the aim or requiring every town to supply water to every house, which they could do by building their own waterworks or by liaising with water companies, and to undertake drainage, sewerage and street paving projects. Most of its grand aims were considerably watered down by the time it became law, but it established a Central Board of Health, whose members were [[Lord Morpeth]], [[Lord Shaftesbury]], and Chadwick. They were later joined by Southwood Smith, who acted as a medical advisor. Districts could pay for a survey from an inspector employed by the Board, and could then proceed without the need to obtain a costly local Act to authorise the work. Chadwick chose all of the inspectors himself, ensuring that they shared his views on glazed sewer pipes, constant water supply and arterial drainage. They worked enthusiastically, ensuring that districts considered comprehensive schemes for water supply, drainage and sewerage.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=31}}

Ratepayers in a district could request an inspector to attend if ten percent of them signed a petition. The Board could also hold an enquiry if the death rate of a district exceeded 23 per 1000, but gauged the level of local support, and formed a local Board if there was support, and withdrew tactfully if there was opposition. By 1853, they had received requests for inspections from 284 towns, and 13 combined water supply, sewerage and drainage schemes had been completed under the legislation.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=31-32}} Relationships with engineers were not always easy, with [[James Meadows Rendel (engineer)|J M Rendel]] calling Chadwick's ideas "sanitary humbug" and Robert Stephenson stating that he hated the ideas of pipes, rather than brick-built sewers. Even [[Joseph Bazalgette]], who went on to design London's trunk sewer network, spoke out against glazed sewer pipes.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=36}} As time went by, there was growing opposition to what was seen as central control by the Board. The rift between Chadwick and Hawksley had become open hostility, and Hawksley made serious complaints against Chadwick and one of the Board's inspectors to a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1853.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=37-38}} Opposition from engineers increased, and a "Private Enterprise Society" was formed by Hawksley and [[James Simpson (engineer)|James Simpson]], with the intent of bringing down the Board. Shaftsbury, Chadwick and Southwood Smith all had to resign in 1854, and the Board did not last for long afterwards. Chadwick lived to see his position vindicated, when the Local Government Board was established in 1871, which led to the formation of the Ministry of Health. Since then, it has been widely acknowledged that public health is a matter of government responsibility, working through local authorities.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=41-42}}

In 1851, Chadwick made a recommendation that a single authority should take over the nine separate water supply companies that operated in London. Although this idea was rejected by the Government, the Metropolitan Water Supply Act 1852 forced the companies to move the intakes for their water to locations above [[Teddington Lock|Teddington weir]], to filter water before it was used for domestic supply, to cover filtered water reservoirs, and to ensure that there was a constant water supply to all users by 1857. This was not achieved until 1899, and Chadwick's recommendation for a single authority was eventually implemented in 1902, with the formation of the Metropolitan Water Board.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=12-13}}
   
In 1852, Chadwick conversed with [[Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn]] in relation to the construction of a sewerage system in Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Burton Archives, Swansea University, LAC/26/D/61&lt;/ref&gt;

Chadwick's efforts were acknowledged by at least one health reformer of the day: [[William James Erasmus Wilson]] dedicated his 1854 book ''Healthy Skin'' to Chadwick "In admiration of his strenuous and indefatigable labors in the cause of Sanitary Reform".&lt;ref name="ErasmusWilson1854"&gt;{{cite book | title=Healthy Skin: A Popular Teatise on the Skin and Hair, their Preservation and Management |url=https://archive.org/details/healthyskinapop04wilsgoog| last= Wilson| first= Erasmus| edition=2nd American, from the 4th Revised London | year=1854| publisher=Blanchard &amp; Lea | location= Philadelphia| page=|accessdate=8 November 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

He  corresponded with [[Florence Nightingale]] on methodology. He encouraged her to write up her research into the book ''Notes on Nursing.'' He promoted it among well placed intellectuals, making her more visible.&lt;ref&gt;Joann G. Widerquist,  "Sanitary Reform And Nursing: Edwin Chadwick and Florence Nightingale." ''Nursing History Review.'' (1997), Vol. 5, p149-160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Chadwick was a commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] in London from 1848 to 1849. He was also a commissioner of the [[Local board of health#General Board of Health|General Board of Health]] from its establishment in 1848 to its abolition in 1854, when he retired on a pension. He occupied the remainder of his life in voluntary contributions to sanitary, health and economic questions.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=42}}

In January 1884, he was appointed as the first president of the Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors, now the [[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]]. Its head office, in [[Waterloo, London]], is named Chadwick Court, in his honour.

While he is well known for his work with the Poor Law and with sanitation, he also contributed to other areas of public policy. These included tropical hygiene, criminal justice institutions, policy regarding funerals and burials in urban areas, school architecture, utilisation of sewage, military sanitation and the education of paupers. He was involved in investigations into child labour in factories, the organisation of the police force, drunkenness, the treatment of labourers on the railways, the building and maintenance of roads, organisation of the civil service, and various aspects of education. Most of these benefitted from his use of statistical methods to collect and organise data, and of the use of anecdotal evidence to support his conclusions. He was involved in a number of organisations, including the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[Institute of Civil Engineers]], the [[National Association for the Promotion of Social Science]], the [[Royal Society of Arts]], the [[Royal Statistical Society]], the [[London Debating Societies|London Debating Society]] and the [[Political Economy Club]].{{sfn |Ekelund |Price |2012 |pp=4-5}}

In recognition of his public service, he was [[knight]]ed in 1889. He served in his post until his death, at 90, in 1890,{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=42}} at [[East Sheen]], [[Surrey]].

Chadwick is remembered at the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine]] where his name appears among the names of 23 pioneers of public health and tropical medicine  chosen to be honoured when the School was built in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/library/archives/history/frieze/chadwick.html|title=Behind the Frieze - Sir Edwin Chadwick (1800-1890) {{!}} London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine {{!}} LSHTM.|website=www.lshtm.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032848/http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/library/archives/history/frieze/chadwick.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He is also commemorated at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland for the engineering building.

According to Priti Joshi in 2004 the evaluation of his career has drastically changed since the 1950s:
:The Chadwick that emerges in recent accounts could not be more different from the mid-century Chadwick. The post-war critics saw him as a visionary, an often-embattled crusader for public health whose enemies were formidable but whose vision, extending the liberal and radical tradition, ultimately prevailed. Cultural critics, on the other hand, present a Chadwick who misrepresented (if not outright oppressed) the poor and who was instrumental in developing a massive bureaucracy to police their lives. Thus, while earlier accounts highlighted Chadwick’s accomplishments, the progress of public health reforms, and the details of legislative politics, more recent ones draw attention to his representations of the poor, the erasures in his text, and the growing nineteenth-century institutionalization of the poor that the Sanitary Report promotes. Chadwick, in other words, is portrayed as either a pioneer of reform or an avatar of bureaucratic oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Priti |last=Joshi |title=Edwin Chadwick's Self-Fashioning: Professionalism, Masculinity, and the Victorian Poor |work=Victorian Literature and Culture |volume=32 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pp=353–370 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/victorian-literature-and-culture/article/edwin-chadwicks-selffashioning-professionalism-masculinity-and-the-victorian-poor/896F815307412B1ACD57604A503CC6F9}}, quoting p 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such views are not universally held. Thus Eckland and Price in their assessment of Chadwick's economic policies in 2012 can write:
:It is no exageration to note that Chadwick is an almost singular progenitor of public health in the UK and elsewhere. The one hundredth anniversary of his death (1990) and the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the first Public Health Act (1848) was an occasion of serious and deserved plaudits for him in the United States and abroad. His prowess in sanitation engineering has also been duly noted. These excellent works appropriately feature Chadwick's role as one of the two or three most important policy makers of nineteenth century England.{{sfn |Eckland |Price |2012 |p=viii}}

A '''fence insert''' is an object designed to fit or clip into standard [[chain link fencing]]. There are three main objectives typically fulfilled by fence inserts. One is to provide [[privacy]] by converting chain link fencing into an opaque surface.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; Another is to exploit the fence as a site for signage, often providing low-resolution displays of corporate logos, sports mascots or verbal messages. A third objective of fence inserts is to decorate otherwise plain fencing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rakRAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=fence+insert+decoration+weave+-wikipedia+chain+link&amp;dq=fence+insert+decoration+weave+-wikipedia+chain+link&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_s_G-xtraAhWnJ8AKHfjmCVo4ChDoAQguMAI Encylopedia Brittanica - Wire] 1957. Vol 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of fence inserts can be traced back to U.S. [[patent]] #507,952, filed by Clarence White of [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] in 1893.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The invention consists of "marbles or other loose independent filling pieces" sized to allow placement within the cells of a wire mesh. The purpose of the invention is described as providing "a convenient and economical means of lettering, ornamenting, or filling" the wire mesh.

Current products on the market include privacy slats that weave through the [[fence]], plastic-shaped cups designed to clip into open cells, and two-part interlocking units which attach together at the crossover of fence wires.&lt;ref name="McElroy"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=598vHUrUraoC&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=fence%20insert%20privacy%20weave%20-wikipedia&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q=fence%20insert%20privacy%20weave%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false Fences and Retaining Walls] McElroy, W. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''festival''' is an event ordinarily celebrated by a [[community]] and centering on some characteristic aspect of that community and its [[religion]] or [[culture]]s. It is often marked as a local or national [[holiday]], [[mela]], or [[Muslim holidays|eid]]. Next to religion and [[folklore]], a significant origin is [[agriculture|agricultural]]. Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with [[harvest]] time. Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in [[autumn]], such as [[Halloween]] in the northern hemisphere and [[Easter]] in the southern.

Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanksgiving. The celebrations offer a sense of belonging for religious, social, or geographical groups, contributing to [[group cohesiveness]]. They may also provide [[entertainment]], which was particularly important to local communities before the advent of mass-produced entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform community members of their traditions; the involvement of [[old age|elders]] sharing stories and experience provides a means for unity among [[family|families]].

In [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], festivals such as the [[Saturnalia]] were closely associated with social organisation and political processes as well as religion.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Noel|title=Festivals and legends: the formation of Greek cities in the light of public ritual|year=1992|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=0802059880|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brandt&gt;{{cite book|last=Brandt|first=edited by J.

The [[Philippines]] is one example of a modern society with a large number of festivals, as each day of the year has at least one specific celebration. There are more than 42,000 known major and minor festivals in the country, the majority of which are specific to the [[barangay]] (village) level.&lt;ref name="Picard"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Picard|first1=David|last2=Robinson|first2=Mike|editor=David Picard and Mike Robinson|title=Festivals, Tourism and Social Change|year=2006|publisher=[[Channel View Publications]]|isbn=978-1-84541-267-8|pages=1–3|chapter=Remaking Worlds: Festivals, Tourism and Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Alexander van Bredael - A Festival in Antwerp.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.10|A Festival at [[Antwerp]], 17th century]]
[[File:Ländliches Fest in Schwaben.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.10|Country Festival in [[Swabia]]]]
The word "festival" was originally used as an adjective from the late fourteenth century, deriving from [[Latin]] via [[Old French]].&lt;ref name=oed1&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/69567 festival, adj. and n.]". [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle English]], a "festival dai" was a religious holiday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&amp;id=MED15806&amp;egs=all festival (adj.)] at the [[Middle English Dictionary]]. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first recorded used as a noun was in 1589 (as "Festifall").&lt;ref name=oed1/&gt; Feast first came into usage as a noun circa 1200,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68799 feast, n.]". [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and its first recorded use as a verb was circa 1300.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68800 feast, v.]". [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "feast" is also used in common [[secular]] [[idiom|parlance]] as a synonym for any large or elaborate [[meal]]. When used as in the meaning of a festival, most often refers to a [[religious festival]] rather than a film or art festival. In the [[Philippines]] and many other former Spanish colonies, the Spanish word '''fiesta''' is used to denote a communal religious feast to honor a [[patron saint]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Traditions==
Many festivals have religious origins and entwine cultural and religious significance in traditional activities. The most important religious festivals such as [[Christmas]], [[Rosh Hashanah]], [[Diwali]], and [[Eid al-Adha]] serve to mark out the year. Others, such as [[harvest festival]]s, celebrate seasonal change. Events of historical significance, such as important military victories or other nation-building events also provide the impetus for a festival. An early example is the festival established by [[Ancient Egypt]]ian Pharaoh [[Ramesses III]] celebrating his victory over the Libyans.&lt;ref name=Berrett&gt;{{cite book|last=Berrett|first=LaMar C.|title=Discovering the world of the Bible|year=1996|publisher=Grandin Book Co.|location=Provo, Utah|isbn=0-910523-52-5|page=289|edition=3rd ed., rev.|author2=Ogden D. Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many countries, royal holidays commemorate dynastic events just as agricultural holidays are about harvests. Festivals are often commemorated annually.

There are numerous [[Outline of festivals#Types of festivals|types of festivals]] in the world and most countries celebrate important events or traditions with traditional cultural events and activities. Most culminate in the consumption of specially prepared food (showing the connection to "feasting") and they bring people together. Festivals are also strongly associated with national holidays. Lists of national festivals are published to make participation easier.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [[List of festivals in Australia]]; [[List of festivals in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]]; [[List of festivals in Canada|Canada]]; [[Traditional Chinese holidays|China]]; [[List of festivals in Colombia|Colombia]]; [[List of festivals in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]]; [[List of festivals in Fiji|Fiji]]; [[Public holidays in India|India]]; [[List of festivals in Indonesia|Indonesia]]; [[List of festivals in Iran|Iran]]; [[List of festivals in Japan|Japan]]; [[List of festivals in Laos|Laos]]; [[List of festivals in Morocco|Morocco]]; [[List of festivals in Nepal|Nepal]]; [[List of festivals in Pakistan|Pakistan]]; [[List of festivals in the Philippines|Philippines]]; [[List of festivals in Romania|Romania]]; [[List of festivals in Tunisia|Tunisia]]; [[List of festivals in Turkey|Turkey]]; [[List of festivals in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]; [[List of festivals in the United States|United States]]; [[List of festivals in Vietnam|Vietnam]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of festivals==
===Religious festivals===
{{main|Religious festival}}
Among many [[religion]]s, a feast is a set of celebrations in honour of [[Gods]] or [[God]].&lt;ref name=Bleeker&gt;Ancient Egyptian festivals could be either religious or political.{{cite book|last=Bleeker|first=C. J.|title=Egyptian festivals. Enactments of religious renewal|date=1967 [1968]|publisher=E. J. Brill|location=Leiden, The Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feast and a festival are historically interchangeable. Most religions have festivals that recur annually and some, such as [[Passover]], Easter and Eid al-Adha are [[moveable feast]]s – that is, those that are determined either by lunar or agricultural cycles or the calendar in use at the time. The [[Sed festival]], for example, celebrated the thirtieth year of an Egyptian [[pharaoh]]'s rule and then every three (or four in one case) years after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heb-Sed (Egyptian feast)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/258986/Heb-Sed|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Christian]] [[liturgical calendar]], there are two principal feasts, properly known as the Feast of the Nativity of our Lord (Christmas) and the Feast of the Resurrection, (Easter). In the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Anglican]] liturgical calendars there are a great number of lesser feasts throughout the year commemorating saints, sacred events or doctrines. In the [[Philippines]], each day of the year has at least one specific religious festival, either from Catholic, Islamic, or indigenous origins.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religious festivals, such as [[Esala Perahera]] are held in Sri Lanka and Thailand.&lt;ref name=Gerson&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerson|first=Ruth|title=Traditional festivals in Thailand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Kuala Lumpur; New York|isbn=9676531111}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Sindhi festivals|Hindu festivals]], such as [[Holi]] are very ancient. The [[Sikh]] community celebrates the [[Vaisakhi]] festival marking the new year and birth of the [[Khalsa]].&lt;ref name="Roy2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Christian|title=Traditional Festivals, Vol. 2 &amp;#91;M – Z&amp;#93;: A Multicultural Encyclopedia|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-089-5|page=480|chapter=Sikh Vaisakhi: Anniversary of the Pure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts festivals===
{{main|Arts festival}}

Among the many offspring of general arts festivals are also more specific types of festivals, including ones that showcase intellectual or creative achievement such as [[science festival]]s, [[literary festival]]s and [[music festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of music festivals]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Sub-categories include [[comedy festival]]s, [[rock festival]]s, [[List of jazz festivals|jazz festivals]] and [[buskers festival]]s; [[poetry]] festivals,&lt;ref&gt;Some such as such as [[Cúirt International Festival of Literature]] started as a poetry festival and then broadened in scope.&lt;/ref&gt; [[theatre festival]]s, and [[storytelling festival]]s; and re-enactment festivals such as [[Renaissance fair]]s. In the [[Philippines]], aside from numerous art festivals scattered throughout the year, February is known as national arts month, the culmination of all art festivals in the entire archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasilag|first=Giselle P.|date=February 1999|title=Performances, exhibits around the country mark National Arts Month|url=|journal=BusinessWorld (SanJuan, Philippines)|volume=|pages=1|issn=0116-3930|via=Nexis Uni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Film festival]]s involve the screenings of several different films, and are usually held annually. Some of the most significant film festivals include the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], the [[Venice Film Festival]] and the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

===Food and drink festivals===
{{main|Food festival}}
A food festival is an event celebrating food or drink. These often highlight the output of producers from a certain region. Some food festivals are focused on a particular item of food, such as the [[National Peanut Festival]] in the United States, or the [[Galway International Oyster Festival]] in Ireland. There are also specific beverage festivals, such as the famous [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany for [[Beer festival|beer]]. Many countries hold festivals to celebrate [[wine festival|wine]]. One example is the global celebration of the arrival of [[Beaujolais nouveau]], which involves shipping the new wine around the world for its release date on the third Thursday of November each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hyslop|first=Leah|title=Beaujolais Nouveau day: 10 facts about the wine|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/wine/10465236/Beaujolais-Nouveau-day-10-facts-about-the-wine.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haine2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haine|first=W.

In the Philippines, there are at least two hundred festivals dedicated to food and drinks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Seasonal and harvest festivals===
Seasonal festivals, such as [[Beltane]], are determined by the [[solar calendar|solar]] and the [[lunar calendar]]s and by the cycle of the [[season]]s, especially because of its effect on food supply, as a result of which there is a [[list of harvest festivals|wide range]] of ancient and modern [[harvest festival]]s. Ancient Egyptians relied upon the seasonal [[inundation]] caused by the [[Nile River]], a form of [[irrigation]], which provided fertile land for crops.&lt;ref name="Bunson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunson|first=Margaret|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6EJ0G-4jyoC&amp;pg=PA277|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0997-8|page=278|chapter=Nile festivals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Alps]], in autumn the return of the cattle from the mountain [[pasture]]s to the stables in the valley is celebrated as ''[[Almabtrieb]]''. A recognized winter festival, the [[Chinese New Year]], is set by the lunar calendar, and celebrated from the day of the second new moon after the [[Dongzhi (solar term)|winter solstice]]. [[Dree Festival]] of the Apatanis living in Lower Subansiri District of Arunachal Pradesh is celebrated every year from July 4 to 7 by praying for a bumper crop harvest.&lt;ref name="GoAP PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arunachalpradesh.nic.in/press/04-05/050704a.htm|title=Press release – Dree festival|date=5 July 2004|publisher=Directorate of Information, Govt of Arunachal Pradesh|accessdate=2009-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718153132/http://arunachalpradesh.nic.in/press/04-05/050704a.htm|archive-date=July 18, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Midsummer]] or St John's Day, is an example of a seasonal festival, related to the [[feast day]] of a Christian saint as well as a celebration of the time of the [[summer solstice]] in the northern hemisphere, where it is particularly important in Sweden. [[Winter carnival]]s also provide the opportunity to utilise to celebrate creative or sporting activities requiring snow and ice. In the [[Philippines]], each day of the year has at least one festival dedicated to harvesting of crops, fishes, crustaceans, milk, and other local goods.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Study of festivals==
* [[Festive ecology]] – explores the relationships between the [[symbol]]ism and the [[ecology]] of the [[plant]]s, [[fungi]] and [[animal]]s associated with cultural events such as festivals, processions and special occasions. 
* [[Heortology]] – the study of [[religious festival]]s.  It was originally only used in respect of [[Christianity|Christian]] festivals,&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Heortology}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it now covers all [[religion]]s, in particular those of Ancient [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Parker: Athenian Religion&lt;/ref&gt; See [[list of foods with religious symbolism]] for some topical overlap.

'''[[Foreign direct investment]] and the environment''' involves international businesses and their interactions and impact on the natural world. These interactions can be observed through the stringency applied to foreign direct [[investment]] policy and the responsiveness of capital or labor incentive for investment inflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neequaye|first=Nii Amon|last2=Oladi|first2=Reza|date=2015-09-01|title=Environment, growth, and FDI revisited|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059056015001021|journal=International Review of Economics &amp; Finance|volume=39|pages=47–56|doi=10.1016/j.iref.2015.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws and regulations created by a country that focuses on environmental regimes can directly impact the levels of competition involving foreign direct investment they are exposed to.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Policy Stringency and Foreign Direct Investment|last=Kalamova|first=Magarita|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=34–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal and financial incentives stemming from ecological motivators, such as [[carbon tax]]ation, are methods used based on the desired outcome within a country in order to attract foreign direct investment.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Šimelytė|first=Agnė|last2=Liučvaitienė|first2=Aušra|date=2012-01-01|title=Foreign Direct Investment Policy–Friendly Business Environment in R&amp;D Sectors: Baltic States versus Visegrad Countries|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10669868.2012.663737|journal=Journal of East-West Business|volume=18|issue=1|pages=66–93|doi=10.1080/10669868.2012.663737|issn=1066-9868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

External funding sources that come from foreign direct investment, stimulates the increase of innovative ideas surrounding technological advances while it also holds the potential to decrease unemployment.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; When financial and fiscal motives are combined with environmental consciousness, the promotion of green and [[sustainable]] innovations increases. Such environmental consciousness can result in the decrease of industrial pollutants, which contributes to infant mortality and other health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jorgenson|first=Andrew K|date=2009-06-01|title=Foreign Direct Investment and the Environment, the Mitigating Influence of Institutional and Civil Society Factors, and Relationships Between Industrial Pollution and Human Health: A Panel Study of Less-Developed Countries|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1086026609338163|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=135–157|doi=10.1177/1086026609338163|issn=1086-0266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policies created that attract innovative and environmentally conscious technological advancements have been stated as a great way to encourage increase in the abundance of environmentally friendly foreign direct investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ajide|first=K. B.|date=|year=2010|title=FDI and the Environment in Developing Economies: Evidence from Nigeria|url=http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/medwelljournals/erj/2010/291-297.pdf|journal=Environmental Research Journal|volume=4|pages=291–297|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]]'' promotes policies that can have positive social and economic impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/about/|title=About the OECD - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign direct investment does have the potential in initiating negative effects on countries as well. Foreign direct investments allow for the chance of compromise and collaboration between policies of negotiating countries which brings the opportunity for new perspectives on green innovation. However, intensifying regulations around production costs, such as environmental effect, can decrease the attraction of foreign direct investment to that country. Businesses or governments may wish to negotiate with a country with less complicated policies therefore decreasing a country's competitive edge on the international market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Environmental Regulation and Foreign Direct Investment Incentives ==
A complete list of foreign direct investment incentives that can be applied in regards to international business can be found in [[Foreign direct investment]].

Some researchers find foreign direct investment leads to strict environmental policy.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/pdf/09657576/v19i0003/568_eraiffdi.xml|title=Environmental Regulation: An Incentive for Foreign Direct Investment|last=Dijkstra|first=Bouwe R|last2=Mathew|first2=Anuj Joshua|date=|website=journals2.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-28|last3=Mukherjee|first3=Arijit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental consciousness has been a pressing topic for discussion and concern in the global community as has been seen in the recent [[Paris Agreement]]. For a country to become more attractive to foreign investors, one may consider implementing incentives that simultaneously reduce cost while also enabling environmental initiatives. Incentives are policy or regulation measures that are implemented to serve both as a reason to increase foreign direct investment while also maintaining control over the impact investment may have.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajan|first=Ramkishen S.|date=2004-01-01|title=Measures to Attract FDI: Investment Promotion, Incentives and Policy Intervention|jstor=4414454|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=39|issue=1|pages=12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiscal incentives alone, such as taxation laws that aim to reduce the [[tax]] burden of a firm, do not largely contribute to attracting foreign direct investment in research and development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Financial incentives direct monetary contributions from a government to a firm; this could include direct capital subsidies or subsidized loans. Incentives that combine both fiscal and financial aspects, have the capacity to increase interest in investment.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

== Foreign Direct Investment and Environment in Different Countries ==

=== Canada ===
[[Canada]] is part of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], an amalgamation of countries dedicated to working in unison to increase environmental sustainability.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.563.9526&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Explaining Canada's Changing FDI Patterns|last=Hejazi|first=Walid|last2=Safarian|first2=Edward|date=|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research shows that the total amounts of  [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions have been increasing for Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/science/article/pii/S0301479706003070|title=Greenhouse gas emissions in Canada and Japan: Sector-specific estimates and managerial and economic implications|last=Hayami|first=Hitoshi|last2=Nakamura|first2=Masao|date=|website=www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study shows that Canada is not prepared to avoid the effects of environmental issues that come with economic growth as it does not have a high level of per capita [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] to avoid these negative effects at this time.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdouli|first=Mohamed|last2=Hammami|first2=Sami|title=Economic growth, FDI inflows and their impact on the environment: an empirical study for the MENA countries|url=https://link-springer-com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/article/10.1007/s11135-015-0298-6|journal=Quality &amp; Quantity|volume=51|issue=1|pages=121–146|doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0298-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While another study shows that [[Quebec]] which is a major exporter of hydropower, decreased their green house gas emissions by 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amor|first=Mourad Ben|last2=Pineau|first2=Pierre-Olivier|last3=Gaudreault|first3=Caroline|last4=Samson|first4=Réjean|year=2011|title=Electricity trade and GHG emissions: Assessment of Quebec's hydropower in the Northeastern American market (2006–2008)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/science/article/pii/S0301421511000097|journal=Energy Policy|volume=39|pages=1711–1721|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, Canada has developed more lenient foreign direct investment policies in order to attract investment.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; For example, recent Chinese investment in Canada's oil and gas industry has raised concerns that such investments may increase global emissions.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/pdf/17538963/v07i0001/21_clseatrofiic.xml|title=Chinese lessons: state-owned enterprises and the regulation of foreign investment in Canada|last=Woo|first=Yuen Pau|date=|website=journals2.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Canada is involved in trade agreements over water with the United States such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://watermicronworld.com/TheGlobalWaterCrisis.pdf|title=The Global Water Crisis and the Commodification of the World’s Water Supply|last=Maude|first=Barlow|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers argue trade agreements concerning water is affecting the [[sustainability]] of water management.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=aWOKNROK9XsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=canada's+water+resource+trade&amp;ots=UtES26Vc5D&amp;sig=QXc6AOKoOgt1yPRjCgcwz5zhqBE#v=onepage&amp;q=canada's%20water%20resource%20trade&amp;f=false|title=Eau Canada: The Future of Canada's Water|last=Bakker|first=Karen|date=2011-11-01|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=9780774840095|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is stated that water governance and management is changing in Canada. There are many commodities that are produced with water, which may increase the competition for water resources&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; and this may affect water security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Young Jae|last2=Hipel|first2=Keith W.|last3=Bowman|first3=Clement W.|title=Water security problems in Canada’s oil sands|url=http://www.tandfonline.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/doi/full/10.1080/07011784.2013.773770?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Canadian Water Resources Journal|volume=38|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.1080/07011784.2013.773770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has been taking preliminary steps to become more environmentally conscious within their trade agreements and environmental regulation policies. In order to address [[air pollution]] and its effects on the environment such as acid rain, Canada has partnered with the [[United States]] through Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement. Canada and the United States work together to address [[acid rain]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.gc.ca/International/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=F7D0DFE8-1|title=Environment and Climate Change Canada - About  Environment and Climate Change Canada - Air|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|website=ec.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, chemicals and waste industries have economic benefits however also pollute the environment. Canada is part of multiple groups such as United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development  and  Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, to ensure waste management is effectively managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.gc.ca/International/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=BBC45B41-1|title=Environment and Climate Change Canada - About  Environment and Climate Change Canada - Chemicals and Waste management|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|website=ec.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Canada is part of multiple [[trade agreement]]s to ensure economic growth as well as protection of the environment. Canada has made trade agreements that focus on both labor and the environment with countries such as Chile, which focus on promoting environmental transparency and strengthening the effectiveness of domestic environmental laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.gc.ca/can-chil/default.asp?Lang=En|title=Environment and Climate Change Canada - About  Environment and Climate Change Canada - Canada-Chile|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|website=ec.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
For the past 30 years [[China]] has experienced rapid economic growth. Many studies have been dedicated to documenting the impact foreign direct investment has on the environment in China. However, there have been varying conclusions as to whether or not such investment is environmentally beneficial for the country. Jiajia Zheng and Pengfei Sheng discovered that provinces in the East have higher evidence of market development and lower CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions while provinces in the West have lower evidence of market development and higher CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Jiajia|last2=Sheng|first2=Pengfei|date=2017-03-06|title=The Impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on the Environment: Market Perspectives and Evidence from China|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2227-7099/5/1/8|journal=Economies|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.3390/economies5010008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been documented by the scientific community that there is a correlation between foreign direct investment and increases in China’s  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions as energy consumption in the long term impacts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; Researchers found that a 1% increase in foreign direct investment stocks, increase industrial SO2 levels by 0.099%, which shows that increases in foreign direct investment impacts the level of emissions.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; When market development increases, so do the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Moreover, sulfur dioxide emissions are said to be one of the main sources of pollution in the air.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/docview/873897002/573EC7A3696743D4PQ/1?accountid=11233|title=The impact of FDI on air quality: evidence from China|last=Kirkulak|first=Berna|authorlink=|last2=Qiu|first2=Bin|date=|website=search.proquest.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-28|last3=Yin|first3=Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers conclude that foreign direct investment does not have negative effects on China’s natural environment.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Studies have shown that the presence of foreign direct investment has the potential to reduce air [[pollution]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Foreign direct investment can be beneficial to China’s environment as the foreign companies bring more efficient technology which could improve productivity and energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; China progressed in its market oriented economy as this market oriented reform improved electricity generation efficiency.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, cleaner technology helps China’s environment. Further, there is an openness of trade, which can impact the environment and has been studied. The results found that international trade would raise income, promote consumer spending on environmentally friendly goods and curb emissions as trade openness brings more technology through from developed countries which help the environment.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

China is taking some steps towards a cleaner environment through policy-making.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/stable/pdf/41329087.pdf|title=Environmental Lessons from China: Finding Promising Policies  in Unlikely Places|last=Remais|first=Justin V|last2=Zhang|first2=Junfeng|date=|website=www.jstor.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that environmental regulations have the potential to encourage industrial relocations.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/pdf/09596526/v141icomplete/295_mepaphhefcpi.xml|title=Multiple environmental policies and pollution haven hypothesis: Evidence from China's polluting industries|last=Zheng|first=Dan|last2=Shi|first2=Minjun|date=|website=journals2.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has energy saving and airborne emissions reduction policies which have been stated to help move air-polluting industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Jing|last2=Wei|first2=Yehua Dennis|last3=Yang|first3=|year=Zi|title=The impact of environmental regulations on the location of pollution-intensive industries in China|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/science/article/pii/S0959652617302640|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=148|pages=785–794|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China has accomplished reducing carbon emissions through far reaching efficiency programs as in 2004, the country adopted national fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles. Although China is improving their environmental regulations, there is still more work to do such as increasing transparency of environmentally informed national accounts, and the need for greater enforcement.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== India ===
Statistics have shown that although there is a long run, positive but marginal, impact of foreign direct investment in India, the long run growth of foreign direct investment impact on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is even larger.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acharyya|first=Joysri|year=2009|title=FDI, growth and the environment: Evidence from India on CO2 emission during the last two decades|url=|journal=Journal of economic development|volume=34|pages=43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized that the impact on environment may be larger as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  emission is an air pollutant that is typically generated through economic activities.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; By the turn of this century, India had been named as the 4th highest in global ranking of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Many developing countries desire increased inflows of foreign direct investment as it brings the potential of technological innovation.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; However, studies have shown a host country must reach a certain level of development in education and infrastructure sectors in able to truly capture any potential benefits foreign direct investment might bring.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; If a country already has sufficient funds in terms of per capita income, as well as an established financial market, foreign direct investment has the potential to influence positive economic growth.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Pre-determined financial efficiency combined with an educated labor force are the two main measures of whether or not foreign direct investment will have a positive impact on economic growth within a country.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Since 1991, India has sought to increase foreign direct investment interest within their country by instilling liberal trade and investment policies.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Since making these policy changes India has seen an increase in GDP growth rates at 7% annually. However, since the surge in foreign direct investment inflow, pollution emission and resource depletion has been increasing at alarming rates due to greater economic activity (such as the cement, transportation and paper industries).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; There is hope that as income growth increase, there would be a positive long run effect on the environment as consumer demand shifts towards relatively cleaner goods - this shift would cause pollution-intensive goods to fall, potentially reducing pollution emissions.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; India, as well as many developing countries, have been experiencing rapid economic development once adopting more liberal economic policies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ajide|first=K. B.|date=|year=2010|title=FDI and the Environment in Developing Economies: Evidence from Nigeria|url=http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/medwelljournals/erj/2010/291-297.pdf|journal=Environmental Research Journal|volume=4|pages=291–297|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

There is potential for regulation of industrial pollution to increase with further economic development due to the creation of developed public institutions capable of regulating environment depletion.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; However, until then these public sectors and institutions can be implemented, India will continue to experience increased resource depletion and pollution emissions with increases of foreign direct investment.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Nigeria ===
Studies have demonstrated that there is a causal link between [[Carbon dioxide]] per capita, and foreign direct investment inflow in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Foreign direct investment can be critical in promoting growth in the adoption of new technologies, stimulating knowledge transfers, and introducing alternative management practices as well as better institutional organization arrangements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In many [[Developing country|Developing countries]] foreign direct investment is expected to improve the balance of payments. Therefore, in many African countries, foreign direct investment impacts constitutes a key outcome of globalization which can propel them to support and promote liberalization policies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When a country adopts policies focused on liberalization, it aids in the increase of free movement capital. Therefore, long term capital, such as foreign direct investment, could then have the potential to embody adverse environmental consequences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In many [[globalization]] discussions, it is argued that environmental quality can be viewed as a good, therefore increasing free trade and foreign direct investment would lead to a cleaner environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1986, Nigeria saw foreign direct investment as a pathway to enhance growth that could span the entire economy and therefore adopted structural adjustment programs for foreign direct investment inflows.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Due to the success of the structural adjustment programs, Nigeria has become the continent's second top foreign direct investment recipient, with their oil sector receiving 90% of foreign direct investment inflow.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

However, Nigeria has demonstrated an inverse relationship between [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) and [[Carbon dioxide]] emissions, as GDP per capita increases, per capita emission falls.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A decline in the manufacturing sector shares in the country explains the average carbon dioxide emission per capita drop of 0.84 tons from 1980-1989 to 0.41 tons from 2000-2009.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It has been documented in numerous studies that developing countries tend to utilize lax environmental regulations as a method of instilling unethical industries from developed countries in hopes of increasing economic gains.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Studies have concluded that within Nigeria, although there is a long-standing relationship between quality of the environment and foreign direct investment whereas the same can not be said for foreign direct investment and economic growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=E|first=Uwubanmwen Ahmed|last2=Gabriel|first2=Ajao Mayowa|date=2012-11-21|title=The Determinants and Impacts of Foreign Direct Investment in Nigeria|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijbm/article/view/20210|journal=International Journal of Business and Management|language=en|volume=7|issue=24|pages=67|doi=10.5539/ijbm.v7n24p67|issn=1833-8119}}&lt;/ref&gt; However arguments have been made that although "extractive" foreign direct investment may not have a significant impact on a countries growth and development, manufacturing foreign direct investment may be more beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akinlo|first=A. Enisan|date=2004-07-01|title=Foreign direct investment and growth in Nigeria: An empirical investigation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893804000572|journal=Journal of Policy Modeling|volume=26|issue=5|pages=627–639|doi=10.1016/j.jpolmod.2004.04.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is constant growing evidence demonstrating that the increase of foreign direct investment within Nigeria, leads to further deterioration of their natural environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[File:Sexy-Legs-With-High-Heels.jpg|thumb|250px|High-heel shoes worn in an overt sexual context.]]
'''Fuck-me shoes''', alternatively '''fuck-me boots''', is a slang term for women's [[high-heeled shoes]] that exaggerate a sexual image. The term can be applied to any women's shoes that are worn with the intention of arousing others. It is sometimes used to imply condemnation against the women who choose to wear them or in a [[misogyny|misogynistic]] fashion toward the women who wear them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egan|first=Danielle|year=2012|title=Sexuality, youth and the perils of endangered innocence: how history can help us get past the panic|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540253.2012.666232?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Gender and Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is similar in meaning to ''[[kinky boots]]'', although typically ''kinky boots'' refer more specifically to boots suited to a particular fetish.

== Term and usage ==
The phrase possibly originated in the United States, where two similar terms are used: {{" '}}fuck-you shoes' implying a disregard for convention or propriety, or 'fuck-off shoes' where 'fuck-off' means both outsize and aggressive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorne|first=Tony|title=Dictionary of Contemporary Slang|year=2009|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-0220-6|page=N.p.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tight trousers were called "come fuck-me's" as listed in a 1972 British dictionary of slang, while a 1974 book is cited as making a reference to a person wearing "a pair of fabulous 1940s-[[Joan Crawford]]-fuck-me's".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheidlower|first=Jesse|title=The F-Word|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-539311-8|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song "We are the Dead" from [[David Bowie]]'s 1974 ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' album mentions "fuck-me pumps."

Prominent feminist [[Germaine Greer]] brought what had been an "obscure" term to more mainstream notoriety when she used it in 1995. Greer used the term in referring to British journalist [[Suzanne Moore]]'s alleged "hair bird's-nested all over the place, fuck-me shoes and three fat inches of cleavage". Greer made the remark in response to a column Moore had written about Greer in ''[[The Guardian]]'', where Moore had mistakenly repeated an incorrect rumor that Greer had a hysterectomy as a voluntary decision to have herself sterilized.&lt;ref name="Greer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thackray|first=Rachelle|title=Germaine Greer smacks her sisters|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/germaine-smacks-her-sisters-1072156.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=February 21, 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719005038/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/germaine-smacks-her-sisters-1072156.html|archivedate=July 19, 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greer was also quoted during the 1990s as criticizing a number of women writers that she termed "lifestyle feminists"&lt;ref name="Greer" /&gt; who were, in her view, espousing feminism at nothing more than a superficial level. Moore's response was that her fashion choices were dictated by her own tastes and not to please men: "as someone who grew up with [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], I take it for granted that women dress to please themselves and not men..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caudwell|first=Jayne|title=Sport, Sexualities And Queer/theory|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-36761-5|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moore has said her footwear is "not worn just for the benefit of men", implying that the intention is twofold, to please both her and observers, although she also says "Most of the pleasure [of buying shoes] involves a private fantasy that begins with me and ends at my feet. Men don't get a look in".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benstock, Sheri |author2=Ferriss, Suzanne |title=Footnotes: On Shoes|year=2001|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-2871-7|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident, and the term, received coverage in British media and beyond, and the term has become associated with Greer in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calcutt|first=Andrew|title=Brit Cult: An A to Z of British Pop Culture|year=2001|publisher=Contemporary Books|isbn=978-0-8092-9324-7|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greer had been denouncing [[stiletto heel|stiletto shoes]] as symbols of women's subordination as early as 1971.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009 82"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Tim|title=Fashion in Focus: Concepts, Practices and Politics|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-44793-5|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continues to use the phrase "fuck me shoes" in public speaking when discussing gender and clothing styles society deems appropriate.

The expression was further popularized when British jazz singer [[Amy Winehouse]] released the single "Pumps" (originally titled "[[Fuck Me Pumps]]"{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} on her 2003 album ''[[Frank (Amy Winehouse album)|Frank]]''), a song about gold diggers.

In January 2011, in a forum with teenaged students in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], Greer noticed the popularity of silicone [[breast implants]] in the audience. She asked students why they thought women tennis players wore skirts, and asked why a young woman would choose to wear stiletto shoes: "So you think the shoes are her fetish?&amp;nbsp;... I call them fuck-me shoes", she said, "because you can't walk in them but you can wear them in bed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Gaby|title=Hay Festival Cartagena: Passionate Germaine Greer's still a class act|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/8290650/Hay-Festival-Cartagena-passionate-Germaine-Greers-still-a-class-act.html|newspaper=The Telegraph (UK)|date=January 29, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702232609/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/8290650/Hay-Festival-Cartagena-passionate-Germaine-Greers-still-a-class-act.html|archivedate=July 2, 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural debate ===

The underlying conflict arises from the question of what is considered an appropriate way for women to present their bodies in public spaces. Some feminists have come to view criticisms of fashion choices to be what they term "[[slut-shaming]]", an action they view as misogynist, even when coming from other women. The development of the [[SlutWalk]] protest demonstrations against [[dress codes]] is influenced by this position. 

When [[punk fashion]] was on the rise during the late 1970s, young women consciously played with the symbolism inherent in their accessorizing, mixing choices that created a jarring visual clash; leather was combined with lace, steel spikes with velvet, stiletto heels with heavy ankle chains. The result was to exaggerate a look of sexual aggression, turning {{" '}}fuck me' shoes into signifiers of 'fuck you{{' "}}.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009 82"/&gt; The punk influenced youth counterculture continues with this trend, part of the wider trend of [[fetish fashion]].

'''Gendered racism''' is a form of [[oppression]] that occurs due to [[Race (human classification)|race]] and [[gender]]. It is perpetuated due to the prevalence of perceptions, [[stereotype]]s, and images of certain groups. '''[[Racism]]''' is defined as the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race. Racism functions as a way to distinguish races as inferior or superior to one another. '''[[Sexism]]''' is defined as prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination on the basis of sex. Gendered racism differs in that it pertains specifically to racial and ethnic understandings of masculinity and femininity, as well as along gendered forms of race and ethnic discrimination.

Fundamentally, [[Ageing|age]], [[Social class|class]], and gender are intersecting categories of experience that affect all aspects of human life. Thus, they simultaneously structure the experiences of all people in society. At any moment, race, class, or gender may feel more salient or meaningful in a given person's life, but they are overlapping and cumulative in their effects on people's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson &amp; Collins, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasizes that it is difficult for an individual to differentiate which aspect of their identity is being attacked. It may be impossible for an individual to assess whether discrimination is due to gender or race. Both of these constructs make up the individual's identity, and they intersect with one another. Because people have intersecting social identities, it is important to focus on how these identities shape an individual's experiences.

==Origin==
The term gendered racism was originally coined by sociologist [[Philomena Essed]], and refers to the simultaneous experience of both racism and sexism. According to Essed, racism and sexism "intertwine and combine under certain conditions into one hybrid phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;Essed, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Gendered racism also encompasses what is known as "double jeopardy". Double jeopardy in this case can be defined as a disadvantage an individual faces due to aspects of their identity. 
Gendered racism is seen through society's stereotypical portrayals of men and women of color. For example, [[African American]] men may be seen as criminals and absent fathers, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] women may be seen as feisty and exotic, Asian women may be viewed as submissive and docile, and African American women may be portrayed as [[Mammy archetype|Mammy]] figures, promiscuous, and emasculating.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} These stereotypes coincide with the images that are pervasive in the media, which influences public opinions on people of color.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} For African American women, gendered racism has manifested in multiple ways, and continues to do so. Their challenges include prejudice, mistreatment, and economic disadvantage.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Coping==
As a means of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]], African American women relied heavily on the support of the black community. They also coped by overachieving or being overly successful, and thinking positively.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Witherspoon &amp; Speight, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Research demonstrated that the coping mechanisms employed by African American women were not always beneficial because they heightened distress rather than decrease it. Possible ways to cope with gendered racism include education, in which African American women are provided with a space to openly discuss their experiences and develop strategies to better handle situations when they are being discriminated against. Another research experiment was conducted in order to assess how black female college students cope with gendered racial microaggressions.{{specify|reason=Which experiment?|date=December 2014}} '''[[Microaggressions]]''' are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.&lt;ref&gt;Wing Sue &amp; Rivera, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The results from these [[focus groups]] showed that there were five coping strategies employed: two resistance coping strategies, one collective coping strategy, and two self-protective coping strategies. The two resistance coping strategies were using one's voice as power and resisting Eurocentric standards. When Black women use their voice as power they are actively speaking up and addressing the microaggressions in order to assert power in the situation. In order to resist Eurocentric standards black women are compelled to shy away from the traditional standards of beauty as well as dominant ideologies held by the larger society.

The collective coping strategy proved to be leaning on one's support networks in which individuals find solace through interactions with friends and family. The women who utilized this coping strategy spoke about the comfort they found in having support from other women who had similar experiences. The two self-protective coping strategies used were becoming a Superwoman of sorts and becoming desensitized and escaping. Self-protective coping involves strategies that are used to minimize the stressful effect of gendered microaggressions. Black women who cope by becoming a Black Superwoman take on multiple roles to demonstrate their strength and resilience. Other women cope by becoming desensitized and escaping, which involves downplaying the seriousness of the situation and attempting to find a way out.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26729">[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Opte Project]] visualization of [[routing|routing path]]s through a portion of the Internet. The connections and pathways of the internet could be seen as the pathways of [[neurons]] and [[synapse]]s in a global brain]]

The '''global brain''' is a neuroscience-inspired and futurological vision of the planetary [[information and communications technology]] [[computer network|network]] that interconnects all humans and their technological artifacts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heylighen|first1=F.|title=What is the global brain?|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GBRAIFAQ.html|website=Principa Cybernetica Web|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As this network stores ever more [[information]], takes over ever more functions of coordination and communication from traditional organizations, and becomes increasingly [[intelligent]], it increasingly plays the role of a [[brain]] for the planet [[Earth]].

==Basic ideas==
Proponents of the global brain hypothesis claim that the [[Internet]] increasingly ties its users together into a single information processing system that functions as part of the collective [[nervous system]] of the planet. The intelligence of this network is [[collective intelligence|collective]] or [[distributed cognition|distributed]]: it is not centralized or localized in any particular individual, organization or computer system. Therefore, no one can command or control it. Rather, it [[self-organization|self-organizes]] or [[emergence|emerges]] from the [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of [[human–computer interaction|interactions]] between its components. This is a property typical of [[complex adaptive systems]].&lt;ref name=CAS-T-17/&gt;

The [[World-wide web]] in particular resembles the organization of a brain with its webpages (playing a role similar to [[neurons]]) connected by [[hyperlinks]] (playing a role similar to [[synapses]]), together forming an [[Association (psychology)|associative]] network along which information propagates.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"&gt;{{cite conference | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 =  Francis | last2 = Bollen | first2 = J. | date = 1996 | title = The World-Wide Web as a Super-Brain: from metaphor to model | editor-first = R. | editor-last = Trappl  | conference = Cybernetics and Systems' 96 | publisher = Austrian Society For Cybernetics | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/WWW-Super-Brain.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy becomes stronger with the rise of [[social media]], such as [[Facebook]], where links between personal pages represent relationships in a [[social network]] along which information propagates from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weinbaum | first = D. | date = 2012 | title = A Framework for Scalable Cognition: Propagation of challenges, towards the implementation of Global Brain models | publisher = GBI working paper 2012-02 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ECCO/ECCO-Papers/Weaver-Attention.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such propagation is similar to the [[spreading activation]] that [[neural networks]] in the brain use to process information in a parallel, distributed manner.

==History==
Although some of the underlying ideas were already expressed by [[Nikola Tesla]] in the late 19th century and were written about by many others before him,  the term “global brain” was coined in 1982 by [[Peter Russell (writer)|Peter Russell]] in his book ''The Global Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Peter Russell (physicist) | last = Russell | first = P. | date = 1983 | title = The Global Brain: speculations on the evolutionary leap to planetary consciousness | location = Los Angeles | publisher = JP Tarcher }}&lt;/ref&gt; How the Internet might be developed to achieve this was set out in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Andrews | first = D. | date =  February 1986 | title = Information routeing groups – Towards the global superbrain: or how to find out what you need to know rather than what you think you need to know | journal = Journal of Information Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–35 | doi=10.1057/jit.1986.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first peer-reviewed article on the subject was published by [[Gottfried Mayer-Kress]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer-Kress | first1 = G. | last2 = Barczys | first2 = C. | date = 1995 | title = The global brain as an emergent structure from the Worldwide Computing Network, and its implications for modeling | journal = The information society | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–27 | url = http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | doi = 10.1080/01972243.1995.9960177 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120907044231/http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | archivedate = 2012-09-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the first [[algorithms]] that could turn the world-wide web into a collectively intelligent network were proposed by [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Johan Bollen]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Bollen | first1 = J. | authorlink2 = Francis Heylighen | last2 = Heylighen | first2 = Francis | date = 1996 | title = Algorithms for the self-organization of distributed, multi-user networks.

Reviewing the strands of intellectual history that contributed to the global brain hypothesis, [[Francis Heylighen]] distinguishes four perspectives: ''“organicism”'', ''“encyclopedism”'', ''“emergentism”'' and ''“evolutionary cybernetics”''. He asserts that these developed in relative independence but now are converging in his own scientific re-formulation.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 = Francis | date = 2011 | chapterurl = http://pcp.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-conceptions-Rodrigue.pdf | chapter = Conceptions of a Global Brain: an historical review | title = Evolution: Cosmic, Biological, and Social | editor1-last = Grinin | editor1-first = L.

=== Organicism ===
In the 19th century, the sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] saw society as a [[social organism]] and reflected about its need for a nervous system. Entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler|William Wheeler]] developed the concept of the ant colony as a spatially extended organism, and in the 1930s he coined the term [[superorganism]] to describe such an entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = William Morton Wheeler | last = Wheeler | first = William | date = 1911 | title = The Ant Colony as an Organism | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 22 | pages = 307–325 | doi=10.1002/jmor.1050220206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later adopted by thinkers such as [[Gregory Stock]] in his book [[Metaman]] and [[Joel de Rosnay]] to describe planetary society as a superorganism.

The mental aspects of such an organic system at the planetary level were perhaps first broadly elaborated by palaeontologist and Jesuit priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. In 1945, he described a coming “planetisation” of humanity, which he saw as the next phase of accelerating human “socialisation”. Teilhard described both socialization and planetization as irreversible, irresistible processes of ''macrobiological development'' culminating in the emergence of a [[noosphere]], or global mind (see Emergentism below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap VII – The Planetisation of Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent [[living systems theory]] describes both organisms and social systems in terms of the "critical subsystems" ("organs") they need to contain in order to survive, such as an internal transport system, a resource reserve, and a decision-making system. This theory has inspired several thinkers, including Peter Russell and Francis Heylighen to define the global brain as the network of information processing subsystems for the planetary social system.

=== Encyclopedism ===
In the perspective of encyclopedism, the emphasis is on developing a universal knowledge network. The first systematic attempt to create such an integrated system of the world's knowledge was the 18th century ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. However, by the end of the 19th century, the amount of knowledge had become too large to be published in a single synthetic volume. To tackle this problem, [[Paul Otlet]] founded the science of documentation, now called [[information science]]. In the 1930s he envisaged a [[World Wide Web]]-like system of associations between documents and telecommunication links that would make all the world's knowledge available immediately to anybody. [[H. G. Wells]] proposed a similar vision of a collaboratively developed world encyclopedia that would be constantly updated by a global university-like institution. He called this a [[World Brain]], as it would function as a continuously updated memory for the planet, although the image of humanity acting informally as a more organic global brain is a recurring motif in other of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=H.G. Wells | title=The New Machiavelli| quote="But the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's brains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great brain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was thinking them! ... And then I came back as if I came back to a refrain; — the ideas go on — as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in some great brain beyond our understanding...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], too, was inspired by the free-associative possibilities of the brain for his invention. The brain can link different kinds of information without any apparent link otherwise; Berners-Lee thought that computers could become much more powerful if they could imitate this functioning, i.e. make links between any arbitrary piece of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Berners-Lee|1999|pp=4, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful implementation of encyclopedism to date is Wikipedia, which integrates the associative powers of the world-wide-web with the collective intelligence of its millions of contributors, approaching the ideal of a global memory.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"/&gt; The [[Semantic web]], also first proposed by Berners-Lee, is a system of protocols to make the pieces of knowledge and their links readable by machines, so that they could be used to make automatic [[inference]]s, thus providing this brain-like network with some capacity for autonomous "thinking" or reflection.

=== Emergentism ===
This approach focuses on the emergent aspects of the evolution and development of [[complexity]], including the spiritual, psychological, and moral-ethical aspects of the global brain, and is at present the most speculative approach. The global brain is here seen as a natural and emergent process of planetary evolutionary development. Here again [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] attempted a synthesis of science, social values, and religion in his [[The Phenomenon of Man]], which argues that the ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' (drive, purpose) of universal evolutionary process is the development of greater levels of both complexity and consciousness. Teilhard proposed that if life persists then planetization, as a biological process producing a global brain, would necessarily also produce a global mind, a new level of planetary consciousness and a technologically supported network of thoughts which he called the ''[[noosphere]]''. Teilhard's proposed technological layer for the noosphere can be interpreted as an early anticipation of the Internet and the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap X – The Formation of the Noosphere }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist and philosopher [[Peter Russell (physicist)|Peter Russell]] elaborates a similar view, and stresses the importance of personal spiritual growth, in order to build and to achieve synergy with the spiritual dimension of the emerging superorganism. This approach is most popular in [[New Age]] circles, which emphasize growth in consciousness rather than scientific modelling or the implementation of technological and social systems.

===Evolutionary cybernetics===
[[Systems theory|Systems theorists]] and [[cybernetics|cyberneticists]] commonly describe the emergence of a higher order system in evolutionary development as a “[[metasystem transition]]” (a concept introduced by [[Valentin Turchin]]) or a “major evolutionary transition”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The major evolutionary transitions | authorlink1 = Eörs Szathmáry | first1 = Eörs | last1 = Szathmáry | authorlink2 = John Maynard Smith | first2 = John | last2 = Maynard Smith | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 374 | pages = 227–232 | date = 16 March 1995 | doi = 10.1038/374227a0 | pmid=7885442| bibcode = 1995Natur.374..227S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a metasystem consists of a group of subsystems that work together in a coordinated, goal-directed manner. It is as such much more powerful and intelligent than its constituent systems. [[Francis Heylighen]] has argued that the global brain is an emerging metasystem with respect to the level of individual human intelligence, and investigated the specific evolutionary mechanisms that promote this transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2008 | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf | chapter = Accelerating socio-technological evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain | title = Globalization as evolutionary process: modeling global change | publisher = Routledge | page = 284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scenario, the Internet fulfils the role of the network of “nerves” that interconnect the subsystems and thus coordinates their activity. The cybernetic approach makes it possible to develop mathematical models and simulations of the processes of [[self-organization]] through which such coordination and [[collective intelligence]] emerges.

== Recent developments ==
In 1994 [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], in his popular book ''[[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of Control]]'', posited the emergence of a "[[Collective consciousness|hive mind]]" from a discussion of cybernetics and evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=ooc&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Addison-Wesley| isbn = 0201577933| authorlink = Kevin Kelly (editor) | last = Kelly | first = Kevin| title = [[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization]]| location = Reading, Mass| date = 1994| pages = 5–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Ben Goertzel]] founded the Global Brain group, a discussion forum grouping most of the researchers that had been working on the subject of the global brain to further investigate this phenomenon. The group organized the first international conference on the topic in 2001 at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

After a period of relative neglect, the Global Brain idea has recently seen a resurgence in interest, in part due to talks given on the topic by [[Tim O'Reilly]], the Internet forecaster who popularized the term [[Web 2.0]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | authorlink = Tim O'Reilly | first = Tim | last = O'Reilly | url = http://www.greenbiz.com/video/2012/03/22/towards-global-brain?ms=42144 | title = Towards a Global Brain | series = One Great Idea | date = March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yuri Milner]], the social media investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Chrystia | last = Freeland | website = blogs.reuters.com | url = http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/09/23/the-advent-of-the-global-brain/ | title = The advent of the global brain }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the Global Brain Institute (GBI) was founded at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] to develop a mathematical theory of the “brainlike” propagation of information across the Internet. In the same year, [[Thomas W. Malone]] and collaborators from the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]]  have started to explore how the global brain could be “programmed” to work more effectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Klein | first2 = M. | authorlink3 = Thomas W. Malone | last3 = Malone | first3 = Thomas W. | date = 2012 | title = Programming the Global Brain | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | page = 41 | url = http://cci.mit.edu/publications/CCIwp2011-04.pdf | doi=10.1145/2160718.2160731}}&lt;/ref&gt; using mechanisms of [[collective intelligence]]. The complexity scientist [[Dirk Helbing]] and his NervousNet group have recently started developing a "Planetary Nervous System", which includes a "Global Participatory Platform", as part of the large-scale [[FuturICT]] project, thus preparing some of the groundwork for a Global Brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Dirk Helbing | last1 = Helbing | first1 = Dirk | date = 2015 | chapter = Creating (“Making”) a Planetary Nervous System as Citizen Web | title = Thinking Ahead – Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society | pages = 189–194 | publisher = Springer International Publishing | chapterurl = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15078-9_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 [[Elon Musk]] founded the company [[Neuralink]], which aims to create a Neural Lace, which is a concept invented by the novelist [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]] and basically refers to a machine interface woven into the brain, to allow the user to access all available human information. A core driver behind this business idea is Mr Musk’s argument, that human beings soon have to embrace brain implants to stay relevant in a world which, he believes, will soon be dominated by [[artificial intelligence]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21719774-do-human-beings-need-embrace-brain-implants-stay-relevant-elon-musk-enters|title=Elon Musk enters the world of brain-computer interfaces|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm raised $27m from 12 Investors in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-startup-a7916891.html|title=Elon Musk could be about to spend $100m linking human brains to computers|date=2017-08-28|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==
A common criticism of the idea that humanity would become directed by a global brain is that this would reduce individual diversity and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rayward | first = W. B. | date = 1999 | title = H. G. Wells' s idea of a World Brain: A critical reassessment | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 50 | issue = 7 | pages = 557–573 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.85.1010 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:7&lt;557::aid-asi2&gt;3.0.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lead to [[mass surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brooks | first = M. | date = June 24, 2000 | url = http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0006/msg00182.html | title = Global brain | journal = New Scientist | issue = 2244 | page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is inspired by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] forms of government, as exemplified by [[George Orwell|George Orwell']]s character of "[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]". It is also inspired by the analogy between collective intelligence or [[swarm intelligence]] and [[insect societies]], such as beehives and ant colonies, in which individuals are essentially interchangeable. In a more extreme view, the global brain has been compared with the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goertzel | first = Ben | date = 2002 | title = Creating Internet Intelligence: Wild computing, distributed digital consciousness, and the emerging global brain | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers | url = {{google books|id=Vnzb-xLdvv8C|plainurl=yes}} | isbn = 9780306467356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the race of collectively thinking cyborgs conceived by the [[Star Trek]] science fiction franchise.

Global brain theorists reply that the emergence of distributed intelligence would lead to the exact opposite of this vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2007 | title = The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society | journal = Social Evolution &amp; History | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–119 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/Superorganism.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2002 | chapter = Das Globale Gehirn als neue Utopia |trans-chapter=The global brain as a new utopia | publisher = Suhrkamp | location = Frankurt | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-Utopia.pdf | editor1-first = R. | editor1-last = Maresch | editor2-first = F. | editor2-last = Rötzer | title = Renaissance der Utopie }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that effective [[collective intelligence]] requires [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] of opinion, [[decentralization]] and individual independence, as demonstrated by [[James Surowiecki]] in his book [[The Wisdom of Crowds]]. Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Global news flow''' (also referred to as '''international news flow''') is a field of study that deals with the news coverage of events in foreign countries. It describes and explains the flow of news from one country to another.&lt;ref name="segev"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/31394|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|last=Segev|first=Elad|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2016|isbn=9781433129841|location=New York|page=139-153|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on global news flow typically attempt to understand why certain countries are more newsworthy than others..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kariel|first1=Herbert G.|last2=Rosenvall|first2=Lynn A.|title=Factors influencing international news flow|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=1984|volume=61|issue=3|page=509-516|doi=10.1177/107769908406100305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K., &amp; Barnett, G. A. (1996). The determinants of international news flow a network analysis. Communication Research, 23(3), 323-352.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the years it has been found that the economic power of countries plays a particularly crucial role in their news prominence&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segev|first1=Elad|last2=Blondheim|first2=Menahem|title=America's global standing according to popular news sites from around the world|journal=Political Communication|date=2013|volume=30|issue=1|page=139-161|doi=10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the presence of international news agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, H. D. (2000). Systemic determinants of international news coverage: A comparison of 38 countries. Journal of Communication, 50(2), 110-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the US has been found to be very prominent in news mentions around the world (18%), followed by China, Western European and Middle Eastern countries (about 3-5% each).&lt;ref name="segev" /&gt;

The unequal representation of the world and the under-representation of [[developing countries]] have been already of a great concern at least since the 1950s, since they influence the way people perceive the world and the image of countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (1954). How Nations See Each Other? Paris: UNESCO Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was later addressed in the [[MacBride report]], and his set of recommendations for a [[New World Information and Communication Order]]. The unequal representation of the world has been also linked to the [[World System Theory]], and the unequal economic structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, T. K. (1998). All Countries Not Created Equal to Be News World System and International Communication. Communication research, 25(5), 528-563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent empirical studies&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=Visible and invisible countries: News flow theory revised|journal=Journalism|date=2015|volume=16|issue=3|page=412-428|doi=10.1177/1464884914521579|url=http://jou.sagepub.com/content/16/3/412|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that among online news websites and [[news aggregators]] the unequal representation of the world has been perpetuated and even further intensified. Economically powerful countries, as well as their opponent countries (mainly in the Middle East and Asia) get the most news coverage around the world.

'''Helsinki Challenge''' is a science-based competition and idea accelerator which brings together the academic community and society at large to solve the world’s grand challenges in cooperation. The competition goal is not only to create new scientific information, but to influence society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/blog/prepare-for-the-unexpected |title=Prepare for the unexpected - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2015-02-11 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/qa |title=Questions &amp; Answers - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary teams consisting of experts from the academic and artistic communities, the business world, the public and third sectors, media and other actors of the society are welcome to take part in the competition. Participating teams are evaluated by the jury using the following criteria: originality, creativity, impact, focus on solutions and use of science-based methods. The competition prize is 375,000 euros and it is meant for the implementation of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/how-to-participate |title=How to participate? - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626135757/http://challenge.helsinki.fi/how-to-participate |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/qa |title=Questions &amp; Answers - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helsinki Challenge was held for the first time in 2015. In 2017, the competition is organised by the [[University of Helsinki]] in collaboration with [[Aalto University]], [[Hanken School of Economics]], [[University of Eastern Finland]], [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[University of Oulu]], [[University of the Arts Helsinki]], [[University of Turku]], [[University of Vaasa]] and [[Åbo Akademi University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://challenge.helsinki.fi/articles/helsinki-challenge-to-return-bigger-and-better&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helsinki Challenge 2014–2015==

The first ever Helsinki Challenge was organised by the University of Helsinki and celebrated the University’s 375th anniversary in 2015. The first Helsinki Challenge competition themes were: environmental change, health and wellbeing, future learning, global Helsinki and new world view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/about |title=About - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626134954/http://challenge.helsinki.fi/about |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semifinal 2014–2015===
Out of 80 proposals, a list of 20 semifinalists were announced in December 2014. Teams’ competition ideas ranged from developing tools to analyze [[big data]] on the Finnish discussion forum [[Suomi24]] to studying our expectations of robot morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1417410726435 |title=Tiederyhmä selvittää syyllisyyttä robottien tekemissä virheissä - Tiede - Kotimaa - Helsingin Sanomat |publisher=Hs.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mika Pantzar |url=http://wau.fi/artikkelit/big-dataa-riittaa-mutta-riittaako-suomessa-kykya-hyodyntaa-sita |title=Big dataa riittää, mutta riittääkö Suomessa kykyä hyödyntää sitä? |publisher=Wau.fi |date=2015-05-29 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final 2014–2015===

In October 2015, the five finalist teams were chosen:  Moralities of Intelligent Machines, Biodiversity Now, Helsinki Sleep Factory, SafePreg – Health into Next Generation and NEMO - Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction.  The jury for the final included Chancellor Thomas Wilhelmsson (chair), Pro-Vice Chancellor of Education [[Sally Mapstone]] from the [[University of Oxford]], Professor of Practice Pasi Sahlberg from [[Harvard University]]’s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]], Director Ulrich Weinberg from the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] School of Design Thinking and President Mikko Kosonen of the Finnish Innovation Fund [[SITRA]].

====Winner teams====

The €375,000 prize for the science-based idea competition Helsinki Challenge was divided between two teams. The winner was NEMO – Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction, which received €250,000, while the runner-up, Biodiversity Now, received €125,000.The prize money is intended for realising the team’s idea.

NEMO is developing new ways to digitise and transmit emotion online.The team is planning small add-ons for digital interaction platforms that would consider emotions.This way participants in online discussions could see or even experience the emotions of others in a new way that would be equivalent to natural interaction.The team wants to create an open protocol for emotion transmission for any coder to use for building new empathy-enabling applications.

Biodiversity Now team wants to establish a Finnish habitat bank so that, for example, companies reducing biodiversity through a construction project could offset this by increasing biodiversity elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sttinfo.fi/tiedote/the-internet-of-empathy-receives-the-helsinki-challenge-prize-of-250000?publisherId=1807796&amp;releaseId=36507619&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Stephens Salt''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɔː|l|t|,_|s|ɒ|l|t}}; 20 September 1851 – 19 April 1939) was an English writer and campaigner for social reform in the fields of prisons, schools, economic institutions, and the treatment of animals. He was a noted ethical [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]], anti-[[vivisection]]ist, [[socialist]], and [[pacifist]], and was well known as a literary critic, biographer, classical scholar and [[natural history|naturalist]]. It was Salt who first introduced [[Mohandas Gandhi]] to the influential works of [[Henry David Thoreau]], and influenced Gandhi's study of vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;"My faith in vegetarianism grew on me from day to day. Salt's book ''Plea for Vegetarianism'' whetted my appetite for dietetic studies. I went in for all books available on vegetarianism and read them". Mohandas Gandhi, ''[[An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]'', Part I, chapter XV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashe, Geoffrey. Gandhi, a Biography. New York: Cooper Square Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Salt is credited with being the first writer to argue explicitly in favour of [[animal rights]], in his ''[[Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress]]'' (1894), rather than focusing on improvements to [[animal welfare]]. He wrote: "If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a 'great gulf' fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood."&lt;ref name=Salt1/&gt;

==Early life and career==
The son of a British army colonel, Salt was born in [[Naini Tal]] in India in 1851, but returned with his family to England in 1852 while still an infant. He studied at [[Eton College]], and graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1875.&lt;ref name=bit&gt;H. F. Oxbury, ‘Salt, Henry Shakespear Stephens (1851–1939)’, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37932, accessed 15 Aug 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Cambridge, Salt returned to Eton as an assistant schoolmaster to teach classics. Four years later, in 1879, he married the scholar Catherine (Kate)Leigh Joynes, the daughter of a fellow master at Eton.&lt;ref name=bit/&gt; He remained at Eton until 1884, when, inspired by classic ideals and disgusted by his fellow masters' meat-eating habits and reliance on servants, he and Kate moved to a small cottage at Tilford, Surrey where they grew their own vegetables and lived very simply, sustained by a small pension Salt had built up. Salt engrossed himself in writing and began work on the pioneering Humanitarian League.

==Activism==

===Writing and influence===
During his lifetime Salt wrote almost 40 books.&lt;ref name="henrysalt.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.henrysalt.co.uk/biography.htm ''Henry S. Salt - Biography by Simon Wild''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305211751/http://www.henrysalt.co.uk/biography.htm |date=5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first, ''A Plea for Vegetarianism'' (1886) was published by the [[Vegetarian Society]], and in 1890, he produced an acclaimed biography of philosopher [[Henry David Thoreau]], two interests that later led to a friendship with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. He also wrote, in ''On Cambrian and Cumbrian Hills'' (1922), about the need for [[nature conservation]] to protect the natural beauty of the British countryside from commercial vandalism.

His circle of friends included many notable figures from late-19th and early-20th century literary and political life, including writers [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Havelock Ellis]], Count [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[William Morris]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Ouida]], George Bernard Shaw and [[Robert Cunninghame-Graham]], as well as Labour leader James [[Keir Hardie]] and [[Fabian Society]] co-founders [[Hubert Bland]] and [[Annie Besant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Winsten|Winsten, Stephen]], ''Salt and His Circle'', 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarian League===
Salt formed the [[Humanitarian League]] in 1891. Its objectives included the banning of hunting as a sport (in this respect it can be regarded as a fore-runner of the [[League Against Cruel Sports]]).  In 1914 The League published a whole volume of essays on ''Killing for Sport'', the preface was written by [[George Bernard Shaw]].  The book formed in summary form the Humanitarian League's arraignment of blood-sports.&lt;ref name="henrysalt.co.uk"/&gt;

===Animal rights===
Keith Tester writes that, in 1894, Salt created an "[[Epistemology|epistemological]] break," by being the first writer to consider the issue of animal rights explicitly, as opposed to better animal welfare.&lt;ref name=TaylorTester&gt;Tester, Keith (1991) cited in Taylor, Angus. ''Animals and Ethics''. Broadview Press, 2003, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress]]'', Salt wrote that he wanted to "set the principle of animals' rights on a consistent and intelligible footing, [and] to show that this principle underlies the various efforts of humanitarian reformers ...":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even the leading advocates of animal rights seem to have shrunk from basing their claim on the only argument which can ultimately be held to be a really sufficient one&amp;mdash;the assertion that animals, as well as men, though, of course, to a far less extent than men, are possessed of a distinctive individuality, and, therefore, are in justice entitled to live their lives with a due measure of that 'restricted freedom' to which Herbert Spencer alludes.&lt;ref name=Salt1&gt;Salt, Henry S. ''[http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/salt01.htm Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress]'', Macmillan &amp; Co., 1894, chapter 1. He cited Spencer's definition of rights: "Every man is free to do that which he wills, provided he infringes not the equal liberty of any other man ... Whoever admits that each man must have a certain restricted freedom, asserts that it is right he should have this restricted freedom.... And hence the several particular freedoms deducible may fitly be called, as they commonly are called, his rights."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He wrote that there is no point in claiming rights for animals if we subordinate their rights to human interests, and he argued against the presumption that a human life necessarily has more value than a nonhuman one:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] notion of the life of an animal having 'no moral purpose,' belongs to a class of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the advanced humanitarian thought of the present day&amp;mdash;it is a purely arbitrary assumption, at variance with our best instincts, at variance with our best science, and absolutely fatal (if the subject be clearly thought out) to any full realization of animals' rights. If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a 'great gulf' fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood."&lt;ref name=Salt1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, it involves digital data being transformed into physical letter items at distributed print centres located as close as possible to the final delivery addresses. An '''e-mail letter''' (also '''L-mail''' and '''letter mail''') is a [[letter (message)|letter]] which sent as an [[email]] using a computer then printed out and delivered as a traditional (physical) letter. It is a communication means between the [[Virtuality|virtual]] [[Internet-related prefixes|cyber]]- and the material real world. The [[printer (publisher)|printer]] or [[mail transfer agent]] prints the [[electronic mail]] on paper, the [[mail transport agent]] packs it into an [[envelope]] and the [[mail delivery agent]] or [[postman]] delivers it to the receiver's mailbox. Generally there is a [[fee]] for this service; however very small amounts and single email letters may be free of charge depending on the [[service provider]] and generally fees are much lower than directly sending mail or using a franking machine.

There are also reverse systems, where handwritten letters can be delivered as email. This mail scanning service, sometimes called '''letter email''', is increasingly popular with businesses and individuals who wish to access their mail from another country. However, special care must be taken to inspect local laws and the service provider's scanning practices to ensure that they are not reading the mail or acting on behalf of the client from a legal standpoint.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53654">'''Inoculation theory''' was developed by [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] [[William J. McGuire]] in 1961 to explain how [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[beliefs]] change, and more importantly, how to keep existing attitudes and beliefs consistent in the face of attempts to change them. Inoculation theory functions as a [[strategy]] to protect attitudes from change–to confer [[Psychological resistance|resistance]] to counter-[[Attitude (psychology)|attitudinal]] influences, whether such influences take the form of direct attacks or sustained pressures.

The [[theory]] posits that weak [[Counterargument|counterarguments]]–arguments that are easily refuted–generate resistance within the receiver, enabling them to maintain their beliefs in the face of a future, stronger, attack. Following exposure to weak counterarguments, the inoculation receiver will then seek out supporting information to further strengthen their threatened position. Finally, the held attitude or belief becomes resistant to a stronger attack, hence the medical analogy of a [[vaccine]].

==About==

Inoculation is a [[theory]] developed to strengthen existing attitudes and beliefs while building resistance to future counterarguments. For inoculation to be successful it is crucial that a threat (motivation for resistance) is imposed upon these existing ideas and refutational preemption (ability to build defenses against potential counterarguments) takes place after the inoculation. The argument that is presented through inoculation must be strong enough to initiate motivation to maintain current attitudes and beliefs, but weak enough that the receiver will refute the [[counterargument]] (Compton, 2013; McGuire, 1964). Inoculation has been proven successful through trials and research. This article highlights vital aspects of inoculation theory, however, it is not exhaustive–there is a large volume of quality research on the theory not mentioned. Finally, while numerous studies have tested and verified the efficacy of the inoculation process, there continues to be a need for refinement and elaboration.

Inoculation theory is used today as part of the suite of tools used by those engaged in shaping or manipulating [[public opinion]]. These contexts include: [[politics]] (e.g., Pfau et al., 1990; see Compton &amp; Ivanov, 2013, for a review), [[health campaign]]s (e.g., Pfau &amp; VanBockern, 1994; see Compton, Jackson, &amp; Dimmock, 2016, for a review), [[marketing]] (e.g., Compton &amp; Pfau, 2004) and [[education]] (Compton, 2011), among others. (See Banas &amp; Rains, 2010, for a [[meta-analysis]], and Compton, 2013, for a narrative overview.)

The inoculation process is analogous to the medical [[inoculation]] process from which it draws its name; the [[analogy]] served as the inaugural exemplar for how inoculation confers resistance. As McGuire (1961) initially explained, medical inoculation works by exposing the body to a weakened form of a virus—strong enough to trigger a response (i.e., the production of [[antibodies]]), but not so strong as to overwhelm the body's resistance. Attitudinal inoculation works the same way: Expose the receiver to weakened counterarguments, triggering a process of counterargument which confers resistance to later, stronger persuasive messages. This process works like a metaphorical vaccination: the receiver becomes immune to attacking messages that attempt to change their attitudes or beliefs regarding the initial threat. Inoculation theory suggests that if one sends out messages with weak counterarguments, an individual can build immunity to those messages and strengthen their original attitudes. It uses a threat on initial beliefs to trigger a person's desire to fight against the threat, ultimately reinforcing their attitude.

==History==
William McGuire set out to conduct research “on ways of inducing resistance to persuasion, under the impression that while much experimental work was being done on factors that increased persuasive effectiveness, little was being done on ways of producing resistance to persuasion” (McGuire, 1964, p. 192). McGuire was motivated to study inoculation and persuasion as a result of the [[aftermath of the Korean War]]. Nine US [[prisoners of war]], when given the opportunity, elected to remain with their captors. Many assumed they were [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]], so McGuire and other [[social scientists]] turned to ways of conferring resistance to persuasion (Dewey, 2017). This was a change in [[wikt:extant|extant]] persuasion research, which was almost exclusively concerned with how to make messages more [[persuasive]], and not the other way around (Gass &amp; Seiter, 2003). 

The theory of inoculation was derived from previous research studying one-sided and two-sided messages. One-sided messages are supportive messages to strengthen existing attitudes, but with no mention of counterpositions. One-sided messages are frequently seen in [[political campaign]]s when a [[candidate]] denigrates his or her opponent through "[[Negative campaigning|mudslinging]]". This method is effective in reinforcing [[wikt:extant|extant]] attitudes of derision toward the opposition and support for the "mudslinging" candidate. If the audience supports the opposition, however, the attack message is ineffective. Two-sided messages present both counterarguments and [[refutations]] of those counterarguments. To gain [[compliance (psychology)|compliance]] and [[source credibility]], a two-sided message must demonstrate the sender's position, then the opposition's position, followed by a refutation of the opposition's argument, then finally the sender's position again (Lumsdaine &amp; Janis, 1953).

Since its creation, the uses of inoculation theory have been expanded in the areas of health, political, educational and commercial messaging. When McGuire (1966a) created this theory, it was applied to social [[cliché]]s. This meant it was primarily used toward the attitudes that were rarely, if ever attacked by opposing forces. The early tests of inoculation theory were used on non-controversial issues, (e.g. brushing your teeth is good for you). Few refute that brushing one's teeth is a good habit, therefore external opposing arguments against tooth brushing would not change one's opinion, but it would strengthen support for brushing one's teeth (Banas &amp; Rains, 2010). Inoculation theory studies currently target less popular or common attitudes, such as whether one should buy a [[Apple Mac|Mac]] or a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[Personal computer|PC]] [[computer]] or if one should support [[gay marriage]].  Implementing inoculation theory in studies of contemporary social issues (from [[mundane]] to [[controversial]] [[social issues]]), the variety and resurgence of studies using inoculation theory helps bolster the effectiveness and [[utility]] of the theory and provides support that it can be used to strengthen and/or predict attitudes.

McGuire led a series of experiments assessing inoculation's [[efficacy]] and adding nuance to our understanding for how it works (for a review, see Compton, 2013; Compton &amp; Pfau, 2005). Early studies (e.g., McGuire &amp; Papageorgis, 1961) limited testing of inoculation theory to [[cultural]] truisms, or [[beliefs]] accepted without consideration (e.g., people should brush their teeth daily). Later development of the theory extended inoculation to more [[controversial]] and contested topics in the contexts of politics (see Compton &amp; Ivanov, 2013), health (see Compton, Jackson, &amp; Dimmock, 2015), marketing, and contexts in which people have different pre-existing attitudes, such as climate change.&lt;ref name=inoculation2&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/gch2.201600008 |title=Inoculating the Public against Misinformation about Climate Change |journal=Global Challenges |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=1600008 |year=2017 |last1=van der Linden |first1=Sander |last2=Leiserowitz |first2=Anthony |last3=Rosenthal |first3=Seth |last4=Maibach |first4=Edward }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has also been applied in education to help prevent substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drchrustowski.com/TheSocialPsychologyofAdolescentSubstanceAbuse.pdf|title=The Social Psychology of Adolescent Substance Abuse|format=PPT|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325034118/http://www.drchrustowski.com/TheSocialPsychologyofAdolescentSubstanceAbuse.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, more recent research has examined inoculation's effects on targets besides attitudes, including task self-efficacy (Jackson, Compton, Whiddett, Anthony, &amp; Dimmock, 2015). Other work has confirmed that inoculation's efficacy can be boosted with other persuasion processes, like reactance (Miller et al., 2013).

==Explanation==
Inoculation theory states that to prevent persuasion it is necessary to strengthen preexisting attitudes, beliefs, or opinions. First, the receiver must be made aware of the potential vulnerability of an existing position (e.g., attitude, belief). This establishes threat and initiates defenses to future attacks. The idea is that when a weak argument is presented in the inoculation message, processes of refutation or other means of protection will prepare for stronger arguments later. It is critical that the attack is strong enough to keep the receiver defensive, but weak enough to not actually change those preexisting ideas. This will hopefully make the receiver actively defensive and allow them to create arguments in favor of their preexisting thoughts. The more active the receiver becomes in his or her defense the more it will strengthen their own attitudes, beliefs, or opinions (McGuire, 1964).

===Key components===
There are four basic key components to successful inoculation: threat, [[refutational preemption]], delay, and involvement. The first is threat, which provides motivation to protect one's attitudes or beliefs (Pfau, 1997a). Threat is a product of the presence of counterarguments in an inoculation message and/or an explicit forewarning of an impending challenge to an existing belief (see Compton &amp; Ivanov, 2012). The message receiver must interpret that a message is threatening and recognize that there is a reason to fight to maintain and strengthen their opinion. If the receiver of an opposing message does not recognize that a threat is present, they will not feel the need to start defending their position and therefore will not change their attitude or strengthen their opinion (Banas &amp; Rains, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;285). Compton and Ivanov (2012) found that participants who had been forewarned of an attack–i.e. threat–but not given the appropriate tools to combat the attack were more resistant than the control group. In this case, the simple act of forewarning of an attack was enough to resist the counterattitudinal persuasion.

The second component, refutational preemption, is the [[cognitive]] part of the process. It is the ability to activate one's own argument for future defense and strengthen their existing attitudes through counterarguing (Pfau, 1997). Scholars have also explored whether other resistance processes might be at work, including affect. Refutational preemption provides specific content that receivers can employ to strengthen attitudes against subsequent change. This aids in the inoculation process by giving the message receiver a chance to argue with the opposing message. It shows the message receiver that their attitude is not the only attitude or even the right attitude, creating a threat to their beliefs. This is beneficial because the receiver will get practice in defending their original attitude, therefore strengthening it. This is important in fighting off future threats of opposing messages and helps to ensure that the message will not affect their original stance on the issues (Banas &amp; Rains, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;285). Refutational preemption acts as the weak [[strain (biology)|strain]] of the virus in the metaphor. By injecting the weakened virus–the opposing opinion–into a receiver, this prompts the receiver to strengthen their position, enabling them to fight off the opposing threat. By the time the body processes the virus–the counterattack–the receiver will have learned how to eliminate the threat. In the case of messaging, if the threatening message is weak or unconvincing, a person can reject the message and stick with their original stance on the matter. By being able to reject threatening messages a person builds strength of their belief and every successful threatening message that they can encounter their original opinions only get stronger (Banas &amp; Rains, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;285). Recent research has studied the presence and function of word-of-mouth communication, or post-inoculation talk (see Compton &amp; Pfau, 2009), following exposure to inoculation messages (e.g., Ivanov et al., 2015).

Delay is the next element that is necessary in the inoculation process. There has been much debate on whether there is a certain amount of time necessary between inoculation and further attacks on a persons' attitude that will be most effective in strengthening that person's attitude. McGuire (1961) suggested that delay was necessary strengthening a person's attitude and since then many scholars have found evidence to back that idea up. There are also scholars on the other side who suggest that too much of a delay lessens the strengthening effect of inoculation. With this being said, it has been revealed that the effect of inoculation can still be significant weeks or even months after initial introduction or the treatment showing that it does produce somewhat long-lasting effects (Banas &amp; Rains, 2010).

Involvement is the final element of the inoculation process. Pfau, et al. (1997a) defined involvement as "the importance or salience of an attitude object for a receiver" and is “among the most important and widely employed concepts in the scholarly literature on persuasion” (p. 190). Involvement is critical; an individual's involvement with an issue determines how effective the inoculation process will be, if at all. If an individual does not have a vested interest in the subject, they will not perceive a threat and, consequently, will not feel the need to defend and strengthen their original opinion, rendering the inoculation process ineffective.

===Applications===
Research during the past two decades has revealed numerous real-world applications of inoculation theory. The field of Public Relations is the perfect place for the inoculation theory to be used because the field itself is meant to act to the public, their opinions, and their actions. It is especially useful with an audience who already has an opinion on a brand. Inoculation theory is the perfect way to convince already faithful customers that they are making the right choice in trusting your company and to keep the customer coming back in the future. For example, Apple and their "[[Get A Mac]]" campaign. This campaign did a great job of following the inoculation theory in targeting those who already preferred Mac computers. The series of ads pit out in the duration of the campaign had a similar theme; they directly compared Macs and PCs. Inoculation theory applies here as these commercials are more than likely aimed toward Apple users. These ads are effective because the Apple users already prefer Mac computers and they unlikely to change their minds. This comparison creates refutational preemption, showing Macs may not be the only viable options on the market. The TV ads throw in a few of the positive advantages that PCs have over Macs, but by the end of every commercial they reiterate the fact that the Mac is ultimately the superior product for consumers. This reassures viewers that their opinion is still right and that Macs are in fact better than PCs. The inoculation theory in these ads keep Mac users coming back for Apple products and may even have them coming back sooner for the bigger and better products that Apple is releasing. That last part is especially important in a field like technology because it is continually changing and something new is always being pushed out onto the shelves.

An example of inoculation theory usage in politics are present in studies indicating that it is possible to inoculate political supporters of a candidate in a campaign against the influence of an opponent's attack ads (Pfau &amp; Burgoon, 1988); citizens against the corrosive influence of soft-money-sponsored political attack ads on democratic values (Pfau, M., Park, D., Holbert, R. L., &amp; Cho, J., 2001); citizens of fledgling democracies against the spiral of silence which can thwart the expression of minority views (Lin, W. K., &amp; Pfau, M., 2007); commercial brands against the influence of competitors' comparative ads (Pfau, 1992a); corporations against the damage to credibility and image that can occur in crisis settings (Dawar, N., &amp; Pillutla, M. M., 2000); and young adolescents against influences of peer pressure, which can lead to smoking, underage drinking, and other harmful behaviors (Godbold, L. C., &amp; Pfau, M., 2000).

===Refutational same and refutational different===
While there are many studies that have been conducted comparing different treatments of inoculation, there is one specific comparison that is mentioned throughout various studies. This is the comparison between what is known as refutational same and refutational different messages. A refutational same message is an inoculation treatment that refutes specific potential counterarguments that will appear in the subsequent persuasion message, while refutational different treatments are refutations that are not the same as those present in the impending persuasive message  (Pfau et al., 1990). Pfau and his colleagues (1990) developed a study during the [[United States presidential election|1988 United States presidential election]]. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] were claiming that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate was known to be lenient when it came to the issue of crime. The researchers developed a refutational same message that stated that while the Democratic candidate was in favor of tough sentences, merely tough sentences could not reduce crime. The refutational different message expanded on the candidate's platform and his immediate goals if he were to be elected. The study showed comparable results between the two different treatments. Importantly, as McGuire and others had found previously, inoculation was able to confer resistance to arguments that were not specifically mentioned in the inoculation message.

==Relevant research==

===Political campaigning===
Compton and Ivanov (2013) offer a comprehensive review of political inoculation scholarship and outline new directions for future work.

Sample studies include:

Pfau and some of his colleagues examined inoculation through the use of direct mail during the 1988 presidential campaign.  The researchers were specifically interested in comparing inoculation and post hoc refutation. Post hoc refutation is another form of building resistance to arguments, however, instead of building resistance prior to future arguments, like inoculation, it attempts to restore original beliefs and attitudes after the counterarguments have been made. Results of the research reinforced prior conclusions that refutational same and different treatments both increase resistance to attacks. More important, results also indicated inoculation was superior to post hoc refutation when attempting to protect original beliefs and attitudes (Pfau et al., 1990).

===Health===
Much of the research conducted in health is attempting to create campaigns that will encourage people to stop unhealthy behaviors (e.g. getting people to stop smoking or prevention of teen alcoholism). Compton, Jackson and Dimmock (2016) reviewed studies where inoculation theory was applied to health-related messaging. There are many inoculation studies with the intent to inoculate children and teenagers to prevent them from smoking, doing drugs or drinking alcohol. Much of the research shows that targeting at a young age can help them resist peer pressure in high school or college.

Godbold and Pfau (2000) used sixth graders from two different schools and applied inoculation theory as a defense against peer pressure to drinking alcohol. They hypothesized that a normative message, a message tailored around what the social norms are, would be more effective than an informative message. An informative message is a message tailored around giving individuals information pieces. In this case, the information was why drinking alcohol is bad.  The second hypothesis was that subjects who receive a threat two weeks later will be more resistant than those receiving an immediate attack. The results supported the first hypothesis partially. The normative message created higher resistance from the attack, but was not necessarily more effective. The second hypothesis was also not supported; therefore, the time lapse did not create further resistance for teenagers against drinking. One major outcome from this study was the resistance created by utilizing a normative message.

In another study conducted by Duryea (1983), the results were far more supportive of the theory. The study also attempted to find the message to use for educational training to help prevent teen drinking and driving. The teen subjects were given resources to combat attempts to persuade them to drink and drive or to get into a vehicle with a drunk driver. The subjects were: 1) shown a film; 2) participated in question and answer; 3) role playing exercises; and 4) a slide show. The results showed that a combination of the four methods of training was effective in combating persuasion to drink and drive or get into a vehicle with a drunk driver. The trained group was far more prepared to combat the persuasive arguments.

Additionally, Parker, Ivanov, and Compton (2012) found that inoculation messages can be an effective deterrent against pressures to engage in unprotected sex and binge drinking—even when only one of these issues is mentioned in the health message.

Another study by Pfau, et al. (1992) examined the role of inoculation when attempting to prevent adolescents from smoking. One of the main goals of the study was to examine longevity and persistence of inoculation. They took a group of elementary school students in [[South Dakota]] and had the students watch a video warning them of future pressures to smoke. In the first year, resistance was highest among those with low [[self-esteem]] (Pfau et al., 1992). At the end of the second year, students in the group showed more attitudinal resistance to smoking than they did previously (Pfau &amp; Van Bockern 1994). Importantly, the study and its follow-up demonstrate the long-lasting effects of inoculation treatments.

Other recent areas of study include vaccination safety. Wong and Harrison (2014) studied 212 female students and their attitudes about the HPV vaccine. They found that inoculation messages about HPV helped build resistance to messages that attacked the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine. Additionally, Compton, Jackson and Dimmock (2016) discussed possibilities of further research. One topic was on the preparation of possible health concerns that new parents may not be expecting. For example, benefits of breastfeeding, sleep deprivation and post-partum depression.

One area that has been heavily researched since the development of the theory is the prevention of smoking. These studies have mainly focused on preventing youth smokers–inoculation seems to be most effective in young children. Grover (2011) researched the effectiveness of the [[Truth (anti-tobacco campaign)|"truth" anti-smoking campaign]] on smokers and non-smokers. Grover divided the two groups to show that inoculation works differently when the behavior is already being exercised versus the behavior being non-existent. In the first hypothesis Grover predicted that exposure to the "truth" ads would result in negative attitudes towards smoking after being exposed to pro-smoking advertisements. That hypothesis was supported by the data. In the second hypothesis, exposure to "truth" ads results in increased aversion to tobacco industry retail products, the results showed the contrary. Exposure to "truth" ads reduces aversion to tobacco branded products. The other observation made here was that the greater the exposure to pro-smoking ads, the higher the aversion to tobacco retail products. This observation contradicts hypothesis H2c and hypothesis H3. In H3, the prediction was that the aversion towards tobacco industry retail products would dictate the exposure to "truth" ads and attitudes towards tobacco companies. This data was taken from a combined sample of both smokers and non-smokers. When Grover split the data between the two groups all the original hypotheses were supported, except H2c. Those results mirrored the results of the pooled data. What Grover demonstrated was that the initial attitude plays a major role in the ability to inoculate an individual.
 
Future studies in the area of health can be extremely beneficial to communities. Some areas that are currently being researched can possibly help with present-day issues (e.g., inoculation-based strategies for addiction intervention to assist sober individuals from relapsing). Other areas for future studies include, promoting healthy eating habits, exercising, breastfeeding and creating positive attitude towards mammograms (Ivanov, 2017). An area that has been underdeveloped is mental health awareness. With the number of young adults and teens committing suicide due to bullying this can be an area where inoculation messages could be effective. McGuire (1961) used a medical analogy to initially describe his theory. Unsurprisingly, inoculation strategies can be most effective when combined with health issues.

===Marketing===
Inoculation theory research, as applied to advertising and marketing, are primarily focused on promoting healthy lifestyles with the help of a product or for a specific company's goal.

Shortly after McGuire published his development on inoculation theory, Szybillo and Heslin (1973) applied the concepts that McGuire used in the health industry to advertising and marketing campaigns. They sought to provide answers for advertisers marketing a controversial product or topic: if an advertiser knew the product or campaign would cause an attack, what would be the best advertising strategy? Would they want to refute the arguments or reaffirm their claims? (Szybill and Heslin, 1973)

Szybillo and Heslin (1973) sought to test five hypotheses: 1) to reaffirm or refute the arguments is better than not addressing, 2) refuting the same counterarguments will be more effective than supportive defense, 3) refutational defense is better than supportive defense, 4) over a long period, refutational defense is more effective than supportive defenses, and 5) high credibility sources are more effective than low credibility. The controversial topic in the study was: "Inflatable air bags should be installed as passive safety devices in all new cars."

Szybillo and Heslin (1973) tested four advertisement strategies: defense, refutational-same, refutational-different and supportive. They also manipulated the time of the counterargument attack. Some subjects received the attack message 30 minutes after and the other group three days later. The results confirmed the first hypothesis that a reaffirmation or refutation approach is better than not addressing the attack. The second hypothesis was also confirmed with the data that refuting the counterargument is more effective than supportive defense. The third hypothesis was confirmed as well, though the mean for refutational-different posttreatment was not much greater than for supportive posttreatment. In this study the time lapse was not significantly impactful nor was the credibility of the source. Thus, hypothesis four and five were not supported.

In 2006, a jury awarded Martin Dunson and Lisa Jones, the parents of one-year-old Marquis Matthew Dunson, $5 million for the death of their son. Dunson and Jones sued [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], the makers of Infant's [[Tylenol (brand redirect)|Tylenol]] claiming that there were not enough warnings regarding the dosage of [[acetaminophen]] (Daly, 2006).

What resulted was a Johnson &amp; Johnson campaign that encouraged parents to practice proper dosage procedures (Veil and Kent, 2008). In a review of the campaign by Veil and Kent (2008), they breakdown the message of the campaign utilizing the basic concepts of inoculation theory. They theorize that Johnson &amp; Johnson used inoculation to alter the negative [[perception]] of their product. The campaign began running prior to the actual verdict, thus the timing seemed suspicious.

A primary contention made by Veil and Kent (2008) was that the intentions of Johnson &amp; Johnson were not to convey safety guidelines for consumers, but to change how the consumer might respond to further lawsuits on [[overdose]]. The inoculation strategy used by Johnson &amp; Johnson, per Veil and Kent, is evident in their campaign script: "Some people think if you have a really bad headache, you should take extra medicine." The authors state the term "some people" is referring to the party suing the company. The commercial also used the Vice President of Sales for Tylenol to deliver a message, who may be considered a [[Source credibility|credible source]].

In 1995, Burgoon et al. published empirical findings on issue/advocacy advertising campaigns like the one Johnson &amp; Johnson executed. Most, if not all, of these types of advertising campaigns utilize inoculation to create the messages. Burgoon et al. (1995) posited that the use of inoculation strategies for these types of campaigns should be utilized to enhance the corporations' credibility and aide in maintaining the existing consumer attitude. This strategy should not be used to change consumer attitudes. Based on the analysis of previous research Burgoon et al. concluded issue/advocacy advertising is most effective for reinforcing support and avoid potential slippage in the attitudes of supporters. 
Based on previous publications they looked to test three hypotheses. The first was that issue/advocacy advertisements work to inoculate against counterattitudinal attacks. Next, issue/advocacy advertisements work to protect the source credibility. Lastly, [[conservatives]] are more likely to be inoculated by issue/advocacy messages. They use [[Mobil Oil]]'s issue/advocacy campaign to test the hypotheses.

The first hypothesis was supported by the data. There was a significant effect provided by inoculation.  Additionally, H1 showed that issue/advocacy inoculation messages and attack messages vary in effectiveness depending on the content. The result was also noted in the results of H2, which were also supported by the results. Finally, the results indicated that political views play a role in the effectiveness of the campaigns. Thus, confirming H3, that conservatives are easier to inoculate. They also posed a research question regarding the impact of [[gender]] on inoculation effectiveness in issue/advocacy campaigns. The conclusion was made that females are more likely to be inoculated with these types of campaigns. An additional observation made by Burgoon et. al (1995) was that the type of content used in these campaigns contributed to the campaigns success. The further the advertisement was from "direct self-benefit" the greater the inoculation effect was on the audience (Burgoon, et al., 1995).

It took quite some time for inoculation theory to be applied to marketing, because of the many limitations (Lessne and Didow, 1987). Lessne and Didow (1987) reviewed publications about inoculation application to marketing campaigns. They note that, at the time, the closest to true marketing context was Hunt's 1973 study on the Chevron campaign.

The [[Federal Trade Commission]] made a statement that Chevron had deceived consumers on the effectiveness of their gas additive F-310. The FTC was going to conduct a corrective advertising campaign to disclose the information. In response to that, Chevron ran a print campaign to try and combat the anticipated FTC campaign. The double page advertisement read, "If every motorist used Chevron with F-310 for 2000 miles, air pollutants would be reduced by thousands of tons in a single day. The Federal Trade Commission doesn't think that's significant." Hunt used this real-life message as an inoculation treatment in his research (Lessne and Didow, 1987).

He used the corrective campaign by the FTC as the attack on the positive attitude toward Chevron. The results indicated that a supportive treatment offered less resistance than a refutational treatment. The other discovery was that when an inoculative treatment is received, but no attack is followed there is a drop in attitude. One of the major limitations in this study was that Hunt did not allow a time elapse between the treatment and the attack. Which is a major element from McGuire's original theory (McGuire, 1961). Since this publication, there has been more research conducted in marketing and advertising as well. The future applications in marketing are far more promising than they were in 1987.

Other more recent studies include:

# Compton and Pfau (2004) extended inoculation theory into the realm of credit card marketing targeting college students. They wondered if inoculation could help protect college students against dangerous levels of [[credit card debt]] and/or help convince them to increase their efforts to pay down any existing [[debt]]. The results were encouraging: Inoculation seemed to protect students' healthy attitudes about debt and some of their behavioral intentions. Further, Compton and Pfau found some evidence that those who received the inoculation treatment were more likely to talk to their friends and family about issues of credit card debt.
# Ivanov, Parker, and Compton (2011) proposed inoculation as a means for helping [[consumers]] work through [[Buyer's remorse|post-purchase dissonance]].

===Cyber security===
Treglia and Delia (2017) apply inoculation theory to [[cyber security]]; people are susceptible to electronic or physical tricks, scams or misrepresentations that may lead to deviating from security procedures and practices, opening the operator, organization or system to exploits, malware, theft of data or disruption of systems and services. Inoculation in this area improves peoples resistance to such attacks, examples and directions for future work are provided.

===Psychological reactance===
Recent studies have approached inoculation by incorporating [[Reactance theory|psychological reactance theory]] (Brehm, 1966, 1972; Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981) as a means to enhance resistance outcomes through inoculation theory's two key components: threat and refutational preemption.

Miller, et al. (2013) focused their study on [[Emerging adulthood and early adulthood|emerging adults]] and their reactance to persuasive appeals. Research has demonstrated that this population is in a transitional stage in life (Voyer et al., 2005) and are more likely to defend their behavioral freedoms if they feel others are attempting to control their behavior (Grandpre et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2006). Populations in transitional stages rely on source credibility as a major proponent of cognitive processing and message acceptance. If the message is [[explicit knowledge|explicit]] and threatens their perceived [[freedoms]], transitional-stage populations will most likely derogate the source and dismiss the message. Two important needs for reactance to a threatened freedom from an emerging adult population is [[Vested interest (communication theory)|immediacy and vested interest]] (Crano, 1995). Their study discusses how emerging adults need to believe their behavioral freedoms, for which they have vestedness, are being threatened and that the threat exists in real time with almost immediate consequences. Threats that their perceived freedoms will be eliminated or minimized increases motivation to restore that freedom or possibly engage in the threatened behavior to reinforce their autonomy and control of their attitudes and actions. The study also surmises that threat does not necessarily need anger to motivate counterargumentation and simply attempting to provoke anger through manipulation is limited as a technique of gauging negative cognitions. Miller, et al. (2013) also consider refutational preemption as motivation for producing initial counterarguments and provocation of [[dissension]] when contemplating the attack message (Miller et al., 2013). The main focus of this study is to determine how to improve the effectiveness of the inoculation process by evaluating and generating reactance to a threatened freedom by manipulating explicit and implicit language and its intensity. While most inoculation studies focus on avoiding reactance, or at the very least, minimizing the impact of reactance on behaviors, in contrast, Miller, et al. (2013) chose to manipulate reactance by designing messages to enhance resistance and counterarguing output.

They posit seven hypotheses in this study. H1 aims to discover if reactance-enhanced messages warning of a potential attitudinal threat negative affect and cognitions toward the attack message and its source. H2 considers if reactance-enhanced messages increase more counterarguments for the subject and a decrease in attitude change. H3 ponders if reactance-enhanced messages also result in more source derogation in terms of credibility and an increase in negative affect toward the source. These first three hypotheses consider the appraisal process of reactance. The final four hypotheses regard the impact of language and intensity as potentially more threatening (i.e. generating more resistance to the message because of increased counterattitudinal output and source derogation.

Their methods involve three phases. Phase 1 assesses the attitudes of their participants regarding four topics: "legalization of marijuana, gun control legislation, legalization of gambling, and restriction of television violence" (Miller et al., 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;135). Phase 2 presented an inoculation message relative to each participant's measured attitudes from Phase 1. The participants were divided into two groups, including the inoculation group and the control group. The questionnaire the participants received also gauged both their perceived threat and affect toward the attack messages. In Phase 3, each group was also given an attack message using either high-controlling or low-controlling language, and again, to evaluate the levels of perceived threat and affect.

The study concluded that support existed for all hypotheses. The results of their experimentation yielded the understanding that inoculation coupled with reactance-enhanced messages leads to "stronger resistance effects" (p.&amp;nbsp;148). Consistent with the medical analogy of inoculation theory, Miller, et al. (2013) liken reactance-enhanced messages to a "booster shot," increasing the success of the inoculation. Another unique feature of the study is examining low-controlling language versus high-controlling language and its impact on affect and source credibility.

Similarly, Miller, et al. (2007) utilizes psychological reactance theory (Brehm, 1966, 1972; Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981) to avoid or eliminate source derogation and message rejection. In this study, their focus is instead Brehm's concept of restoration. Some of their ideas deal with low reactance and whether it can lead to more positive outcomes and if behavioral freedoms can be restored once threatened. As discussed in Miller, et al. (2013), this study ponders whether individuals know they have the behavioral freedom that is being threatened and whether they feel they are worthy of that freedom. This idea also ties into the emerging adult population of the above study and its affirmation that individuals in transitional stages will assert their threatened behavior freedoms (Voyer et al., 2005; Grandpre et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2006; Miller et al. 2007; Miller et al., 2013).

Miller, et al. (2007) sought to determine how effective explicit and implicit language is at mitigating reactance. Particularly, restoration of freedom is a focus of this study, and gauging how concrete and abstract language informs an individual's belief that he or she has a choice. Some participants were given a persuasive appeal related to health promotion with a following postscripted message designed to remind them they have a choice as a method of restoring the participants' freedom. Using concrete language proved more effective at increasing the possibilities of message acceptance and source credibility. This study is relevant to inoculation research in that it lends credence to Miller, et al. (2013), which transparently incorporates psychological reactance theory in conjunction with inoculation theory to improve the quality of persuasive appeals in the future.

===Postinoculation talk===
Following Compton and Pfau's (2009) research on postinoculation talk, Ivanov, et al. (2012) explore how cognitive processing could lead to talk with others after receiving an inoculation message in which threat exists. The authors found that message processing leads to postinoculation talk which could potentially lead to stronger resistance to attack messages. Further, postinoculation talk acts virally, spreading inoculation through talk with others on issues that involve negative cognitions and affect. In previous research, the assumption that talk was [[subvocal]] (existing only [[Intrapersonal communication|intrapersonally]]) was prevalent, without concern for the impact of vocal talk with other individuals. Ivanov, et al. (2012) deems vocal talk important to the incubation process.

Their study concluded that individuals who receive an inoculation message that contains threat will talk to others about the message and talk more frequently than individuals who do not receive an inoculation message. Additionally, the act of postinoculation talk bolsters their attitudes and increases resistance to the message as well as increasing the likelihood that talk will generate a potentially viral effect–spreading inoculation to others through the act of vocal talk (Ivanov et al., 2012).

[[Sharia]] or sharia law is the basic Islamic [[religious law]] derived from the religious precepts of [[Islam]], particularly the [[Quran]] and the opinions and life example of [[Muhammad]] ([[Hadith]] and [[Sunnah]]) which are the primary [[sources of sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionar Definition of sharia in English|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sharia|website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"&gt;[[John Esposito|John L.

The derivation differs between the various [[Islamic schools and branches|sects of Islam]] ([[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] are the majority), and various jurisprudence schools such as [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jafari]].&lt;ref name=hmr&gt;Hisham M.

The first military rulings were formulated during the first hundred years after Muhammad [[Hijra (Islam)|established an Islamic state in Medina]]. These rulings evolved in accordance with the interpretations of the Quran (the Muslim Holy scriptures) and Hadith (the recorded traditions of Muhammad). The key themes in these rulings were the [[Justice|justness]] of war (see [[Justice in the Quran]]), and the injunction to jihad. The rulings do not cover [[feud]]s and armed conflicts in general.&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aboul-Enein|first1=H.

Some have pointed out that the current Western view of the need for a clear separation between Church and State was only [[Separation of church and state#Jefferson and the Bill of Rights|first legislated into effect]] after 18 centuries of Christianity in the Western world.&lt;ref name="church state evolution"&gt;[http://counterjihad.com/separation-church-state-west-sharia "Separation of Church and State: In the West and Under Sharia"] By Immanuel Al-Manteeqi.

Islam has never had any officially recognized tradition of [[pacifism]], and throughout its history warfare has been an integral part of the Islamic theological system.&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300198171/islamic-imperialism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lews, Bernard, Islam and the West, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Since the time of Muhammad, Islam has considered warfare to be a legitimate expression of religious faith, and has accepted its use for the defense of Islam.&lt;ref&gt; name=Zuhur&gt;Aboul-Enein, H.

While the early spread of Islam was often borne on the back of military conquest, within Christianity its early spread was often a matter of political expediency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophyandscripture.org/Issue3-1/Adams/Adams.html "Paul and the Government of the Soul"] Journal of Philosophy and Scripture.

Additionally, some notable Muslim clerics, such as [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] have developed alternative non-violent Muslim theologies. Some hold that the formal juristic definition of [[Islam and war|war in Islam]] constitutes an irrevokable and permanent link within Islam between the political and religious justifications for war.&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quranic concept of ''[[Jihad]]'' includes aspects of both a physical and an internal struggle.&lt;ref name="morgan2010"/&gt;

According to [[Jonathan Berkey]], jihad in the Quran was maybe originally intended against Muhammad's local enemies, the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pagans]] of Mecca or the [[Banu Qurayza|Jews of Medina]], but the Quranic statements supporting jihad could be redirected once new enemies appeared.&lt;ref name="Berkey2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkey|first=Jonathan Porter|authorlink=Jonathan Berkey|title=The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLV6lo4mvj0C&amp;pg=PA73|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58813-3|page=73|quote=The Koran is not a squeamish document, and exhort the believers to jihad. Verses such as "Do not follow the unbelievers, but struggle against them mightily" (25.52) and "fight [those who have been given a revelation] who do not believe in God  and the last day" (9.29) may originally have been directed against Muhammad's local enemies, the pagans of Mecca or the Jews of Medina, but could be redirected once a new set of enemies appeared.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documentation of the law of Jihad was written by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Awza'i and [[Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani]].

The first forms of military Jihad occurred after the migration ([[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]) of Muhammad and his small group of followers to [[Muhammad in Medina|Medina]] from [[Muhammad in Mecca|Mecca]] and the conversion of several inhabitants of the city to Islam. The first revelation concerning the struggle against the Meccans was [[Al-Hajj|surah 22]], verses 39–40:&lt;ref&gt;William M. Watt: ''Muhammad at Medina'', p. 4; q.v. the [[Tafsir]] regarding these verses&lt;/ref&gt;
The main focus of Muhammad's later years was increasing the number of allies as well as the amount of territory under Muslim control.&lt;ref name="DavidCook2005"&gt;David Cook, ''Understanding Jihad''; University of California Press: CA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Edwards and [[Sherifa Zuhur]], offensive jihad was the type of jihad practiced by the early Muslim community, because their weakness meant "no defensive action would have sufficed to protect them against the allied tribal forces determined to exterminate them." Jihad as a collective duty (''[[Fard]] Kifaya'') and offensive jihad are synonymous in classical Islamic law and tradition, which also asserted that offensive jihad could only be declared by the caliph, but an "individually incumbent jihad" (''Fard Ayn'') required only "awareness of an oppression targeting Islam or Islamic peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards |first1=Richard |last2=Zuhur|first2=Sherifa |title=The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and|page=553|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAd8efHdVzIC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;dq=jihad+declared+by+caliph&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIh7D86LCfyAIVFxKSCh1bnQiW#v=onepage&amp;q=jihad%20declared%20by%20caliph&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tina Magaard, associate professor at the [[Aarhus University]] Department of Business Development and Technology, has analyzed the texts of the 10 largest religions in the world. In an interview, she stated that the basic texts of Islam call for violence and aggression against followers of other faiths to a greater extent than texts of other religions. She has also argued that they contain direct incitements to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Jyllands-Posten|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE5097347/Islam-er-den-mest-krigeriske-religion/|title=Islam er den mest krigeriske religion|date=Oct 9, 2005|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Main article|Caravan raids|Ghazi (warrior)}}
[[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]] ([[Wiktionary:ghazi|غازي]]) is an Arabic term originally referring to an individual who participates in Ghazw (غزو), meaning military expeditions or raiding; after the emergence of Islam, it took on new connotations of religious warfare. The related word Ghazwa (غزوة) is a singulative form meaning a battle or military expedition, often one led by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Aboul-Enein, H. Yousuf and Zuhur, Sherifa,"''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1428910395&amp;id=5F-JEmNr9yUC&amp;printsec=frontcover Islamic Rulings on Warfare'']", Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, Diane Publishing Co., Darby PA, {{ISBN|1-4289-1039-5}} p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Caravan raids]] were a series of raids in which Muhammed and his [[Sahabah|companions]] participated. The raids were generally offensive and carried out to gather intelligence or seize the trade goods of [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] financed by the [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]].&lt;ref name="Watt1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Montgomery Watt|title=Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RV7uAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=26 February 2016|year=1974|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raids were intended to weaken the economy of [[Mecca]] by Muhammad. His followers were also impoverished.&lt;ref name="Gabriel2007"/&gt; Muhammad broke an Arab tradition of not attacking one's own kinsmen by raiding caravans.&lt;ref name="Gabriel2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard A.

Islamic Doctrines teachings on matters of war and peace have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. Charles Matthews writes that there is a "large debate about what the Quran commands as regards the '[[sword verses]]' and the 'peace verses'".  According to Matthews, "the question of the proper prioritization of these verses, and how they should be understood in relation to one another, has been a central issue for Islamic thinking about war."&lt;ref name=Mathewes&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Religious Ethics |first=Charles T. |last=Mathewes|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyCsZE_iHp4C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Koran+%22sword+verses%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dipak Gupta, "much of the religious justification of violence against nonbelievers (Dar ul [[Kufr]]) by the promoters of jihad is based on the Quranic “sword verses.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=

On the other hand, other scholars argue that such verses of the Qur'an are interpreted out of context,&lt;ref name="Boundries_Princeton"&gt;Sohail H. Hashmi, David Miller, ''Boundaries and Justice: diverse ethical perspectives'', Princeton University Press, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www-rohan.sdsu.edu"&gt;Khaleel Muhammad, professor of religious studies at San Diego State University, states, regarding his discussion with the critic Robert Spencer, that "when I am told ... that Jihad only means war, or that I have to accept interpretations of the Qur'an that non-Muslims (with no good intentions or knowledge of Islam) seek to force upon me, I see a certain agendum developing: one that is based on hate, and I refuse to be part of such an intellectual crime." {{cite web|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708102707/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |archivedate= 8 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micheline R. Ishay has argued that "the Quran justifies wars for self-defense to protect Islamic communities against internal or external aggression by non-Islamic populations, and wars waged against those who 'violate their oaths' by breaking a treaty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|12|end=15|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|39|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ishay, Micheline|title=The history of human rights |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley |year=|page=45 |isbn=0-520-25641-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner]] stated that jihad, even in self-defence, is "strictly limited".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaiil.org/uk/newsletters/2002/0302ukbulletin.pdf Article on Jihad] by Dr. G. W. Leitner (founder of The Oriental Institute, UK) published in Asiatic Quarterly Review, 1886. ("Jihad, even when explained as a righteous effort of waging war in self defense against the grossest outrage on one's religion, is strictly limited..")&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Oliver Leaman, a number of Islamic jurists asserted the primacy of the “sword verses” over the conciliatory verses in specific historical circumstances.&lt;ref name="Leaman2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Leaman|authorlink=Oliver Leaman|title=Jewish Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLLKcZuGCQ4C&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08868-5|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to Diane Morgan, [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301–1372) asserted that the Sword Verse [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] all [[Hudna|peace treaties]] that had been promulgated between Muhammad and idolaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essential Islam: a comprehensive guide to belief and practice |first=Diane |last=Morgan|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=sword+verses+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=sword%20verses%20quran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernists]] reject the abrogating status of the sword verses, which would result in the abrogation (naskh) of numerous Quranic verses that counsel peace and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shariʻa as discourse: legal traditions and the encounter with Europe |first1=Jørgen S.|last1=Nielsen |first2=Lisbet |last2=Christoffersen |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2010 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VJ_t0F7ZGEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Quran+%22sword+verses%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20%22sword%20verses%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muslims and modernity: an introduction to the issues and debates |first=Clinton |last=Bennett |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005|page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0vYYovH7OQC&amp;dq=Koran+%22sword+verses%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his oppressors in Mecca.&lt;ref name="cultures"&gt;Boulding, Elise. "Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History", p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until after the exile that the [[Muhammad's first revelation|Quranic revelations]] began to adopt a more defensive perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Lawrence. "Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses", p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; From that point onward, those dubious about the need to go to war were typically portrayed as lazy cowards allowing their love of peace to become a [[Fitna (word)|fitna]] to them.&lt;ref name="church"&gt;Churchill, Robert Paul.

====Hadiths====
{{Main article|Jihad in Hadith}}
{{See also|Criticism of Hadith}}
The context of the Quran is elucidated by Hadith (the teachings, deeds and sayings of Muhammad). Of the 199 references to jihad in perhaps the most standard collection of hadith—[[Sahih Bukhari|Bukhari]]—all refer to warfare.&lt;ref name=bukhari&gt;Muhammad ibn Isma'il Bukhari, The Translation of the Meaning of Sahih al-Bukhari, trans.

===== Quranism =====

[[Quranists]] reject the hadith and follow the Quran only.

====Ahmadiyya====
{{Main article|Ahmadiyya view on Jihad|Ahmadiyya#Abrogation|Persecution of Ahmadis}}

According to [[Ahmadi]] Muslim belief, Jihad can be divided into three categories: ''Jihad al-Akbar'' (Greater Jihad) is that against the self and refers to striving against one's low desires such as anger, lust and hatred; ''Jihad al-Kabīr'' (Great Jihad) refers to the peaceful propagation of Islam, with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the ''pen''; ''Jihad al-Asghar'' (Smaller Jihad) is only for self-defence under situations of extreme religious persecution whilst not being able to follow one's fundamental religious beliefs, and even then only under the direct instruction of the [[Ahmadiyya Caliphate|Caliph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414065050/http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archivedate=2012-04-14 | title=Suspension of Jihad | accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valentine2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Ross Valentine|title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdRth02Q6nAC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2008|publisher=C.

{{Quote|As far as Islam is concerned, it categorically rejects and condemns every form of terrorism. It does not provide any cover or justification for any act of violence, be it committed by an individual, a group or a government.}}

Various Ahmadis scholars, such as [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]], [[Maulana Sadr-ud-Din]] and [[Basharat Ahmad]], argue that when the Quran's verses are read in context, it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits initial aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Ali, Maulana Muhammad - p. 414"&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad; The Religion of Islam (6th Edition), Ch V "Jihad" p. 414 "When shall war cease".

[http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/mali/religionislam/religionofislam.pdf link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadi Muslims believe that no verse of the Quran abrogates or cancels another verse. All Quranic verses have equal validity, in keeping with their emphasis on the "unsurpassable beauty and unquestionable validity of the Qur'ān".&lt;ref name="Friedmann"&gt;[[Yohanan Friedmann|Friedmann]], ''Jihād in Ahmadī Thought'', {{ISBN|965-264-014-X}}, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The harmonization of apparently incompatible rulings is resolved through their juridical deflation in Ahmadī ''[[fiqh]]'', so that a ruling (considered to have applicability only to the specific [[asbab al-nuzul|situation for which it was revealed]]), is effective not because it was revealed last, but because it is most suited to the situation at hand.&lt;ref name="Friedmann"/&gt;

Ahmadis are considered non-Muslims by the mainstream Muslims since they consider [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of Ahmadiyya, as the promised [[Mahdi]] and [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/3in1/chap2/index.html | title=An Enemy a Disbeliever a Liar, Claims of Hadhrat Ahmad | publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Naeem Osman Memon | year=1994 |isbn=1-85372-552-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/reflection.html | title=Truth about Ahmadiyyat, Reflection of all the Prophets |publisher=London Mosque | author=B.A Rafiq | year=1978 |isbn=0-85525-013-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirza Tahir Ahmad 1998"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_7_section_1.html | title=Revelation Rationality Knowledge and Truth, Future of Revelation|publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | authorlink=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | year=1998 |isbn=1-85372-640-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Lago|title=The Handbook of Transcultural Counselling and Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA312|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=978-0-335-23851-4|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of Islamic countries, especially Sunni-dominated nations, Ahmadis have been considered heretics and non-Muslim, and have been subject to various forms of [[Persecution of religious minorities by Muslims|religious persecution]], [[Religious discrimination|discrimination]] and systematic oppression since the movement's inception in 1889.&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819140154/http://www.theasa.org/conferences/asa04/panels/panel21.htm "Localising Diaspora: the Ahmadi Muslims and the problem of multi-sited ethnography".] Association of Social Anthropologists, 2004 conference panel.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam and crime===
{{Main article|Islamic criminal jurisprudence|Hudud|Qisas|Tazir}}

The Islamic criminal law is [[criminal law]] in accordance with Sharia. Strictly speaking, Islamic law does not have a distinct corpus of "criminal law."

Zina only applies for unlawful sex between free Muslims; the rape of a non-Muslim slave woman is not zina as the act is considered an offense not against the raped slave woman, but against the owner of the slave.&lt;ref name=ae2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=keciali/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Juan Eduardo Campo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=28 February 2016|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2696-8|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zina and rape laws of countries under Sharia law are the subjects of a global human rights debate and one of many items of reform and secularization debate with respect to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;LAU, M.

In contrast to human rights activists, Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and sexual codes that are central to Islam. Zina laws come under hudud—seen as crime against [[Allah]]; the Islamists refer to this pressure and proposals to reform zina and other laws as ‘contrary to Islam’. Attempts by international human rights to reform religious laws and codes of Islam has become the Islamist rallying platforms during political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;A.

==Terrorism==

{{Islamism sidebar}}
[[Islamic terrorism]] is, by definition, [[Terrorism|terrorist acts]] committed by Muslim groups or individuals who profess Islamic or [[Islamism|Islamist]] motivations or goals. Islamic terrorists have relied on particular interpretations of the tenets of the Quran and the Hadith, citing these scriptures to justify violent tactics including mass murder, genocide, [[Islam and Pedophilia|child-molestation]] and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/meast/isis-justification-female-slaves/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK |author=Greg Botelho|date=12 December 2014|work=CNN|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, incidents of Islamic terrorism have occurred on a global scale, occurring not only in Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also abroad in [[Terrorism in the European Union|Europe]], [[Terrorism in Russia|Russia]], and the [[Terrorism in the United States|United States]], and such attacks have targeted Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/24/isis-ideology-islamic-militants-british-appeal-iraq-syria|title=Isis: a contrived ideology justifying barbarism and sexual control|author=Mona Siddiqui|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of the worst-affected Muslim-majority regions, these terrorists have been met by armed, independent resistance groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/01/kurdish-peshmerga-kobani-isis-syria|title=Kurdish peshmerga forces arrive in Kobani to bolster fight against Isis|author=Constanze Letsch|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; state actors and their [[proxy war|proxies]], and politically liberal Muslim protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/388593/moderate-muslims-stand-against-isis-christine-sisto|title=Moderate Muslims Stand against ISIS |author=Christine Sisto|work=National Review Online|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pacifism in Islam ==
Islam does not have any normative tradition of [[pacifism]], and [[Islam and war|warfare]] has been integral part of Islamic history both for the defense and the spread of the faith since the time of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300198171/islamic-imperialism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lews, Bernard, Islam and the West, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his opposition in Mecca.&lt;ref name="cultures"&gt;Boulding, Elise. "Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History", p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until after the exile that the [[Muhammad's first revelation|Quranic revelations]] began to adopt a more violent perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Lawrence. "Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses", p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, however, says that should the enemy's hostile behavior cease, then the reason for engaging the enemy also lapses.&lt;ref name =afsaruddin&gt;Afsaruddin, Asma (2007). ''Views of Jihad Throughout History''. Religion Compass 1 (1), pp. 165–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception of Islam==
===Negative perceptions===
Philip W. Sutton and Stephen Vertigans describe Western views on Islam as based on a [[stereotype]] of it as an inherently violent religion, characterizing it as a 'religion of the sword'. They characterize the image of Islam in the [[Western world]] as "dominated by conflict, aggression, 'fundamentalism', and global-scale violent terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resurgent Islam: a sociological approach |first1=Philip W. |last1=Sutton |first2=Stephen |last2=Vertigans |publisher=Polity |year=2005 |page=7 |quote=Stereotypical views which portray Islam as an inherently violent religion, a 'religion of the sword' and an increasing global threat have thus been reinforced and even extended over recent years. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jhx1XlbhFhgC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QN4FTaL-Jo7msQOepuWODQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Eduardo Campo writes that, "Europeans (have) viewed Islam in various ways: sometimes as a backward, violent religion; sometimes as an [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]] fantasy; and sometimes as a complex and changing product of history and social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |first=Juan Eduardo |last=Campo |page=374 |publisher = Infobase Publishing| year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Gleave writes that, "at the centre of popular conceptions of Islam as a violent religion are the punishments carried out by regimes hoping to bolster both their domestic and international Islamic credentials."&lt;ref name="HinnellsKing2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Hinnells|author2=Richard King|title=Religion and Violence in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wb1OBi3zvdkC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=26 February 2016|year=2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08869-2|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attack on the US]] has led many non-Muslims to indict Islam as a violent religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, power &amp; violence: expression of politics in contemporary times|first=Ram |last=Puniyani |publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |pages=97–98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fd5Fm79VMk8C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X30ETYusGcq-nAfihpnmDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Corrigan and Hudson, "some conservative Christian leaders (have) complained that Islam (is) incompatible with what they believed to be a Christian America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion in America: an historical account of the development of American religious life |first1=John|last1=Corrigan |first2=Winthrop Still |last2=Hudson |publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |year=2004 |page=444 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVTuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;dq=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TdQFTa6ZAY72tgPb9aDHDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[evangelical Christian]]s who have expressed such sentiments include [[Franklin Graham]], an [[Christianity in the United States|American Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and [[missionary]], and [[Pat Robertson]], an American [[media mogul]], [[executive chairman]], and a former [[Southern Baptist]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Nation Challenged: The Religious Right; Islam Is Violent in Nature, Pat Robertson Says |publisher=New York Times |date=23 February 2002 |quote=The religious broadcaster Pat Robertson has described Islam as a"violent religion that wants to 'dominate and then, if need be, destroy'."|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/23/us/nation-challenged-religious-right-islam-violent-nature-pat-robertson-says.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a survey conducted by [[LifeWay Christian Resources|LifeWay Research]], a research group affiliated with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], said that two out of three [[Protestantism|Protestant]] pastors believe that Islam is a "dangerous" religion.

Dr. Johannes J.G. Jansen was an Arabist who wrote an essay called “Religious Roots of Muslim Violence”, in which he discusses at length all aspects of the issue and unequivocally concludes that Muslim violence is mostly based on Islamic religious commands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabistjansen.nl/Arabist/pub_list_Engl_files/RelRootsMusViol.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage on terrorist attacks play a critical role in creating negative perceptions on Islam and Muslims. Powell  &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=Kimberly|date=2011|title=Framing Islam: An Analysis of U.S. Media Coverage of Terrorism Since 9/11|url=|journal=Communication Studies|volume=62|pages=90-112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described how Islam initially appeared in U.S. news cycles because of its relationships to oil, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and terrorism (92). Thus the audience was provided the base to associate Muslims to control of the resource of oil, war, and terrorism. A total of 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. soil since the 9/11 and their content coverage (in 1,638 news stories) in the national media had been analyzed "through frames composed of labels, common themes, and rhetorical associations" (Powell 94)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The key findings are summarized below: 
* The media coverage of terrorism in the U.S. feeds a culture of fear of Islam and describes  the United States as a good Christian nation (Powell 105). 
* A clear pattern of reporting had been detected that differentiates "terrorists who were Muslim with international ties and terrorists who were U.S. citizens with no clear international ties" (Powell 105). This was utilized to frame "war of Islam on the United States".
* "Muslim Americans are no longer ‘‘free’’ to practice and to name their religion without fear of prosecution, judgment, or connection to terrorism." (Powell 107)

Hill and Bernard Spilka write in ''The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach'', "Although it would be a mistake to think that Islam is inherently a violent religion, it would be equally inappropriate to fail to understand the conditions under which believers might feel justified in acting violently against those whom their tradition feels should be opposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach|first1=Ralph W. |last1=Hood |first2=Peter C.|last2=Hill |first3=Bernard |last3=Spilka |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2009|page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETVk59xbc90C&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZbcFTb21G4uosAOp3ZiKDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Chandra Muzaffar]], a [[political scientist]], [[Liberal Muslim movements#Reform|Islamic reformist]] and [[activist]], says, "The Quranic exposition on resisting aggression, oppression and injustice lays down the parameters within which fighting or the use of violence is legitimate. What this means is that one can use the Quran as the criterion for when violence is legitimate and when it is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rights, religion and reform: enhancing human dignity through spiritual and moral transformation |first=Chandra |last=Muzaffar |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2002|page=345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQA02NT6tmAC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=Quran+violence&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-C8HTdGqOoOusAPNn4DZDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
[[Pew Research Center|Pew research]] in 2010 found that in [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Nigeria]], roughly 50% of Muslims had favourable views of [[Hezbollah]], and that [[Hamas]] also saw similar support.&lt;ref name=PewDivided&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/|title=Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah|date=2 December 2010|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-terrorism]] researchers suggests that support for suicide bombings is rooted in opposition to real or perceived foreign military occupation, rather than Islam, according to a Department of Defense-funded study by University of Chicago researcher Robert Pape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rozen |first=Laura |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1010/Researcher_Suicide_terrorism_linked_to_military_occupation.html?showall |title=Researcher: Suicide terrorism linked to military occupation - Laura Rozen |publisher=Politico.Com |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the [[National Post]], [[Barbara Kay]] stated that [[honor killing]] is not strictly a Muslim phenomenon and that it is enabled by factors including [[sexism]], dowries and a lack of a dependable legal system. Nevertheless, Kay says that the murders are a Muslim phenomenon in the West, where 95% of honor killings are perpetrated by "Muslim fathers and brothers or their proxies". Kay warns that females do not dissent as one might expect either: The women may describe victims of honor killing as having needed punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[Continue calling ‘honour killings’ by its rightful name, Barbara Kay, September 21, 2011, Full comment, National Post.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center also found that support for the [[Islam and capital punishment|death penalty]] as punishment for "people who leave the Muslim religion" was 86% in Jordan, 84% in Egypt, 76% in Pakistan, 80% in Nigeria (all very large Muslim populations) and yet lower in some other countries.&lt;ref name=PewDivided/&gt; The different factors at play (e.g. sectarianism, poverty, etc.) and their relative impacts are not clarified.

According to 2006 data, Pew says that 46% of [[Islam in Nigeria|Nigerian Muslims]], 29% of [[Islam in Jordan|Jordan Muslims]], 28% of [[Islam in Egypt|Egyptian Muslims]], 15% of [[Islam in the United Kingdom|British Muslims]], and 8% of [[Islam in the United States|American Muslims]] thought suicide bombings are often or sometimes justified.&lt;ref name=PewMuslimAmericans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf|title=Muslim Americans – Middle class and mostly mainstream|date=22 May 2007|publisher=Pew Research Center|page=60|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was unchanged – still 8% – for American Muslims by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2011/08/30/muslim-americans-no-signs-of-growth-in-alienation-or-support-for-extremism/|title=Muslim Americans: No Signs of Growth in Alienation or Support for Extremism|date=30 August 2011|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polls have found Muslim-Americans to report less violent views than any other religious group in America. 89% of Muslim-Americans claimed that the killing of civilians is never justified, compared to 71% of Catholics and Protestants, 75% of Jews, and 76% of atheists and non-religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/148763/Muslim-Americans-No-Justification-Violence.aspx|title=Most Muslim Americans See No Justification for Violence|publisher=gallup.com|date=2 August 2011|author=Nicole Naurath|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center's 2013 poll showed that the majority of 14,244 Muslim, Christian and other respondents in 14 countries with substantial Muslim populations are concerned about Islamic extremism and hold negative views on known terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/|title=Concerns about Islamic Extremism on the Rise in Middle East|publisher=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gallup poll====
Gallup poll collected extensive data in a project called "Who Speaks for Islam?". [[John Esposito]] and [[Dalia Mogahed]] present data relevant to Islamic views on peace, and more, in their book ''Who Speaks for Islam?'' The book reports Gallup poll data from random samples in over 35 countries using Gallup's various research techniques (e.g. pairing male and female interviewers, testing the questions beforehand, communicating with local leaders when approval is necessary, travelling by foot if that is the only way to reach a region, etc.) &lt;ref name=GallupEM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307065817/http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archivedate=2009-03-07|title=FAQs: Who Speaks for Islam?|publisher=gallup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a great deal of data. It suggests, firstly, that individuals who dislike America and consider the September 11 attacks to be "perfectly justified" form a statistically distinct group, with much more extreme views. The authors call this 7% of Muslims "Politically Radicalized".&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt; They chose that title "because of their radical political orientation" and clarify "we are not saying that all in this group commit acts of violence. However, those with extremist views are a potential source for recruitment or support for terrorist groups."&lt;ref name=GallupRadical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/104941/what-makes-radical.aspx|publisher=Gallup.com|title=What Makes a Radical?|author=Gallup Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data also indicates that poverty is not simply to blame for the comparatively radical views of this 7% of Muslims, who tend to be better educated than moderates.&lt;ref name=GallupRadical/&gt;

The authors say that, contrary to what the media may indicate, most Muslims believe that the September 11 attacks cannot actually be justified at all. The authors called this 55% of Muslims "Moderates". Included in that category were an additional 12% who said the attacks ''almost'' cannot be justified at all (thus 67% of Muslims were classified as Moderates). 26% of Muslims were neither moderates nor radicals, leaving the remaining 7% called "[[Political radicalism|Politically Radicalized]]". Esposito and Mogahed explain that the labels should not be taken as being perfectly definitive. Because there may be individuals who would generally not be considered radical, although they believe the attacks were justified, or vice versa.&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt;

'''Lucretia Mott''' (née '''Coffin'''; January 3, 1793 – November 11, 1880) was a [[Quakers in North America|U.S. Quaker]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[women's rights]] activist, and [[social reformer]]. She had formed the idea of reforming the position of women in society when she was amongst the women excluded from the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in 1840. In 1848 she was invited by [[Jane Hunt]] to a meeting that led to the first meeting about women's rights. Mott helped write the [[Declaration of Sentiments]] during the 1848 [[Seneca Falls Convention]].

Her speaking abilities made her an important abolitionist, feminist, and reformer. When slavery was outlawed in 1865, she advocated giving former slaves who had been bound to slavery laws within the boundaries of the United States, whether male or female, the right to vote. She remained a central figure in the abolition and suffrage movement until her death in 1880.

Mott was a Quaker preacher early in her adulthood.

== Early life and education ==
Lucretia Coffin was born in [[Nantucket]], [[Massachusetts]], the second child of Anna Folger and Thomas Coffin.{{Sfn|Faulkner|2011|pp=8, 14}} Through her mother, she was a descendent of [[Peter Folger (Nantucket settler)|Peter Folger]]{{Sfn|Faulkner|2011|p=12}} and [[Mary Morrell Folger]].{{Sfn|Payne|2011|p=20}} Her cousin was [[Framers of the Constitution|Framer]] [[Benjamin Franklin]], while other Folger relatives were [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]].{{Sfn|Faulkner|2011|p=14}}

She was sent at the age of 13 to the [[Oakwood Friends School|Nine Partners School]], located in [[Dutchess County, New York]], which was run by the [[Society of Friends]].{{Sfn|Faulkner|2011|pp=24–27}} There she became a teacher after graduation. Her interest in [[women's rights]] began when she discovered that male teachers at the school were [[gender pay gap|paid significantly more than]] female staff.{{Sfn|Faulkner|2011|p=33, 34}} After her family moved to Philadelphia, she and James Mott, another teacher at Nine Partners, followed.{{Sfn|Faulkner|2011|pp=34, 36}}

== Abolitionist ==
=== Early anti-slavery efforts ===

Like many Quakers, Mott considered slavery to be evil. Inspired in part by minister [[Elias Hicks]], she and other Quakers refused to use cotton cloth, cane sugar, and other slavery-produced goods. In 1821, Mott became [[Recorded Minister|a Quaker minister]]. With her husband's support, she traveled extensively as a minister, and her sermons emphasized the Quaker inward light, or the presence of the Divine within every individual.  Her sermons also included her [[Free produce movement|free produce]] and anti-slavery sentiments. In 1833, her husband helped found the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]]. By then an experienced minister and abolitionist, Lucretia Mott was the only woman to speak at the organizational meeting in Philadelphia. She tested the language of the society's Constitution and bolstered support when many delegates were precarious. Days after the conclusion of the convention, at the urging of other delegates, Mott and other white and black women founded the [[Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society]]. Integrated from its founding, the organization opposed both slavery and racism, and developed close ties to Philadelphia's Black community. Mott herself often preached at Black parishes. Around this time, Mott's sister-in-law, Abigail Lydia Mott, and brother-in-law, [[Lindley Murray Moore]], were helping to found the [[Rochester Anti-Slavery Society]] (see [[Julia Griffiths]]).

Amidst social persecution by [[proslavery|abolition opponents]] and pain from [[dyspepsia]], Mott continued her work for the abolitionist cause. She managed their household budget to extend hospitality to guests, including [[fugitive slaves]], and donated to charities. Mott was praised for her ability to maintain her household while contributing to the cause. In the words of one editor, "She is proof that it is possible for a woman to widen her sphere without deserting it."{{Sfn|Bacon|1999|p=68}} Mott and other female activists also organized [[anti-slavery fair]]s to raise awareness and revenue, providing much of the funding for the movement.{{Sfn|Faulkner|2011|p=169}}

Women's participation in the anti-slavery movement threatened societal norms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Many members of the abolitionist movement opposed public activities by women, especially public speaking. At the [[Congregational Church]] General Assembly, delegates agreed on a pastoral letter warning women that lecturing directly defied [[St. Paul]]'s instruction for women to keep quiet in church.([[1 Timothy 2:12]]) Other people opposed women's speaking to mixed crowds of men and women, which they called "promiscuous." Others were uncertain about what was proper, as the rising popularity of the [[Grimké sisters]] and other women speakers attracted support for abolition.

Mott attended all three national [[Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women|Anti-Slavery Conventions of American Women]] (1837, 1838, 1839). During the 1838 convention in Philadelphia, a mob destroyed [[Pennsylvania Hall (Philadelphia)|Pennsylvania Hall]], a newly opened meeting place built by abolitionists. Mott and the white and black women delegates linked arms to exit the building safely through the crowd. Afterward, the mob targeted her home and Black institutions and neighborhoods in Philadelphia. As a friend redirected the mob, Mott waited in her parlor, willing to face her violent opponents.{{Sfn|Faulkner|2011|p=79}}

Mott was involved in a number of anti-slavery organizations, including the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society, the [[Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society]] (founded in 1838), the American Free Produce Association, and the American Anti-Slavery Society.

=== World's Anti-Slavery Convention ===
{{main|World Anti-Slavery Convention}}
{{Anti-Slavery Society Convention 1840|align=right|size=400px|caption=1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention.{{Sfn|Haydon|1841}} Move your cursor to identify delegates or click the icon to enlarge}}

In June 1840, Mott attended the [[Anti-Slavery International#History|General Anti-Slavery Convention]], better known as the World's Anti-Slavery Convention, in London, England. In spite of Mott's status as one of six women delegates, before the conference began, the men voted to exclude the American women from participating, and the female delegates were required to sit in a segregated area. Anti-slavery leaders didn't want the women's rights issue to become associated with the cause of ending slavery worldwide and dilute the focus on abolition.{{Sfn|Rodriguez|2011|pp=585–596}} In addition, the social mores of the time generally prohibited women's participation in public political life. Several of the American men attending the convention, including [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Wendell Phillips]], protested the women's exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1021069176|title=Votes for women! : American suffragists and the battle for the ballot|last=Winifred|first=Conkling|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781616207342|edition= First|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|pages=27|oclc=1021069176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison, [[Nathaniel Peabody Rogers]], [[William Adam (minister)|William Adam]], and African American activist [[Charles Lenox Remond]] sat with the women in the segregated area.

Activists [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and her husband [[Henry Brewster Stanton]] attended the convention while on their honeymoon. Stanton admired Mott, and the two women became united as friends and allies.

One Irish reporter deemed her the "Lioness of the Convention".{{Sfn|Bacon|1999|p=92}} Mott was among the women included in the commemorative painting of the convention, which also featured female British activists: [[Elizabeth Pease Nichol|Elizabeth Pease]], [[Mary Anne Rawson]], [[Anne Knight]], [[John Harfield Tredgold|Elizabeth Tredgold]] and Mary Clarkson, daughter of [[Thomas Clarkson]].{{Sfn|Haydon|1840}}

Encouraged by active debates in England and Scotland, Mott also returned with new energy for the anti-slavery cause in the United States. She continued an active public lecture schedule, with destinations including the major Northern cities of [[New York City]] and [[Boston]], as well as travel over several weeks to slave-owning states, with speeches in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] and other cities in [[Virginia]]. She arranged to meet with slave owners to discuss the morality of slavery.  In the [[District of Columbia]], Mott timed her lecture to coincide with the return of [[US Congress|Congress]] from Christmas recess; more than 40 Congressmen attended. She had a personal audience with President [[John Tyler]] who, impressed with her speech, said, "I would like to hand [[John C. Calhoun|Mr. Calhoun]] over to you",{{Sfn|Bacon|1999|p=105}} referring to the [[United States Senate|senator]] and abolition opponent.

== Women's rights ==
=== Overview ===
Mott and Cady Stanton became well acquainted at the World's Anti-Slavery Convention. Cady Stanton later recalled that they first discussed the possibility of a women's rights convention in London.

Women's rights activists advocated a range of issues, including equality in marriage, such as women's property rights and rights to their earnings. At that time it was very difficult to obtain divorce, and fathers were almost always granted custody of children. Cady Stanton sought to make divorce easier to obtain and to safeguard women's access to and control of their children. Though some early feminists disagreed, and viewed Cady Stanton's proposal as scandalous, Mott stated "her great faith in Elizabeth Stanton's quick instinct &amp; clear insight in all appertaining to women's rights."{{Sfn|Faulkner|2011|p=160}}

Mott's theology was influenced by [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] including [[Theodore Parker]] and [[William Ellery Channing]] as well as early Quakers including [[William Penn]]. She thought that "the kingdom of God is within man" (1749) and was part of the group of religious liberals who formed the [[Free Religious Association]] in 1867, with Rabbi [[Isaac Mayer Wise]],{{Sfn|The Free Religious Association|1907|pp=30–31}} [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]]. Her theological position was particularly influential among Quakers, as in the future many harked back to her positions, sometimes without even knowing it.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

In 1866, Mott joined with Stanton, Anthony, and Stone to establish the American Equal Rights Association.  The following year, the organization became active in Kansas where black suffrage and woman suffrage were to be decided by popular vote, and it was then that Stanton and Anthony formed a political alliance with Train, leading to Mott's resignation. Kansas failed to pass both referenda.

Mott was a founder and president of the Northern Association for the Relief and Employment of Poor Women in Philadelphia (founded in 1846).

=== Seneca Falls Convention ===
{{Main|Seneca Falls Convention}}
In 1848, Mott and Cady Stanton organized the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women's rights convention, at [[Seneca Falls (CDP), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]].{{Sfn|McMillen|2008|pp=2–3}} Stanton's resolution that it was "the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves the sacred right to the elective franchise" was passed despite Mott's opposition. Mott viewed politics as corrupted by slavery and moral compromises, but she soon concluded that women's "right to the elective franchise however, is the same, and should be yielded to her, whether she exercises that right or not."{{Sfn|Faulkner|2011|p=147}} Mott signed the Seneca Falls [[Declaration of Sentiments]].

Despite Mott's opposition to electoral politics, her fame had reached into the political arena even before the July 1848 women's rights convention. During the June 1848 [[National Convention]] of the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], 5 of the 84 voting delegates cast their ballots for Lucretia Mott to be their party's candidate for the Office of U.S. Vice President. In delegate voting, she placed 4th in a field of nine.

Over the next few decades, [[women's suffrage]] became the focus of the women's rights movement.  While Cady Stanton is usually credited as the leader of that effort, it was Mott's mentoring of Cady Stanton and their work together that inspired the event. Mott's sister, [[Martha Coffin Wright]], also helped organize the convention and signed the declaration.

Noted abolitionist and human rights activist [[Frederick Douglass]] was in attendance and played a key role in persuading the other attendees to agree to a resolution calling for women's suffrage.{{Sfn|National Portrait Gallery, The Seneca Falls Convention}}

=== American Equal Rights Association ===

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Mott was elected the first president of the [[American Equal Rights Association]], an organization that advocated [[universal suffrage]]. She resigned from the association in 1868 when [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]] allied with a controversial businessman named [[George Francis Train]]. Mott tried to reconcile the two factions that split the following year over the priorities of woman suffrage and Black male suffrage. Ever the peacemaker, Mott tried to heal the breach between Stanton, Anthony and [[Lucy Stone]] over the immediate goal of the women's movement: suffrage for freedmen and all women, or suffrage for freedmen first?

=== ''Discourse on Women'' ===

In 1849, Mott's "Sermon to the Medical Students" was published.{{Sfn|Lockard}} In 1850, Mott published her speech ''Discourse on Woman'', a pamphlet about restrictions on women in the United States.{{Sfn|Mott|1849}}

== Swarthmore College ==

In 1864, Mott and several other [[Elias Hicks|Hicksite Quakers]] incorporated [[Swarthmore College]] near Philadelphia, which remains one of the premier [[liberal arts college]]s in the country.{{Sfn|Swarthmore College}}

== Pacifism ==

Mott was a pacifist, and in the 1830s, she attended meetings of the [[New England Non-Resistance Society]]. She opposed the War with Mexico. After the Civil War, Mott increased her efforts to end war and violence, and she was a leading voice in the [[Universal Peace Union]], founded in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/DG026-050/DG038UPU.html|title=Universal Peace Union Records, Collection: DG 038 - Swarthmore College Peace Collection|website=swarthmore.edu/Library/peace/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
[[File:Lucretia and James Mott.png|left|thumb|upright|alt=Daguerreotype portrait of Lucretia and James Mott sitting together|James and Lucretia Mott, 1842]]
On April 10, 1811, Lucretia Coffin married [[James Mott]] at Pine Street Meeting in Philadelphia. They had six children. Their second child, Thomas Mott, died at age two. Their surviving children all became active in the anti-slavery and other reform movements, following in their parents' paths. Her great-granddaughter [[May Hallowell Loud]] became an artist.

Mott died on November 11, 1880 of pneumonia at her home, Roadside, in [[Cheltenham Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Cheltenham, Pennsylvania]]. She was buried near to the highest point of [[Fair Hill Burial Ground]], a Quaker cemetery in North Philadelphia.

Mott's great-granddaughter served briefly as the Italian interpreter for [[Americans|American]] [[Feminism|feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] during a controversial speaking engagement in Rome.{{Sfn|Friedan|2001|p=221}}

[[Susan Jacoby]] writes, "When Mott died in 1880, she was widely judged by her contemporaries... as the greatest American woman of the nineteenth century." She was a mentor to [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who continued her work.{{Sfn|Jacoby|2005|p=95}}

A version of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] from 1923, which is different from the current version and is written, "Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.," was named the Lucretia Mott Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was Alice Paul|url=http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|website=Alice Paul Institute|access-date=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/lucretia-mott.htm.|title="Lucretia Mott" National Park Service|website=National Park Service|publisher=United States Government|access-date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A stamp was issued in 1948 in remembrance of the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], featuring [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], and Lucretia Mott.

In 1983, Mott was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/lucretia-mott/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Lucretia Mott]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mott is commemorated along with [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]] in a sculpture by [[Adelaide Johnson]] at the [[United States Capitol]], unveiled in 1921. Originally kept on display in the crypt of the US Capitol, the sculpture was moved to its current location and more prominently displayed in the rotunda in 1997.{{Sfn|Architect of the Capitol}}

The Lucretia Mott School in Washington D.C. was named for her,{{Sfn|The Washington Post Staff|1909}} as was P.S. 215 Lucretia Mott; the latter closed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://insideschools.org/school/27Q215|title=P.S. 215 Lucretia Mott – District 27 – InsideSchools|website=insideschools.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] announced in 2016 that an image of Mott will appear on the back of a newly designed $10 bill along with [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Alice Paul]] and the [[1913 Woman Suffrage Procession]]. Designs for new $5, $10 and $20 bills will be unveiled in 2020 in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of American women winning the right to vote via the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]].{{Sfn|US Department of the Treasury}}{{Sfn|Korte|2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''Making Sense of Abstinence''' is a collection of 16 lessons for teaching about [[sexual abstinence]] in the context of comprehensive [[sexuality education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getthefactsny.org/educators/documents/NewMakingSenseFlyer.pdf|title=Empire State Acts|website=Getthefactsny.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Minnesota Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy, Prevention, and Parenting, it is "a [[curriculum]] that takes [[abstinence]] beyond a one-dimensional scope of 'just say no,'...[utilizing] positive and engaging activities to help young people think about [[abstinence]] in a way that values their ability to make decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moappp.org/Documents/MakingSenseAbstinence.pdf|format=PDF|title=Making Sense of Abstinence : Lessons for Comprehensive Sexuality Education|website=Moappp.org|date=February 8, 2006|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample lessons include such titles as "So What's An Abstinence Anyway?" "Hey, Mom?  Hey, Dad? Hey...Gram?  Can We Talk about Abstinence?" "Just Say Know," "Masturbation:  A Touchy Subject," "Handling Horny," and "Some Day:  Making the Transition from Sexual Abstinence".

The manual has received praise from sexuality educators for expanding the way [[sexuality education]] teaches about abstinence, and for teaching the subject in a positive way, unlike other fear-based approaches.  For example, the online journal "Sexual Intelligence" praised "Making Sense of Abstinence" for "not treating kids like robotic idiots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualintelligence.org/newsletters/issue71.html#four|title=Sexual Intelligence by Marty Klein, Ph.D.|website=Sexualintelligence.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abstinence-only]] advocates have criticized the manual for including such topics as [[outercourse]] and [[masturbation]], behaviors they believe should not be acknowledged.  Critics also claim that teenagers should not learn information to protect themselves when their abstinence decisions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedom.us/pdf/abstinence_ed.pdf|format=PDF|title=Faith and Freedom|website=Faithandfreedom.us|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of "Making Sense of Abstinence" state that neither the "Just say no" approach, nor the "Always say yes," is appropriate for abstinence education.  Rather, they emphasize that teens need complete information to help them make the best decisions for themselves.

'''Maniammai''' (10 March 1917 – 16 March 1978) was an activist and rationalist leader from [[Tamil Nadu]]. She was also the adopted daughter and life partner of [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]], and succeeded him as the leader of the [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] upon his death in 1973. She is considered the first woman political leader from the state.

[[File:The March of Progress.jpg|250px|thumb|The original '''''March of Progress''''' illustration from ''Early Man'' (1965) with [[spread (typography)|spread]] extended (top) and folded (bottom)]]
'''''The March of Progress''''', properly called '''''The Road to Homo Sapiens''''', is an illustration that presents 25 million years of [[human evolution]]. It was created for the ''Early Man'' volume of the ''[[Life Nature Library]]'', published in 1965.

It has been viewed as a picture of the discredited view ([[orthogenesis]]) that evolution is progressive.&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt; As such, it has been widely parodied and imitated to create images of progress of other kinds.

The picture of progress in evolution was anticipated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''.

==Illustration==
The illustration is part of a section of text and images commissioned by [[Time-Life Books]] for the ''Early Man'' volume (1965) of the ''[[Life Nature Library]]'', by [[Francis Clark Howell|F. Clark Howell]].&lt;ref name=Howell1965&gt;Howell, F. Clark and the Editors of TIME-LIFE Books (1965), ''Early Man'', [[New York City|New York]]: [[TIME-LIFE Books]], pp. 41–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The illustration is a [[spread (typography)|foldout]] entitled "The Road to Homo Sapiens". It shows a sequence of figures, drawn by natural history painter and muralist [[Rudolph Zallinger]] (1919–1995).&lt;ref name=Howell1965/&gt; The 15 human evolutionary forebears are lined up as if they were marching in a parade from left to right. The first two sentences of the caption read "What were the stages of man's long march from apelike ancestors to ''sapiens''? Beginning at right and progressing across four more pages are milestones of primate and human evolution as scientists know them today, pieced together from the fragmentary fossil evidence."&lt;ref name=Howell1965/&gt;

===Sequence of species===
The 15 primate figures in Zallinger's image, from left to right, are listed below. The datings follow the original graphic and may no longer reflect current scientific opinion.

* ''[[Pliopithecus]]'', 22–12 million year old "ancestor of the [[gibbon]] line"
* ''[[Proconsul (primate)|Proconsul]]'', 21–9 million year old primate which may or may not have qualified as an ape
* ''[[Dryopithecus]]'', 15–8 million year old fossil ape, the first such found (1856) and probable ancestor of modern apes
* ''[[Oreopithecus]]'', 15–8 million years old
* ''Ramapithecus'',  13–8 million year old ape and possible ancestor of modern [[orangutan]]s (now considered a female ''[[Sivapithecus]]'')
* ''[[Australopithecus]]'', 2–3 million years old; then considered the earliest "certain hominid"
* ''[[Paranthropus]]'', 1.8–0.8 million years old
* Advanced ''Australopithecus'', 1.8–0.7 million year old
* ''[[Homo erectus]]'', 700,000–400,000 years old, then the earliest known member of the genus ''Homo''
* [[Early Homo sapiens|Early ''Homo sapiens'']], 300,000–200,000 years old; from [[Swanscombe Heritage Park|Swanscombe]], [[Steinheim Skull|Steinheim]] and [[Montmaurin]], then considered probably the earliest ''H. sapiens''
* [[Solo Man]], 100,000–50,000 years old; described as an extinct Asian "race" of ''H. sapiens'' (now considered a sub-species of ''H. erectus'')
* [[Rhodesian Man]], 50,000–30,000 years old; described as an extinct African "race" of ''H. sapiens'' (now considered either ''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]'' or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis|H. heidelbergensis]]'' and dated much earlier)
* [[Neanderthal Man]], 100,000–40,000 years old
* [[European early modern humans|Cro-Magnon Man]], 40,000–5,000 years old
* [[Anatomically modern humans|Modern Man]], 40,000 years to the present

==Intention==
[[File:Astronomy Evolution 2 (27458655072).jpg|thumb|One of many versions of the progressionist [[meme]]: ''Astronomy Evolution 2'' by Giuseppe Donatiello, 2016]]

Contrary to appearances and some complaints, the original 1965 text of "The Road to Homo Sapiens" reveals an understanding of the fact that a linear presentation of a sequence of primate species, all in the direct line of human ancestors, would not be a correct interpretation. For example, the fourth of Zallinger's figures (''Oreopithecus'') is said to be "a likely side branch on man's family tree". Only the next figure (''Ramapithecus'') is described as "now thought by some experts to be the oldest of man's ancestors in a direct line" (something no longer considered likely). That implies that the first four primates are not to be considered actual human ancestors. Likewise, the seventh figure (''Paranthropus'') is said to be "an evolutionary dead end".&lt;ref name=Howell1965/&gt; In addition, the colored stripes, across the top of the figure, which indicate the age and duration of the various lineages clearly imply that there is no evidence of direct continuity between extinct and extant lineages and also, multiple lineages of the figured hominids occurred contemporaneously at several points in the history of the group.

==Reception==
[[File:Evolution on a wall.jpg|thumb|Anti-war mural, Tehran, 2007]]
The image has frequently been copied, modified, and parodied. It has been criticized as  "unintentionally and wrongly" implying that "[[Orthogenesis|evolution is progressive]]".&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Jennifer|title=What our most famous evolutionary cartoon gets wrong|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/10/27/what-our-most-famous-evolutionary-cartoon-gets-wrong/drKMD5121W6EUxXJ4pF0YL/story.html|accessdate=29 December 2017|work=The [[Boston Globe]]|date=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the way the illustration has been interpreted, the anthropologist and author of the section, [[F. Clark Howell]], remarked:&lt;ref name=Barringer2006/&gt;

{{quote|The artist didn't intend to reduce the evolution of man to a linear sequence, but it was read that way by viewers.&amp;nbsp;... The graphic overwhelmed the text. It was so powerful and emotional.&lt;ref name=Barringer2006&gt;Barringer,  David (2006) "Raining on Evolution’s Parade"; ''[[I.D. Magazine]]'', March/April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Stephen Jay Gould]] (1941–2002) condemned the iconology of the image in several pages of his 1989 book, ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', reproducing several advertisements and political cartoons that make use of the illustration to make their various points. In a chapter, "The Iconography of an Expectation", he asserted that&lt;ref name=Gould1989/&gt;
{{quote|The march of progress is ''the'' canonical representation of evolution – the one picture immediately grasped and viscerally understood by all.&amp;nbsp;... The straitjacket of linear advance goes beyond [[iconography]] to the definition of evolution: the word itself becomes a synonym for ''progress''.&amp;nbsp;... [But] life is a copiously branching bush, continually pruned by the grim reaper of extinction, not a [[Orthogenesis|ladder of predictable progress]].&lt;ref name=Gould1989&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen Jay]] (1989), ''Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History''. [[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]], pp 30–36.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The [[intelligent design]] advocate [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]] wrote in ''[[Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth?]]'' (2002), "Although it is widely used to show that we are just animals, and that our very existence is a mere accident, the ultimate icon goes far beyond the evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wells |first=Jonathan |title=[[Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth?]] |year=2000 |publisher=Regnery Publishing |page=211 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book likens a selection of evolution theory textbook topics to the cover illustration thus qualified.

Brian Switek, writing for ''[[Scientific American]]'', argues that the idea of a "march of progress", as depicted in the 1965 Time-Life illustration, dates back to the medieval [[great chain of being]] and the 19th century idea of the "[[transitional fossil|missing link]]" in the [[fossil record]]. In his view, to understand life and evolution, "step one involves casting out types of imagery which constrain rather than enlighten."&lt;ref name="Switek2010"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Switek |first1=Brian |title=Breaking our link to the 'March of Progress' |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/breaking-our-link-to-the-march-of-progress/ |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=23 May 2018 |date=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Switek added that "There is perhaps no other illustration that is as immediately recognizable as representing evolution, but the tragedy of this is that it conveys a view of life that does not resemble our present understanding of life's history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Switek |first1=Brian |title=The March of Progress has Deep Roots |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/11/the-march-of-progress-has-deep-roots/ |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=23 May 2018 |date=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Participatory development communication''' is the use of [[mass media]] and traditional, inter-personal means of communication that empowers communities to visualise aspirations and discover solutions to their development problems and issues.

'''Participatory communication''' is "the theory and practices of communication used to involve people in the [[decision-making]] of the development process. It intends to return to the roots of its meaning, which, similarly to the term community, originate from the Latin word 'communis', i.e. common (Mody, 1991). Therefore, the purpose of communication should be to make something common, or to share...meanings, perceptions, worldviews or knowledge. In this context, sharing implies an equitable division of what is being shared, which is why communication should almost be naturally associated with a balanced, two-way flow of information."{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* Strengthen a regional training capacity to improve the development support communication (DSC) skills of intermediate-level professionals so that they could improve the effectiveness of the rural development programmes in which they work.
* Initiate an example of a sustainable national DSC service to support rural development programmes and projects.
* Advance towards the creation of a group of DSC professionals in the region, by means of preparing a regional Post-graduate DSC Professional Diploma Course (through collaboration with the University of Zimbabwe in Harare).
* Advise governments and other development-related organisations about the requirements for effective DSC in Southern Africa, for future action.

Based on a "Results" section which synthesises and recaps the main issues by reviewing how the conception and levels of participation identified in his research have shifted in each phase of the project, Mefalopulos concludes by arguing that participatory communication is an approach capable of facilitating people's involvement in decision-making about issues impacting their lives – a process capable of addressing specific needs and priorities relevant to people and at the same time assisting in their empowerment. In fact, he says, participatory communication is "a necessary component, consistent with a democratic vision of international development, needed to increase projects sustainability and ensure genuine ownership by the so-called 'beneficiaries'."

==Six phases of planning==

Communication planning for development is a logical process guided by a systematic and rational framework. This framework could be developed through situation-specific data gathered using participatory research techniques.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Preliminary situation assessment===
Situation assessment could be done most effectively in a participatory manner through PRCA or participatory rural communication appraisal. Three kinds of analysis are done in PRCA: audience analysis, programme analysis, and situation analysis.
Audience analysis Audience analysis is essentially "listening" to what potential users of information need. They are the ones whom the communication program intends to reach. Users of information are also referred to as stakeholders of a communication program. Collecting baseline information about these stakeholders is an essential preliminary step towards developing a communication strategy.
Segmentation, or dividing large groups of stakeholders into smaller groups, helps achieve focus in communication strategy development. Segmentation is usually done in two ways:
* Conventional segmentation according to socio-economic status (income, education, age, sex, etc.), place of residence (urban-rural), and language/ethnic group
* Innovative segmentation based on behaviour, needs, and values and lifestyles.
* Situation analysis: In doing situation analysis, planners look at both the possible problem to be addressed by the communication program and the conditions surrounding such problem.

What are the factors which cause a gap between the existing and desired behavior of stakeholders? Is the problem due to the stakeholders' lack of awareness or knowledge of the nature of the problem? Or is it attitudinal in nature? Could the gap be due to their lack of skills to carry out certain practices?
Situation analysis likewise includes assessing the communication resources in the area which could be tapped for the communication program. Knowledge of the area's mass and small media, as well as interpersonal means of communication, should contribute substantially to strategy development.
Programme analysis
When doing program analysis, program planners need to take both an inward and an outward look at the situation that is, looking at the organization's own vision, policies, resources, strengths, and weaknesses relevant to the problem.
Are there adequate resources to realize this vision? How well are program managers using available resources? At the same time, it is important to scan the environment for existing programs that could affect, positively or negatively, the communication strategy to be developed.

===Communication strategy design===
Data that have been collected need to be analyzed and interpreted carefully as these will serve as bases of the communication strategy. Communication strategy is the combination of methods, messages, and approaches by which the planner seeks to achieve the communication objectives.
The second phase of the process charts the direction of the communication program. It is at this stage where objectives and the corresponding standards and indicators for [[Monitoring and Evaluation|monitoring and evaluation]] are formulated.
The very word strategy suggests a unique combination of techniques or approaches by which to achieve program goals and objectives.
During strategy design formulation, planners also begin thinking of the following:
* Preliminary action plan;
* Communication modes/approaches; and
* Basic messages and discussion themes.

===Participatory design of messages and discussion themes===
The main activities under the message design phase are selection of message appeals and approaches and selection of communication channels and media. The big challenge at this stage is the development of the big idea or the creative concept around which the whole communication program would revolve.
Professional communication outfits are often tapped to develop messages and communication materials for the above-mentioned processes. The disadvantage of this approach, aside from the huge expense involved, is the lack of participation from the stakeholders themselves.
Involving the stakeholders in message and materials development increases the likelihood that the communication program would help achieve the bigger development goals.

===Communication methods and materials development===
Actual development of communication methods and materials are undertaken once the communication strategy is in place.
A useful reminder to planners concerns the importance of pretesting not only the materials themselves, but also the creative idea and the messages. Pretesting allows for adjustments in the communication activities before substantial time, efforts, and resources are spent on their actual production.
Pretesting measures potential effectiveness of communication messages, methods, and materials in terms of their being able to attract attention, to be understood, to be accepted, and to generate the feeling of self-involvement among the stakeholders.

===Management and implementation===
Management of the organization carrying out the communication program and networking are two of the most important activities in this phase.
A manager's internal task entails preparing or training people for their respective tasks in the organization within a positive organizational climate. The external task calls for forging linkages with key organizations engaged in the same area of development work.
After all the preparatory stages, launching and carrying out the communication campaign or program now takes priority. Together with this come monitoring the process of dissemination, transmission, and reception of programme inputs.
The management aspect also covers the management improvement process and the concept of leadership as they affect implementation of communication programmes.

===Monitoring and evaluation===
Monitoring enables the planners and implementors to answer the question: Are things going all right? Evaluation, on the other hand, provides answers to the question: So, did it work?
Together, monitoring and evaluation help planners and implementors:
* Achieve better understanding of how the communication programme is working;
* Make informal decisions regarding operations and adjust to changing conditions;
* Ensure most effective and efficient use of resources;
* Look at the extent to which the program/project is having or has had the desired impact; and
* Fine-tune future programme impact.
To help gauge programme impact on stakeholders, it is important to set up clear standards and indicators based on the objectives set. How much have the activities contributed to achieving objectives of key organizations? This can be gauged by comparing evaluation with baseline data, specifically those gathered during the PRCA.
More importantly, monitoring and evaluation data contribute to planning for program sustainability and self-sufficiency.

==Types of participation==

Participation can be used as a goal or as a tool for specific projects.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tufte, Mefalopulos|first=Thomas, Paolo|title=Participatory Communication|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTDEVCOMMENG/Resources/Participatorycommunication.pdf|publisher=The World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four categories below refer to different levels of participation and communication:

===Passive participation===
The stakeholders of a project essentially act as "empty vessels" and receive information. Feedback is minimal if at all and participation is assessed through methods such as head counts.

===Participation by consultation===
Researchers or "experts" pose questions to the stakeholders. Input can be provided at different points in time but the final analysis and decision-making power lies in the hands of the external professionals whom may or may not take the stakeholders' decisions into consideration.

===Participation by collaboration===
Groups of primary stakeholders are formed in order to participate in discussion and analysis. Objectives are predetermined. This method incorporates components of horizontal communication and capacity building among all stakeholders.

===Empowerment participation===
Primary stakeholders are capable and willing to become involved in the process and take part in decision-making. Outsiders are equal partners, but the stakeholders make the final decisions as ownership and control of the process rests in their hands. Knowledge exchange leads to solutions.

==Minga Peru case study==

Minga Peru is a non-profit organization formed to address issues of "social justice, gender equality, reproductive health, and human rights". Minga has targeted the northern Loreto region for its development of "communicative spaces" which hope to spark debate and participation from the community. In order to achieve these goals they have produced a radio program, started a community empowerment and leadership program and supported income generating activities.

These activities are community-based approaches as evidenced by editorial letters being sent to the radio program, use of youth correspondents which provides the community with access to and voice within the broadcast, and emphasis on social networking which has resulted in stronger social cohesion. The most prominent outcomes in the empowerment of women through self-confidence. Women are better able to develop professional and social networks and have improved capacity to handle health challenges.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Formally beginning in 2015, Phandeeyar provides funding and training for emerging [[startups]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar's Internet innovators emerge amid connectivity boom|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Myanmar-s-Internet-innovators-emerge-amid-connectivity-boom|website=Nikkei Asian Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phandeeyar also conducts trainings, hosts workshops, and holds competitions for startups within the digital sector.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Lanmadaw, Yangon, Myanmar (Burma) - panoramio (3).jpg|upright|thumb|175px|Yangon, Myanmar]]

In 2014, Phandeeyar emerged from a [[hackathon]] named "Code for Change Myanmar"&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lack of risk capital in Myanmar: David Madden, Phandeeyar|url=https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/we-believe-very-deeply-in-the-potential-of-the-tech-community-phandeeyars-david-madden-41822/|website=www.dealstreetasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where its founder and current CEO, [[David Madden (entrepreneur)|David Madden]], wanted to promote the growth of Myanmar's digital sector. Through this hackathon, politics and elections were addressed. 

Madden states the need for better financial support for emerging start-ups in Myanmar which also led to the creation of the accelerator.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|first1=Site designed and built by Hydrant|title=David Madden, Founder &amp; CEO, Phandeeyar: Myanmar Innovation Lab: Interview|url=https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/interview/david-madden-founder-ceo-phandeeyar-myanmar-innovation-lab/myanmar-2017|website=Oxford Business Group|language=en|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding ===

Phandeeyar's sponsors and investors include the [[Omidyar Network]] which has donated 2 million US dollars to the company, &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phandeeyar gets $2 million grant for tech start-ups|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/business/technology/20631-phandeeyar-gets-2-million-grant-for-tech-start-ups.html|website=The Myanmar Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Institute of Peace]], the [[Open Society Foundation]], and the [[Schmidt Family Foundation]].&lt;ref name="invest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Omidyar Network grant jumpstarts for-profit accelerator in Myanmar|url=https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/startups/omidyar-network-grant-jumpstarts-profit-accelerator-myanmar|website=Digital News Asia|language=en|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

David Madden states that Phandeeyar's objective is to connect those in the tech field with others actively working in the social sector through different events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madden and Soloff on the Power of the Smartphone|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/madden-and-soloff-on-the-power-of-the-smartphone-1438715401|website=Wall Street Journal|date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Events and Initiatives===

In 2015, Phandeeyar hosted a two week event event called "MaePaySoe" (translating to "let's vote")&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hackers in programming meet to prepare for the vote|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/business/technology/16485-hackers-in-programming-meet-to-prepare-for-the-vote.html|website=The Myanmar Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where more than one hundred web developers gathered to create technology which informs the general public about potential political candidates in Myanmar and the country's voting process.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt;
===Seed Funding===
In 2016, around fifteen to twenty startups were projected to be accepted into the accelerator in a three year span.&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; Phandeeyar also plans to invest around $2 million into startups in the near future. &lt;ref name=":100"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar: Phandeeyar sets up accelerator, to invest $200k in 8 startups in 2016 - DealStreetAsia|url=https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/phandeeyar-to-seed-fund-up-to-200000-through-their-first-tech-startup-accelerator-43871/|website=www.dealstreetasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the startups accepted, Phandeeyar would claim a 12 percent ownership of the companies. 
Those selected for Phandeeyar's 6 month training program would receive a funding of $25,000 to launch their ventures in addition to business partnerships to help with the early stages of their startups. &lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; These partnerships include leaders from regional companies such as the Myanmar Information Technology, CarsDB, [[Muru-D]]. and Golden Gate Ventures. &lt;ref name=":100"/&gt; Towards the end of the program, companies have the opportunity to pitch their startup ideas to [[venture capitalists]] and [[angel investors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Roundup (February 25)|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/business/business-roundup-february-25.html|website=The Irrawaddy|date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Serial Podcast.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]'' podcast being played through an [[iPhone]]]]

A '''podcast''' or generically '''netcast''', is an [[episode|episodic]] series of [[digital media|digital]] [[Digital audio|audio]] or [[Digital video|video]] [[Computer file|files]] which a user can [[download]] in order to listen to. It is often available for subscription, so that new episodes are automatically [[download]]ed via [[web syndication]] to the user's own local computer, mobile application, or [[portable media player]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/podcast |title=Definition of Podcast |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was originally suggested by [[Ben Hammersley]] as a [[portmanteau]] of "[[iPod]]" (a brand of [[portable media player|media player]]) and "[[broadcast]]".&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/podcast |title=Definition of podcast in English |website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=padding&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p038m811|title=The man who accidentally invented the word 'podcast' |last=Sawyer |first=Miranda |authorlink=Miranda Sawyer |date=November 20, 2015 |website=[[BBC Radio 4]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017|format=MP3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The files distributed are in audio format, but may sometimes include other file formats such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] or [[EPUB]]. Videos which are shared following a podcast model are sometimes called [[Podcast#Video podcasts|video podcasts]] or vodcasts.

The generator of a podcast maintains a central list of the files on a [[server (computing)|server]] as a [[web feed]] that can be accessed through the [[Internet]]. The listener or viewer uses special [[client (computing)|client]] [[application software|application]] [[software]] on a computer or media player, known as a [[List of podcatchers|podcatcher]], which accesses this web feed, checks it for updates, and downloads any new files in the series. This process can be automated to download new files automatically, which may seem to users as though new episodes are broadcast or "[[Push technology|pushed]]" to them. Files are stored locally on the user's device, ready for [[Online and offline|offline]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k1967&amp;pageid=icb.page23750 |title=Podcast Production |website=[[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710232048/http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k1967&amp;pageid=icb.page23750 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;This code enables specially designed software to locate and track new versions or episodes of a particular podcast&amp;nbsp;... |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different mobile applications available for people to use to subscribe and to listen to podcasts. Many of these applications allow users to download podcasts or to stream them on demand as an alternative to downloading. Many podcast players (apps as well as dedicated devices) allow listeners to skip around the podcast and control the playback speed.

Some have labeled podcasting as a [[Technological convergence|converged medium]] bringing together audio, [[World Wide Web|the web]], and [[portable media player]]s, as well as a [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive technology]] that has caused some individuals in the radio business to reconsider established practices and preconceptions about audiences, consumption, production, and distribution.&lt;ref name="Willipod"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=Richard |date=May 1, 2006 |title=Will the iPod Kill the Radio Star?

Podcasts are usually free of charge to listeners and can often be created for little to no cost, which sets them apart from the traditional model of "[[Gatekeeper|gate-kept]]" media and production tools. Podcast creators can monetize their podcasts by allowing companies to purchase [[advertising|ad]] time, as well as via sites such as [[Patreon]], which provides special extras and content to listeners for a fee. Podcasting is very much a [[Horizontalidad|horizontal]] media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freshminds.net/2011/07/horizontal-media-how-social-media-has-changed-journalism/ |title='Horizontal media' - how social media has changed journalism |last=Stratmann |first=Jo |date=July 20, 2011 |website=[[FreshMinds]] |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; form – producers are consumers, consumers may become producers, and both can engage in conversations with each other.&lt;ref name="Willipod" /&gt;

==Name==
"Podcast" is a [[portmanteau]] word, formed by combining "[[iPod]]" and "[[Broadcasting|broadcast]]".&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; The term "podcasting" as a name for the nascent technology was first suggested by [[The Guardian]] columnist and [[BBC]] journalist [[Ben Hammersley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia |title=Why online radio is booming |last=Hammersley |first=Ben  |authorlink=Ben Hammersley |date=February 12, 2004 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who invented it in early February 2004 while "[[wikt:pad out|padding out]]" an article for The Guardian newspaper.&lt;ref name= padding/&gt; Despite the etymology, the content can be accessed using any computer or similar device that can play media files. Use of the term "podcast" predated Apple's addition of formal support for podcasting to the iPod, or its [[iTunes]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4631051.stm |title=Apple brings podcasts into iTunes |date=June 28, 2005 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names for podcasting include "net cast", intended as a vendor-neutral term without the loose reference to the Apple iPod. This name is used by shows from the [[TWiT.tv]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/FAQ |title=FAQ - The Official TWiT Wiki |website=[[TWiT.tv]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources have also suggested the [[backronym]] "portable on demand" or "POD", for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-vista/create-your-own-podcast-what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-podcaster |title=Create your own podcast: What you need to know to be a podcaster |website=[[Microsoft Windows]] |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225095312/http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-vista/create-your-own-podcast-what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-podcaster |archivedate=2015-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of podcasting}}

Former [[MTV]] [[VJ (media personality)|video jockey]] [[Adam Curry]], in collaboration with [[Dave Winer]] – co-author of the [[RSS]] specification – is credited with coming up with the idea to automate the delivery and syncing of textual content to portable audio players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/21/entertainment/ca-podfather21 |title='Podfather' plots a radio hit of his own |last=Miller |first=Martin |date=May 21, 2006 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.voices.com/resources/articles/podcasting/history-of-podcasting |title=The Origins of Podcasting |last=Ciccarelli |first=Stephanie |date=April 4, 2015 |website=[[Voices.com]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Podcasting History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/podcasting1.htm |title=How Podcasting Works § Podcasting History |last=Watson |first=Stephanie |date=March 26, 2005 |website=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Podcasting, once an obscure method of spreading information, has become a recognized medium for distributing audio content, whether for corporate or personal use. Podcasts are similar to [[radio program]]s, but they are audio files. Listeners can play them at their convenience, using devices that have become more common than portable broadcast receivers.

The first application to make this process feasible was iPodderX, developed by August Trometer and Ray Slakinski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/technology_1/internet/1112804661/podcast/ |title=Podcast |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630060559/http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/technology_1/internet/1112804661/podcast/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |website=redOrbit |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, audio podcasts were doing what was historically accomplished via radio broadcasts, which had been the source of radio [[Talk radio|talk shows]] and [[All-news radio|news programs]] since the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Podcasting History" /&gt; This shift occurred as a result of the evolution of internet capabilities along with increased consumer access to cheaper hardware and software for audio recording and editing.

In October 2003, Matt Schichter launched his weekly chat show ''The BackStage Pass''. [[B.B. King]], [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Gavin DeGraw]], [[The Beach Boys]], and [[Jason Mraz]] were notable guests the first season. The hour long radio show was recorded live, transcoded to 16kbit/s audio for dial-up online streaming. Despite a lack of a commonly accepted identifying name for the medium at the time of its creation, ''The Backstage Pass'' which became known as ''Matt Schichter Interviews''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/matt-schichter-interviews/id1110551911?mt=2|title=Matt Schichter Interviews by Scared Goose Productions on Apple Podcasts|website=Apple Podcasts|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly believed to be the first podcast to be published online.

In August 2004, Adam Curry launched his show ''[[Daily Source Code]]''. It was a show focused on chronicling his everyday life, delivering news, and discussions about the development of podcasting, as well as promoting new and emerging podcasts. Curry published it in an attempt to gain traction in the development of what would come to be known as podcasting and as a means of testing the software outside of a lab setting. The name ''Daily Source Code'' was chosen in the hope that it would attract an audience with an interest in technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geoghegan |first1=Michael W.|last2=Klass |first2=Dan |date=November 4, 2007 |title=Podcast Solutions: The Complete Guide to Audio and Video Podcasting |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkAzn9TfL9gC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage |publisher=[[Apress]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-59059-905-1 |page=4 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Daily Source Code'' started at a grassroots level of production and was initially directed at podcast developers. As its audience became interested in the format, these developers were inspired to create and produce their own projects and, as a result, they improved the code used to create podcasts. As more people learned how easy it was to produce podcasts, a community of pioneer podcasters quickly appeared.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;

In June 2005, [[Apple Inc|Apple]] released [[iTunes]] 4.9 which added formal support for podcasts, thus negating the need to use a separate program in order to download and transfer them to a mobile device. While this made access to podcasts more convenient and widespread, it also effectively ended advancement of podcatchers by independent developers. Additionally, Apple issued [[cease and desist]] orders to many podcast application developers and service providers for using the term "iPod" or "Pod" in their products' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/09/24/with-pod-on-lockdown-apple-goes-after-podcast/ |title=With "pod" on lockdown, Apple goes after "podcast" |last=Blass |first=Evan |date=September 24, 2006 |website=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Podcasting icon.svg|thumb|The logo used by Apple to represent podcasting in its iTunes software.]]

Within a year, many podcasts from public radio networks like the [[BBC]], [[CBC Radio One]], [[NPR]], and [[Public Radio International]] placed many of their radio shows on the iTunes platform. In addition, major local radio stations like [[WNYC]] in New York City and [[WHYY-FM]] radio in Philadelphia, [[KCRW]] in Los Angeles placed their programs on their websites and later on the iTunes platform.

Concurrently, [[CNET]], ''[[This Week in Tech]]'', and later [[Bloomberg Radio]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'', and other for-profit companies provided podcast content, some using podcasting as their only distribution system.

===IP issues in trademark and patent law===
====Trademark applications====
Between February 10 and 25 March 2005, Shae Spencer Management, LLC of [[Fairport, New York]] filed a trademark application to register the term "podcast" for an "online prerecorded radio program over the internet". On September 9, 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) rejected the application, citing [[Wikipedia]]'s podcast entry as describing the history of the term. The company amended their application in March 2006, but the USPTO rejected the amended application as not sufficiently differentiated from the original. In November 2006, the application was marked as abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=78564869&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=documentSearch |title=Podcast trademark rejection documents |website=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 20, 2005, known trademarks that attempted to capitalize on podcast included: ePodcast, GodCast, GuidePod, MyPod, Pod-Casting, Podango, PodCabin, Podcast, Podcast Realty, Podcaster, PodcastPeople, Podgram PodKitchen, PodShop, and Podvertiser.&lt;ref name="Podcasting History" /&gt;

By February 2007, there had been 24 attempts to register trademarks containing the word "PODCAST" in the United States, but only "PODCAST READY" from ''Podcast Ready, Inc.'' was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?state=4810:al4odh.4.1&amp;f=toc&amp;a_search=&amp;p_s_ALL=PODCAST |title=List of US podcast trademarks |website=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apple trademark protections====
On September 26, 2004, it was reported that [[Apple Inc.]] had started to crack down on businesses using the string "POD", in product and company names. Apple sent a [[cease and desist]] letter that week to Podcast Ready, Inc., which markets an application known as "myPodder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.podcastready.com/info.php?section=8&amp;page=41 |title=Podcast Ready Receives Cease &amp; Desist from Apple Computer |last=Holliman |first=Russell |date=September 26, 2006 |website=Podcast Ready |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005015828/http://www.podcastready.com/info.php?section=8&amp;page=41 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers for Apple contended that the term "pod" has been used by the public to refer to Apple's music player so extensively that it falls under Apple's trademark cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2343732,00.asp |title=Apple's Legal Team Going After 'Pod' People |last=Heater |first=Brian |date=March 24, 2009 |website=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such activity was speculated to be part of a bigger campaign for Apple to expand the scope of its existing [[iPod]] trademark, which included trademarking "IPOD", "IPODCAST", and "POD".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2006/09/25/podcast-trademark-controversy/ |title=Podcast Trademark Controversy |last=Longo |first=Jeffrey |date=September 25, 2006 |website=[[MacRumors]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 16, 2006, the Apple Trademark Department stated that "Apple does not object to third-party usage of the generic term 'podcast' to accurately refer to podcasting services" and that "Apple does not license the term". However, no statement was made as to whether or not Apple believed they held rights to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theglobalgeekpodcast/309396084/sizes/l/ |title=Copy of the letter from Apple Trademark Department |author=Global Geek Podcast |website=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal Audio lawsuits====
[[Personal Audio LLC (patent holding company)|Personal Audio]], a company referred to as a "[[patent troll]]" by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]],&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/help-save-podcasting |title=Help Save Podcasting! |last=Nazer |first=Daniel |date=May 30, 2013 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed a patent on podcasting in 2009 for a claimed invention in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/patents/US8112504 |title=System for disseminating media content representing episodes in a serialized sequence |website=[[Google Patents]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Personal Audio started suing high-profile podcasters for royalties,&lt;ref name="EFF" /&gt; including ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'' and the ''[[HowStuffWorks]]'' podcast. US Congressman [[Peter DeFazio]]'s previously proposed "SHIELD Act" intended to curb patent trolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/podcasting-community-faces-patent-troll-threat-eff-wants-help |title=Podcasting Community Faces Patent Troll Threat; EFF Wants to Help |last=Samuels |first=Julie |date=February 5, 2013 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |quote=Personal Audio is claiming that it owns a patent that covers podcasting technology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] filed a petition with the US Trademark Office to invalidate the Personal Audio patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/cases/eff-v-personal-audio-llc |title=EFF v. Personal Audio LLC |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation announced that Adam Carolla had settled with Personal Audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/08/good-bad-and-ugly-adam-carollas-settlement-podcasting-troll |title=The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Adam Carolla’s Settlement with the Podcasting Troll |last=Nazer |first=Daniel |date=August 18, 2014 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2015, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office invalidated five provisions of Personal Audio's podcasting patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/04/10/how-the-government-just-protected-your-favorite-podcasts/ |title=How the government just protected some of your favorite podcasts |last=Fung |first=Brian |date=April 10, 2015 |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
===Enhanced podcasts===
An '''enhanced podcast''' can display images synchronized with audio. These can contain chapter markers, [[hyperlink]]s, and artwork, all of which is synced to a specific program or device. When an enhanced podcast is played within its specific program or device, all the appropriate information should be displayed at the same time and in the same window, making it easier to display materials.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Podcast novels===
A '''podcast novel''' (also known as a '''serialized audiobook''' or '''podcast audiobook''') is a [[Literature|literary]] format that combines the concepts of a podcast and an [[audiobook]]. Like a traditional [[novel]], a podcast novel is a work of long literary fiction; however, this form of the novel is recorded into episodes that are delivered online over a period of time and in the end available as a complete work for download. The episodes may be delivered automatically via [[RSS]], through a website, blog, or another syndication method. These files are either listened to directly on a user's computer or loaded onto a portable media device to be listened to later.

The types of novels that are podcasted vary from new works from new authors that have never been [[Printing|printed]],&lt;ref name="myb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ki0pE7i7FM |title=Marketing your book in the internet age |author=Creative Choices |date=August 6, 2009 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aftv"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/books/01podb.html |title=Authors Find Their Voice, and Audience, in Podcasts |last=Newman |first=Andrew Adam |date=March 1, 2007 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to well-established authors that have been around for years,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} to classic works of literature that have been in print for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4532526.stm |title=Christmas Carol gets free podcast |date=December 15, 2005 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://librivox.org/short-story-collection-001/ |title=Short Story Collection Vol. 001 |website=[[LibriVox]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same style as an audiobook, podcast novels may be elaborately narrated with separate voice actors for each character and sound effects, similar to a [[Radio drama|radio play]]. Other podcast novels have a single narrator reading the text of the story with little or no sound effects.

Podcast novels are distributed over the [[Internet]], commonly on a [[Blog|weblog]]. Podcast novels are released in episodes on a regular schedule (e.g., once a week) or irregularly as each episode is released when completed. They can either be downloaded manually from a website or blog or be delivered automatically via [[RSS]] or another method of syndication.  Ultimately, a serialized podcast novel becomes a completed [[audiobook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1872381,00.html |title=Podcasting Your Novel: Publishing's Next Wave? |last=Florin |first=Hector |date=January 31, 2009 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some podcast novelists give away a free podcast version of their book as a form of promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Take-my-book-It-s-free-3288454.php |title=Take my book.

===Video podcasts===
[[File:The Crab Nebula NASA.ogv|thumb|A video podcast on the [[Crab Nebula]] by [[NASA]]]]

A '''video podcast''' (sometimes shortened to "'''vodcast'''") includes [[video clip]]s. [[Web television]] series are often distributed as video podcasts.

''[[Dead End Days]]'' (2003–2004) is commonly believed to be the first video podcast. That serialized [[Black comedy|dark comedy]] about zombies was broadcast from 31 October 2003 through 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-video-podcast.htm |title=What is a Video Podcast? |website=wiseGEEK |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the spread of the [[Internet]] and the use of Internet broadband connection [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], which helps to identify various applications, a faster connection to the Internet has been created and a wide amount of communication has been created. Video podcasts have become extremely popular online and are often presented as short video clips, usually excerpts of a longer recording. Video clips are being used on pre-established websites, and increasing numbers of websites are being created solely for the purpose of hosting video clips and podcasts. Video podcasts are being streamed on intranets and extranets, and private and public networks, and are taking communication through the Internet to new levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.inxpo.com/from-association-meetings-to-corporate-events-video-is-everywhere/ |title=From Association Meetings to Corporate Events, Video is Everywhere |last=Shiao |first=Dennis |date=March 17, 2011 |website=INXPO |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most video clips are now submitted and produced by individuals.{{Nonspecific|date=December 2012}} Video podcasts are also being used for web television, commonly referred to as Web TV, a rapidly growing genre of digital entertainment that uses various forms of [[new media]] to deliver to an audience both reruns of shows or series and content created or delivered originally online via broadband and mobile networks, web television shows, or web series. Examples include [[Amazon Video]], [[Hulu]], and [[Netflix]].  Other types of video podcasts used for web television may be short-form, anywhere from 2–9 minutes per episode, typically used for advertising, video blogs, amateur filming, journalism, and convergence with traditional media.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Video podcasting is also helping build businesses, especially in the sales and marketing sectors. Through video podcasts, businesses both large and small can advertise their wares and services in a modern, cost-effective way. In the past, big businesses had better access to expensive studios where sophisticated advertisements were produced, but now even the smallest businesses can create high-quality media with just a camera, editing software, and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/podcasting4.htm |title=How Podcasting Works § Video Podcasts |last=Watson |first=Stephanie |date=March 26, 2005 |website=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a two-year study, 2012-2013, conducted by a South African university a question was raised; over the years of podcast development, is podcasting socially inclusive. The results of this study concluded with minor quarks, podcasting is socially inclusive.&lt;ref name="Golden Age"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=Richard |date=November 2015 |title=A Golden Age of Podcasting? Evaluating Serial in the Context of Podcast Histories |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19376529.2015.1083363 |url-access=registration |journal=Journal of Radio &amp; Audio Media |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=170–178 |publisher=EBSCOhost |doi=10.1080/19376529.2015.1083363 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oggcast===
An '''oggcast''' is a podcast recorded and distributed exclusively in the [[Vorbis]] audio codec with the [[Ogg]] [[Digital container format|container format]], and/or other similarly free codecs/formats.&lt;ref name="Djere"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://djere.com/node/183 |title=The Definition of An Oggcast |last=Djere |first=Rex |date=December 25, 2011 |website=Djere |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072050/https://djere.com/node/183 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a podcast distributed both in the non-free [[MP3]] format and the free [[Ogg]] format would not technically meet the definition of an oggcast. In contrast, a podcast distributed in both the Vorbis and [[Speex]] codecs would meet the strict definition of an oggcast. The term oggcast is a combination of the word "ogg" from the term [[Ogg Vorbis]], and the syllable "cast", from "[[Broadcasting|broadcast]]".

The term was coined for the fifth season of the ''Gnu World Order'' by [[Klaatu (podcaster)|Klaatu]] in 2010, when the show declared itself "the world's first oggcast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnuworldorder.info/audiophile/archive/season5/index5.html |title=The Bad Apples - The World's First OGGcast! |website=Gnu World Order |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, the show was one of the few that released only in free formats, with no MP3 feed as an option. This gave way to other shows using the term, with hosts gathering in the {{Freenode|oggcastplanet}} [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel on the [[Freenode]] network to compare notes.

''[[The Linux Link Tech Show]]'', one of the longer running Linux podcasts still in production, has a program in the Ogg Vorbis format in its archives from January 7, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tlltsarchive.org/archives/tllts_14-01-07-04.ogg |title=The Linux Link Tech Show |last=Washko |first=Dann |last2=Fessenden |first2=Linc |date=January 7, 2004 |website=TLLTS Archive |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oggcasters tend to be broadcasters who prefer not to use audio and video codecs that have patent and/or licensing restrictions, such as the [[MP3]] codec.&lt;ref name="Djere" /&gt;

Recording and distributing podcasts in the Ogg Vorbis audio format has advantages. [[Mozilla]] [[Firefox]] and [[Google Chrome]] web browsers both support playing Vorbis files directly in the browser without requiring plugins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Mozilla-Firefox-3-1-on-It-039-s-Way-to-Setting-Web-Video-Standard-91432.shtml |title=Mozilla Firefox 3.1 on Its Way to Setting Web Video Standard |last=Constantin |first=Lucian |date=August 5, 2008 |website=[[Softpedia]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-chrome-gets-html-video-support/ |title=Google Chrome gets HTML video support |last=Shankland |first=Stephen |date=May 28, 2009 |website=[[CNET]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorbis may produce better audio quality with a smaller file size than alternative codecs such as [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or MP3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eskimo.com/~nanook/knowledge/oggvorbis.html |title=Ogg Vorbis - An Alternative to MP3 |website=Eskimo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202172710/http://www.eskimo.com/~nanook/knowledge/oggvorbis.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has not been proven conclusively. Ogg Vorbis is not bound by patents and is considered "free software" in the sense that no corporate entity owns the rights to the format. Some people feel that this is a safer container for their multimedia content for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/playogg/en/ |title=PlayOgg! |website=[[Free Software Foundation]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, oggcasters can generally not reach as wide of an audience as more traditional podcasters. This is mainly due to the lack of native Ogg Vorbis support in [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]] and Apple's [[Safari web browser]], and the lack of Ogg Vorbis support in many mobile audio devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wewantogg.com/ |title=Ogg Vorbis Support for Internet Explorer and Safari |website=We Want Ogg |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918203524/http://www.wewantogg.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oggcast Planet maintains a central list of oggcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://monsterb.github.io/ocp/ |title=Oggcast Planet |author=monsterb |website=Oggcast Planet |date=March 14, 2010 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political podcast===
{{Further|Political podcast}}

A '''political podcast''' focuses on current events, lasts usually a half hour to an hour, often with a relaxed and conversational tone, and features journalists and politicians and pollsters and writers and others with credentials in the [[public sphere]]. Most political podcasts have a host-guest interview format and are broadcast each week based on the news cycle. Political podcasts have blossomed in the past few years in the [[United States]] because of the long election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/conservative-podcasts-ricochet/ |title=You Heard Right: Conservatives Get Their Very Own Podcast Network |last=Locke |first=Charley |date=July 6, 2016 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |quote= ...&amp;nbsp;this election cycle is bringing listeners an unprecedented spate of opinionated incredulity.

===Podguide===
A '''podguide''' is an enhanced [[audio tour]] podcast.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is a single [[audio file]] where each chapter displays a picture and a number of what to look at a certain stopover. The numbers correspond to the numbers on a map that can be downloaded via the link incorporated into the artwork of the chapters in the podguide. Podguides are in the [[m4a]] format and can only be listened to through [[iTunes]] or an [[iPod]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is like a soundseeing tour but with pictures and a map, so users can take the tour themselves.

==Uses==
{{Main|Uses of podcasting}}

Communities use collaborative podcasts to support multiple contributors podcasting through generally simplified processes, and without having to host their own individual feeds. A community podcast can also allow members of the community (related to the podcast topic) to contribute to the podcast in many different ways. This method was first used for a series of podcasts hosted by the Regional Educational Technology Center at [[Fordham University]] in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Anders Gronstedt]] explores how businesses like [[IBM]] and [[Dell EMC|EMC]] use podcasts as an employee training and communication channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gronstedt |first=Anders |date=June 2007 |title=Employees Get an Earful |url=https://hbr.org/2007/06/employees-get-an-earful |journal=[[Harvard Business Review]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gronstedt |first=Anders |date=May 3, 2007 |title=Basics of Podcasting |url=http://gronstedtgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Infoline_Gronstedt_Basics_of_Podcasting.pdf |publisher=[[Association for Talent Development|ASTD]] |isbn=1-56286-488-2 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The podcast industry is very profitable. Over 50 million people listen to podcasts each month. A small, yet efficient number of listeners are also podcast creators. Creating a podcast is reasonably inexpensive. It requires just a microphone, laptop or other personal computer, and a room with some sound blocking. Podcast creators tend to have a good listener base because of their relationships with the listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Smith |first=Steve |date=November 22, 2016 |title=Podcasts: Can They Hear Us Now |url=http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/Column/Follow-the-Money/Podcasts-Can-They-Hear-Us-Now-114172.htm |magazine=EContent |publisher=[[Information Today, Inc.]] |volume=39 |issue=8 |page=9 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7880">'''Prohibitionism''' is a [[legal philosophy]] and [[political theory]] often used in [[lobbying]] which holds that citizens will abstain from actions if the actions are typed as unlawful (i.e. prohibited) and the prohibitions are enforced by law enforcement.&lt;ref name=cantystrategies&gt;C Canty, A Sutton. ''Strategies for community-based drug law enforcement: From prohibition to harm reduction''; in T Stockwell, PJ Gruenewald, JW Toumbourou, WLoxley W, eds. ''Preventing Harmful Substance Use: The Evidence Base for Policy and Practice.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2005. pp. 225-236.&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy has been the basis for many acts of [[statutory law]] throughout history, most notably when a large group of a given population disapproves of and/or feels threatened by an activity in which a smaller group of that population engages, and seeks to render that activity legally prohibited.&lt;ref name=cantystrategies/&gt;

== Examples ==
Acts of prohibition have included [[sumptuary law|prohibitions on types of clothing]] (and [[Public nudity|prohibitions on lack of clothing]]), prohibitions on [[gambling]] and [[striptease|exotic dancing]], the [[prohibition of drugs]] (for example, [[prohibition of alcohol|alcohol prohibition]] and [[cannabis prohibition]]), [[smoking ban|prohibitions on tobacco smoking]], and [[gun prohibition]]. Indeed, the period of [[Prohibition in the United States]] between 1920 and 1933 due to the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]] often is referred to simply as "[[Prohibition]]", as is the "[[War on Drugs]]" that succeeded it. &lt;br /&gt;
An additional example, called ''nettle war'': Since 2002 in [[France]] the sale of nettle liquid manure was prohibited, and since 2006, unauthorized plant protection products (such as nettle liquid manure) to sell, own and operate.  Even [[advertising]] and recommendations for these products were not allowed. Only since 2011, it was legalized again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000023912654 Decree 2011: Nettles were legalized again (fr)] Retrieved 16 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The film by [[Arte]] about it was completed in 2010 (''Nettle-war, mysterious plants - Nettle'', 42:04 minutes)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eraclito450.blogspot.de/2013/09/brennessel-krieg-geheimnisvolle.html nettle-war in France] Retrieved 16 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
The success of a measure of prohibitionism has been criticized as often depending too much upon effective enforcement of the relevant legislation. Some people{{Who|date=July 2011}} have argued this is because the majority of the targets of prohibitionism are in the category of [[victimless crime]], where they claim the harm that comes from the crime is non-existent, questionable, or only to the person who performs the act and even then the magnitude of the harm being relatively small.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Under this interpretation enforcement becomes a conflict between violation of statue and violation of free will.{{Why?|date=July 2011}} Since the acts prohibited often are enjoyable, enforcement is often the most harmful choice to the individual. This sometimes results in laws which rarely are enforced by anybody who does not have a financial or personal motivation to do so.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The difficulty of enforcing prohibitionist laws also criticized as resulting in selective enforcement, wherein the enforcers select the people they wish to prosecute based on other criteria, resulting in [[discrimination]] based on races, culture, nationality, or financial status. For example, [[United States|American]] philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] has criticized drug prohibition as being a technique of [[social control]] of the "so-called dangerous classes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20020208.htm Noam Chomsky, "On the War on Drugs", ''Week Online'', DRCNet, February 8, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prohibitionism based laws have the added problem of calling attention to the behavior that they are attempting to prohibit.  This can make the behavior interesting and exciting, and cause its popularity to increase. This is essentially in relation with the [[Streisand effect]].

'''Public intoxication''', also known as "'''drunk and disorderly'''" and '''drunk in public''', is a [[summary offense]] in some countries rated to public cases or displays of [[alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]]. Public intoxication laws vary widely from jurisdiction, but usually require some obvious display of intoxicated incompetence or behavior disruptive/obnoxious to [[public-order crime|public order]] before the charge is levied.

{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
While it is technically illegal in most [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]] of [[Australia]] to be drunk and disorderly, most Australian police are relatively lenient about public intoxication. They generally transport the IP ("Intoxicated Person") to his or her residence or temporary detention at a police station or other welfare establishment until the person is sober.

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] being "drunk in a public place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Offences Act 1966|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/soa1966189/s13.html|publisher=Australian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "drunk and disorderly in a public place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Offences Act 1966|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/soa1966189/s14.html|publisher=Australian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are separate offences contained in the ''Summary Offences Act 1966'' which have their own power of arrest. Recent changes to legislation allow police to issue an infringement notice for these offences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infringements (General Regulations ) 2006 - Schedule 3 Section 10AA|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/ir2006325/sch3.html|publisher=Australian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the traditional method of charging and bailing the offender to the Magistrates' Court. The current fine attached to the infringement notice is $590 for a first offence and $1,100 for a subsequent offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tough new laws to tackle drunken louts|url=http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/322-tough-new-laws-to-tackle-drunken-louts.html|publisher=Premier of Victoria|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person arrested for being drunk or drunk and disorderly is held at the Melbourne Custody Centre or the cells at a police station or placed in the care of a friend or relative.  

In [[New South Wales]] police have the discretion to issue "on the spot" fines or infringement notices for "drunk in public", a fine that costs the individual over $480 (4 penalty units).{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Community Legal Centres across the state complain about these fines and the impact it has had on various vulnerable members of the community, including young people, the homeless and minority groups.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Prosecution (charging) is generally only considered if the person is violent or other offenses have been committed.

As an example, a "Drunk and Disorderly" Fine in the State of New South Wales starts at $550.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

As of February 2009, local councils in the state of New South Wales are not allowed to charge people who drink in alcohol-free zones; they are only permitted to confiscate the alcohol of the intoxicated person.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Canada==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2010}}
In [[Canada]], liquor laws are made by the [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and not the [[Government of Canada|federal government]].

In [[British Columbia]], drinking in public and public [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]] are offenses.  If an event is to take place in public with alcohol it must have a permit.

In Ontario, drinking in public and public intoxication are offenses. Having an open container in public garners a $125 fine. Public drunkenness garners a $65 fine and detainment until sober. If an event is to take place in public with alcohol it must have a permit.

While liquor laws are similar from [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] to province, the laws in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territories]] tend to be substantially different. For instance, in the [[Northwest Territories]] public intoxication can result in imprisonment or detention in a medical facility for up to 24 hours (NWT Liquor Act).

[[File:Stonehenge trouble on stones.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a group of people standing outside at nighttime, two of whom are barechested and one of whom is balancing on a stone|In the United Kingdom, the police normally only enforce the laws against public intoxication if the intoxicated person is unable to act in a reasonable manner, as demonstrated by such activities as climbing on [[Stonehenge]] ''(pictured)''.]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], there are a number of offences dealing with intoxication, which vary between the constituent countries.

In a public place, it is an offence to be:
*drunk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1052305&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1052313 |title=section 12 Licensing Act 1872 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*drunk and disorderly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1251271&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1251348 |title=section 91, Criminal Justice Act 1967 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also an offence to be drunk:
*while boarding, or while on board, an aircraft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=3635635&amp;ActiveTextDocId=3635866 |title=section 139, Air Navigation Order 2009 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*while in charge of a child under 7 years old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=licensing&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=7&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1066805&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1066810&amp;filesize=3498 |title=section 2, Licensing Act 1902 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*while travelling to a "designated sporting event" (usually professional football matches) on [[public transport]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1300758&amp;activetextdocid=1300761 section 1, Sporting  Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985]&lt;/ref&gt; or a vehicle with eight seats or more&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1300758&amp;activetextdocid=1300762section 1A, Sporting   Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;
*while in, or attempting to enter, a "designated sporting ground" (a football ground) during a designated sporting event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/57/section/2 section 2], Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|police]] will only get involved if the person is so drunk they are unable to act in a reasonable manner, such as passing out on the street. In that case typically the police will, depending on the circumstances, help the intoxicated person on their way or place the person in a police station cell until [[Sobriety|sober]].  Once fit to be dealt with the detained person will normally either be cautioned, be issued with a [[Penalty Notice for Disorder]] (PND – £90 fine in ticket form) or bailed to appear at the local [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|court]]. The court in turn may issue a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] (up to level 1 or level 3 on the [[standard scale#United Kingdom|standard scale]] depending on the offence charged).

There are also many more specific offences, including driving a motor vehicle while drunk (or being found 'drunk in charge')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880052_en_2] - [[Road Traffic Act 1998]], ss.4-5&lt;/ref&gt; and riding a cycle while unfit through drink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880052_en_3] - [[Road Traffic Act 1998]], s.30&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the police have the power (although not the obligation) to confiscate any alcohol which is being consumed in public by those under 18, and [[local government|local authorities]] have the power to prohibit alcohol consumption in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/ukpga_20010016_en_2] - [[Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001]], ss.12-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]], drinking in public is not a crime and instead, local governments must specify that alcohol is banned in an area before it is considered a crime to drink in that location. Being drunk in public is not specifically an offense unless the person who is intoxicated is a public nuisance, in which case they may be dealt with for 'disturbing the peace'. This will usually result in being taken home, or otherwise taken to a police cell until sober.

==United States==
[[File:HomelessPeople-BaltimoreMD.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a man and a woman lying on a sidewalk, the woman wearing one white shoe while its match lies beside her, the man wearing two shoes|Public intoxication laws in the United States vary from state to state, and some states consider it a misdemeanor to obstruct sidewalks as a result of intoxication.]]
Laws in the United States regarding [[drunkenness]] vary widely from state to state.

===1968 Constitutional challenge===
In 1968, in the case of ''[[Powell v. Texas]]'', the [[Texas]] law against public intoxication was challenged in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] for alleged violation of [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]], which forbids [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. The court upheld the law, ruling that making a crime of public intoxication was neither cruel nor unusual.

===State public intoxication laws today===
{{See also|Alcohol laws of the United States}}
*[[California]]: California Penal Code 647(f) considers public intoxication a [[misdemeanor]]. The code describes public intoxication as someone who displays intoxication to liquor, drugs, controlled substances or [[toluene]] and demonstrates an inability to care for themselves or others, or interferes or obstructs the free use of streets, sidewalks or other public way. California Penal Code 647(g) affords law enforcement the option to take an individual fitting the arrest criteria for 647(f), and no other crime, into civil protective custody if a "sobering facility" is available.  Essentially, the detainee agrees to remain at the location until the facility's staff consents to their departure; usually after four hours and upon the belief that the detainee is safe to look after themselves.   Not every municipality in California has such a facility.  Also, if a person is being combative and/or is under the influence of drugs, they will be taken to jail.  Unlike a person who is taken to jail, a civil detainee under 647(g) is not later prosecuted in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/pen/639-653.1.html |title=CAL. PEN. CODE § 639 : California Code - Section 639 |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Colorado]]: Public intoxication in the state of Colorado is not punished with criminal or civil penalties. Instead, state law prohibits the passing of local laws that penalize public intoxication, but state law provides for the creation of patrols trained to provide assistance to intoxicated and incapacitated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/colorado-public-intoxication-laws.htm |title=Colorado Public Intoxication Laws |date= |accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]:  In Georgia, public intoxication is a class B misdemeanor.  Public intoxication is defined as a person who shall be and appear in an intoxicated condition in any public place or within the curtilage of any private residence not his own other than by invitation of the owner or lawful occupant, which condition is made manifest by boisterousness, by indecent condition or act, or by vulgar, profane, loud, or unbecoming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexis-nexis.com/hottopics/gacode/default.asp |title=LexisNexis Custom Solution: Georgia Code Research Tool |publisher=Lexis-nexis.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Indiana]]: In Indiana, public intoxication is a class B misdemeanor, punishable with up to 180 days in jail, and a $1000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title35/ar50/ch3.html |title=Indiana Code 35-50-3 |publisher=In.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, simply being intoxicated in public is no longer a crime. The person must also be, (1) endangering the person's life; (2) endangering the life of another person;(3) breaching the peace or is in imminent danger of breaching the peace; or (4) is harassing, annoying, or alarming another person. (See IC 7.1-5-1-3).
*[[Iowa]]: The Code of Iowa Sec 123.46 states that "a person shall not be intoxicated or simulate intoxication in a public place". Public Intoxication is a Simple Misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 30 days' jail and a $1,000 fine. Aggravated Public Intoxication (3rd or subsequent Offense) is an Aggravated Misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 2 years in prison. As of 2013, Johnson County, home of the University of Iowa had the highest arrest rate for public intoxication of any county in the state, at 8.28 per 1,000 residents.
*[[Kansas]]: Being drunk in public in Kansas is not a criminal offense. Kansas statute 65-4059 states "No county or city shall adopt any local law, ordinance, resolution or regulation having the force of law rendering public intoxication by alcohol in and of itself or being a common drunkard or being found in enumerated places in an intoxicated condition, an offense, a violation, or the subject of criminal penalties."
*[[Minnesota]]: Public intoxication is not a crime in Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes?id=340A.902|title=340A.902 - 2015 Minnesota Statutes|website=www.revisor.mn.gov|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cities can enact laws against public intoxication, such as the City of [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ci.stcloud.mn.us/106/Code-of-Ordinances|title=Code of Ordinances {{!}} St. Cloud, MN - Official Website|website=ci.stcloud.mn.us|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Missouri]] has no state public intoxication law. Missouri's [[Alcohol laws of Missouri|permissive alcohol laws]] both protect people from suffering any criminal penalty (including arrest) for the mere act of being drunk in public, and prohibit local jurisdictions from enacting criminal public intoxication laws on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/06700003051.HTML|title=Section: 067.0305 Counties or cities not to arrest or punish for public intoxication.  RSMO 67.305|website=www.moga.mo.gov|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Montana]] state law states that public intoxication is not a crime. However, the law allows law enforcement to take an intoxicated person home, or to detain them, if they are a danger to themselves or others. The law also states that no record can be made that indicates the person was arrested or detained for being intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/53/24/53-24-107.htm |title=Article 53-24-107 of the Montana Code |publisher=Leg.mt.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nevada]] has no state public intoxication law. Nevada state law both protects people from suffering any criminal penalty (including arrest) for the mere act of being drunk in public, and prohibits local jurisdictions from enacting criminal public intoxication laws on their own.
*[[Oregon]]: The state has no laws against public intoxication and actively bans local intoxication ordinances in §430.402.  "However, if the person is incapacitated, the health of the person appears to be in immediate danger, or the police have reasonable cause to believe the person is dangerous to self or to any other person, the person shall be taken by the police to an appropriate treatment facility." § 430.399 
*[[Texas]]: Public intoxication is a Class C misdemeanor&lt;ref&gt;Texas Penal Code Section 49.02.&lt;/ref&gt; (Class C misdemeanors are punishable by fine only not to exceed $500&lt;ref&gt;Texas Penal Code Section 12.23.&lt;/ref&gt;).  However, if the offender is a minor, harsher penalties apply (especially if a two-time prior offender in which case jail time can be ordered).&lt;ref&gt;Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code Section 106.071.&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 49.01 of the Penal Code, which legally defines "intoxication", includes both a blood alcohol content greater than 0.08 but also defines it as "not having the normal use of mental or physical faculties by reason of the introduction of alcohol, a controlled substance, a drug, a dangerous drug, a combination of two or more of those substances, or any other substance into the body"; thus, a breathalyzer or field sobriety test is not required to prove public intoxication.  This low standard of proof has led to criticism that officers are using "public intoxication" as a means of harassment, especially towards minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2010/02/26/texas-public-intoxication-laws |title=Texas Public Intoxication Laws Allow for Arrest Without Intoxication. Or Even Drinking. - Hit &amp; Run |publisher=Reason.com |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Virginia]] criminalizes public intoxication under section 18.2-388 of the Code of Virginia. It is punishable by a fine of up to $250. 
*[[Wisconsin]] also does not have a state public intoxication law although municipalities may pass city ordinances prohibiting public intoxication.  Public intoxication is legal in [[Milwaukee]], however, public drinking is not.

The concept of race or ethnicity in contemporary [[Singapore]] emerged from [[British Empire|British colonial]] attitudes towards race. Today, the Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others (CMIO) model is the dominant organising framework of '''race in Singapore'''.&lt;ref name="TanE"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Rituals and Riots: Ethnic Pluralism and Social Cohesion in Singapore|last=Tan|first=Eugene|publisher=Institute of Policy Studies and Eastern Universities Press|year=2004|isbn=|editor-last=Lai|editor-first=Ah Eng|location=|pages=65–97|chapter=“We, the Citizens of Singapore …”: Multiethnicity, its Evolution and its Aberrations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Race informs government policies on a variety of issues such as political participation, public housing and education.&lt;ref name="TanE"/&gt;  However, the state’s management of race, as well as the relevance of the CMIO model, has been a point of contention amongst some in recent years.

== Historical background ==
The practice of classifying the local population based on their races or ethnicities was born out the British colonial practices.&lt;ref name="Purushotam"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southeast Asian Identities: Culture and the Politics of Representation in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand|last=Purushotam|first=Nirmala|publisher=ISEAS|year=1998|isbn=|editor-last=Khan|editor-first=Joel S.|location=Singapore|pages=51–94|chapter=Disciplining Difference: “Race” in Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Race categories were enshrined through local censuses and the issuance of identity cards. In the early British censuses of British Malaya, racial lines were often drawn by birthplace and linguistic or linguistic group. In these censuses, labels such as ‘Hokkien’, ‘Boyanese’ and ‘Bengali’ being used. In the 1891 census, races began to be grouped into broader categories such as Chinese, Malay, and Indian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirschman|first=Charles|date=1987|title=The Meaning and Measurement of Ethnicity in Malaysia: An Analysis of Census Classifications|jstor=2056899|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=46|issue=3|pages=555–582|doi=10.2307/2056899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up till the 20th century, the largely first and second-generation immigrant population retained strong ties to their respective homelands. These communities continued to be influenced by the ideological movements in their homelands. Such movements included the [[Chinese Civil War|Chinese civil war]], the [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence in then-British India]], and the decolonisation efforts in peninsula Malaya and Indonesia. As such, each immigrant community maintained their own sense of indigeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chua|first=Beng Huat|date=2005|title=Taking Group Rights Seriously: Multiracialism in Singapore (Working Paper No.124)|url=https://www.murdoch.edu.au/Research-capabilities/Asia-Research-Centre/_document/working-papers/wp124.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Singapore was part of the Federation of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965, [[History of Singapore#Racial tension|inter-racial tensions were rife]], culminating in incidents such as [[1964 race riots in Singapore|the 1964 Race Riots]]. At the same time, Singaporean political leaders such as Lee Kuan Yew began to advocate for a “[[Malaysian Malaysia]]”, opposing the Malaysian Federal Government’s vision of an ethnic-based Malay Malaysia.&lt;ref name="TanE"/&gt;

After Singapore’s split from Malaysia, the Singapore government pushed for the development of a “Singaporean Singapore” identity based on racial equality, with race acting as a secondary identifier alongside the Singaporean national identity.&lt;ref name="TanE"/&gt;  Special rights for Malays were legislated into the Singapore Constitution, symbolically recognising the community as the indigenous people of the land. Singapore also formally adopted four official languages - English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil - and implemented a bilingual education policy.

==Government policies==
According to the [[Immigration and Checkpoints Authority|Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA)]], the child’s race registered on their Birth Certificate “can follow that of the child's father, mother or an acceptable mixed race if the parents are of different races.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority - FAQs &gt;&gt; Birth/Death Registration - Birth Registration|url=http://www.ifaq.gov.sg/ICA/apps/fcd_faqmain.aspx?FAQ=2102404|website=Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority|accessdate=26 March 2018|language=en-us|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race field cannot be left blank during registration. If parents cannot decide on their child’s race at the time of registration, the child's race is provisionally recorded as the father's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority - FAQs &gt;&gt; Birth/Death Registration - Birth Registration|url=http://www.ifaq.gov.sg/ICA/apps/fcd_faqmain.aspx?FAQ=235808|website=Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority|accessdate=26 March 2018|language=en-us|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The option to record a child’s race as double-barrelled (e.g. Chinese-Indian) was introduced in 2010 by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoe|first1=Yeen Nie|title=Singaporeans of mixed race allowed to "double barrel" race in IC|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com:80/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1030142/1/.html|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=26 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206100917/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1030142/1/.html|archivedate=6 February 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, mixed-race Singaporeans were allowed to choose between either of their parents' races and no allowance was made for mixed-race children, with the exception of [[Eurasians in Singapore|Eurasians]]. For relevant Government policies (e.g. the [[Race in Singapore#Public Housing|Ethnic Integration Policy]]), the first component of a double-barrelled race is used.&lt;ref name="ICA"&gt;{{cite web|title=ICA - Greater Flexibility with Implementation of Double-Barrelled Race Option from 1 January 2011|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=12443|website=Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority|accessdate=29 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729133759/https://www.ica.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=12443|archivedate=29 July 2017|language=en-us|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singaporeans are allowed to change their race twice: once before the age of 21, and once at or after the age of 21. They would have to execute a Statutory Declaration stating their reason(s) for the change, and undertaking not to change their race again.&lt;ref name="ICA" /&gt;

===Constitution===
Racial equality and non-discrimination are set out in Article 12 of the Singapore Constitution, which states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;"12.—(1)  All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.
(2)  Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution, there shall be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion, race, descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.
(3)  This Article does not invalidate or prohibit —
(a)	any provision regulating personal law; or

The Constitution also recognises the special position of Malays as the indigenous people of the land in Article 152:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;"152.—(1)  It shall be the responsibility of the Government constantly to care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore.
(2)  The Government shall exercise its functions in such manner as to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 152, Constitution of the Republic of Singapore|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=P1XIII-#pr152-|website=Singapore Statutes Online|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Language policies ===

The four official languages (English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil) are recognised in Article 153 the Singapore Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963#pr153A-|title=Article 153A, Constitution of the Republic of Singapore|last=|first=|date=|website=Singapore Statutes Online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108113132/https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963#pr153A%2D|archive-date=2017-11-08|dead-url=yes|access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is the language of administration,&lt;ref name="TanE"/&gt; and is also seen as a common language for the different races to communicate with one another.

===Parliamentary and presidential elections===
{{See also|Elections in Singapore}}
According to the Parliamentary Elections Act, each [[Group Representation Constituency|Group Representation Constituency (GRC)]] must include one member of the minority race such as a Malay or Indian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 8A, Parliamentary Elections Act|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PEA1954?ProvIds=P1I-#pr8A-|website=Singapore Statutes Online|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[by-elections in Singapore|by-election]] need not be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, even if there are no other minority candidates in that GRC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nur Asyiqin Mohamad Salleh|title=No by-election if minority MP leaves GRC, says Chun Sing|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapolitics/no-by-election-if-minority-mp-leaves-grc-says-chun-sing|accessdate=22 July 2017|publisher=The Straits Times|date=7 Feb 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722003525/http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapolitics/no-by-election-if-minority-mp-leaves-grc-says-chun-sing|archivedate=22 July 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for any other reason.

From 2017 onwards, the [[Presidential elections in Singapore|presidential elections]] will be reserved for a racial group if that racial group has not represented for five terms.&lt;ref name="reserved election"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 19B, Constitution of the Republic of Singapore|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=P1V-#pr19B-|website=Singapore Statutes Online|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there are no eligible candidates from that group, the election would be opened to candidates of all races, and the “reserved election” would be deferred to the next Presidential election.&lt;ref name="reserved election" /&gt; The [[Singaporean presidential election, 2017|first reserved Presidential Election was held in 2017]].

===Public housing===
The Ethnic Integration Policy implemented by the [[Housing and Development Board|Housing and Development Board (HDB)]] sets a quota on who can reside in a public housing flat in a particular block or neighbourhood. The policy was first introduced 1989 to prevent the formation of ethnic enclaves and encourage a balanced racial mix in HDB estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnic Integration Policy is implemented - Singapore History|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/d8fea656-d86e-4658-9509-974225951607#1|website=HistorySG|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the HDB, the proportion set for a block or neighbourhood “is based on the ethnic make-up of Singapore”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnic Integration Policy and SPR Quota - Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB)|url=http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/ethnic-integration-policy-and-spr-quota|website=Housing and Development Board (HDB)|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CPF contribution to community funds===
By default, all employees are required to contribute to self-help groups’ funds, namely: [[Chinese Development Assistance Council|Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC)]] Fund, Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF), [[Singapore Indian Development Association|Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA)]] Fund and Eurasian Community Fund (ECF).&lt;ref name="CPF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contributions to Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and SHARE Donations|url=https://www.cpf.gov.sg/employers/employerguides/employer-guides/hiring-employees/contributions-to-self-help-groups-(shgs)-and-share-donations|website=Central Provident Fund Board|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contribution to the self-help group depends on the race and/or religion of the employee which is indicated on the [[National Registration Identity Card|National Registration Identity Card (NRIC)]].&lt;ref name="CPF" /&gt; Contributions are deducted from an employee’s wages as well as their share of their [[Central Provident Fund|Central Provident Fund (CPF)]] contribution. However, employees have the option of opting-out from contributing to their respective self-help groups.&lt;ref name="CPF" /&gt;

===National service===
Malays were virtually excluded from [[National service in Singapore|conscription]] from the beginning of the draft in 1967 until 1977 and, after the policy was eased, were assigned mainly to serve in the [[Singapore Police Force|police]] and [[Singapore Civil Defence Force|civil defence]] (fire brigade), not active combat roles.&lt;ref name="alon"&gt;''[http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/ponsacs/seminars/Synopses/s93peled.htm A Question of Loyalty: Ethnic Minorities, Military Service and Resistance]'' by Alon Peled, 3 March 1993.

=== Racial Harmony Day ===
{{See also|Racial Harmony Day}}
Racial Harmony Day is celebrated on 21 July, on the anniversary of [[1964 race riots in Singapore|the 1964 Race Riots]]. First launched in 1997 by the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]] in schools, the event has since expanded in reach. Today, grassroots organisations such as the [[People's Association (Singapore)|People’s Association]] and the [[Community Development Council]]s also celebrate Racial Harmony Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_965_2004-12-31.html|title=Racial Harmony Day|last=Han|first=Jamie|last2=Loh|first2=Pei Ying|date=|website=Singapore Infopedia|access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debate ==
The Singapore state’s treatment of race has also faced criticism from some academics. Scholar S. Velayutham argues that the state’s constant focus on the “spectre of racial violence has literally erased the notion of racism from public and official discourses”.  Velayutham also argues and that “the need to maintain racial harmony, social cohesion and tolerance is repeatedly voiced to render racists practices as non-occurrences”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Everyday Multiculturalism|last=Velayutham|first=Selvaraj|publisher=Palgrave Macmilan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-24447-4|editor-last=Wise|editor-first=Amanda|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Everyday Racism in Singapore|editor-last2=Velayutham|editor-first2=Selvaraj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars such as N. Purushotam take issue with the orientalist underpinnings of the CMIO classification, and argue that continued adherence to the model merely avoids reconceptualisation of the term “race”.&lt;ref name="Purushotam"/&gt; The “Others” category has also been criticised, with scholar Elaine Ho contending that the grouping of ethnic groups into the category “glosses over their social heterogeneity and different needs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/debate-over-cmio-model-diversity-grows|title=Debate over CMIO model as diversity grows|last=Cheng|first=Kenneth|date=8 August 2017|work=TODAYonline|access-date=10 April 2018|last2=Chua|first2=Joey Xue Ting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, CMIO framework retains majority mainstream support among Singaporeans. A 2016 joint survey by [[Channel NewsAsia]] and the [[Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore)|Institute of Policy Studies]] showed that a majority of respondents believed that the CMIO classification helps build trust between the races (69%), fosters greater interaction between races (69%) and safeguards minority rights (71%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://lkyspp2.nus.edu.sg/ips/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/CNA-IPS-survey-on-race-relations_190816.pdf|title=Channel NewsAsia-Institute of Policy Studies (CNA-IPS) Survey on Race Relations|publisher=Institute of Policy Studies|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 interview with local newspaper TODAY, the survey’s lead researcher Mathew Mathews said that “[t]he answer is not dismantling the framework, the answer is to ensure that all the communities continue to be embracing (of others).”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cmio-model-still-relevant-sporeans-value-importance-race-study|title=CMIO model still relevant as S’poreans ‘value importance of race’: Study|last=Mokhtar|first=Faris|date=8 November 2017|work=TODAYonline|access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22072">Like many other communities, the older [[Chinatown]]s face certain social problems. Although Chinatowns are now generally viewed and valued as [[tourist attraction]]s, their earlier reputation was that of dangerous or dilapidated [[ghetto]]s and [[slum]]s, sites of [[brothels]], [[opium den]]s, and [[gambling hall]]s.

==Gangs and Organized crime==
In modern times, competing Asian [[gang|street gangs]] and [[organized crime]], such as the [[tong (organization)|tongs]] and the [[Hong Kong]]-based [[Triad society|triads]], continue to plague the metropolitan Chinatowns worldwide where Triads have their operations, including [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]; [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]], [[California]]; [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Boston]], [[Seattle]], [[New Jersey]], [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], and [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Tongs are Chinese secret societies, which were prominent in the 19th and 20th centuries. There have been 'Tong wars' or Chinatown in-fighting, between the Tong groups in the older Chinatowns. A tong war occurred in a Chinatown could be spread to other Chinatown communities. Initially, many Chinatown gangs were formed to defend the community from the ''lo fahn'' ([[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] word and transliteration for "[[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]") but later turned on members of their own ethnic community. This had a huge impact on the gang.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Peter Huston. ''Tongs, Gangs, and Triads: Chinese Crime Groups in North America'' (1995) Paladin Press. Boulder, Colorado&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chin, Ko (1990). ''Chinatowns and Tongs". In Chinese subculture and criminality: non-traditional crime groups in America''. New York: Greenwood Press. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinatowns of the 1960s and 1970s experiences a rapid influx of working-class immigrants from [[Hong Kong]]. Since their inception in the late 1960s, the Hong Kong-born immigrants and mostly unemployed though some work as waiters and busboys [[Wah Ching]] (華青) gang members began a campaign of harassment and assault of white tourists in [[San Francisco's Chinatown]], which ultimately proved to be a predicament for the tourism-minded conservative Chinatown elite of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (the biggest problem is that the CCBA simply advocated tougher policing against the gangs rather than resolve Chinatown social inequalities at the core). In North America, Chinese American street gangs often have connections with the tongs and triads. Examples of such street gangs include the [[Joe Boys]] and [[Jackson Street Boys]], which are named after the major street of San Francisco's Chinatown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan |last=Curie |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/03/04/MN82053.DTL&amp;hw=Jackson+Street+Boys&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 |title=Chinatown Gang Branching Out, FBI Says : Report alleges loansharking at casinos |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date= 2011-01-09|accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfcall.com/issues%202001/11.19.01/dimmick,_murder.htm |title=Getting away with murder in the city of St. Francis : No justice in 3 out of 4 homicides; killers at large |publisher=San Francisco Call |date=2001-11-19 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[gang#violence|Turf wars]] have been common in the older Chinatowns. Gang rivalry among Chinatown gangs has sometimes have a high profile. As Chinatowns tend to be tourist attractions, tourists in Chinatowns have sometimes been victims of these gang warfare crimes.  In 1977, a shoot-out occurred in a San Francisco Chinatown restaurant (where the rival gang were normally based), in which two tourists and three waiters were murdered by stray gunfire in a botched assassination attempt on a Wah Ching gang member. Eleven other people were injured. This incident is notoriously known as the [[Golden Dragon massacre]] and it mobilized the [[San Francisco Police Department]] to create an Asian crime unit. The five suspects involved in the attack were sentenced and convicted. On June 30, 1995 involved two factions of the Jackson Street Boys. One faction opened fire on the other on a busy Chinatown street, [[Stockton Street]], during the daytime. Seven innocent bystanders were struck, including a pregnant woman.

[[Seattle]]'s generally pacific [[International District, Seattle, Washington|International District-Chinatown]] was rocked by one particularly spectacular incident of gang violence in February 1983, when the [[Wah Mee massacre]] killed 13 people at an illegal gambling club, among them several prominent restaurant owners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/68438_mak30.shtml Mak spared death for Wah Mee killings], Tuesday, April 30, 2002, By Tracy Johnson, Seattle Post-Intelligencer Reporter&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, some amount of the ethnic Chinese refugees from [[Vietnam]] would also start gangs.

In the [[Los Angeles Chinatown]] of 1984, Chinese Vietnamese gang members shot and murdered a white [[Los Angeles Police Department]] officer in the line of duty and wounded his [[Japanese American]] partner. The officers were responding to a silent robbery alarm at a Chinatown jewelry store and a shoot-out ensued. The wounded Japanese American officer returned fire, killing three of the five suspects. A three-year trial concluded in 1988, and the remaining killers received the verdict of life imprisonment.

In [[Chinatown, Manhattan]] in May 1985, a gang-related shooting injured seven people, including a 4-year-old boy, at 30 East Broadway. Two males, who were 15 and 16 years old and were members of a Chinese street gang, were arrested and convicted.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, William R. [https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/25/nyregion/chinatown-youth-arrested-in-shooting-that-injured-7.html CHINATOWN YOUTH ARRESTED IN SHOOTING THAT INJURED 7], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 25, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/13/nyregion/2-in-a-chinatown-gang-convicted-in-shootings.html 2 in a Chinatown Gang Convicted in Shootings], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 13, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suburban Chinatowns are also not entirely immune from [[extortion]]. In the so-called "new Chinatown" of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[British Columbia]], the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] arrested six male suspects in connection with extortion that involved assaulting a Chinese Canadian waiter and then vandalizing the restaurant in 1999. In the summer of 2003, in the [[Los Angeles County]] community of [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]], California, Asian gunmen shot out a window of a Chinese restaurant, allegedly to send a message to the owner to pay protection; instead, they killed a waitress, a Mainland Chinese immigrant. Triad extortion activity is also rife in several Chinatowns of Sydney, Australia. Chinese restaurants have especially been targeted in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/sydney-triads-bring-terror-to-restaurants-646133.html | title=Sydney triads bring terror to restaurants | publisher=[[The Independent]] | date=June 23, 2002 | accessdate=September 20, 2012 | author=Marks, Kathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Chinese victims in Chinatown and other areas where Chinese are [[prostitute]]s and reluctant to report any incidents of gang harassment to authorities because they fear possible retaliation. First-generation immigrants, who often speak limited English, may be in the country illegally or have a general distrust of the police or of government in general. Many immigrants emigrated from countries where the police routinely intimidate the population – such as with Communist China and Taiwan under President [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s martial law – or where the government persecuted the population, as with [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]. In [[Hong Kong]], until recently,{{When|date=March 2016}} the police were often corrupt and ineffective.

Also compounding to the problem is that Chinese immigrant restaurateurs and storekeepers sometimes dismiss the exploitative [[extortion]] as another cost of doing business in the form of a "business tax" and thus simply shrug it off. In Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and many areas of Mainland China, extortion is figured into the cost of running a business, and many immigrant business owners presume that it is the same in their newly adopted country as well.

==Smuggling of immigrants==
The triads are also primarily responsible for smuggling [[illegal immigrant]]s into the Chinatowns of Australia, Europe, and North America, often from China and Vietnam.  These Asian smugglers are called "[[Snakehead (gang)|snakeheads]]".  In order to pay for their passage, many of these immigrants end up [[Indentured servant|indentured]] in "under the table" low-wage (often lower than the minimum wage) service jobs, e.g., as restaurant [[waiter]]s or dishwashers, masseuses in [[massage parlor]]s, [[prostitute]]s, and [[sweatshop|garment sweatshops]].

Such social problems have been the subject for several Hollywood police films such as ''[[The Corruptor]]'' (starring [[Mark Wahlberg]] and [[Chow Yun-fat]]),  ''[[Year of the Dragon (movie)|Year of the Dragon]]'' (starring [[Mickey Rourke]]) and ''[[Revenge of the Green Dragons]]'' (executive produced by [[Martin Scorsese]]).

==Decaying Chinatowns==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Chinatown]] --&gt;
[[Image:Los angeles chinatown0001.jpg|thumbnail|left|Entryway to Los Angeles Chinatown, facing northwest on Broadway Avenue and [[Cesar E. Chavez]] Avenue]]
Whereas a few Chinatowns, notably the ones in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Manhattan]] and Chicago, have been experiencing population growth and urban renewal, many others (such as San Francisco, [[Houston]] and [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Vancouver]]) have been facing [[urban decay]] over the years.  Social ills such as [[homelessness]] and [[Recreational drug use|drug-related]] problems occur with some Chinatowns in urban areas.  Many vagrants – often non-Chinese{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} – are seen [[Aggressive panhandling|aggressively panhandling]] and sometimes causing a nuisance on the streets of older Chinatowns, making them unattractive for investment.

[[Homelessness]] has been a problem in the Chinatowns of [[Honolulu]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], and especially Vancouver's Chinatown, which neighbors [[Downtown Eastside]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In Vancouver, Los Angeles, and other cities where the Chinatown is widely perceived as part of an unsafe inner city, few people will venture there at night, so many Chinatown businesses close around 5 or 6 pm; only a handful of restaurants remain open.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} These Chinatowns become virtual ghost towns in the evening. By contrast, the vibrant suburban Chinatowns in North America have a bustling nightlife with a number of restaurants with longer business hours, and the Chinatowns in New York City, Seattle, and London remain popular late-night destinations.

There have been programs such as [[graffiti removal]], in which Chinatown community members and the local police work together to improve the safety and aesthetics of Chinatowns, and, as police forces diversify, many have made more successful outreach to Chinatowns than in the past. As a case study, Chinatown in Los Angeles has improved notably in these respects although there has been political wrangling with the Chinatown leaders and city of Los Angeles. However, several revitalization plans have failed to take off due in the past to low funding. Vancouver's Chinatown has attempted to counter [[parking]] problems by erecting a large [[parking structure]], but drug problems and perceived police ineffectiveness to clamp down on property crime in Chinatown have hampered efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancourier.com/issues04/053204/news/053204nn2.html canada.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exodus of ethnic Chinese from Chinatowns and their gradual acculturation into the larger society has caused some loss of revenue. Elderly Chinese-speaking customers remain in Chinatowns and patronize Chinatown businesses, but without a large immigrant and descendant population to sustain their communities, Chinatowns increasingly rely on tourism.  The Chinatown of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] (otherwise known as the ''[[barrio chino]]'') with its small and declining population of Chinese origin, promotes its exotic image to the tourist trade.

Social problems aside, several longtime popular and historic Chinese restaurants have also closed in the Chinatowns of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Toronto, thus leading to the decline.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The old Chinatowns now face heavy competition from the ethnic Chinese and pan-Asian large supermarkets, shopping centers, and mini-malls found in the suburbs. Many old Chinatowns have experienced declining revenue.  For example, in [[California]] the Chinatowns of San Francisco and Oakland compete with the large shopping centers in [[Cupertino]] and [[Silicon Valley]], and the Los Angeles Chinatown faces distinct challenges from the [[San Gabriel Valley]]'s multiple Chinatowns. With a multitude of acclaimed Chinese cuisine restaurants, the gleaming suburban Chinese Canadian business district of [[Richmond, British Columbia]], has nearly rendered the aging Vancouver Chinatown obsolete for business and revenue, superseding it as the focal point of Chinese culture in greater Vancouver; its influence is felt even across the border in the [[Puget Sound]] area.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Manhattan's Chinatown continues to grow (having almost completely engulfed [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]]) but its ever-higher property values have driven many Chinese New Yorkers – both businesses and customers – to the [[Chinatown, Flushing|Flushing Chinatown]] in [[Queens]], not to mention Chinese New Yorkers moving to [[Parsippany, New Jersey]] and [[Edison, New Jersey]]. In Houston the older Chinatown in [[Downtown Houston]] has been largely replaced with a [[Chinatown, Houston, Texas|new Chinatown]] in southwest Houston outside of [[Beltway 8]] in the [[Alief, Houston, Texas|Alief]] area. In [[South Africa]], [[Johannesburg]] Chinatown has fallen victim to crime in that city and is being largely replaced by a new Chinatown in suburban [[Cyrildene, South Africa|Cyrildene]]. In Sydney, Australia, there are also multiple quasi "Chinatowns" in the suburbs, notably in the communities of Cabramatta, Chatswood, Paramatta, among others, which are rapidly outpacing the old Chinatown in Sydney proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/09/06/1031115933806.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Eastern promise spreads to the suburbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; New shopping centers in the suburbs of Boston are also replacing Chinatown.  With new developments and investments of new shopping centers in the suburbs, many ethnic Chinese immigrants in those areas now do not need to head to overcrowded and congested old Chinatowns to gain access to the goods and services.

[[Gentrification]] has reversed decline in Chicago's Chinatown and it may reverse that of Vancouver as well, as the downtown condo tower boom of that city is now moving toward its Chinatown. New upscale 40-story condo towers are being constructed, as are urban retail centres.

Gentrification and urban renewal both have positive and negative aspects. There are fears that non-Chinese-inspired gentrification will change Chinatowns into something entirely different. Hence, there have been various organized vocal opposition and protests in the Chinatowns.  Proposals for London's Chinatown include development of posh shops and relocation of its historic pagoda structure.  In San Francisco's Chinatown, a proposed development of luxury apartments amidst a large working-class community was thwarted.  In Los Angeles, development of an artist colony with non-Chinese-owned art galleries - many have replaced old Chinese American storefronts - in Chinatown has altered the landscape. Toronto's Chinatown is also facing the prospect of inevitable gentrification, with a declining Chinese population.  The politics of gentrification has also been felt in the Chinatowns of [[Philadelphia]] (where a [[Philadelphia Phillies]] baseball stadium was once proposed), [[Boston]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] (where the [[Capital One Arena]] has significantly shrunk the Chinatown). The local population of Montreal's Quartier Chinois has thwarted a scheme that would have placed a casino within the district.&lt;ref&gt;http://montreal.cbc.ca/regional/servlet/View?filename=chinagamble020114&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, Los Angeles's Chinatown has embraced [[bohemianism|bohemian]] gentrification without much vocal opposition; Seattle's [[International District, Seattle, Washington|Chinatown/International District]], which has long been more a commercial than a residential neighborhood, has seen a great deal of new construction and some gentrification; nearly all of this recent development is by Asians or Asian Americans, if not always by Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==SARS concerns==
Because Toronto has become the home for a large number of Chinese immigrants, many Chinese Canadians travel to and from Asia on a regular basis. In 2003, several deaths attributed to the outbreak of the [[SARS]] (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus in Toronto prompted a major scare as it was spread by a Chinese Canadian woman who had visited Hong Kong, contracted the virus during her visit, and died upon her return to Canada.  A panic spread across cities with Chinatowns in Canada and in the United States as many Chinese businesses urged people who had recently been traveling in China (where SARS was first reported) or Hong Kong to stay away.  In addition, many Chinese restaurants and shopping centers, especially in the [[Chinatown, Toronto|Chinatowns]] of [[Toronto]] and [[Markham, Ontario]], saw a reduction in business because of the perceived SARS threat.

As a result, many [[Chinese Canadian]]s and even [[Chinese American]]s faced an economic impact on their businesses.  (During the peak of the hype, several businesses in Chinatowns old and new even capitalized on the fear by selling face masks and SARS "survival kits".)  To allay some of the public fears in Canada and worldwide, Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] and Toronto Mayor [[Mel Lastman]] had lunch in a Toronto Chinatown restaurant to show that the restaurants and Chinatown in general were safe for tourism.

There were rumors circulating around Chinese communities and the Internet (especially with e-mail [[chain letter]]s) to avoid certain Chinese restaurants and supermarkets in many urban and suburban Chinatowns because they could allegedly contract the virus.  Some authorities{{Who|date=March 2016}} have theorized these warnings were initiated by rival competing Chinese businesses. There was no factual basis found for these claims.

'''Software studies''' is an emerging [[interdisciplinary]] research field, which studies [[software systems]] and their social and cultural effects.

==Overview==
The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as [[cyberculture]], [[Internet studies]], [[new media studies]], and [[digital culture]], yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study.

Software studies is an interdisciplinary field. To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the [[digital humanities]] and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.

==History==
The conceptual origins of software studies include [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in [[Friedrich Kittler]]'s essay, "Es gibt keine Software,"&lt;ref name="Kittler, 1993"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Reclam| pages = 225–242| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften| chapter = Es gibt keine Software| location = Leipzig| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = There is no software| work = CTheory.net| accessdate = 2013-01-19| date = 1995| url = http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Manovich]]'s ''Language of New Media'',&lt;ref name="Manovich, 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-13374-1 | pages = xxxix, 354| last = Manovich| first = Lev| title = The language of new media| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Fuller's ''Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software''.&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Autonomedia| isbn = 1-57027-139-9 | page = 165| last = Fuller| first = Matthew| title = Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and [[computer-aided design]] are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.

The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop Software Studies Workshop] Rotterdam 2006 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workshop.softwarestudies.com/ SoftWhere: Software Studies Workshop] San Diego 2008 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[MIT Press]] launched a ''Software Studies'' book series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fuller |first=Matthew |author2=Lev Manovich |author3=Noah Wardrip-Fruin |title=Software Studies - Series |work=MIT Press |accessdate=2013-01-18 |date=2010 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803154024/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's "Software Studies: a Lexicon"),&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Matthew | title = Software Studies: a lexicon | year = 2008 | publisher = The MIT Press | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061342/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archivedate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-262-06274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic program was launched, ([[Lev Manovich]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] and [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Software Studies Initiative" at U. California San Diego).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.softwarestudies.com/ Software Studies Initiative @ UCSD] official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established ''Computational Culture'', an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for "inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/calendar/?id=4870|title=Computational Culture: Double Book Launch and Launch of Computational Culture, a journal of software studies|work=Goldsmiths|date=December 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the [[digital humanities]] that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective.  Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code.  Notably related are [[critical code studies]], which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program,&lt;ref&gt;http://criticalcodestudies.com/wordpress&lt;/ref&gt; and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bogost | first = Ian |author2=Nick Montfort  | title = Platform Studies, a book series published by MIT Press | work = Platform Studies | accessdate = 2013-01-18 | url = http://platformstudies.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew| title = Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide [paywalled]| journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2013-01-18| date = 2009-01-23| url = http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science-and/14806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strategic talk''' is how [[language]] can be used to maximize shared [[understanding]] by consciously and deliberalty to formulating talk, asking questions and giving answers, putting other's talk into our own words, using concrete example and telling stories to illustrate a meaning. This method of [[Organizational communication|organizational]] or [[business communication]] was created by Richard E. Heymen Ed.D.&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, Richard. Why Didn't You Say That in the First Place?: How to Be Understood at Work. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16337">'''Tangible symbols''' are a type of [[augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC) that uses objects or pictures that share a perceptual relationship with the items they represent as [[symbols]].  A tangible symbol's relation to the item it represents is perceptually obvious and concrete - the visual or tactile properties of the symbol resemble the intended item. Tangible Symbols can easily be manipulated and are most strongly associated with the sense of touch.These symbols can be used by individuals who are not able to communicate using speech or other abstract symbol systems, such as [[sign language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trief|first=Ellen|author2=Bruce, Cascella |title=The selection of tangible symbols by educators of students with visual impairments and additional disabilities|journal=Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness|date=August 2010|volume=104|issue=8|pages=499–504|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;id=2E7D9C0E-CF91-609B-9F5A-F774F1C81BA8&amp;resultID=8&amp;page=1&amp;dbTab=pi}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for those who have the ability to communicate using speech, learning to use tangible symbols  does not hinder further developing acquisition of natural [[speech]] and/or [[language development]], and may even facilitate it.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;

==Definition==
The term tangible symbols was first developed by Charity Rowland and Philip Schweigert,&lt;ref name=rowsch00&gt;Rowland, C. &amp; Schweigert, P. (2000). Tangible symbols, tangible outcomes. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 16 (2), 61-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89&gt;Rowland, C., &amp; Schweigert, P. (1989). Tangible symbols: Symbolic communication for individuals with multisensory impairments. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 5(4), 226-234.&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to two-dimensional pictures or three-dimensional objects used as symbols to convey meaning. The items are termed "tangible" because they are concrete items that can be manipulated by the user and communication partner. Symbols can be used individually or combined with other symbols in order to create new messages. Tangible symbols are used as a means of communication for individuals who are unable to understand or communicate using abstract systems, such as speech or [[sign language]].&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=beu51&gt;Beukelman &amp; Mirenda (2005), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Properties of tangible symbols include permanency, capacity to be manipulated by both the user and the communication partner, and an obvious relationship between the symbol and the referent. They can represent items, people, activities and/or events, and look or feel similar to what they refer to.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;&lt;ref name=park95/&gt;&lt;ref name=park97/&gt; For example, a cup can be used as three-dimensional tangible symbol to represent the action: "drink".&lt;ref name=park97/&gt; A photograph of a cup can be used as a two-dimensional tangible symbol to also represent the action : "drink". Two- and three-dimensional symbols are used to fit the cognitive and sensory abilities of the individual, as well as the individual's unique experiences.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 5(4), 226-234.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Rowland and Schweigert use the term tangible symbols to refer to conceptually tangible items like two-dimensional pictures or three-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;  However, other authors, such as Beukelman and Mirenda, use the term to exclusively describe three-dimensional physical objects that display concrete properties such as shape or texture.&lt;ref name=beu51/&gt;

According to Rowland and Schweigert, "for some individuals, the use of tangible symbols may be used to bridge the gap between gestural communication and the use of formal language systems. For others, tangible symbols may represent an ultimate level of communicative competence."&lt;ref name=rowsch00 /&gt;

&lt;ref name=rowsch00 /&gt;

==History==
Historically, objects and pictures have frequently been used as communication devices.&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;&lt;ref name=park95&gt;Park, K. (1995)  Using objects of reference: a review of the literature. European Journal of Special Needs Education, 10(1), 40-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=park97&gt;Park, K. (1997). How do objects become objects of reference? A review of the literature on objects of reference and a proposed model for the use of objects in communication. British Journal of Special Education, 24(3), 108-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors have also used picture symbols, such as line drawings and photographs to develop language in individuals with little or no speech and/or [[cognitive disabilities]].&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt; Tangible symbols emerged from Van Dijk’s work in the 1960s using objects as symbols to develop language in [[deaf-blind]] children.&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J. (1966).  The first steps of the deaf-blind child toward language.  International Journal for the Education of the Blind, 15(4), 112-114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J. (1967).  The non-verbal deaf-blind child and his world:  His outgrowth towards the world of symbols.  Jaarverslag, Institut voor Doven.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Van Dijk’s work was based on the concept "symbol formation" developed by Werner and Kaplan (1963), who theorized that "symbol formation" referred to the process of developing language by creating symbols in our minds.&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, H. &amp; Kaplan, B. (1963).  Symbol formation.  New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of tangible symbols==
Rowland and Schweigert propose that tangible symbols can be divided into hierarchical categories, ranging from most [[concrete]] to most abstract symbols:&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt; 
*Identical objects are real items that are equal to their referent and are the most concrete type of tangible symbol. An example includes using a toothbrush to represent "brush your teeth".&lt;ref name=beu51/&gt; Beukelman and Mirenda includes in this category miniature objects: items that are smaller than what they symbolize, such as having a small toy toilet indicate "toilet".&lt;ref name=beu52&gt;Beukelman &amp; Mirenda (2005), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;
*Partial/associated objects refers to a portion of the object they represent, and therefore are less concrete than identical objects.&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt; For example, a shoelace would symbolize "shoes". 
*Symbols with one or two shared features have a resemblance to their referent, like using a mould of a loaf of bread for "bread". This category is sometimes included in the partial/associated objects category.&lt;ref name=beu52/&gt;
*Artificial symbols are abstract symbols that do not have a direct resemblance to their referent, such as having a 3D shape (i.e. an apple) that is attached to a cafe door be used as the symbol for "cafe".&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;  Beukelman and Mirenda include textured symbols in this category.&lt;ref name=beu52/&gt; An example of a textured symbol is using a piece of spandex material to denote "bathing suit".&lt;ref name=beu52/&gt;
*Three-dimensional symbols may be identical objects, parts of objects, or associated objects. A three-dimensional symbol will share similar features of the focused object, creating a meaningful symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowland|first=Charity|title=Tangible Symbol Systems|url=http://www.osepideasthatwork.org/toolkit/pdf/TangibleSymbol%20Systems.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204002735/http://www.osepideasthatwork.org/toolkit/pdf/TangibleSymbol%20Systems.pdf|archivedate=4 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Two-dimensional pictures, such as photographs and line drawings, are the most abstract type of tangible symbols.&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt; They are commonly used for both expressive and receptive communication, whereas the three-dimensional symbols are often used for receptive only communication (i.e. to cue the individual for upcoming events). [http://www.pac6.org/images/upload/Tangible_Symbols_Tangible_Outcomes.pdf]

The type of tangible symbol used is chosen based on the [[cognitive]] and [[Sensory perception|sensory]] abilities of the learner/user.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt; The meaning behind each symbol is not universal, but by using a symbol the individual is familiar with, a meaningful symbol is created.  Tangible symbols should be constructed by meaningful and motivating symbols that will provide the individual with the most opportunities to practice using the new system.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;

==Users of tangible symbols==

Individuals who can benefit from using tangible symbols include those who may lack the skills to communicate using verbal speech or other various communication systems such as sign language. Users of tangible symbols may include individuals with [[cognitive disabilities]] (including developmental delay and intellectual disability), sensory and/or [[visual impairments]] (blindness and/or deafblindness), [[developmental disabilities]] (such as autism spectrum disorder), and orthopedic impairments.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch00 /&gt;&lt;ref name=beu51/&gt;  Rowland and Schweigert claim that tangible symbols do not require the use of high demands on the learner’s [[cognitive abilities]], [[memory]], [[visual perception]], and motor abilities because they are:
*[[Iconic]] and concrete: they have a clear connection what they refer to.
*Permanent: the user does not need to recall the object, but simply be able to recognize them. 
*Manipulable: can be picked up and used by the learner and who s/he is communicating with.
*Tactually discriminable: can be identified by touch. 
*May be indicated through a simple motor response: such as eye gazing, touching, or pointing.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt; 
Furthermore, simple behavioral responses can be used with tangible items. For example, learners that are unable to speak can simply point, touch, pick up, or look (in cases of severe motoric impairment) at the object to answer a question or make a request.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;  Finally, three-dimensional objects can be distinguished from one another using touch, and therefore they are suitable for people with visual impairments or blindness.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;
A study by Rowland and Schweigert found individuals who were already able to communicate using gestures or vocalizations more readily learned to use tangible symbols than those who did not have intentional pre-symbolic communication skills.

==Application of tangible symbols==
Presentation format depends on the users [[visual scanning]] and motoric ability. The tangible symbols can placed in front of the user within reach, placed on a board for visual scanning, or placed in a book for access.

Typically, tangible symbols are custom made and tailored to the individual child.  If pre-made sets are used, it is assumed that the symbols are familiar and motivating for the user.  It is important to utilize frequently occurring and highly motivating symbols in order to optimize opportunities for use.&lt;ref name=rowsch00 /&gt;

==Universal tangible symbol system==
In 2009, Ellen Trief, Susan M. Bruce, Paul W. Cascella, and Sarah Ivy created a Universal Tangible Symbol System. They began by developing a survey to determine which tangible symbols were already in use, new activities and concepts for which tangible systems are needed, and participant preferences for tangible symbols from a pilot study. Participants included teachers and [[speech-language pathologists]] from four New York City schools. Following the survey, an advisory board consisting of directors of the New York City schools, speech-language pathologists, the designer and manufacturer of the symbols, a representative from the Perkins School for the Blind, college professors, and a graduate research assistant reviewed and discussed the results. This resulted in the establishment of the 55 universal tangible symbols seen in the chart below. However, this universal tangible symbol system should not replace a system already established for an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Trief, E., Bruce, S.M., Cascella, P.W., &amp; Ivy S. (2009). The development of a universal tangible symbol system. Journal of visual impairment &amp; blindness. July 2009. 425-431.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5375">'''Technological evolution''' is a theory of radical transformation of society through technological development. This theory originated with [[Czechs|Czech]] philosopher [[Radovan Richta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Böhme|first1=Gernot|last2=Stehr|first2=Nico|title=The Knowledge Society: The Growing Impact of Scientific Knowledge on Social Relations|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400947245|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3mdDBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=radovan%20richta%20describes%20the%20radical%20transformation%20of%20society%20through%20technological%20development&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=27 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of technological evolution==
''[[Mankind in Transition|Mankind In Transition]]; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future'', Masefield Books, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Masse|title=The Automated Society; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future|date=1993|publisher=Masefield Books|isbn=1879981025|url=http://massebloomfield.com/books/the-automated-society/|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technology]] (which Richta defines as "a material entity created by the application of mental and physical effort to nature in order to achieve some value") evolves in three stages: tools, machine, automation. This evolution, he says, follows two trends:

===Development===
The pretechnological period, in which all other animal species remain today aside from some avian and primate species was a non-rational period of the early [[Prehistory|prehistoric man]].

The emergence of technology, made possible by the development of the rational faculty, paved the way for the first stage: the tool. A tool provides a mechanical advantage in accomplishing a physical task, such as an arrow, plow, or hammer that augments physical labor to more efficiently achieve his objective. Later animal-powered tools such as the plow and the horse, increased the productivity of food production about tenfold over the technology of the hunter-gatherers. Tools allow one to do things impossible to accomplish with one's body alone, such as seeing minute visual detail with a [[microscope]], manipulating heavy objects with a [[pulley]] and cart, or carrying volumes of water in a bucket.

The second technological stage was the creation of the [[machine]]. A machine (a powered machine to be more precise) is a tool that substitutes the element of human physical effort, and requires  only to control its function. Machines became widespread with the industrial revolution, though [[windmills]], a type of machine, are much older.

Examples of this include cars, trains, [[computers]], and lights. Machines allow humans to
Tremendously exceed the limitations of their bodies. Putting a machine on the farm, a tractor, increased food productivity at least tenfold over the technology of the plow and the horse.

The third, and final stage of technological evolution is the [[automation]]. The automation is a machine that removes the element of human control with an automatic algorithm. Examples of machines that exhibit this characteristic are [[digital watches]], automatic telephone switches, [[pacemakers]], and computer programs.

It's crucial to understand that the three stages outline the introduction of the fundamental types of technology, and so all three continue to be widely used today. A spear, a plow, a pen, a knife, a glove, a chicken and an optical microscope are all examples of tools.

===Theoretical implications===
The process of technological evolution culminates with the ability to achieve all the material values technologically possible and desirable by mental effort.

An [[Economics|economic]] implication of the above idea is that intellectual labour will become increasingly more important relative to physical labour. Contracts and agreements around information will become increasingly more common at the marketplace. Expansion and creation of new kinds of institutes that works with information such as    universities, book stores, patent-trading companies, etc. is considered an indication that a civilization is in technological evolution.

This highlights the importance underlining the debate over intellectual property in conjunction with decentralized distribution systems such as today's internet. Where the price of information distribution is going towards zero with ever more efficient tools to distribute information is being invented. Growing amounts of information being distributed to an increasingly larger customer base as times goes by. With growing [[disintermediation]] in said markets and growing concerns over the protection of intellectual property rights it is not clear what form markets for information will take with the evolution of the information age.

The '''Theory of Narrative Thought''' is a theory of thought designed to bridge the gap between the [[Brain|neurological functioning of the brain]] and the flow of everyday [[Consciousness|conscious experience.]] Proposed by Lee Roy Beach,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Decision making: Linking narratives and action|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2009|journal = Narrative Inquiry|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The psychology of narrative thought: How the stories we tell ourselves shape our lives.|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2010|journal = Bloomington IN: Xlibris|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cognitive errors and the narrative nature of epistemic thought|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2011|journal = Perspectives on thinking, judging, and decision making.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = Universitesforlaget.|editor-first = W.|editor-last = Brun|editor2-last = Keren|editor2-first = G.|editor3-last = Kirkebøen|editor3-first = G.|editor4-last = Montgomery|editor4-first = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory is expanded by Beach, Byron Bissell, and James Wise (2016).

==Background==

	The theory of narrative thought (TNT) is a refinement of image theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Image theory: Decision making in personal and organizational contexts|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|publisher = Wiley|year = 1990|isbn = |location = Chichester UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Image theory: Principles, goals, and plans in decision making|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 1987|journal = Acta Psychologica|doi = 10.1016/0001-6918(87)90034-5|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Mitchell|first2 = T. R. |volume=66 |pages=201–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed as an alternative to [[rational choice theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theory of games and economic behavior|last = von Neumann|first = J.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1947|isbn = |location = Princeton NJ|pages = |last2 = Morgenstern|first2 = O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of image theory is that decisions are shaped by long-term attempts to manage the future rather than short-term results. The image theory model of the decision process, called the compatibility test, held up in both laboratory and field tests (Beach, L. R., &amp; Connolly, T. (2005). The Psychology of Decision Making: People in Organizations. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage) and has been retained, but renamed, as the discrepancy test in TNT.

	Image theory’s weakness was its failure to adequately specify the concept of image.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Subsequent attempts to specify it led to its replacement by narrative, the specification of which was based upon the work of Walter R. Fisher (1987) in [[Communication theory|communications theory]]. Exploration of the specification’s implications led to TNT, in which [[narrative]] is supposed to be the natural mode of human thought in a story that defines what led up to this moment, what is happening now, and what can be expected to happen in the future. This, in turn, led to examination of the apparently “natural” urge to think narratively and its roots in known neurological processes that format neural events in a rudimentary narrative form. This, in turn, led to the view that narrative thinking is a product of [[evolution]].

==Narrative development==
The theory of narrative thought (TNT) describes the brain as being composed of subsystems that act together to give rise to consciousness. Some of these subsystems, such as perception and memory, contribute content to consciousness. One subsystem in the [[Lateralization of brain function|left hemisphere]] codes the content in language while a corresponding subsystem in the right hemisphere links it with emotions. Working together as a single system, called the “interpreter,” they organize the content of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Who’s in charge? Free will and the science of the brain|last = Gazzaniga|first = M. S.|publisher = HarperCollins|year = 2011|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This order is the origin of narrative but at this point it is rudimentary, a proto-narrative. The proto-narrative is simple but up-to-date; it reflects what is happening at the moment. For infants, proto-narratives are pretty much the whole story, but as memories are formed, past proto-narratives become linked with present proto-narratives and, as caregivers lend a hand, more elaborate narratives take shape. As a store of elaborated narratives develops, proto-narratives continue to update them with current information from the [[perceptual system]]. This keeps the narratives aware of what is going on in the internal and external environments. Over time, two kinds of narratives develop.

== Two kinds of narrative ==
Chronicle narratives are about what happened in the past, what is happening now, and what is expected to happen in the future. They are the ongoing story of one’s conscious experience. Procedural narratives are about how to do things. They are about the actions one can take to better inform one’s chronicle narratives. They also are about the actions one can take to shape the future by acting directly upon the internal or external environment to produce desired results. Procedural narratives are subordinate to chronicle narratives. When used alone, the word “narrative” refers to chronicle narratives. [Note that chronicle and procedural narratives are parallel to, but not identical to, Daniel Kahneman’s (2011) System 1 and System 2.]

==Nature of narratives==
Narratives are more than just updated memories about what has happened recently. They are the stuff of ongoing conscious experience, of moment-to-moment thinking, of the richness of mental life, and they are the foundations for informed guesses about the future. They are a mixture of memories and of visual, auditory, and other imagery as well as the accompanying emotions. Their elements are symbols that stand for real or imagined events and actors (including oneself), where the actors are animate beings or inanimate forces. The events and actors are linked by causality. Causality implies temporality and, for animate actors, purpose. That is, a narrative consists of a temporal arrangement of events that are purposefully caused by animate beings (including oneself) or are the result of inanimate forces. The narrative’s storyline is its meaning, which is created by a coherent arrangement of the events and actors.

==Causality, plausibility, and coherence==
Causality is the structural backbone of all narratives, both chronicle and procedural. This is because it is the source of narrative temporality. This temporal aspect of causality works retrospectively, from effect to cause, which allows one to account for what is happening now as a result of what has happened in the past. And it works prospectively, from cause to effect, which allows one to set expectations for what will happen in the future as a result of what is happening now and what came before. A good narrative is plausible if its actors’ actions contribute to the story line and are not uncharacteristic, i.e., are reasonably consistent across narratives. A good narrative is coherent if the actions of the actors and the effects of those actions conform to one’s causal rules. In short, a good narrative makes sense in that there are no loose ends.

==Causal rules==
Noncontingent rules are about what to expect to happen as a result of actions by other people or outside forces over which one has no control. Contingent rules are about what one expects to happen as a result of one’s own actions. These rules form the causal linkages among narratives’ elements and are the bases of expected and action projections respectively.

Causal rules tell one what caused something to happen or how to make something happen. Another kind of rule, normative rules, tell one why something should happen. Normative rules are about what qualifies as desirable and what does not. That is, normative rules are standards for what is ethical, right, proper, principled, reasonable, appropriate, preferred, and so on, all of which are one’s values and preferences.

==Current narrative==
The current narrative is the narrative one is focused upon at the moment. It is the narrative that makes sense of what has happened leading up to the present, what is happening right now, and what will happen next. The latter, results from extrapolating the past and present segments of current narrative to make educated guesses about the future. A guess about how the future might unfold if one does not make an effort to change it is called an expected projection and a guess about how the future might unfold as a result of one’s efforts to change it is called an action projection. Both projections are narratives. Both are extrapolations of the current narrative. Both are constructed using one’s store of causal rules. Both are subject to the scrutiny of normative rules. Both are imaginary.

==Decision making==
When the future is projected, based upon the current narrative, the emotions associated with the relevant normative rules provide the criteria for evaluating the desirability of that future. Each feature of the projected future elicits an emotion that reflects how well it meets the relevant standard(s) set by one’s normative rule(s). A positive emotion is elicited if it meets the standard(s) and a negative emotion is elicited if it doesn’t. The strength of the elicited emotion is a function of the degree to which the feature exceeds or falls short of the standard(s). When evaluating the desirability of the projected future, the focus is on the features that fall short of one’s standards—called violations. If the violations are too abundant, too large, or too important, the associated negative emotions mount to a point at which one must conclude that the projected future will be undesirable. When this happens, survival, or simply unacceptable discomfort, dictates that something must be done to change the future so that when it arrives it will be more desirable than if things are simply allowed to happen as they will. The action agenda for changing the future is called a plan and execution of that plan is called implementation. The anticipated result of implementing the plan is the action projection. An acceptable plan is one that offers a sufficiently desirable future, a future that is compatible with one’s values and preferences.

==Plans==
A plan is a narrative about how one intends to go from the present to a more desirable future—how one intends to influence the course of ongoing events in a desirable direction. Like other narratives, plans must be plausible and coherent. Plausibility means that all the relevant elements, including oneself, are included and that their proposed actions are reasonable. Coherence means that the sequence of tactics creates a feasible causal chain from the present to the desired future. Plausibility is revealed by the ease with which one can imagine oneself and other actors engaging in a successful implementation of the plan, even if it will require hard work. Plausibility also requires that this activity seems natural and lifelike, and that success doesn’t rely on unlikely events or unrealistic amounts effort and resources. Coherence is revealed by the completeness of the causal chain of tactics, even though one knows one probably won’t end up doing things exactly as planned. A plan that lacks plausibility and/or coherence inspires little confidence (which is an emotion associated with a normative standard), which prompts its revision or replacement by another plan.

Briefly stated: (1) There are two kinds of narratives: chronicle narratives, which are stories about ongoing events, including the expected future, and procedural narratives, which are stories about how to do things; (2) both kinds of narrative are structured by time and causality and both are “good narratives” if they are plausible and coherent; (3) the undesirability of the expected future is assessed by its failure to meet standards set by one’s values and preferences; (4) action is prompted when the projected future is determined to be so undesirable as to be unacceptable.

==TNT as a theory of mind==

Both Beach (2010) and Beach, Bissell, and Wise (2016) open with a historical description of the ebbing fortunes of “executive mind,” as a scientific concept but how, over the past 50 years, it has come back, albeit on firmer ground, as “the brain.” But while “the brain” may be the new name for “mind,” the fact that the old name continues to be used in both scientific and everyday discourse suggests that the new name doesn’t quite do the job. That is, rather than merely reflecting sloppy usage, the word “mind” reflects something more than merely neural activity in the brain.

Other than the computer analogy and the information processing metaphor, cognitive science has produce no encompassing theory. But it seems to be widely assumed that when such a theory appears, it will necessarily be in terms of brain function to which conscious experience is subsidiary and derivative. TNT challenges this assumption by recognizing that brain functioning and conscious experience are two qualitatively different things. Although subjective experience derives from brain activity, it is not reducible to it. Therefore, the theory recognizes the importance of the brain and how it works, but it also recognizes the importance of conscious experience and how it works. Putting the two together as equally legitimate and complementary provides the “something more” than neural activity in the brain that is implied by the word “mind.”
 
Much has been written about the characteristics of mind, mostly by philosophers. The commonalities across those discussions reveals three primary characteristics that a theory of mind should address and that are, in fact, addressed by TNT: Thinking that is both reflective and reflexive—that is able to consider both itself and things other than itself. Knowing that allows distinctions between truth and falsity, error and ignorance, and belief and opinion. Purpose that results in actions aimed at foreseen objectives. In addition, TNT addresses the most common questions raised in these philosophical discussions: How does the mind operate? What are its “intrinsic excellences or defects?” How is it related to matter, to bodily organs, to material conditions, and to other minds? Is it possessed in common with animals? Does it exist separate from corporeality? Insofar as the theory adequately deals with these characteristics and answers these questions, it qualifies as a modern theory of mind.

This '''timeline of the American Old West''' is a chronology ordered list of events significant to the development of the American West as a region of the United States prior to 1912. The term "[[American Old West]]" refers to a vast geographical area and lengthy time period of imprecise boundaries, and historians' definitions vary. The events in this timeline occurred primarily in the contiguous portion of the modern United States west of the [[Mississippi River]], and mostly in the period between the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and the admission of the last [[contiguous United States|mainland states]] into the Union in 1912. A small section summarizing early exploration and settlement prior to 1803 is included to provide a foundation for later developments. Rarely, events significant to the history of the West but which occurred within the modern boundaries of Canada and Mexico are included as well.

Western North America was inhabited for millennia by various groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and later served as a [[frontier]] to European powers, beginning with [[Spain|Spanish]] colonization in the 16th century. [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], and [[Russia]]n claims followed in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the [[American Revolution]], the newly independent [[United States]] began securing [[American frontier|its own frontier]] from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] westward for settlement and economic investment by American citizens. The long [[territorial evolution of the United States|history of American expansion]] into these lands has played a central role in shaping American culture, iconography, and the modern national identity, and remains a popular topic for study by scholars and historians.

Events listed below are notable developments for the region as a whole, not just for a particular state or smaller subdivision of the region; as historians Hine and Faragher put it, they "tell the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the lands, the development of markets, and the formation of states.... It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Robert V.|last2=Faragher|first2=John Mack|title=The American West : a new interpretive history|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0300078358|page=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost three centuries after Columbus' voyages to the New World, much of western North America remained unsettled by European colonists, despite various territorial claims made by imperialist nations. Europeans interest in the vast territory was motivated by the search for precious metals, especially gold, and the fur trade, with miners, trappers, and hunters among the first people of European descent to permanently settle in the West.&lt;ref name=RMUtley/&gt;{{rp|150}} The early years were also a period of scientific exploration and survey, such that by 1830 the rough outline of the western half of the continent had been mapped to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=RMUtley&gt;Robert M.

The first World Congress on Communication for Development ('''WCCD''') was held in Rome, Italy from October 25 to 27, 2006.

== Main objective==

The '''''First World Congress on Communication for Development''''' was hosted by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and organized by [[The World Bank]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], and The Communication Initiative. It intended to clearly demonstrate to policy and decision-makers the effectiveness of "[[Communication for Development]]" in helping meet today's most pressing development challenges and to advocate among them for the systematic inclusion of communication in development policy and practice.

[[Communication for Development]] — as a process of dialogue, information sharing and building mutual understanding — is a powerful tool to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of development interventions, to assess and mitigate the political and social risks of those interventions and to build social ownership and sustainability.

== Participants==

The '''WCCD''', the first event of its kind, brought together more than 500 policymakers, development practitioners, NGO and CSO representatives, and academics/researchers active in the field. Thousands more from around the world were able to participate via webcasting and broadcasting.

== Organization and structure==

FAO and the World Bank spearheaded this event, and involved more than 75 key institutions, including multilateral and bilateral partners, media institutions, academic and research institutions, and NGOs to help organize the Congress. The three party governance structure consisted of a steering committee (to provide overall advice and guidance to the planning), a Scientific Committee (to conduct the paper review and the Mainstreaming study) and an Advisory Body.

== Invitees profile==

Nobel Prize Keynote Speakers, Highest Level of Representation from the UN and The World Bank, Italian Authorities, High Profile Public Figures, Ministries and Authorities from Developing Countries, Prime International University Representatives and Academicians.

== Themes and structure==

The Congress was structured around four broad thematic areas: Health, Governance, Sustainable Development, and Communication Labs. During the Policymakers Forum leading policy and decision-makers discussed and debated the opportunities and constraints they envisaged vis-à-vis the proposed recommendations for mainstreaming communication in development policies and programs.

A Mainstreaming and Policy Recommendations Study commissioned by the Scientific Committee served as the basis of discussions at the Policymakers' Forum, integrated the outcomes of the Forum and was then published, together with the proceedings of sessions and papers.

== Media partners==

Media Partners included [[Inter Press Service]]-IPS, [[RAI]] (Italy), [[BBC]] (UK) and CNBC (Germany). Additional media outlets were [[Al-Jazeera]] (Qatar), [[Reuters]], CNN Español, and major Latin-American media; Rome-based correspondents of the international press, together with major Italian newspapers covered the event. The BBC broadcast from the Congress site its flagship program, World Debate, while CNBC broadcast the show, Global Players.

== Expectations==

This event generated an enormous amount of interest around the world with more than 600 papers submitted through the call for papers, more than 1,700 registered through the Congress website, more than 600,000 hits on the site, and more than 2,000 people participated in pre-Congress e-discussions on Congress-related topics and themes.

One of the most extensive efforts previous to the Congress was the latinamerican seminar "Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo" (Without Communication No Development), held on August, 2006 in the city of Lima (Perú) with participants from Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Perú, Uruguay, Venezuela, Germany and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Calandria, 2007 - Source: [http://issuu.com/calandriaperu/docs/calandria-sin-comunicacion-no-hay-d Official Publication from the Seminar "Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo" (Without Communication No Development)]&lt;/ref&gt; It reunited the following Peruvian (PE) and international institutions (I - International / LA - Latinamerican): Asociación de Comunicadores Sociales Calandria (PE), CESIP (PE), CNR (Perú), Colectivo Radial Feminista (PE),  DEMUS (PE), Equipo Uno (PE), Voces Nuestras, PUCP (PE), Red Científica Peruana (PE), ILLA (PE), IEC (PE), MINSA (PE), CONAM (PE), CONCORTV (PE), IDL (PE), IUCM, Mesa de Comunicadores de Agencias de Cooperación, FELAFACS (LA), OCLAC (LA), OPS (LA), ANDI (LA), ALER (LA), AMARC (LA), Observatorio de Imprensa (LA), World Bank (I), AVINA (I), Broederlijk Delen (I), CAMECO (I), Communication for Social Change Consortium (I), FAO (I), Iniciativa de la Comunicación (I), ONU (I), OXFAM (I), UNICEF (I), USAID (I), WACC (I).&lt;ref&gt;Iniciativa de la Comunicación, 2006 - Source: [http://www.comminit.com/node/196198 Resume and list of presentations from the Seminar "Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo" (Without Communication No Development)]&lt;/ref&gt;
