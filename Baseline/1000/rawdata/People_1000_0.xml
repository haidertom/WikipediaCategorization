Figueroa moved out of the home in 1996 and secured custody of her four children. Police assisted in the move and detained Castro, but did not pursue charges.&lt;ref name="nationalpost1" /&gt; Castro continued to threaten and attack Figueroa after she left him, according to Caraballo.

DeJesus and her friend, Castro's daughter Arlene, had called Figueroa for permission to have a sleepover at DeJesus's house, but Figueroa replied they could not and the two girls parted ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/suspects_daughter_said_in_2004.html |title=Suspect's daughter said in 2004 she was the last to see Gina DeJesus |last1=Dissell |first1=Rachel |date=May 7, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gk6Vrz5i?url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/suspects_daughter_said_in_2004.html |archivedate=May 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arlene was the last person to see DeJesus before her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cleveland-kidnapping-latest-police-twice-visited-house-in-ohio--but-missed-three-women-held-captive-for-a-decade-8605381.html |title=Cleveland kidnapping: Son reveals his father padlocked doors to basement because 'we weren't allowed to go there' |last1=Kumar |first1=Nikhil |last2=Usborne |first2=David |date=May 8, 2013 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508011422/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cleveland-kidnapping-latest-police-twice-visited-house-in-ohio--but-missed-three-women-held-captive-for-a-decade-8605381.html |archivedate=May 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeJesus was taken under the impression that she was being dropped off, and trusted Castro because she was friends with his teenage daughter. Because no one witnessed DeJesus's abduction, an [[AMBER Alert]] was not issued, which angered DeJesus's father. He said in 2006, "The Amber Alert should work for any missing child … Whether it's an abduction or a runaway, a child needs to be found. We need to change this law".&lt;ref name="3 missing women found"/&gt;

A year after DeJesus' disappearance, the FBI released a [[composite sketch]] and description of a male suspect, described as "Latino, 25 to 35 years of age, {{convert|5|ft|10|in}}, {{convert|165|to|185|lb}}, with green eyes, a [[goatee]] and possibly a pencil-thin beard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swaine |first=Jon |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10045464/Ohio-abductions-FBI-photofit-with-likeness-to-suspect-Ariel-Castro-held-for-seven-years-as-police-say-he-acted-alone.html |title=Ohio abductions: FBI photofit with likeness to suspect Ariel Castro held for seven years as police say he acted alone |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=May 9, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608063305/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10045464/Ohio-abductions-FBI-photofit-with-likeness-to-suspect-Ariel-Castro-held-for-seven-years-as-police-say-he-acted-alone.html |archivedate=June 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court records, Castro was {{convert|5|ft|7|in}}, {{convert|179|lb}}; he had brown eyes and a goatee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=33093 |title=Printout: FBI releases sketch of Gina DeJesus' alleged kidnapper |date=April 15, 2005 |publisher=WKYC |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10882714 |title=FBI had sketch of suspect but missed the connection |date=May 10, 2013 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Captivity==
After Knight's kidnapping, Castro took her upstairs, tied her hands and feet together, and pulled her up using her hands, feet, and neck. He left her there for three days without food. Prosecutors at Castro's sentencing wrote that diaries kept by the women "speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a [[prisoner of war]], of missing the lives they once enjoyed, of [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]], of his threats to kill, of being treated like an animal, of continuous abuse, and of desiring freedom". The women were kept in locked upstairs bedrooms, where they were forced to use plastic toilets that were "emptied infrequently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/ariel_castro_sentencing_memo_r.html |title=Ariel Castro sentencing memorandum filed by prosecutors |last1=Krouse |first1=Peter |date=July 31, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804045034/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/ariel_castro_sentencing_memo_r.html |archivedate=August 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were fed one meal a day, and allowed to shower twice a week at most.&lt;ref name=cnn080213&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/01/justice/ohio-cleveland-castro-home |title=Deception, threats and abuse: Captives' hellish life inside Castro's home |last1=Botelho |first1=Greg |date=August 2, 2013 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805195802/http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/01/justice/ohio-cleveland-castro-home |archivedate=August 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight told police that Castro had impregnated her at least five times, and had induced [[miscarriage]]s each time through beatings: hitting with [[dumbbell]]s, punching, and slamming her against walls.

The court forfeited all of his property and assets to the Cuyahoga County government.&lt;ref name=pd130801&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/08/judge_sends_ariel_castro_to_pr.html |title=Judge sends Ariel Castro to prison for abduction, rape of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight (slideshow) |date=August 1, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804045059/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/08/judge_sends_ariel_castro_to_pr.html |archivedate=August 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his sentencing, Castro addressed the court for twenty minutes, in which he said he was "a good person" and "not a monster", but that he was addicted to sex and pornography, and had "practiced the art of [[masturbation]]" from a young age. He claimed that he had never beaten or tortured the women, and insisted that "most" of the sex he had with them "was consensual". He shifted between an apologetic tone and blaming the FBI for failing to catch him, as well as his victims themselves, insisting to the court that when he had sex with them he discovered they were not virgins. He would alternatively shift back into apologetic comments, saying: "I hope they can find in their hearts to forgive me because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130806234708/http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 6, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro spoke for 20 minutes in court, read what he said here |date=August 1, 2013 |publisher=WKYC |accessdate=August 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentencing judge also heard from Knight and family members of Berry and DeJesus. Knight told Castro: "You took eleven years of my life away. I spent eleven years in hell, now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all that has happened, but you will face hell for eternity. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think of the eleven years of atrocities that you inflicted on us... I can forgive you, but I will never forget."&lt;ref name=pd130801/&gt;

===Survivors===
On July 9, 2013, Knight, Berry, and DeJesus broke their public silence for the first time since their rescue by releasing a video statement thanking the public for their support. An attorney for Berry and DeJesus said the women "still have a strong desire for privacy" and did not wish to speak to the media about their ordeal.&lt;ref name=pd070913&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/amanda_berry_gina_dejesus_and_2.html |title=New video: Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, Cleveland's 3 missing women, thank you for your support |last1=Caniglia |first1=John |date=July 9, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710092111/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/amanda_berry_gina_dejesus_and_2.html |archivedate=July 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/transcript-cleveland-kidnapping-victims-say-thank-for-support |title=TRANSCRIPT: Cleveland kidnapping victims say thank you for support |last1=Steer |first1=Jen |date=July 9, 2013 |publisher=newsnet5.com |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711210648/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/transcript-cleveland-kidnapping-victims-say-thank-for-support |archivedate=July 11, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cleveland Courage Fund, a bank account set up to help the women in their transition to independent life, had collected approximately $1.05&amp;nbsp;million at the time of the video's release.&lt;ref name=pd070913/&gt; Before Berry's disappearance, her grandfather had promised to give her a classic [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] from the year Berry was born.

===House demolition===
[[File:Seymour Avenue - panoramio.jpg|thumbnail|right|The site on Seymour Avenue in 2014.]]
As part of the plea bargain, the house where Castro lived, and where he had held the women captive, was demolished on August 7, 2013. Knight was present and handed out yellow balloons, which she said represented missing children, to the gathered crowd. The balloons were released before DeJesus's aunt began the demolition with a swing of a [[crane (machine)|crane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cleveland-house-horrors-destroyed-demolition-crews-tear-ariel-castro-home-article-1.1419792 |title=Cleveland house of horrors destroyed — demolition crews tear down Ariel Castro's home |last1=Kemp |first1=Joe |date=August 7, 2013 |newspaper=NY Daily News |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810195725/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cleveland-house-horrors-destroyed-demolition-crews-tear-ariel-castro-home-article-1.1419792 |archivedate=August 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/cleveland-kidnapper-ariel-castros-house-horrors-demolished/story?id=19890927 |title=Cleveland Kidnapper Ariel Castro's 'House of Horrors' Demolished |last1=Ng |first1=Christina |date=August 7, 2013 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810182609/http://abcnews.go.com/US/cleveland-kidnapper-ariel-castros-house-horrors-demolished/story?id=19890927 |archivedate=August 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_cuyahoga/michelle-knight-held-captive-for-decade-by-ariel-castro-hands-out-yellow-balloons-on-seymour-avenue |title=Michelle Knight held captive for decade by Ariel Castro hands out yellow balloons on Seymour Avenue |last1=Seitz |first1=Colleen |date=August 7, 2013 |publisher=newsnet5.com |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810222225/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_cuyahoga/michelle-knight-held-captive-for-decade-by-ariel-castro-hands-out-yellow-balloons-on-seymour-avenue |archivedate=August 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Castro's death ===
On the evening of September 3, 2013, one month into his life sentence, Castro was found hanging with a bed sheet in his detention cell at the [[Correctional Reception Center]] in [[Orient, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="AP suicide"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |title=Cleveland man's suicide brings little sympathy |last1=Sheeran |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Welsh-Huggins |first2=Andrew |date=September 4, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20131004072333/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison staff performed [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on Castro before he was taken to the [[Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University|Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], where he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Jim|title=Ariel Castro dies in apparent suicide|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906090516/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|archivedate=September 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |last1=Mungin |first1=Lateef |last2=Alsup |first2=Dave |publisher=CNN |date=September 4, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro, Cleveland kidnapper, found hanged in prison cell |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JNhFIjnY?url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] [[coroner]] Dr. Jan Gorniak announced that a preliminary [[autopsy]] had found the cause of Castro's death to be suicide by hanging.&lt;ref name="usatoday-Eversley"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eversley|first=Melanie|title=The Ohio kidnapper was not on suicide watch, but was checked on every 30 minutes by guards.|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|accessdate=September 4, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904195004/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|archivedate=September 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2013, the [[Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction]] released a report that suggested Castro may have died accidentally from auto-[[erotic asphyxiation]] rather than suicide. Gorniak rejected the possibility, standing by her ruling of suicide. The report also said two prison guards had falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro hours before he was found dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Castro suicide report: Officers falsified reports|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|accessdate=October 10, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010150554/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|archivedate=October 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was not on [[suicide watch]] at the time of his death, but had been subject to routine checks every thirty minutes due to his notoriety.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;

A consultant's report was released on December 3, and officially concluded that "all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in Castro's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment." The [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] also reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name="suiciderpt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |title=Consultants: Kidnapper Ariel Castro's death a suicide |last=Welsh-Huggins |first1=Andrew |date=December 3, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206061146/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |archivedate=December 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3344">The '''Blue Sky Rangers''' is a group of [[Intellivision]] game programmers who previously worked for [[Mattel]] in the early 1980s.

When the Intellivision first came out in 1978, its games were all developed by an outside firm, [[APh Technological Consulting]]. Realizing that potential profits are much greater with [[first party software]], Mattel formed its own in-house software development group. The original five members of that Intellivision team were manager [[Gabriel Baum]], [[Don Daglow]], [[Rick Levine]], [[Mike Minkoff]] and [[John Sohl]]. Levine and Minkoff (a long-time Mattel Toys veteran) both came over from the hand-held Mattel games engineering team.  To keep these and later programmers (the Mattel team peaked at 110 people in 1983) from being hired away by rival [[Atari]], their identity and work location was kept a closely guarded secret.

In 1982, ''[[TV Guide]]'' published an article about Intellivision's secret programming team. The writer of the article wanted to come up with some group name other than "The Application Software Programmers," so he came up with the name "The Blue Sky Rangers." This was based on the programming group's "Blue Sky Meetings," which were a series of brainstorming sessions for new game ideas.&lt;ref name="TVGuide" /&gt;

This name stuck and the programmers were (and still are) collectively referred to as the Blue Sky Rangers. One of the early programmers, Keith Robinson, re-acquired the rights to Intellivision in recent years and the Blue Sky Rangers' games are now available on a variety of computers and video game platforms, as well as [[mobile phones]]. Rights are currently held by Tommy Tallarico.&lt;ref name="Techspot"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Video game music veteran Tommy Tallarico acquires Intellivision rights from Mattel | first = Jeffrey | last  = Cal | date  = May 29, 2018 | magazine = [[Techspot]] | url   = https://www.techspot.com/news/74844-video-game-music-veteran-tommy-tallarico-acquires-intellivision.html | accessdate = August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Brit Pack'''" is a term that has been used to refer to specific groups of young British actors who have achieved success in Hollywood, as well as more generally to the entire group of such actors. According to one article, "every decade brings a new Brit Pack, another disparate group of actors backed by the media to achieve simultaneous Hollywood stardom."&lt;ref name="talktalk.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/tim-roth/biography/122|title=Tim Roth – Biography|author=TalkTalk web studio|publisher=talktalk.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is most closely associated with the crop of British actors which emerged in the late 1980s, because of the prominence of the American [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] actors at that time.

==1980s Brit Pack==
The journalist Elissa Van Poznak interviewed [[Gary Oldman]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Paul McGann]], [[Bruce Payne]], [[Spencer Leigh (actor)|Spencer Leigh]], and [[Colin Firth]] for ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' magazine, in January 1987. The magazine had also intended to interview [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] but he was busy filming ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agwlbp.com/facejan.html|title=HugeDomains.com – Agwlbp.com is for Sale (Agwlbp)|publisher=agwlbp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the interview was "The Brit Pack". The moniker stuck and has been referenced in subsequent articles concerning the actors.&lt;ref name="talktalk.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tim-roth.com/index.php?id=facejul90|title=Tim Roth: Press|publisher=tim-roth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue of the 1988 magazine [[Film Comment]] stated that '[[Rupert Everett]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Miranda Richardson]], and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' were the leaders of the pack.&lt;ref name="americancinemapapers.com"&gt;[http://www.americancinemapapers.com/files/BRIT_PACK.htm BRIT PACK: A CLUTCH OF ACTORS], Harlan Kennedy, ''American Cinema Papers'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Brit Pack==
In July 1993, an article for ''The Face'' was titled ''The New Brit Pack'', which included [[Jaye Davidson]], [[Naveen Andrews]], [[Jude Law]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Craig Kelly (actor)|Craig Kelly]], [[Samuel West]] and [[Rufus Sewell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Face Magazine Editors|title=The Face Magazine – Jaye Davidson Cover|url=http://www.crazyaboutmagazines.com/ourshop/prod_571877-The-Face-magazine-Jaye-Davidson-cover-July-1993-Volume-2-No-58.html|accessdate=1 November 2015|work=[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]|date=10 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from other "packs"==
Unlike the Brat Pack or other similarly defined groups of American actors, "Brit Pack" actors have rarely associated with each other socially or in film. As a 1988 article put it, the Brit Pack "aren't seen together at parties or in restaurants or in gossip columns. And since British cinema has had no equivalent to Hollywood's Eighties conveyor-belt youth movies – ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', ''[[About Last Night...]]'', ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'', et al. – they don't keep re-meeting each other on-screen either".&lt;ref name="americancinemapapers.com"/&gt; Nonetheless, [[Bruce Payne]] and [[Tim Roth]] had both appeared in the ''Tales Out of School'' television series, [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Tim Roth]] both appeared in ''[[Meantime (film)|Meantime]]'' and ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'', Gary Oldman and Colin Firth appeared together in [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]] and [[Bruce Payne]] and Spencer Leigh both appeared in ''[[Smart Money (1986 film)|Smart Money]]''.

==Later uses of the term==
Currently, the phrase 'Brit Pack' is often used to describe any disparate group of young British actors and actresses of rising prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-britpack--our-new-generation-of-movie-stars-takes-tinseltown-841199.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=6 June 2008 | title=The Britpack – Our new generation of movie stars takes Tinseltown}}&lt;/ref&gt; No group has emerged which is as readily identifiable as the group from the 1980s.{{whom| date=November 2017}}

In 2014, it was used to describe a new wave of actors born in the late 1970s and early 1980s who were garnering success in Hollywood. These actors include [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Henry Cavill]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Eddie Redmayne]] and [[Rupert Friend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/best-of-british-tom-hiddleston|title=Best of British|work=ShortList Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/hot-british-men?src=spr_TWITTER&amp;spr_id=1447_64563853#slide-1|title=Hottest British Actors – 10 Best British Actors|author=Rebecca Cope|work=Harper's BAZAAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldic '''[[Label (heraldry)|labels]]''' are used to [[cadency|differentiate]] the personal [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of members of the [[royal family of the United Kingdom]] from that of the monarch and from each other.  In the Gallo-British heraldic tradition, cadency marks have been available to "difference" the arms of a son from those of his father, and the arms of brothers from each other, and traditionally this was often done when it was considered important for each man to have a distinctive individual coat of arms and/or to differentiate the arms of the head of a house from junior members of the family.  This was especially important in the case of arms of sovereignty: to use the undifferenced arms of a kingdom is to assert a claim to the throne. Therefore, in the English royal family, cadency marks were used from the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], typically a label or bordure alluding to the arms of the bearer's mother or wife. After about 1340, when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] made a claim to the throne of France, a blue label did not contrast sufficiently with the blue field of the French quarter of the royal arms; accordingly most royal cadets used labels [[argent]]: that of the heir apparent was plain, and all others were charged.&lt;ref&gt;''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'' by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies (1909), p.&amp;nbsp;494.  (Online texts at https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft or http://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~bprince/hr/foxdavies/index.htm .)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bordures of various tinctures continued to be used into the 15th century.

==The label==
{{Main|Label (heraldry)}}
In the ordinary system of differences a label of three points (which has also been termed a label with three files) is the distinction of the eldest son during the lifetime of his father. In the oldest rolls of arms the labels are all of five points; but labels of three points were at an early period used interchangeably. Besides being used as mere temporary marks of cadency, labels are also employed as permanent distinctions, borne (like any other charge) by every member of some particular branches of certain families. Labels are the principal cadency marks used in certain royal families.  In the British royal family, all labels are ''[[argent]]'' (white). The sons and daughters of the sovereign all bear labels of three points argent; that of the [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|arms of the Prince of Wales]] is plain, but all others are charged. Further descendants of princes bear labels of five points charged. All such differences should be borne on the arms, crest, and supporters.

The system of a special mark for difference for each member of the family goes back to the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], whose successor, as a prince, placed such a mark on the shield of England. Since 1340 this label has almost always been white, and overlaid with small figures, or charges, such as red [[St George's cross|crosses of St George]].&lt;ref name="Neubecker"&gt;[[Ottfried Neubecker]] &amp; [[John Brooke-Little]]: ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'' (1997). {{ISBN|0-316-64141-3}}. "Signs of Differencing" (pp. 96–97).&lt;/ref&gt; This red cross represents England and its [[patron saint]], and was first borne by Richard of Bordeaux (future king [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]) before the death of his father [[Edward, the Black Prince]] in 1376. Other charges used:
* A '''blue anchor''', a symbol of hope, or of naval service, as borne by several Dukes of York.
* The '''Crown''' of England (sometimes called the Imperial or [[St Edward's Crown]]) borne by the abdicated king the [[Duke of Windsor]], which is as unusual as the occurrence itself.
* '''[[Rose (symbolism)|Roses]]''': the [[Tudor Rose]] (combined red and white) has been used as an English [[Royal Supporters of England|royal badge]] since 1485.
* Red '''[[heart (symbol)|hearts]]''' may allude to the arms of [[Lüneburg]] (part of the Hanoverian arms) or – for the descendants of Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark – to the [[coat of arms of Denmark]].
* The blue '''[[fleur-de-lis]]''' appears amongst the Royal Badges in England of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]].
* The '''[[thistle#Heraldry|thistle]]''' is an ancient badge of [[Scotland]].
* The '''escallop shell''' was traditionally a token of pilgrimage on the [[Way of St James]].  The shell in the labels of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]] and [[Prince Harry]] alludes to their [[Diana, Princess of Wales|mother's Spencer]] arms.
* The '''bee''' is a canting charge in the label of [[Princess Beatrice of York]].
* The '''[[trefoil]]''' is a badge of Ireland, associated with [[St Patrick]], who used it to illustrate the [[doctrine of the Trinity]].

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]].

*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult.

Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

A '''Ciguapa''' (pronounced see-GWAH-pah) is a mythological creature of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] and [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] folklore. They are commonly described as having human female form with brown or dark blue skin, backward facing feet, and very long manes of smooth, glossy hair that covers their otherwise naked bodies. They supposedly inhabit the high mountains of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.

== Overview ==
These creatures have nocturnal habits. Also, due to the position of their feet, one can never quite tell from which direction the beings are moving from by looking at their footprints. Some people believe that they bring death, and it is said that one should not look them in the eye,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Liza Phoenix| url=http://www.lizaphoenix.com/encyclopedia/ciguapa.shtml| title= Ciguapa| publisher= lizaphoenix| date=2007-03-05 | accessdate=2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise the person is at risk of being bewitched permanently. Also, the only vocalization made by ciguapas is said to be a kind of whine or chirping.

Ciguapas are considered to be magical beings, beautiful in appearance to some, yet horrendous to others. All sources agree that they are wild creatures. They are compared in many cases to mermaids: beautiful yet cruel, and far from innocent. Deceitful and ready to capture the wayward traveler, they are said that they are so beautiful as to lure men into the forest, even though following footprints is misleading, to make love with them only to kill them afterwards. Even today, one can still find inhabitants who confirm having sighted a ciguapa.

Lore states that the only way to capture a ciguapa is by tracking them at night, during a [[full moon]], with a black and white [[polydactylic]]  dog (called ''cinqueño'' dog).&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many believe that the myth of the ciguapa is of [[Taíno people|Taino]] origin, it has been argued that is probably of more recent concoction, being possibly attributed to African beliefs brought to the island by enslaved peoples during the colonial period. More to the point, no known Taino artifacts or lore make reference to any creature even remotely similar to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the legend may have originated from other myths, as distant as the [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] ''Curupí'' or the [[Hindu]] [[Churel]], which was described by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in ''My Own True Ghost Story'' as having traits amazingly similar to those of the ciguapa. Nonetheless, the Hindu hypothesis may be far-fetched since there is no way to ascertain how this story got to the Dominican Republic during the nineteenth century, when no cultural exchange whatsoever occurred between these nations.

A Dominican film called "''El Mito de la Ciguapa''" (The Myth of the Ciguapa) is set to be produced by [[Xenda Films]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8367">A '''clerihew''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɛr|ᵻ|h|j|uː}}) is a whimsical, four-line biographical poem invented by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. The first line is the name of the poem's subject, usually a famous person put in an absurd light, or revealing something unknown or spurious about them. The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often forced.  The line length and metre are irregular. Bentley invented the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books. One of his best known is this (1905):

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Christopher Wren]]
Said, "I am going to dine with some men.
If anyone calls
Say I am designing St. Paul's."&lt;ref name=bentley&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|year=1905|title=Biography for Beginners|isbn=978-1-4437-5315-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Form==
A clerihew has the following properties:
* It is biographical and usually whimsical, showing the subject from an unusual point of view; it mostly pokes fun at famous people
* It has four lines of irregular length and metre for comic effect
* The rhyme structure is AABB; the subject matter and wording are often humorously contrived in order to achieve a rhyme, including the use of phrases in Latin, French and other non-English languages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verse.org.uk/what-is-a-clerihew.html What is a Clerihew?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first line contains, and may consist solely of, the subject's name.  According to a letter in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in the 1960s, Bentley said that a true clerihew has to have the name "at the end of the first line", as the whole point was the skill in rhyming awkward names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=William|title=The Fireside Book of Humorous Poetry|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|page=xiv|chapter=Introduction|date=1965}} Retrieved 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target famous individuals and reposition them in an absurd, [[anachronism|anachronistic]] or commonplace setting, often giving them an over-simplified and slightly garbled description (not unlike the schoolboy style of ''[[1066 and All That]]'').

==Practitioners==
The form was invented by and is named after [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. When he was a 16-year-old pupil at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London, the lines of his first clerihew, about [[Humphry Davy]], came into his head during a science class.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;{{cite book|last=Gale|first=Steven H.|year=1996|title=Encyclopedia of British Humorists: Geoffrey Chaucer to John Cleese|page=139|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-8240-5990-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his schoolfriends, he filled a notebook with examples.&lt;ref name=First&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|title=The First Clerihews|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-212980-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the word in print was in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley published three volumes of his own clerihews: ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), published as "edited by E. Clerihew";&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; ''More Biography'' (1929); and ''Baseless Biography'' (1939), a compilation of clerihews originally published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' illustrated by the author's son [[Nicolas Bentley]].

[[G. K. Chesterton]], a friend of Bentley, was also a practitioner of the clerihew and one of the sources of its popularity. Chesterton provided verses and illustrations for the original schoolboy notebook and illustrated ''Biography for Beginners''.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; Other serious authors also produced clerihews, including [[W. H. Auden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Michael|year=2007|title=The All-sustaining Air: Romantic Legacies and Renewals in British, American, and Irish Poetry Since 1900|page=94|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-929928-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains a popular humorous form among other writers and the general public. Among contemporary writers, the satirist [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]] has made considerable use of the clerihew in his columns for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

There has been newfound popularity of the form on [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Clerihew&amp;src=tyah Twitter].

==Examples==
Bentley's first clerihew, published in 1905, was written about Sir Humphry Davy:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Humphry Davy]]
Abominated gravy.
He lived in the odium
Of having discovered [[sodium]].&lt;ref name=First/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The original poem had the second line "Was not fond of gravy";&lt;ref name=First/&gt; but the published version has "Abominated gravy".

Other clerihews by Bentley include:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[George III of the United Kingdom|George the Third]]
Ought never to have occurred.
One can only wonder
At so grotesque a blunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Morton S. (ed.)|year=1997|title=A New Dictionary of Eponyms|page=50|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-509354-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
and
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]],
By a mighty effort of will,
Overcame his natural bonhomie
And wrote ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography for Beginners''. {{cite book|last=Swainson|first=Bill (ed.)|year=2000|title=Encarta Book of Quotations|pages=642–43|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-23000-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

W. H. Auden's ''[[Academic Graffiti]]'' (1971) includes:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Henry Rider Haggard]]
Was completely staggered
When his bride-to-be
Announced, "I am [[She (novel)|She]]!"&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' noted Auden's work and responded:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;W. H. Auden
Suffers from acute boredom
But for his readers he's got some merry news
He's written a collection of rather bad clerihews&lt;/poem&gt;}}
A second stanza aimed a jibe at Auden's publisher, [[Faber and Faber]].

Alan Turing, one of the founders of computing, was the subject of a clerihew written by the pupils of his ''alma mater'', [[Sherborne School]] in England:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Turing]]
Must have been alluring
To get made a don
So early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodges|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Hodges|year=1983|title=[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]]|page=94|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0-671-52809-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

A clerihew appreciated by chemists is cited in ''Dark Sun'' by [[Richard Rhodes]], and regards the inventor of the thermos bottle (or [[Dewar flask]]): 
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Sir James Dewar]]
Is a better man than you are
None of you asses
Can liquefy gases.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

''Dark Sun'' also features a clerihew about the German-British physicist and [[Soviet]] nuclear spy [[Klaus Fuchs]]:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Klaus Fuchs|Fuchs]]
Looks 
Like an ascetic
Theoretic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32509950 |title=Dark Sun : The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb |last=Rhodes |first=Richard, |date=1995 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=068480400X |location=New York |pages=57, 488}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In 1983, ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' magazine ran a contest titled "Do You Clerihew?" The winning entry was:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Did [[Descartes]]
Depart
With the thought
"[[Cogito ergo sum|Therefore I'm not]]"?&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Other uses of the form==
The clerihew form has also occasionally been used for non-biographical verses. Bentley opened his 1905 ''Biography for Beginners'' with an example, entitled "Introductory Remarks", on the theme of biography itself:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;The Art of Biography
Is different from Geography.
Geography is about Maps,
But Biography is about Chaps.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The third edition of the same work, published in 1925, included a "Preface to the New Edition" in 11 [[stanza]]s, each in clerihew form. One stanza ran:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;On biographic style
(Formerly so vile)
The book has had an effect
Greater than I could reasonably expect.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[File:Coat of arms of Joseph Ratzinger.svg|thumb|right|250px|The coat of arms of Cardinal Ratzinger]]

The [[papal coats of arms|personal papal coat of arms]] of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was designed by Archbishop [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]] (who was later created a Cardinal) soon after the [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal election in 2005]].

==Shield==
The shape of the [[shield (heraldry)|shield]] varies from artist to artist. In the official rendering of the coat of arms of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] the shape chosen is that of a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]].

===Blazon===
The [[blazon]] (the written description, in terminology peculiar to heraldry, of the contents of the coat of arms) given on the Vatican [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html website] is as follows:
:''Gules, chape ployé Or, with the scallop shell Or; the dexter chape with a moor's head Proper, crowned and collared Gules, the sinister chape a bear trippant (*passant) Proper, carrying a pack Gules belted Sable.'
This means, in non-technical English:
: A red shield mantled in gold and with a gold scallop shell; the right (for the bearer of the shield, the left for the viewer) part of the mantle has the head of a moor in her natural colour (brown) wearing a red crown and red collar; the left part of the mantle has a walking bear in its natural colour (brown) carrying a red pack tied with black bands.

Note 1. A mantle outside the shield does not normally contain ''charges'' (an heraldic term for objects). Within the shield, as here, it is a religious symbol, and indicates ideals inspired in monastic spirituality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is also a reference to the [[Order of Saint Benedict]].

Note 2. The black bands tying the red pack is one of several existing contraventions of the heraldic [[rule of tincture]], which in general does not allow the placing of colour on colour or metal (gold or silver) on another metal.

===Charges===
The charges of the arms &amp;mdash; the [[Maure|Moor's head]], [[Corbinian]]'s bear, and [[scallop]] &amp;mdash; appeared on Ratzinger's previous coat of arms, used when he was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich|Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. However, they relate not only to his origins, but also to his trust in God, as well his calling to spread this faith to others.

====Scallop shell====
The symbolism of the [[scallop]] shell is multiple. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] is said to have been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]. A boy was using a shell to pour sea water into a little hole. When Augustine asked him what he was doing, he replied, "I am emptying the sea into this hole."  Thus did [[Augustine]] understand that man would never penetrate to the depths of the mystery of God. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Fr. Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on ''The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church'', and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.

The scallop shell is also an allusion to the [[Sacrament]] of Holy [[Baptism]]. In the Roman Catholic Church, a sea shell is often used to pour water over the head of the child being baptized. Thus, a sea shell is used to evoke the imagery of this rite which is fundamental to the Christian life.

The shell also stands for [[pilgrimage]]. When topped with a [[Shell of Saint James|scallop shell]] a [[pilgrim's staff]], or "[[Jacob's staff]]", is the sign of a pilgrim. In Church art it is a symbol of the apostle [[Saint James the Great]], and his sanctuary at [[Santiago de Compostela]] in Spain, perhaps the principal place of pilgrimage during the Middle Ages. This symbol also alludes to "the pilgrim people of God", a title for the Church which Joseph Ratzinger championed at the [[Second Vatican Council]] as ''[[peritus]]'' (theological adviser) to Cardinals [[Josef Frings]] of Cologne and [[Julius Döpfner]] of Munich-Freising (his episcopal predecessor). When he became Archbishop he took the shell in his coat of arms. It is also found in the insignia of the Schottenkloster in Regensburg, where the major seminary of that diocese is located, a place where Benedict taught as a professor of theology.

Finally, the [[pilgrimage]] [[symbol]]ism of the shell may also refer both to the reconfigured role of the pope as not only ruler, but also pilgrim among the peoples and nations of the world. [[Pope Paul VI]]&amp;mdash;who created Joseph Ratzinger as a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1977&amp;mdash;was often called the "Pilgrim Pope" for his ground-breaking travels to the [[Holy Land]], [[India]], the [[United States]], [[Colombia]], the [[Philippines]], and elsewhere. This precedent was greatly elaborated upon by [[Pope John Paul II]] with his historic trips, numbering over a hundred. As a result, Benedict may be paying homage to these men and the new role for the papacy.

====Moor of Freising====
[[File:Hochstift Freising coat of arms.svg|right|150px|Moor's head of Freising, from the coat of arms of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Freising]].]]
The [[maure|Moor's head]] is a heraldic charge associated with [[Wörth, Upper Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. The origin of the Moor's head in Freising is not entirely known. Typically facing to the heraldic right, the viewer's left (''[[dexter and sinister|dexter]]'' in heraldic terms) and depicted in natural brown colour ''caput Aethiopum'' (literally "Ethiopian head") with red lips, crown and collar. This is the ancient emblem of the Diocese of Freising, founded in the 8th century, which became a [[Metropolitan Archdiocese]] with the name of München und Freising in 1818, subsequent to the [[Concordat]] between [[Pius VII]] and [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria]] (5 June 1817).

The Moor's head is fairly common in European heraldry. It still appears today in the arms of [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]], as well as in the [[blazons]] of various noble families. Italian heraldry, however, usually depicts the Moor wearing a white band around his head instead of a crown, indicating a slave who has been freed; whereas in [[German heraldry]] the Moor is shown wearing a crown. The Moor's head is common in the [[Bavaria]]n tradition and is known as the ''caput Ethiopicum'' or the ''Moor of Freising''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110021140/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html |archivedate=2007-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corbinian's bear====
A legend states that while traveling to Rome, Saint [[Corbinian]]'s pack [[horse]] was killed by a [[bear]]. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned        to Bavaria. The implication is that "[[Christianity]] tamed and domesticated the ferocity of [[paganism]] and thus laid the foundations for a great civilization in the Duchy of [[Bavaria]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The bear and the scallop-shell &amp;mdash; a unique papal coat of arms | work=Catholic World News| url= http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=36801   | date =27 April 2005 | accessdate=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolizes the weight of office that Benedict carried.

==External ornaments==
[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|200px|The coat of arms of the Holy See.]]
[[File:Guardia Svizzera Bandiera.svg|thumb|right|200px|Banner of the Swiss Guard, with the coat-of-arms of Pope Benedict XVI modified to include the papal tiara.]]
Traditionally, a pope's coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] with lappets and the crossed keys of [[Saint Peter]] with a cord. No other objects nor a motto was added. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind on heaven and earth ({{bibleverse||Matt|16:19|63}}). Pope Benedict's arms maintain the keys, but replace the tiara with a mitre and add a pallium. However, the tiara and keys remain the symbol of the papacy, and appear on the coat of arms of the [[Holy See]] and (reversed) on the flag of [[Vatican City]].

===Mitre===
In Pope Benedict's arms, the tiara is replaced with a silver [[mitre]] with three gold stripes.&lt;ref name= "cns2005"&gt;{{cite news | last=Glatz | first=Carol  |  title=Pope drops papal crown from coat of arms, adds miter, pallium | date=2005-05-18 | publisher=Catholic News Service | url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0502625.htm| accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stripes recall the three crowns of the tiara, which came to represent the three powers of the Bishop of Rome: Orders, Jurisdiction and Magisterium. The stripes preserve that meaning and are joined at the centre to show their unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).

===Pallium===
The [[pallium]] with red crosses is also a new addition.&lt;ref name="cns2005"/&gt; It represents a bishop's role of being pastor of the flock entrusted to him by Christ. The form of the pallium included in the coat of arms recalls that used by metropolitan archbishops (but with black crosses) rather than the much larger pallium worn by Pope Benedict at his inauguration.

==Early controversy==
Some{{Specify|date=March 2012}} have voiced objection to Pope Benedict's use of the mitre and pallium in his coat of arms, and the absence of the traditional [[papal tiara]].

Their arguments include:

[[File:Rom - Vatikanische Gärten Papstwappen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pope's arms with a tiara, Vatican Garden]]
Regardless of the validity of such arguments, the Pope, as supreme legislator and interpreter of Church law,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6YCpraE-7xcC&amp;pg=PA71 John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green, ''New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law''] (Paulist Press 2002 {{ISBN|9780809140664}}), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; had full authority to decide the form of his armorial bearings.

Some{{Specify|date=March 2012}} claimed that Benedict's arms could still properly be rendered with the tiara and keys and without the pallium. This was done in the Vatican gardens behind [[St. Peter's Basilica]], viewable from atop the dome. Shortly after the death of John Paul II, the contents of his shield were removed from the flowerbed, but the tiara was left in place.  After the [[Papal conclave, 2005|election of Benedict XVI]], the gardeners put the design of the new Pope's arms within the shield, but rather than digging up the flowers depicting the tiara and replacing them with a mitre design, they left the tiara in place and omitted the pallium.

==Later controversy==

In a 2013 interview, Cardinal [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]], designer of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms now that he was no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not,”. “And as a person who has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter from the back of the coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/benedict-xvi-needs-new-coat-of-arms-designer-says/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426013511/http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/benedict-xvi-needs-new-coat-of-arms-designer-says/ |archivedate=26 April 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[blazon]] of the '''[[coat of arms]] of the [[Princess of Asturias]]''' is given by a Royal Decree 979 on 30 October 2015 which was an amendment of the Royal Decree 1511 dated [[Madrid]] 21 January 1977, which also created her guidon (military personal ensign) and her standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boletín Oficial del Estado|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2015/10/31/pdfs/BOE-A-2015-11729.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official blazon==

The shield is divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[Gules]] a castle three-towered [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], masoned [[Sable]] ajoure, (door and windows) [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]], for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[Argent]] a lion rampant Purpure crowned Or, armed Gules and crowned Or, for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, Or four pallets Gules, for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, Gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains all linked Or, an emerald Proper, for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];
*''Enté en point'', Argent a pomegranate Proper seeded Gules, supported, sculpted and leafed in two leaves [[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]], for [[Granada]];
*[[Inescutcheon]], Azure with three [[fleurs-de-lys]] Or, [[bordure]]d Gules, for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]].

The whole is differenced by a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points Azure, the [[brisure|difference]] used by heirs apparent to the [[House of Habsburg|Spanish House of Habsburg]].

The shield is surmounted by a closed crown, which is a circle of gold, inset with precious stones of their colours, composed of eight rosettes of acanthus leaves, of which five are visible, interspersed by pearls in their colour, issuing from which are four pearl diadems, of which three are visible, which converge in a blue orb, with gold semi-meridian and equator, surmounted by a gold cross, the crown lined with red and surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]].

&lt;!--The following is unsourced:== Variants ==

Before 2001, the heir to the Spanish throne used this coat of arms unofficially, and still does in Aragon or Navarre, where a different version of the coat of arms, as Prince or Princess of Girona and Viana respectively, is displayed. It is likely that these arms will also be some day adopted officially.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera Sánchez, Alfonso (2010).

[[Image:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint George]] slaying the dragon, as depicted by [[Paolo Uccello]], c. 1470]]
A '''dragonslayer''' is a person or being that slays [[dragon]]s. Dragonslayers and the creatures they hunt have been popular in traditional stories from around the world: they are a type of story classified as type 300 in the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]]. They continue to be popular in modern books, films, video-games and other entertainments. Dragonslayer-themed stories are also sometimes seen as having a [[Chaos (cosmogony)#Chaoskampf|chaoskampf]] theme - in which a heroic figure struggles against a monster that epitomises chaos.

==Description==
[[Image:Paul Gustave Dore Andromeda.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] Chained to a Rock'' by [[Gustave Doré]] (1869).]]

A dragonslayer is often the hero in a "[[Princess and dragon]]" tale. In this type of story, the dragonslayer kills the dragon in order to rescue a high-class female character from being devoured by it. This female character often then becomes the love interest of the account. One notable example of this kind of legend is the story of [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Loðbrók]], who slays a giant serpent, thereby rescuing the maiden, [[Þóra borgarhjörtr]], whom he later marries.

There are, however, several notable exceptions to this common motif. In the legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]], for example, Saint George overcomes the dragon as part of a plot which ends with the conversion of the dragon's grateful victims to Christianity, rather than Saint George being married to the rescued princess character.

In a Norse legend from the [[Völsunga saga]], the dragonslayer, [[Sigurd]], kills [[Fafnir]] - a dwarf who has been turned into a dragon as a result of guarding the cursed ring that had once belonged to the dwarf, [[Andvari]]. After slaying the dragon, Sigurd drinks some of the dragon's blood and thereby gains the ability to understand the speech of birds. He also bathes in the dragon's blood, causing his skin to become invulnerable. Sigurd overhears two nearby birds discussing the heinous treachery being planned by his companion, [[Regin]]. In response to the plot, Sigurd kills Regin, thereby averting the treachery. &lt;ref&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (1990). Saga of the Volsungs: The Norse Epic of Sigurd the Dragon Slayer. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-23285-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mythologists such as [[Joseph Campbell]] have argued that dragonslayer myths can be seen as a psychological metaphor:&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But as Siegfried [Sigurd] learned, he must then taste the dragon blood, in order to take to himself something of that dragon power. When Siegfried has killed the dragon and tasted the blood, he hears the song of nature. he has transcended his humanity and re-associated himself with the powers of nature, which are powers of our life, and from which our minds remove us.

...Psychologically, the dragon is one's own binding of oneself to one's own ego."
&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The East Side Kids''' were characters in a series of films released by [[Monogram Pictures]] from 1940 through 1945.  Many of them were originally part of [[Dead End Kids|The Dead End Kids]] and [[Little Tough Guys|The Little Tough Guys]], and several of them later became members of [[The Bowery Boys]].

==History==
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
When [[Samuel Goldwyn]] turned the play ''[[Dead End (play|Dead End]]'' into the [[Dead End (1937 film)|1937 film version]], he recruited the original tough-talking kids from the play ([[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Bobby Jordan]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Billy Halop]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]) to repeat their roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films starring [[The Dead End Kids]]. The most successful of these features were ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (1938) with [[James Cagney]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], and ''[[They Made Me a Criminal]]'' (1939), starring [[John Garfield]]. Universal offered a competing series, under the [[Little Tough Guys]] brand name, later combining the Little Tough Guys cast members with the Dead End Kids (minus Gorcey) as the Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys series.

==The East Side Kids==
In 1940 producer [[Sam Katzman]], noting the financial success of other tough-kid series,  made the film ''[[East Side Kids (film)|East Side Kids]]'' using two of the 'Little Tough Guys', Hally Chester and Harris Berger. He added former [[Our Gang]] player [[Donald Haines]], [[Frankie Burke]], radio actor Sam Edwards, and Eddie Brian to round out the new team. The film served as a kind of "pilot" for a possible series of films, which were eventually made possible by this film's success.

Katzman hired former Dead End Kid Bobby Jordan to play the lead in the first film in the series proper, ''[[Boys of the City]]'' and he was soon joined in the series by Leo Gorcey. Gorcey's brother David was also added, as well as (Ernie) [[Ernie Morrison|'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison]] as "Scruno," the only African-American in the group and a former child actor from the very first cast of the [[Our Gang]] comedy team.

In the first few films, [[Dave O'Brien (actor)|Dave O'Brien]] (familiar from low-budget westerns and serials, and as the accident-prone star of the [[Pete Smith Specialties|Pete Smith]] comedies) played Jordan's older brother ''Knuckles Dolan,'' who always seemed to be getting roped into chaperoning the kids from adventure to adventure. O'Brien appeared in different roles as well—continuity between films was often ignored. As with the Little Tough Guys, the membership of the team changed from film to film, until Huntz Hall joined in 1941, when the lineup was somewhat stabilized. In total, 20 actors were members of the team at one time or another.

[[File:Million Dollar Kid (1944) 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Bobby Stone]], [[Robert Greig]], [[Leo Gorcey]], and [[Huntz Hall]] in the film ''[[Million Dollar Kid]]'' (1944).]]
Always the outsider, Gabriel Dell drifted in and out of the series as a gang-member, a reporter, or a small-time hoodlum (as in ''Million Dollar Kid''). In ''Smart Alecks'' he's an ex-member who left the gang to pursue a life of crime. [[Stanley Clements]] also appeared in ''Smart Alecks'' as well as '''Neath Brooklyn Bridge'' and ''Ghosts on the Loose''. After Gorcey left the subsequent "Bowery Boys" series in 1956, Clements was chosen to replace him in the last seven films.

Monogram (which later became Allied Artists) was notorious for its "[[Poverty Row]]" productions, and the East Side films were no exception. With a minuscule budget of around $33,000 per feature and a tight shooting schedule of only 5–7 days, the series churned out three or four movies a year (an astonishing 21 films in less than six years). There was no time or money for subtlety, story development, or more than one or two takes per scene.

The stories always centered on the tough, pugnacious "Muggs McGinnis" (Gorcey) or the more innocent, clean-cut "Danny" (Bobby Jordan). Huntz Hall's "Glimpy" began as a minor character who grew in prominence as he was allowed to do more comedy bits over the course of the series. The loose format proved flexible enough to shift back and forth between urban drama (''That Gang of Mine''), murder mystery (''Boys of the City''), boxing melodrama (''Bowery Blitzkrieg''), and horror-comedy (''Spooks Run Wild''), with the kids confronting various stock villains: gangsters, smugglers, spies, and crooked gamblers, along the way. The East Side films were problem-teen melodramas until 1943, when director [[William Beaudine]] joined the series and emphasized the comedy content. He encouraged the actors to improvise freely, adding to the films' spontaneous charm.

The contemporaneous events of World War II affected the series as well as the cast.  In 1943 Béla Lugosi (who was in ''Spooks Run Wild'') returned as a Nazi saboteur in the incongruously-titled ''Ghosts on the Loose'' which also featured a young [[Ava Gardner]]; a German-Japanese spy ring was thwarted in the blatantly patriotic ''[[Let's Get Tough!]]'' from 1942 (with Gabriel Dell, of all people, as a Nazi spy). At the end of ''[[Kid Dynamite (film)|Kid Dynamite]]'' Muggs, Danny, and Glimpy enlist and show off their uniforms. In ''Follow The Leader'' (1944), Muggs and Glimpy appear in uniform as they are on leave from the Army. Offscreen, between 1942 and 1944, cast members [[Billy Benedict]], Morrison, Jordan, Dell, and David Gorcey left the series after being drafted. A few days after receiving ''his'' induction notice, Leo Gorcey suffered a near-fatal motorcycle accident and spent almost a year in recovery. His injuries led to a 4-F classification, rendering him unfit for military service.

During Bobby Jordan's absence, his role in the series was taken by former child actor David Durand. Durand had been the star of Columbia's series of "Glove Slingers" campus comedies, and lent the same earnest sincerity to his East Side Kids appearances. (Jordan returned in 1944, in uniform, for a guest appearance in ''Bowery Champs''.)

Starting with ''Clancy Street Boys'' in 1943, Bernard Gorcey (Leo's father) did various bit parts, playing different characters in a total of seven films. In ''Million Dollar Kid'' he and Leo exchanged banter borrowed from an Abbott and Costello routine. He later became a fixture with [[The Bowery Boys]].

Given the low budgets, simplistic stories, and crude, assembly-line production of the East Side Kids series, its enduring popularity relies on the cast's rambunctious energy, breezy banter (often ad-libbed and containing inside jokes), fast-paced action, and Leo Gorcey's trademark [[malapropism|malapropisms]] ("This calls for drastic measurements").

The East Side Kids series was supplanted by [[The Bowery Boys]] in 1946.

The council of '''Eight Men''' was an early representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous [[Twelve Men]] and was followed by the [[Nine Men]].

==Council==
In 1643 [[Abraham Pietersen Van Deusen]] who had served on the [[council of twelve men]] was appointed to a new council of eight men. The council contacted the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] and blamed governor [[Willem Kieft]] for the declining economic condition of the nascent colony, and the [[Kieft's War|war]] with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. They requested that a new [[Director-General of New Netherland]] be appointed and that the people themselves be given more influence in the new government. Director General Kieft was dismissed, and [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took his place and Stuyvesant remained in power until the colony was turned over to the British in 1664. Kieft returned to Holland, but the vessel, the [[Princess Amelia (1634 ship)|''Princess Amelia'']] was lost at sea and his body was never recovered. John Franklin Jameson (1859–1937) writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commonalty were called together; they were sore distressed. They chose eight, in the stead of the previous twelve, persons to aid in consulting for the best; but the occupation every one had to take care of his own, prevented anything beneficial being adopted at that time. nevertheless it was resolved that as many Englishmen as were to be got in the country should be enlisted, who were indeed now proposing to depart; the third part of these were to be paid by the commonalty; this promise was made by the commonalty but was not followed by the pay.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Council Members==
The council members were:&lt;ref&gt;New York State; O'Callaghan, EB; Broadhead, John Romeyn: ''Documents relative to the colonial history of the state of New York, Vol. I'', p. 191, 1856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=oC0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=council+twelve+kieft+brodhead&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#PPA191,M1 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/projects/New-Amsterdam-Notable-Citizens&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1643 a minor altercation with Indians evolved into a serious uprising followed by an ugly slaughter of Weckquaskeek Indians on Manhattan Island. Kieft feared a major Indian assault. Allerton was asked by Kieft to join a "group of 8 men" to help New Amsterdam. Because he was English and respected in New Haven, Kieft sent Allerton and another Englishman to New Haven in 1643 to ask for men and materials to help defend New Amsterdam. In addition, the "group of 8" was asked to propose measures to improve civility and law-and-order in New Amsterdam. New Haven refused to send men to support the Dutch but Kieft entered into an agreement with the Indians in 1645 that settled the dispute. Because of Kieft's dictatorial manner, several of the eight men petitioned the WIC directors to recall Kieft as Director-General. In time Kieft was replaced by Peter Stuyvesant, and the men initiating the recall petition were accused of insurrection and faced punishment. Allerton was the second signatory of the petition but was not the group's primary spokesman. In 1646, Allerton established a permanent residence in New Haven.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flag (Standard) of the President of Belarus''' ({{Lang-be|Штандар Прэзідэнта Рэспублікі Беларусь}}) is the official symbol of the [[President of Belarus]]. It is used at buildings and on vehicles to denote the presence of the President.

The presidential standard, which has been in use since 1997, was adopted by a decree called "Concerning the Standard of the President of Republic of Belarus".

== Design ==
The standard's design is an exact copy of the national flag, with the addition of the [[National emblem of Belarus|Belarusian national emblem]] in gold and red. The standard's ratio of 5:6 differs from that of the national flag, making the standard almost square. The Presidential Flag is framed with golden fringes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://old.bankzakonov.com/obsch/razdel192/time6/lavz5977.htm Decree dated March 27, 1997, creating the presidential standard]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The original version of the Presidential Standard is kept in the office of the President at the [[Independence Palace, Minsk|Independence Palace]]. The duplicates of Presidential Flag can be placed in the halls or rooms of the Independence Palace or Presidential residences if any official event is intended to be conducted in the presence of the President;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.belta.by/president/view/belarus-president-meets-with-supreme-court-chairman-111494-2018/ Belarus President meets with Supreme Court chairman]&lt;/ref&gt; on other premises when the President of Belarus is visiting; in the hall of the building, where official or other types of events are being held with the participation of the President of Belarus; and on the vehicles of the President.

Presidential flag is also used during inauguration ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.gov.by/en/news_en/view/belarus-presidents-inauguration-ceremony-on-6-november-12501/ Belarus President’s inauguration ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flags of the Dutch royal family''' are a set of flags used to identify a member of the royal family. The current system of flags for the Dutch monarch, princes, and princesses was introduced in 1908.

== Background ==
The current system of personal flags for the monarch and other members of the royal family was introduced in 1908. In 1907, minor modifications were introduced to the Dutch coat of arms; likewise, a new flag for the Dutch monarch was introduced the following year. These flags are designed by the High Council of Nobility (who are also responsible for heraldry of the royal family) and are granted by royal decree. Like their coats of arms, these flags are usually shared among siblings.

The flags follow a similar pattern and, although not [[banner of arms|banners of arms]], are heavily influenced by heraldry. Flags of those born into the royal family feature a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field, while the colours are reversed for those who marry into the family. Males have near-square flags while those of females are swallowtailed. Elements of an individual's family coat of arms are also incorporated into the flags.

== Use ==
The flags are used to mark the presence of an individual in certain buildings, when on vehicles (e.g. a car or ship), or in an army unit. The flag of the monarch is flown above [[Huis ten Bosch Palace]] in [[The Hague]] (the king's private residence) and above [[Noordeinde Palace]] in The Hague (the king's official residence) when the monarch is in the Netherlands, but not necessarily when he is actually resident. Besides these two residences, the royal standard is flown above other palaces, castles or estates where and when the King is actually staying.

The flags are never flown at half-mast; during a period of mourning, a black [[pennon]] is affixed to the flagpole flying the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal flags|url=https://www.royal-house.nl/topics/flags/personal-flags|website=www.royal-house.nl|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Royal standard ==
The '''royal flag''' ({{lang-nl|koninklijke vlag}}), or the '''royal standard''' of the [[Netherlands]], is the official flag of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarch]]. This flag is a non-personal distinctive flag and is not changed from reign to reign. The current flag, introduced in 1908, is a square [[orange (colour)|orange]] flag, divided in four quarters by a nassau-blue [[cross]]. These colours refer to the principality of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]] (in [[France]]) and the principality of [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] (in [[Germany]]) from which the present royal family originates. 

In the centre of the flag is the lesser [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|coat of arms of the Kingdom]] (which originates as a composite of features taken from the arms of the [[house of Nassau]] and the [[Dutch Republic Lion|arms of the Dutch republic]]) surmounted by a [[Crown (headgear)|royal crown]] and surrounded by the insignia of the Grand Cross of the [[Military William Order]]. Each quarter shows a bugle-horn which originates in arms of the principality of Orange.

Image:Arms of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.svg| [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Upon the accession of King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]] in 2013, the monarch's flag was slightly modified: Instead of a rosette, a bow is placed in the ribbon of the Military William Order. Furthermore, the tassels on the horns now both hang down. The adjustments were applied on 30 April 2013 immediately after Willem-Alexander taking office.

==Princes==
The flag of a Dutch prince is rectangular in shape and of proportions 5:6. Flags of princes born into the royal family consist of a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field. 

Instead of the hunting horn of Orange in the upper right and the lower left quarters found in the monarch's flag, these are replaced with figures obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the prince's parent who married into the royal family. 

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed within an orange circle which replaces the center of the cross.

Unlike the flags for princes, the right side of the flag is devoid of the hunting horn of Orange and personal figure. However, the left portion of a princesse's flag contains the usual hunting horn of Orange and personal figure (obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the princess's parent who married into the royal family) in the upper and lower left quarters of the flag respectively.

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed either within an orange circle which replaces the center of a blue cross, or at the centre of an orange cross.

==Consorts==
In general, the standard of a prince consort of the Netherlands is a rectangular flag with proportions 5:6 with the colours of the royal standard (i.e. the orange field and blue cross) reversed. The upper left and lower right quarters bear the lion from the Dutch coat of arms (holding arrows in one hand and brandishing a sword on the other) while the other two quarters have a personal figure taken from their personal coat of arms.

In general, the standard of a queen consort, or the wife of a prince of the Netherlands, is a flag in the form of a swallow tail. The two right quarters are empty, the upper left corner bears the orange horn taken from the arms of the Principality of Orange and the lower left quarter has a personal figure, taken from their personal coat of arms.

In both cases, the coat of arms of the kingdom is at the center of the cross.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">'''Generación del 51''' is a designation for one of a series of "generations" of Spanish composers, identifying a group born between 1924 and 1938.

Members of this group of composers from the Basque and Castilian-speaking regions of Spain include {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}:
*[[Carmelo Bernaola|Carmelo Alonso Bernaola]] (1929–2002)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Miguel Alonso (composer)|es|3=Miguel Alonso Gómez|lt=Miguel Alonso}} (1925–2002)
*[[Angel Arteaga]]
*[[Cristóbal Halffter]] (b. 1930)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Ramón Barce|es}} (1928–2008)
*[[Agustín Bertomeu]] (b. 1929)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Amando Blanquer|es|3=Amando Blanquer Ponsoda}} (1935–2005)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Francisco Calés|es|3=Francisco Calés Otero}} (1925–1985)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Manuel Castillo|es}} (1930–2005)
*[[Juan José Falcón Sanabria]] (b. 1936)
*[[Antón García Abril]] (b. 1933)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Agustín González Acilu|es}} (b. 1929)
*[[Juan Hidalgo Codorniu|Juan Hidalgo]] (b. 1927)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Ángel Oliver|es|3=Ángel Oliver Pina}} (1937–2005)
*[[Luis de Pablo]] (b. 1930)
*[[Claudio Prieto]] (b. 1934)
In their earlier works, members of this generation tended toward the avant-garde, with post-Webernian [[serialism]] evident in the work of Halffter and Luis de Pablo in particular. By the end of the 1970s a mellowing of their language becomes apparent, and during the 1980s many of them began to turn to [[tonality]] of one sort or another {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}. 

The Catalan members of this generation are associated with the reforming and renewing tendencies that emerged after the post-Civil War isolation ({{harvnb|Gómez|2001}}; {{harvnb|Perez Castillo|2001}}):
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Xavier Benguerel i Godó|ca}} (b. 1931)
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Joan Guinjoan Gispert|ca}} (b. 1931)
* [[Josep Mestres Quadreny]] (b. 1929)
* [[Josep Soler i Sardà]] (b. 1935)
Soler's compositional palette involves serial techniques, and he is particularly noted for his dramatic music {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}.

'''Giedroyć''' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: Giedraitis; [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: Гедройц; [[French language|French]]: Guedroitz) is a Polish surname, originating from the [[Giedroyć family|Giedroyć princely family]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

==Overview==
The Second and Third Editions of the Lithuanian Chronicle relate that Giedrius ([[Palemonids]]), a brother of Grand Duke Traidenis of Lithuania (late 13th century), built a castle, named it [[Giedraičiai]], and adopted the title Prince of Giedraičiai.

A document issued by Grand Duke [[Vytautas|Vytautas of Lithuania]] in the period 1399–1429 settled a dispute between the Bishop of Vilnius and the Princes of Giedraičiai. Numerous members of the family were recorded in the 15th and 16th centuries, and thereafter, with the title Prince.

The two lines of the family for which coherent genealogies are available (the family's "central core") descend from (i) Prince Aleksander (late 15th century) and (ii) Prince Bartłomiej (died in 1524).&lt;ref&gt;For a full genealogy of those two lines see [http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/gotha.htm On-line Gotha]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1569 Act of Union inaugurating the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Royal Commonwealth]] confirmed that, as previously in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuanian families of dynastic origin remained entitled to use the title Prince. Many subsequent Giedroyć family members, both of the Line of Aleksander and of the Line of Bartłomiej, were recorded with the title Prince – including several (of both Lines) whose right to the title was individually confirmed under Imperial Russian legislation of 1832. Other members did not seek such specific confirmation under the Russian Empire, but relied on confirmation of their noble status and princely origins under Russian legislation of 1801/3. The Imperial Russian heraldic authority classified these as "of the Princes".

Under the usage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as confirmed by the 1569 Act of Union, princely origins in themselves establish princely status.

==Armorial bearings==
The Second Edition of the Lithuanian Chronicle records that a centaur was the armorial charge of the forebears of Giedrus. A decree issued in 1401 by Władisław Jagiello, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, confirms the right of Prince Michał Giedroyć vel. Ratybor (baptized c.1387) to the arms Hippocentaurus "as used by his illustrious grandfather" Ginwill (2nd Duke of Giedrojcie and candidate to the grand ducal office of Lithuania).

But the earliest surviving illustrated Giedroyć armorial charge is a rose, on seals attached to state documents of 1431-4.

Through the 17th and 18th centuries, the centaur was used predominantly by most members of the family, sometimes in combination with the rose; while the descendants of Mikołaj (died 1657, sixth generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) continued to use the rose alone. But the centaur (sometimes with the rose, sometimes without) predominates in all the 19th century Russian records, even for the descendants of Mikołaj.

At the English College of Arms, the arms of [[Michal Giedroyc]] (born 1929, 16th generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) include both the rose and the centaur (called a sagittary in English heraldry) blazoned as follows: Per fess Or and Gules in chief a Rose Gules barbed and seeded proper and in base a Sagittary trippant to the dexter the head facing to the sinister his tail a serpent facing to the dexter holding in the hands a Bow with arrow drawn and set towards the head of the serpent all Or.

[[Image:Bride-groom-kiss.jpg|thumb|right|A newly [[wedding|wed]] husband kissing his bride]]
A '''husband''' is a [[male]] in a [[marriage|marital relationship]]. The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his [[spouse]] and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between cultures and have varied over time.

In [[monogamy|monogamous]] cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage. This is enforced by legal codes that outlaw two ([[bigamy]]) or more ([[polygamy]]) female spouses. Similarly, [[polyandry]], marriage of one female partner with more than one male partner at the same time is not permitted. In polygamous and polyandrous cultures, there may be more than two parties to a marriage.

In marriages where both spouses are [[Man|men]], both may be referred to as husband.

In [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] marriages, the husband was traditionally regarded as the [[household|head of the household]] and was expected to be the sole provider or [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]], a role that is still maintained in some cultures (sometimes described as [[paternalistic]]).

The term continues to be applied to such a man who has [[Legal separation|separated]] from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized [[divorce]] or the death of his spouse. On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a [[widower]]; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the "ex-husband" of his former spouse.

In today's society a husband is not necessarily considered the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] of the family,{{By whom|date=December 2017}} especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career.  In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children.

==Origin and etymology==
The term ''husband'' refers to [[Middle English]] ''huseband'', from [[Old English]] ''hūsbōnda'', from [[Old Norse]] ''hūsbōndi'' (''hūs'', "house" + ''bōndi'', ''būandi'', present participle of ''būa'', "to dwell", so, etymologically, "a householder").

==Related terms==
At the conclusion of a valid wedding, the marrying parties acquire the [[Social status|status]] of married person and, while the marriage persists, a man is called a husband.  In heterosexual marriages the woman is called a [[wife]]; in same-sex marriages between males, each male is called a husband; between females, each is called a wife. Regardless of gender, a married person is the spouse of the other party to the marriage.

Although "husband" is a close term to [[bridegroom|groom]], the latter is a male participant in a wedding ceremony, while a husband is a married man after the wedding and for the duration of the marriage. The term husband refers to the institutionalized role of the married male, while the term father refers to the male in context of his offspring, a state which may or may not indicate that a marriage ceremony has taken place.

In some cases of heterosexual marriage, before the marriage, he or his family may have received a [[dowry]], or have had to pay a [[bride price]], or both were exchanged. The dowry not only supported the establishment of a household, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, he had to return the dowry to the wife or her family. For the time of the marriage, they were made inalienable by the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2005, ''dowry''&lt;/ref&gt;  He might leave his wife (or wives), then widow (or widows), a dower (often a third or a half of his estate) to support her as [[dowager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/dower|title=Dower - Definition of dower by Merriam-Webster|work=m-w.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Husband" further refers to the institutionalized form in relation to the spouse and offspring, unlike father, a term that puts a man into the context of his children. Also compare the similar [[husbandry]],&lt;ref&gt;See Wiktionary {{linktext|husbandry}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in the 14th century referred to the care of the household, but today means the "control or judicious use of resources", conservation, and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants and animals, and the science about its [[profession]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam–Webster's Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

As an external symbol of the fact that they are married, each spouse commonly wears a [[wedding ring]] on the ring finger; whether this is on the left or right hand depends on the country's tradition.

==Western culture==

===Historical status===
[[File:Seuso and his wife at Lake Balaton.jpg|thumb|Seuso and his wife]] 
In premodern heterosexual unions ([[ancient Roman]], [[medieval]], and early modern history), a husband was obliged to protect and support not only his wife and children, but servants and animals of his domain. The  father (as the "[[patron]]") was awarded with much [[authority]], differing from that of his wife (in these cultures, no polygamy existed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_mommsen_1_5_2.htm|title=The History of Rome, by Theodor Mommsen  Book I Chapter 5 Section 2|work=About.com Ancient/Classical History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern]] European history, it was unusual to marry out of love, but then doing so became an influential ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews34_45/page6.cfm|title=SGN Page 6|author=|date=|website=www.sgn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650–1800 Athens (Georgia), 1993&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, a husband in a heterosexual marriage had more opportunities in society than his wife, who was not recognized as legally independent.&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary status===
In contemporary [[secularized]] Western culture, the rights of the spouses have been made equal. The [[civil marriage]] generally forces the wealthier spouse "''breadwinner''" to provide [[alimony]] to the former spouse, even after separation and also after a divorce (see also [[Law and divorce around the world]]).

The legal status of marriage allows each spouse to speak on the other's behalf when one is incapacitated (e.g., in a coma); a husband is also responsible for his spouse's child(ren) in states where he is automatically assumed to be the [[biological father]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

===Islam===
In [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]], husbands are considered protectors of the household and their wives. As protector, the husband has [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam|various rights and obligations]] that he is expected to fulfill and thus is offered opportunities different from that of his wife or wives, not only in legal and economical affairs of the family but within the family as well. As in most cases in Islam law and culture, everything is being related to the [[Qur'an]].

Many Muslims may agree on a perfectly equal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heba Kotb|Heba G. Kotb MD]], [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm Sexuality in Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709125251/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm |date=9 July 2011 }}, PhD Thesis, Maimonides University, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is the only major religion that puts a cap on [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]], limiting the number of a man's wives to four—provided the husband can do justice to all of them. Although some religions, such as Catholicism for instance, puts a cap on polygamy all together, or even serial monogamy, allowing one spouse until death does them apart, not even accepting divorce. According to the teachings of Islam a Muslim man should have a valid reason and have to get permission from his existing wife (without any force) if he requires to marry again. Islam vehemently abhors any intimate relationship outside the bond of marriage.

There is no external sign to show his status as a husband, unless he adopted the tradition of wearing a wedding ring.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Marriage in Hinduism}}
A Hindu husband traditionally takes his wife to his home. He is expected to provide for her and to prove his abilities to do so. The marriage in Hinduism is a relationship for Seven births (सात जन्मों का रिश्ता). Before 1951 there was no divorce allowed in Hindu marriage. In past before 1750CE equal rights were given to both men and women and the same was extended in marriage as well.

In modern times once again after 1951, equal rights for women through society and law jurisdiction is given. In Hinduism, based on the different regions, marriage process is observed differently with the same Saat Pheras around agni kund (light pyre) to be taken to become a husband and wife.

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] mentions that "In Hindu law, the male members of a joint family, together with their wives, widows, and children, are entitled to support out of the joint property."&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Economic aspects of family law (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Chinese folk religions===
China's family laws were changed by the Communist revolution; and in 1950, the People's Republic of China enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2004, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
In Christianity, according to the Bible, a husband in a heterosexual marriage has a number of honors:
* To present his bride to God throughout their lives as perfectly holy and virtuous as can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%253A26-27&amp;version=ESV|title=Ephesians 53A26-27 ESV -  - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To protect his wife with his own life, physically, emotionally and "spiritually".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm|title=Ephesians 5:28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.

* To "lay down" his life, counting her more important than himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm|title=Ephesians 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To lead his wife and his family into the best things for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-29.htm|title=Ephesians 5:29 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church--|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To be the best that he can be in God's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm|title=Galatians 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To not withhold his body from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm|title=1 Corinthians 7:5 Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cultures==
In Japan, before enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution|Meiji]] Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Legal limitations on marriages (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expectation of fidelity==
{{Main article|Adultery|Open marriage}}
Although there is generally an expectation for a spouse not to have [[sexual relation]]s with anyone other than his spouse(s), historically, in most cultures, this expectation was not as strong as in the case of wives, a situation which was evident in legal codes which prohibited adultery, with male adultery often being criminalized only if "aggravating" circumstances existed, such as if he brought his mistress in the conjugal home, or if there was public scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=NtitRt1uUXMC |title=Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The double standard was also evident in divorce laws of many countries, such as the UK or Australia, which differentiated between female adultery, which was a ground of adultery by itself, and male adultery, which was a ground only under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/seminars/finlay.html&lt;/ref&gt; This double standard continues to be seen today in many parts of the world. For instance, in the Philippines, a wife can be charged with the crime of a''dultery'' (for merely having one act of sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband), while a husband can only be charged with the related crime of c''oncubinage'', which is more loosely defined (it requires either keeping the mistress in the family home, or cohabiting with her, or having sexual relations under scandalous circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|title=Gender Equality in Philippines - Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)|work=genderindex.org|access-date=22 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430025115/http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|archive-date=30 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlp-law.com/blog/a-brief-discussion-on-infidelity-concubinage-adultery-and-bigamy/|title=A brief discussion on Infidelity, Concubinage, Adultery and Bigamy|work=Philippine e-Legal Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A breach of this expectation of [[fidelity]] is commonly referred to as [[adultery]] or [[extramarital sex]]. Historically, adultery has been considered a serious [[offense (law)|offense]], sometimes a crime. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly a divorce. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a [[property settlement]], it may affect the status of children, the [[custody of children]], etc.

'''Jane Grossman Stern''' and '''Michael Stern''' (both born 1946) are American writers who specialize in books about travel, food, and popular culture. They are best known for their ''[[Roadfood]]'' books, website, and magazine columns, in which they find [[road food]] restaurants serving classic American regional specialties and review them. Starting their hunt for regional American food in the early 1970s they were the first food writers to regard this food as being as worthy to report on as the [[haute cuisine]] of other nations. 

Since the Sterns began documenting regional American food in the 1970s many other writers and television personalities have used their pioneering work as inspiration. In addition to their early work with regional American food the Sterns' book ''Square Meals'' (Knopf 1985) put "[[comfort food]]s" like mac and cheese, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes on the culinary map. ''Square Meals'' did an audacious reverse spin on the tricked up and precious nouvelle cuisine that was beloved by food critics at that time.     

Jane Grossman grew up in [[New York City]], where she attended the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden School]] and received a BFA in graphic design at [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn. Michael Stern grew up in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], and graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1968. They met as graduate students in art at [[Yale University]] and their first date, at [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana|Pepe's Pizza]] in New Haven, had a food focus.&lt;ref name=Ephron&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in 1970. The following year, Jane earned an MFA in painting from Yale and Michael changed schools and earned an MFA from [[Columbia University]] in film. Neither found work in their fields of study.

After a short stint of producing documentaries for WNBC, a teaching job at [[Hunter College]] and another at [[Wesleyan University]] they began work on the book that eventually became the first ''Roadfood''. The book was conceived as a book on "truck-stop dining," funded with an advance from a publisher. The Sterns set out in their car to travel through the United States and eat up to 12 meals daily at diners and local cafes.&lt;ref name=Ephron/&gt; The resulting first edition of ''Roadfood'' was published in 1977; the most recent edition was released in 2017.

In addition to their food writing, the Sterns have written books on American popular culture, including [[New York Times bestseller list|''The New York Times'' bestselling]] ''Elvis World'' (1987) and ''The Encyclopaedia of Bad Taste'' (1990). In all, they have written over 30 books. They were staff writers for ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'' magazine for 18 years, have written for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', and are now contributing editors at ''[[Saveur]]''. 

They are regular guests on [[American Public Media]]'s public radio program, ''[[The Splendid Table]]''. They have won numerous awards, including [[James Beard award]]s, and were inducted into [[James Beard Foundation Award#Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America|Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesbeard.org/index.php?q=james_beard_awards_whos_who Who’s Who of Food &amp; Beverage in America], the James Beard Foundation website, accessed September 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Sterns founded Roadfood.com; the site was sold to Fexy Media in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Gordinier| first = Jeff| title = Serious Eats and Roadfood Are Sold to Fexy Media| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2017-11-13| date = 2015-06-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/dining/serious-eats-roadfood-websites-sold-to-fexy-media.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, the Sterns remained in charge of editorial content of their website.&lt;ref name="eater-2015jun02"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.eater.com/2015/6/2/8704397/serious-eats-roadfood-seattle-fexy-media |title=Serious Eats Is Acquired by Seattle-Based Fexy Media: Roadfood has also been sold to Fexy Media. |website=Eater |date=June 2, 2015 |first=Daniela |last=Galarza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Jane Stern published ''Ambulance Girl: How I Saved Myself by Becoming an EMT'', a memoir in which she described suffering from severe [[clinical depression]] when she was in her early 50s and overcame her depression by training and working as an [[emergency medical technician]] in Connecticut. In 2005 the book was made into a [[television movie]], ''[[Ambulance Girl]]'', for which actress [[Kathy Bates]] was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]. The Sterns wrote a joint memoir, ''Two for the Road: Our Love Affair With American Food'', in 2006. 

The couple divorced in 2008; they still write as a team.&lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

In 2011 the former couple published ''The Lexicon of Real American Food'', and Jane Stern published a book on her little known but long-standing career as a [[tarot card reader]]. &lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

'''Jemeker Thompson-Hairston''' is a criminal who rose to the top of the cocaine trade during the peak of the 1980s crack epidemic in Los Angeles.

Her memoir, ''Queen Pin'', co-written with [[David Ritz]], was published in 2010.&lt;ref name="kirkus"&gt;"[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jemeker-thompson-hairston/queen-pin/ QUEEN PIN: A Memoir by Jemeker Thompson-Hairston and David Ritz]", Kirkus Reviews, June 22nd, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;. In a mixed review, [[Kirkus Reviews]] said that it "lacks the salacious elements that make criminal memoirs compelling," but noted that it "may appeal to believers" due to its religious content.&lt;ref name="kirkus" /&gt; Thompson-Hairston was also the subject of an episode in the second season of the [[Netflix]] series ''Drug Lords''.&lt;ref&gt;Flare, "[https://www.macleans.ca/culture/netflix-canada-in-july-2018-whats-coming-and-going-this-month/ Netflix Canada in July 2018: what’s coming (and going) this month]", Macleans, June 25, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani''' is a name shared by two short-lived princes and heirs to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. Both were named after their father [[Kamehameha III]]. In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], the name means "the red trail of heaven", signifying the roadway by which the god descends from heaven.

'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani I''' (1839–1839) was the eldest son of [[Kamehameha III]] and his queen consort [[Kalama Hakaleleponi-i-Kapakuhaili]].  The baby boy was named after his father whose full name was Keaweawe{{okina}}ula Kiwala{{okina}}o Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa Kalani Waiakua Kalanikau Iokikilo Kiwala{{okina}}o i ke kapu Kamehameha.  The royal suffix o-Kalani was added in to signified this Prince of [[Heaven]].

The young Prince Keawe died shortly after his birth. His death left Kamehameha III again childless. His younger brother, Keaweaweʻulaokalani II, would not be born until 1842.

==Later==

|}}
'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani II''' (1842–1842) was the second son of [[Kamehameha III]] and his queen consort [[Kalama Hakaleleponi-i-Kapakuhaili]].  The baby boy was the namesake of his father and his brother.

Initially given in ''[[hānai]]'' to [[Kalākua Kaheiheimālie]], he was instead adopted or ''hānai'' by his grand aunt, [[Kekāuluohi]] and her husband [[Charles Kanaina|Kana{{okina}}ina]] when the old governess of Maui died not three days after his birth. The King promised that he would be sent to the [[Chiefs' Children's School]] once he was weaned and could walk. He soon developed a fever and died, at the age of only 31 days. Dr. Baldwin of Lahaina was convinced that the child was killed by traditional medicinal treatment.

On 21 November 2013 [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] from the [[National Crime Agency#Organisational Structure|Human Trafficking Unit]] arrested two suspects at a residential address in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]]. A 73-year-old ethnic Indian [[Singaporean]] man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, and a 67-year-old [[Tanzanian]]&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; woman, his wife, Chanda Pattni, had been investigated for [[slavery]] and [[domestic servitude]].&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard"/&gt; The case centred around the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]] commune which was led by Balakrishnan. In the early 1980s after a police raid, Balakrishnan decided to move the group's activities underground. Balakrishnan's control over his followers intensified and the commune became a prison to his followers.  On 25 October 2013, three women were rescued from the commune. These were: a 69-year-old [[Malaysians in the United Kingdom|Malaysian]] woman (later revealed to be Aishah Wahab),&lt;ref name="Sawer"/&gt; a 57-year-old [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] woman (Josephine Herivel) and a 30-year-old [[United Kingdom|British]] woman (Katy Morgan-Davies).&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite news |title=Women victims 'held for 30 years' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/women-victims-held-for-30-years-8954976.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katy Morgan-Davies was born into the sect and hadn't experienced the outside world until her release.

Despite believing the United Kingdom to be a [[fascist state]] due to its treatment of the people of Singapore during the [[Malayan Emergency]], Balakrishnan emigrated to the UK in 1963 on a [[British Council]] scholarship to study at the [[London School of Economics]], and married his wife Chandra in 1971.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Over the years he built up a following by giving lectures and staging various [[sit-in]]s and protests. He was a regular attendee at [[London]] demonstrations, where he waved banners depicting the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] and addressed the crowds.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

In 1974, Balakrishnan and his "small clique" were expelled from the [[Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist)]] on account of "their pursuance of conspiratorial and [[wikt:splittist|splittist]] activities ... spreading [[social fascist]] slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement" and attempting "to put themselves above the discipline of the Party".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/cpestatements.htm "Statements of the National Executive Committee, CPE (ML)"], ''The Marxist-Leninist'', 1:1, September 1974, reprinted at marxists.org. Quoted in Nick Cohen [http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/nick-cohen/2013/11/cultists-communists-too-close-to-us-for-comfort/ "Cultists &amp; communists – too close to us for comfort"], ''The Spectator'' (blog), 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The CPE(M–L) "repudiated the metaphysical logic harmfully promoted" by Balakrishnan in "opposition to dialectical materialism and the concrete analysis of concrete conditions".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"/&gt; In response, Balakrishnan set up the Workers' Institute and launched his own publication, the ''South London Workers' Bulletin'', which accused the CPE(M–L) of being "fascists" and "agents of imperialism".&lt;ref name="Ford-WW-989"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Eddie|title=Maoist 'slaves': Combating the fascist state in Brixton  - Weekly Worker|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/989/maoist-slaves-combating-the-fascist-state-in-brixt/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Weekly Worker|issue=989|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1974 and 1976, his followers attempted to "build revolutionary stable base areas in working-class communities",&lt;ref name="On Building a"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Workers’ Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought|title=On Building a Revolutionary Stable Base Area|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/stable-base.htm|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily [[South London]], and worked in ordinary jobs. Balakrishnan discouraged his followers from joining [[trade unions]], describing them as agents of the "imperialist fascist bourgeoisie".&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Evan|title=Inside the paranoid Maoist cults of 1970s Britain|url=http://theconversation.com/inside-the-paranoid-maoist-cults-of-1970s-britain-20739|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Conversation|date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after the more liberal members of his group drifted away, a cult of around 10 female members formed around him. The collective moved to Brixton in 1976, under the title [[Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Following [[Mao Zedong#Death and aftermath|Mao's death in 1976]], the Institute built the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre at 140 Acre Lane, [[Brixton]], which also functioned as a communist collective of "thirteen comrades", with "13 members living on the premises, half in paid work, six doing full-time revolutionary work, with a strong emphasis on women taking a leading role (apart from leading the Party Committee headed by Bala)".&lt;ref name="On Building a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Tide: The Consolidation of Maoism by the Late 1970’s|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members were handed a rota of chores and only allowed to go out in pairs, which Balakrishnan claimed was because the area they lived in was "notorious for violence" and "anything could happen".&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Maoist 'cult' leader denies rape as he claims female commune members competed for his affections|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12019410/Maoist-cult-leader-denies-rape-as-he-claims-female-commune-members-competed-for-his-affections.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Telegraph|date=26 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a police raid on the Memorial Centre in March 1978, which the group claimed  involved "over 200 police", including officers from the [[Special Patrol Group]], "under the pretext of searching for drugs", the Workers' Institute effectively went underground, with the remaining members being convinced to end all contact with others and maintain an intense level of secrecy.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Family members were later branded fascist agents and ostracised,&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; and Balakrishnan and his captives moved to a number of properties during this time as a means for him to escape detection from the authorities.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Balakrishnan convinced his followers that everything was controlled by him from the sun, the moon, wind and fires; that he could overthrow governments, control natural disasters, and make people live or die.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In order to progress his cause, Balakrishnan invented "JACKIE" (an acronym for [[Jehovah]], [[Allah]], [[Christ]], [[Krishna]] and [[Eknath Easwaran|Immortal Easwaran]]) – a type of dangerous, mystical machine that monitored all thought and could control minds.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooke|first1=Rachel|title=My 30 years as prisoner of a London cult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/22/katy-morgan-davies-interview-balakrishnan-cult-brixton-survivor|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Balakrishnan began sexually abusing two of the women in 1979, often physically beating them and making others watch as he did so. All of the women were beaten and four (not including his wife) were said to have been sexually assaulted or engaged with sexual relations with him.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Balakrishnan forced the women to swallow his ejaculate as it was "the elixir of life", and claimed the women he sexually abused had been trying to seduce him out of "jealousy" for his lover.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2" /&gt;

==Victims==
*[[Katy Morgan-Davies]] - born in 1983, she was originally named Prem Maopinduzi Davies. She began calling herself "Rosie" in her teens. She has subsequently changed her name to Katy Morgan-Davies, after the American singer [[Katy Perry]]. She is the biological daughter of Balakrishnan and Sian Davies.&lt;ref name = "growing up"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932|title=Growing up a prisoner in a cult|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=28 January 2017|author=Vanessa Engle|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan-Davies was brought up entirely isolated from the outside world and never went to a nursery, school, dentist or doctor. She was not told who her parents were. The commune members taught her to read and write.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Sian Davies]] - in the early 1980s, after joining the commune, she had a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan.  On Christmas Eve 1996, Morgan-Davies remembered seeing Davies bound and gagged on the living room for trying to escape. Later, she fell out of a top floor bathroom window and was taken to hospital. In hospital she suffered a rapid decline in her mental health and fell into a coma. She died eight months later.  After the fall, her family were told she had gone to India to do charity work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} At the time of Davie's death her daughter, Morgan-Davies, did not know she was her mother.

*[[Aishah Wahab]] - a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] woman who moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 24 to study, joining the group shortly after.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Aishah was reportedly so drawn in by Balakrishnan's Marxist rhetoric that she left her fiancé and moved in with the collective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Oh Kar Eng]] - nurse from [[Malaysia]] who had followed Balakrishnan from the 1970s. She hit her head on a cupboard in 2001 and suffered a stroke. No medical treatment was allowed by the commune and she died the next day.{{r|bbc}} The police were not informed of the accident. Her family were not told about her cremation, and they were told the commune did not have their ashes when in fact they were in a lockup garage in West Norwood.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Josephine Herivel]] - known as Josie, was a violinist studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] before she joined the group.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Her father, [[John Herivel]] was one of the [[Bletchley Park]] [[codebreakers]] who helped Britain and its allies win [[World War II]]. She is believed to have moved to London in the 1970s and disowned her family after becoming involved with the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Herivel initiated the escape plan after becoming concerned with Morgan-Davies rapid weight loss (which was due to undiagnosed diabetes). Medical treatment was not permitted by the commune. Herivel secretly phoned a helpline after memorizing the number from a television program. Herivel has denounced the Balakrishnan sentencing, claiming he has been framed by the state.{{r|bbc}}

==Imprisonment and rescue==
The two older victims are believed to have met Balakrishnan in [[London]] through, according to police, a shared political ideology,&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Martin Evans [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10472632/Slavery-case-suspects-named-as-former-Maoist-collective-leaders.html "Slavery case: suspects named as former Maoist collective leaders"], telegraph.co.uk, 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as he was the leader of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/slave-house-couple-lambeth-leaders-1970s-political-cult 'Slave' house couple 'leaders of 1970s political cult'"], ''[[Channel 4 News]]'', 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The women were not being physically restrained, but held by "invisible handcuffs" after being subjected to [[Mind control|brainwashing]], [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]] and [[physical abuse]] by their captors.&lt;ref name="Standard_2"&gt;{{cite news |title=London slave women endured 30 years of beatings, brainwashing and emotional control |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/london-slave-women-endured-30-years-of-beatings-brainwashing-and-emotional-control-8956001.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |first=Justin |last=Davenport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2014, it emerged that Balakrishnan had been charged with offences relating to cruelty to a person under 16, four counts of rape and 17 counts of indecent assault.

[[File:Las Trece Rosas.jpeg|thumb|250px|Plaque in the cemetery wall.]]
'''"Las Trece Rosas"''' (the ''Thirteen Roses'') is the name given in [[Spain]] to a group of thirteen young women who were executed by a [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] just after the conclusion of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Their execution was part of a massive execution campaign known as the ''"saca de agosto"'', which included 43 young men (among them a fourteen-year-old).&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''El holocausto español. Odio y exterminio en la guerra civil y después.'' Editorial Debate. Barcelona. 2011. p.633&lt;/ref&gt;

The thirteen victims were: Carmen Barrero Aguado (age 24), Martina Barroso García (age 22), Blanca Brissac Vázquez (age 29), Pilar Bueno Ibáñez (age 27), Julia Conesa Conesa (age 19), Adelina García Casillas (age 19), Elena Gil Olaya (age 20), Virtudes González García (age 18), Ana López Gallego (age 21), Joaquina López Laffite (age 23), Dionisia Manzanero Salas (age 20), Victoria Muñoz García (age 19), and Luisa Rodríguez de la Fuente (age 18).&lt;ref&gt;Egido León, Ángeles. ''El perdon de Franco. La represión de las mujeres en el Madrid de posguerra.''.Los libros de la catarata. 2009. Madrid.p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of the women were under age - in Francoist Spain the age of majority was 21.

Following the capitulation of [[Madrid]] to [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] troops and the end of the Civil War, the Madrid Provincial Committee of the [[Unified Socialist Youth]] (JSU) (an organisation resulting from the merger of the [[Socialist Youth of Spain|Socialist Youth]] and the [[Communist Youth Union of Spain|Communist Youth]] even though most pro-[[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) members had abandoned the organisation) tried to reorganise under the leadership of 21-year-old José Peña Brea. He was betrayed, arrested, and tortured; under torture he revealed the names of his collaborators, which led to a wave of arrests of JSU members in Madrid. The Thirteen Roses were among the many JSU members captured and imprisoned by the police. During their detention in the Ventas prison they were repeatedly tortured and humiliated, and conditions in the prison were considered inhumane and overcrowded. They were ultimately executed by firing squad against the wall of the East Cemetery (now [[Cementerio de la Almudena|la Almudena]]) on 5 August 1939. Many of their comrades at the prison recall that while they were being driven away by lorry to their deaths, they sang the "Youthful Guardsmen" (JSU's anthem) so as to be heard by their comrades who remained in jail. The victims were accused of aiding a military rebellion and of assassinating a high-ranking [[political police]] officer, his 16-year-old daughter, and driver who were murdered after they had already been detained.&lt;ref&gt;Julía. Santos; Casanova, Julián; Solé i sabaté, Josep Maria; Villarroya, Joan; Moreno, Francisco. ''Víctimas de la guerra civil.'' Editorial Temas de Hoy. Madrid. 2006. p.329&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 2005, a foundation (''Fundación Trece Rosas'') was created in Spain to keep their memory alive.

'''Liath Luachra''', the "'''Gray of Luachair'''", is the name of two characters in the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. Both appear in ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn]]'', which details the young life and adventures of the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]].

The first Liath Luachra is one of Fionn's foster mothers who raise him after the death of his father [[Cumhal]] at the hands of [[Goll mac Morna]]. She is a great warrior and a companion of Fionn's aunt, the druidess [[Bodhmall]]; together they raise the boy in secret in the forest of [[Slieve Bloom Mountains|Sliabh Bladhma]]. Eventually Fionn's ever-spreading fame threatens to bring his father's killers to him, and his caretakers send him to find his own way. By this point they have taught him enough that he can survive on his own, and he goes into the king of [[Bantry]]'s service.

The second Liath Luachra is a tall, hideous warrior and a member of the [[Fianna]]. He had been an enemy of Cumhal, and even dealt him the first blow in the battle at which he died. Later Goll mac Morna gave him possession of Cumhal's treasures, and made him the Fianna's official treasurer. His ''corrbolg'' or ''crane bag'' is one of the warrior band's great treasures. Eventually he kills a young warrior named Glonda; Fionn sees the man's mother crying blood over the murder and decides to avenge him. He kills Liath easily and takes his treasure from him. This Liath has a son, [[Conán mac Lia]], who becomes lord of Luchair and a marauder against Fionn and the Fianna. He is eventually reconciled with the group and joins them.

{{context|section|date=October 2015}}
Two anime series, LINE OFFLINE and LINE TOWN, were produced in 2013, picturing the Line Friends as employees for the fictional Line Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jpninfo.com/31855|title=Love LINE Friends?

=== Line Offline ===
Line Offline is an animated series created by [[Shogakukan Productions]], based on [[salaryman]] characters working at "Line Corporation". All 114 episodes last about three minutes. The series was aired from January 8, 2013, to October 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/07/line-offline/|title=Messaging App Line’s Kawaii Characters Get Their Own Cartoon Series In Japan – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episodes of Line Offline are not connected to each other. The idea behind the series is to represent the ordinary life of company employees (in this case Line's employees, that's why the series is called "Line Offline"), in which every small problem could lead to weird and funny situations that require some effort in order to restore the [[status quo]].

Most characters from Line Offline are part of Line's universe (the characters who are shown in the animated series are also Line Friends, and they can be seen by users in Line Messaging App and used as emoticons).

This is a list of women who engaged in war, found throughout [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], studied in fields such as [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[film studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[women's studies]]. A ''mythological'' figure does not always mean a ''fictional'' one, but rather, someone of whom stories have been told that have entered the cultural heritage of a people. Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of [[history]] (e.g. the [[Ancient Briton]] queen [[Boudica]], who led the [[Iceni]] into battle against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]). However, to be considered a warrior, the woman in question must have belonged to some sort of [[military]], be it recognized, like an organized [[army]], or unrecognized, like [[revolutionaries]].

While imprisoned, Bonny is reported to have said of her doomed lover: "Sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have been hanged like a dog."&lt;ref&gt;^ Druett, Joan (2000).

While devotions to Marishi-ten predate [[Zen]], they appear to be geared towards a similar meditative mode in order to enable the warrior to achieve a more heightened spiritual level. He lost interest in the issues of victory or defeat (or life and death), thus transcending to a level where he became so empowered that he was freed from his own grasp on mortality. The end result was that he became a better warrior.
*[[Kaihime]] (presumably born 1572) was said to have fought during the Siege of Odawara and to have personally crushed a rebellion, earning her father the respect of [[Hideyoshi Toyotomi]]. However, historians aren't entirely sure if she truly did accomplish those events.

From this position, and with the obedience of the soldiers, Caterina could monitor the Vatican and dictate the conditions for the new conclave. Famous was also her fierce resistance to the Siege of Forlì by [[Cesare Borgia]] who finally was able to capture her dressed in armor and a sword in hand.

Freyja is cited as receiving half of the dead lost in battle in her hall [[Sessrúmnir]], whereas [[Odin]] would receive the other half. Some scholars argue that Freyja, [[Frigg]], and [[Gefjun|Gefion]] are [[Avatar]]s of each other. She is also sometimes [[Valkyrie#Connections with Freyja|associated with the Valkyries and disir]].
*[[Shieldmaiden]]s in [[Scandinavian folklore]] were women who did not have the responsibility for raising a family and could take up arms to live like warriors. Many of them figure in [[Norse mythology]]. One of the most famous shieldmaidens is [[Hervor]] and she figures in the cycle of the magic sword [[Tyrfing]].

*[[Brunhild]], in the ''[[Nibelungen]]'', is "a royal maiden who reigned beyond the sea:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 "From sunrise to the sundown no paragon had she.&lt;br /&gt;
 All boundless as her beauty was her strength was peerless too,&lt;br /&gt;
 And evil plight hung o'er the knight who dared her love to woo.&lt;br /&gt;
 For he must try three bouts with her; the whirling spear to fling;&lt;br /&gt;
 To pitch the massive stone; and then to follow with a spring;&lt;br /&gt;
 And should he beat in every feat his wooing well has sped,&lt;br /&gt;
 But he who fails must lose his love, and likewise lose his head."

*[[Lagertha]]: Lagertha was, according to legend, a Viking shieldmaiden and ruler from what is now Norway, and the onetime wife of the famous Viking Ragnar Lodbrok. Her tale, as recorded by the chronicler Saxo in the 12th century, may be a reflection of tales about Thorgerd (Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr), a Norse deity.

She joined the [[Spanish navy|Armada]] at the age of 16, in 1793, posing as a man, with the name of Antonio Maria de Soto, embarking on the frigate Mercedes. She fought in the battles of Banyuls-sur-Mer, [[Siege of Roses (1794–95)|Roses]], [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Cape St. Vincent]] and [[Assault on Cádiz (1797)|Cádiz]]. She was noticed as a woman during a routine medical recognition, and given the rank and salary of sergeant, in 1798. She was authorized to use the marines' colours and sergeant's chevrons in her woman clothes.
* La Galana ('[[Juana Galán]]') was another woman who fought in the [[Spanish War of Independence]]. She defended Valdepeñas, armed with a baton and aided by the rest of the women in the village because there were not enough men in [[Valdepeñas]] due to the war circumstances. They threw boiling water and oil through the windows. French soldiers were delayed in arriving at the [[Battle of Bailén|Battle of Bailen]] because of this, so Spanish forces won. Also see [[Valdepeñas Uprising]] for more information about this [[guerrilla action]].
* [[La Fraila]] lived in [[Valdepeñas]] as [[Juana Galán]] did. During the [[Spanish War of Independence]] offered food and rest in Valdepeñas' hermitage to the French soldiers. When they were sleeping, La Fraila (which is an alias and her actual name is unknown) closed the doors and set the hermitage on fire using gunpowder as vengeance of her son's death by the French army. She died in the fire as well.
* [[María Pita]]. She defended [[A Coruña]] against [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]'s [[English Armada|army]].
* [[Catalina de Erauso]] or The Nun Lieutenant (La Monja Alférez) was a personality of the Basque Country, Spain and Spanish America in the first half of the 17th century. At the age of fifteen, the age in which Catalina would be required to make her final vows and profess herself a nun, Catalina decided that she was not going to allow her family's traditions or strong religious beliefs guide her life. She ran away from the convent on March 18, 1600. Catalina disguised herself by dressing as a man, and began her journey to the New World. She gave herself the name, "Francisco de Loyola". She participated in several battles. As a prisoner, she confessed her sex to the bishop, Fray Agustín de Carvajal. Induced{{clarify|date=May 2018}} by Fray she entered a convent and her story spread across the ocean. In 1620, the archbishop of Lima called her. In 1624, she arrived in Spain, having changed ship after another fight. On June 29, 1626, Catalina de Erauso was seen by Pope Urban VIII, who granted her a special dispensation that would allow her to continue to wear men's clothing. She wrote her memoirs: Historia de la monja alférez escrita por ella misma.

===Rashidun Caliphate===
[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar]] was the daughter of one of the chiefs of [[Bani Assad]] tribe, and her family embraced Islam in its first days. The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.

[[Nusaybah bint Ka’ab]], also known as [[Umm Ammarah]] (Ammarah's mother), a Hebrew woman by origin from the Banu Najjar tribe, was an early convert to Islam. Nusaybah was attending [[the Battle of Uhud]] like other women, and her intention was to bring water to the soldiers, and attend the wounded while her husband and son fought on the side of the Moslems. But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.

===Mesopotamian mythology===
*[[Ishtar]] is the [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n counterpart to the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] [[Inanna]] and to the cognate [[Phoenicia]]n [[goddess]] [[Astarte]]. [[Anunit]], [[Atarsamain]] and [[Esther]] are alternative names for Ishtar. Ishtar is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In the Babylonian pantheon, she "was the divine personification of the planet Venus".&lt;ref&gt;Guirand, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Semiramis]] was a legendary Assyrian empress-regnant who first came to prominence for her bravery in battle and greatly expanded her empire.

===Old Testament===
*[[Deborah]], a prophetess mentioned in the ''[[Book of Judges]]'', was a poet who rendered her judgments beneath a [[palm tree]] between [[Ramah in Benjamin|Ramah]] and [[Bethel]] in the land of [[Benjamin]]. After her victory over Sisera and the Canaanite army, there was peace in the land for forty years.

===Phoenician mythology===
*[[Ashtart]] [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] "ʻštrt" (ʻAshtart); and Hebrew עשתרת (Ashtoreth, singular, or Ashtarot, plural); Greek ([[Astarte]]) is the  Phoenician counterpart to the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] [[Inanna]] and to the cognate Babylonian goddess Ishtar as well as the Greek Aphrodite. She is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war. Ashtoreth is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a foreign, non-Judahite goddess, the principal goddess of the homeland of the Phoenicians which is in modern-day [[Lebanon]], representing the productive power of nature. [[Herodotus]] wrote that the religious community of Aphrodite originated in Phoenicia (modern day Lebanon) and came to Greeks from there. He also wrote about the world's largest temple of Aphrodite, in one of the Phoenician cities.
*Tanit is a Phoenician lunar goddess, worshiped as the patron goddess at Carthage. Her shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia (Carthage) revealed an inscription that identified her for the first time in her homeland (Phoenicia of the Levant) and related her securely to the Phoenician goddess Astarte/Ashtart. In Egyptian, her name means Land of Neith, Neith being a war goddess. Long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit is still venerated in North Africa under the Latin name of Juno Caelestis, for her identification with the Roman goddess Juno. Hvidberg-Hansen (Danish professor of Semitic philology), notes that Tanit is sometimes depicted with a lion's head, showing her warrior quality. In modern times the name, with the spelling "Tanith", has been used as a female given name, both for real people and, more frequently, in occult fiction. From the 5th century BC  onwards, Tanit is associated with that of Ba`al Hammon. She is given the epithet pene baal ("face of Baal") and the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief).

===Hinduism===
*[[Durga]] ({{lang-sa|"the inaccessible"&lt;ref&gt;"Durga." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 25 February  2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9363243/Durga"&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}} or "the invincible",&lt;ref&gt;"Durga" Sanatan Society &lt;http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/durga.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-bn|দুর্গা}}) is a form of [[Devi]], the supreme [[goddess]] of [[Hinduism]]. According to the narrative from the [[Devi Mahatmya]] of the [[Markandeya Purana]], the form of Durga was created as a warrior goddess to fight a demon. The nine-day holiday dedicated to Durga, ''The [[Durga Puja]],'' is the biggest annual festival in [[Bengal]] and other parts of Eastern India and is celebrated by Hindus all over the world.
*[[Kālī]] ({{lang-sa|काली}}, {{IPA-sa|kɑːliː|IPA}}; {{lang-bn|কালী}}; {{lang-pa|ਕਾਲੀ}};  {{lang-si|කාලි}}; {{lang-te|కాళికాదేవి}}; {{lang-kn|ಕಾಳಿ ಮಾತಾ}}; {{lang-ta|காளி}}), also known as '''{{IAST|Kālikā}}''' ({{lang-sa|कालिका}}, {{lang-bn|কালিকা}}), is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[goddess]] associated with empowerment, [[shakti]]. The name Kali comes from ''kāla'', which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for [[Shiva]]. Kali means "the black one".  Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In Kāli's most famous myth, [[Durga]] and her assistants, the [[Matrikas]], wound the demon [[Raktabija]], in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him.  They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kinsley p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Durga, in need of help, summons Kāli to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess Kāli at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as ''Daksinakali''.
* Other warrior goddesses include [[Chamunda]] ("the killer of demon Chanda and Munda") and the goddess group [[Matrikas]] ("Mothers").
*[[Vishpala]] (in ''The [[Rigveda]]'') is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made. Afterwards, she returned to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpoc.org/library/1976_05_015.asp|title=A Brief Review of the History of Amputations and Prostheses Earl E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6166">'''The Little Tough Guys''' (later billed as 'The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys') were a group of actors who made a series of films and serials released by [[Universal Studios]] from 1938 through 1943.  Many of them were originally part of [[Dead End Kids|The Dead End Kids]], and several of them later became members of [[East Side Kids|The East Side Kids]] and [[The Bowery Boys]].

==History==
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
The urban drama ''Dead End'' became both a successful play and a hit movie, featuring six young actors playing streetwise guttersnipes: [[Billy Halop]], [[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Bobby Jordan]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]. The troupe became known as [[The Dead End Kids]] and starred in a series of features for [[Warner Brothers]].

==Little Tough Guys==
In 1938, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] borrowed the Dead End Kids (except Gorcey and Jordan) for a juvenile-delinquency drama called ''[[Little Tough Guy]]''. Universal adopted this as a brand name, and turned the film into a series of 'Little Tough Guys' features. The studio filled out the cast with David Gorcey (Leo's younger brother) and [[Hal E. Chester|Hally Chester]]. 

The next three films did not include any of the original Dead End Kids. ''Little Tough Guys in Society'' (1939) was more of a lightweight comedy, while the next two, ''Newsboys' Home'' and ''Code of the Streets'' (1939), were more dramatic. [[Jackie Cooper]] starred in ''Newsboys' Home'', but was not a member of the team. Only David Gorcey and Hally Chester remained from the first film, ''Little Tough Guy''. This was the beginning of the members of the team changing on almost a film-to-film basis. Eleven actors drifted in and out of the series, including [[Frankie Thomas]], Charles Duncan (who was originally hired to play Leo Gorcey's role in the play ''Dead End''), and [[Billy Benedict]]. 

When Warners released Bobby Jordan from his contract, Universal quickly signed him to join the rest of gang. Now, with five of the original six Dead End Kids on the payroll, Universal revised the billing to read "The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys". In total, the Little Tough Guys made 12 feature films, and three 12-chapter serials. Leading player Halop joined the armed forces and was replaced by Jordan for the final film in the series, ''Keep 'Em Slugging'', released in 1943.

[[Shemp Howard]] of the [[Three Stooges]] appeared in ''Give Us Wings'', ''Hit The Road'' and ''[[Keep 'Em Slugging]]''. Huntz Hall cited Howard as a major influence when his later "Bowery Boys" series shifted to all-out slapstick comedy.

There was still a market for these tough-teen films, and most of the Little Tough Guys principals wound up at [[Monogram Pictures]] as [[The East Side Kids]] and [[The Bowery Boys]].

'''Margaret Ann Neve''' (''née'' '''Harvey'''; 18 May 1792 – 4 April 1903) was the first recorded female [[supercentenarian]] and the second validated human to reach the age of 110 after [[Geert Adriaans Boomgaard]]. She lived at [[Saint Peter Port]] on the island of [[Guernsey]] in the [[English Channel]]. She was also the first proven individual whose life spanned three centuries (18th to the 20th centuries).

==Family==
By Margaret's birth her family was already well-established on the island. Her father John Harvey was born in Cornwall in 1771 to John (1736-1778) and Margaret Ann Parker (d.1790). John Harvey was involved in merchant shipping and [[privateer]]ing, earning a great amount of wealth over the years. He married Elizabeth Harvey (''née'' Guille) when they were both 19. John died on 4 December 1820 at the age of 49, and  Elizabeth lived with her remaining children in a house called "Chaumière" ("The Cottage"), which he had bought in 1808.&lt;ref name="Priaulx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |title=The Harvey Family |work=Priaulx Library |date=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022135751/http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |archivedate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth died in 1871 at the age of 99.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Together they had seven children:
* Margaret (1792-1903)
* John (1793-1865) - married Anne Sophia Grut (1802-1844) in 1826 and moved to Jersey, then England. They had a son named Thomas, who served in the militia and became a merchant.
* Elizabeth (1796-) - never married.
* Maria (1799) and Augusta (1801) had died as infants.
* Thomas (1803) emigrated to the United States.
* Augusta (1804) - married.
* Louisa (1805-1821)

==Early life and marriage==
Born Margaret Harvey on 18 May 1792, the eldest of seven children, most of her childhood was spent in [[Guernsey]]. Early in her life she survived a fall down the stairs, which left her [[concussion|concussed]] for three days.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Neve, as she would become, could remember the turmoil that the [[French Revolution]] brought to Guernsey; at the time, her father was in command of the militia on the island. In 1807, at the age of 15, Neve set sail for [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] with her father, but a storm caused the ship to land at [[Chesil Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/chambersofcommerce/guernsey-1808-9.pdf |title=Guernsey (Channel Islands) chamber of commerce, members in 1808-9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

She was educated in [[Bristol]], England, gaining an interest in literature and poetry. In 1815, she went to a "finishing school" in Brussels, becoming fluent in French and Italian and able to converse in German and Spanish. She would read the [[New Testament]] in Greek.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|19}}

With her headmistress, she visited the battlefield of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], shortly after [[Battle of Waterloo|the battle]], once the corpses had been buried. There, Margaret picked up souvenirs which she showed to Prussian Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] in London.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Neve met with [[Charles François Dumouriez]], a general of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], who dubbed her "la spirituelle".&lt;ref name="neve1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|pages=10|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=1903-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret married John Neve, born 1779, from [[Tenterden]], Kent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/04/19/101990032.pdf |title=The Late Mrs Neve |work=NY Times |date=19 April 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; in St Peter Port (Town) church on 18 January 1823. On their honeymoon, they visited the Waterloo battlefield, 8 years after the battle.&lt;ref name="ST03"&gt;{{cite news |title=AGED 110 YEARS |publisher=The Straits Times |date=7 May 1903 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived in England for 25 years of marriage, but when her husband died in 1849, she returned to Guernsey.&lt;ref name="neve2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Her Hundred-and-eighth Birthday|pages=3|work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=1900-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had no children.

== Later life and death ==

The census for 1871 shows Margaret A. Neve (78) and her sister Elizabeth Harvey (73) living at 'Chaumière', Rouge Huis, St Peter Port, Guernsey.&lt;ref&gt;RG10-5765-222-1&lt;/ref&gt; Neve traveled abroad to various countries with Elizabeth.  Their last trip was in 1872, when Neve was 80, wherein they visited the Polish city of [[Krakow]] (then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]).&lt;ref name="neve2" /&gt;

On 18 May 1899, a reception was held at [[Rouge Huis]] to celebrate her 107th birthday and her entrance into her 108th year. The town council, [[jurat]]s, the officers of the staff, and about 250 of the leading residents attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unexampled Longevity. |pages=21 |work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=1899-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her age, Margaret was found making [[marmalade]] the next morning by a reporter from ''[[The Times]]''. She was reported as never being ill until the age of 105, when she had the flu, followed by bronchitis at 108. At the age of 110, she climbed a tree to pluck an apple, explaining that they were much tastier when eaten straight from the tree.&lt;ref name="BIB"&gt;{{cite book |first=Glen |last=Balfour-Pau |title=Bagpipes in Babylon: A Lifetime in the Arab World and Beyond |ISBN=9781845111519 |publisher=I.B.Tauris, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

A newspaper report records that she enjoyed a glass and a half of old sherry at lunchtime, followed by a weak whiskey and water at supper. She was in the habit of always rising early and abstaining from eating and drinking between meal times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Oldest Woman in the World |publisher=arence and Richmond Examiner |date=19 February 1901 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, she did not receive congratulations from [[Queen Victoria]] congratulating her for reaching her 110th birthday. However, the Harvey family (through Neve's niece Louisa) did exchange correspondence with the Royal Household, expressing gratitude for the signed photograph given to them on 4 May 1896 by the Queen.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Neve died on 4 April 1903, a month before her 111th birthday. She reportedly repeated a [[Psalm]] in a loud voice the day before she died. Flags in Guernsey were lowered to half mast as a show of respect.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|20}} She was one of the last few living people from the 18th century.

The '''Muan''', '''Moan''' or '''Mohan''' (moo-ahn), sometimes also known as '''Poira''' is a name applied to several mythological or otherwise supernatural creatures in [[South America|South]] and [[Latin American folklore|Central American folklore]]. The most common and widespread use of the term is to refer to the souls of the dead and the indigenous ancestors of old. The word is also used for [[shaman]]s or [[witch doctor]]s in some [[Colombia]]n indigenous cultures (such as the [[:es:Panche|Panche]]s).
[[File:Mohan pijao.JPG|thumb|right|Un muñeco de Mohán.]]
==History==
Various different legends exist about the Mohan, with many of them emerging from Colombia. In Colombia, Mohan can also mean a forest or barren land kind of supernatural being associated with natural forces such as the great rivers and the mysteries lying within the forests, beyond human reach and comprehension. In some legends, it is a [[satyr]]-like being who steals and rapes young women and lives in a cave-like grotto in the bottom of the great jungle rivers where he keeps his female captives. In others, it is depicted as the spirit of an old Indian, brawny and stout, with a terrifying grin and stare, with larger than human stature and proportions, who steals fishermen's bait, catch or nets, and has the power to change shape into a cat-like beast. Other legends describe the Mohan as a "big-headed Indian, with short legs and fish fins on his back, and very brown."&lt;ref name="Botero 1999 286"&gt;{{cite book|last=Botero|first=Alvaro|title=La fábula y el desastre: estudios críticos sobre la novela colombiana, 1650-1931|year=1999|publisher=Fondo Editorial Universidad EAFIT|location=Medellín|isbn=958-9041-27-2|page=286|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/La_f%C3%A1bula_y_el_desastre.html?id=yqXq2rVoA0kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed as an extremely hairy being with a very treacherous personality who dwells in the backwaters and is feared by many people.

The shaman was not able to fully transform back into a human, and became an alligator with a human head.&lt;ref name="Uribe"/&gt; The Poira, whose name is interchangeable with the Mohan, is described by others as an Indian warlock who lives on the [[:es:Cerro del Pacandé|Cerro del Pacandé]] in Tolima, Colombia.&lt;ref name="Botero 1999 286"/&gt; The Poira is also believed to be a small, naked invisible boy or adult who can also appear formless or as a black bear.&lt;ref name="American Elves: An Encyclopedia of Little People from the Lore of 380 Ethnic Groups of the Western Hemisphere"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roth|first=John|title=American Elves: An Encyclopedia of Little People from the Lore of 380 Ethnic Groups of the Western Hemisphere|year=1997|publisher=Mcfarland &amp; Co Inc Pub|isbn=0899509444|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{New Netherland}}

The council of '''Nine Men''' was a citizens board and a form of representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous councils, the [[Twelve Men]] and the [[Eight Men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs  |first=Jaap  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Netherland: A Dutch Colony In Seventeenth-Century America |year=2005  |publisher= |quote=Both in the way it was set up and in the extent of its rights, the council of Twelve Men, as did the two later advisory bodies ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uex2budtSOUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq |isbn=90-04-12906-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the council were elected in 1647, 1649, 1650 and 1652. On July 26, 1649, eleven current and former members of the board signed the ''Petition of the Commonality of New Netherland'', which requested that the States General take action to encourage [[economic freedom]] and force local government like that in the Netherlands, removing the colony from the control of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. It became the basis for the municipal government when the city of [[New Amsterdam]] received its charter in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = About the City Council   | publisher = New York City Council   | date =    | url = http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | accessdate = 2013-01-01   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120620053608/http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | archivedate = 2012-06-20   | df =    }} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3722">'''Philip Bellino''' and '''Edward Gertson''' (both died May 9, 1947) were the last persons [[capital punishment|executed]] by [[Massachusetts]].

==The murder==

Bellino and Gertson were two gangsters convicted of [[murder]]ing nineteen-year-old Robert "Tex" Williams, a former [[U.S. Marine]]. On August 3, 1945, Williams led Bellino, Gertson and Charles Mantia to a [[New Hampshire]] [[summer camp]]. He had learned there would be an illegal dice game taking place in the camp. The four men would rob the players at gunpoint. Williams had lured his accomplices with a promise of easily stealing up to $10,000. Instead they escaped with "a few hundred dollars".&lt;ref name = rogers&gt;Alan Rogers, [http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bctwj/22_2/02_TXT.htm "Success—At Long Last: The Abolition of the Death Penalty in Massachusetts, 1928–1984"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trio was enraged at Williams. They also feared the younger man could squeal on them to the police. On August 7, 1945, the four of them shared a taxi ride in the vicinity of [[Boston]]. The taxi stopped at an isolated location, not far from the shore. Williams, Bellino and Gertson stepped out for a walk. Mantia waited in the taxi with the cab driver. Bellino and Gertson returned without Williams, claiming the young man would spend his night with a girlfriend.&lt;ref name = rogers/&gt;

Williams' corpse was soon after discovered. He had been shot in the back of the head. Mantia was the one to lead the police to Bellino and Gertson. James Salah, the cab driver, also became a witness for the prosecution. On June 18, 1946, the duo were found guilty of first-degree murder in a trial by jury. There were originally 14 jurors. Two of them had been dismissed prior to the final verdict. A legal argument that this violated the rights of the defendants was eventually rejected by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]]. A "mercy bill" discussed at the time in the [[Massachusetts General Court]] could have proven beneficial to the duo, but was vetoed by [[Robert F. Bradford]], [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|Governor of Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name = rogers/&gt;

==Execution and abolition of death penalty in Massachusetts==
Both Bellino and Gertson were executed in the [[electric chair]] at the [[Massachusetts State Prison at Charlestown]] shortly after midnight on the night of May 8–9, 1947.

On April 3, 1951, Massachusetts enacted a "mercy bill" which removed the mandatory death sentence for murder in all cases except for murder committed in the course of rape or attempted rape. No further executions were carried out and in 1984 the [[Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts]] ruled that capital punishment violated the [[constitution of Massachusetts|state constitution]].

{{Islamic prophets|Prophets in the Quran}}
{{Islam|beliefs}}

'''Prophets in Islam''' ({{lang-ar|الأنبياء في الإسلام}}) include "messengers" (''rasul'', pl. ''rusul''), bringers of a [[Revelation|divine revelation]] via an angel (Arabic: {{lang|ar|ملائكة}}, [[Islamic view of angels|malāʾikah]]);&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaatri, A. I. 2007"&gt;Shaatri, A. I. (2007). Nayl al Rajaa' bisharh' Safinat an'najaa'. Dar Al Minhaj.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Prophet#Islam|prophet]]s" (''nabī'', pl. ''anbiyāʼ''), lawbringers that [[Muslim]]s believe were sent by [[God in Islam|God]] to every person, bringing God's message in a language they can understand.&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo|first1=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816054541|pages=559–560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA559&amp;dq=prophethood+in+islam+encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pTKIVduAEobuoAS0-Yi4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=prophethood%20in%20islam%20encyclopedia&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|30|47|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the Islamic prophets is one of the [[Iman (concept)#The_Six_Articles_of_Faith|six articles of the Islamic faith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/beliefs.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Basic articles of faith|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813005904/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/beliefs.shtml|archive-date=13 August 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically mentioned in the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|2|285|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that the first prophet was also the first human being, [[Adam]] ([[Adam in Islam|ادم]]), created by Allah (الله). Many of the revelations delivered by the 48 [[prophets in Judaism]] and many [[prophets of Christianity]] are mentioned as such in the Quran but usually in slightly different forms. For example, the Jewish [[Elisha]] is called [[Elisha#In Islam|Eliyas]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] is [[Job in Islam|Ayyub]], [[Jesus]] is [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]], etc. The [[Torah]] given to [[Moses]] ([[Moses in Islam|Musa]]) is called ''[[Torah in Islam|Tawrat]]'', the [[Psalms]] given to [[David]] ([[David in Islam|Dawud]]) is the ''[[Zabur]]'', the [[The gospel|Gospel]] given to Jesus is ''[[Gospel in Islam|Injil]]''.&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559/&gt;

Unique to Islam is [[Muhammad]] ([[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad ibn ʿAbdullāh]]), who Muslims believe is the "Seal of the Prophets" (''[[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]]'', i.e. the last prophet); and the [[Quran]], revealed to Muhammad but not written down by him,&lt;ref name=denffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Denffer|first=Ahmad von|title=Ulum al-Qur'an : an introduction to the sciences of the Qur an|year=1985|publisher=Islamic Foundation|isbn=0860371328|pages=37|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Muslims believe is unique among divine revelations as the only correct one protected by [[God in Islam|God]] from distortion or corruption,&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding the Qurán'' - Page xii, Ahmad Hussein Sakr - 2000&lt;/ref&gt; destined to remain in its true form until the [[End time|Last Day]].&lt;ref name="The Qur'an Surah 15:9"&gt;{{Cite quran|15|9|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe Muhammad to be the last prophet, although after the prophets there are still [[Wali|saints]]&lt;ref&gt;Neal Robinson ''Christ in Islam and Christianity'' SUNY Press 1990 {{ISBN|978-0-791-40558-1}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt; (though some modern schools, such as [[Salafism]] and [[Wahhabism]], reject the theory of sainthood&lt;ref&gt;Radtke, B., Lory, P., Zarcone, Th., DeWeese, D., Gaborieau, M., F. M. Denny, Françoise Aubin, J. O. Hunwick and N. Mchugh, "Walī", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W. P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In Muslim belief, every prophet in Islam preached the same main Islamic beliefs, the [[Tawhid|Oneness of God]], worshipping of that one God, avoidance of [[Shirk (Islam)|idolatry]] and [[Islamic views on sin|sin]], and the belief in the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]] or the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]] and life after death. Each came to preach Islam at different times in history and some told of the coming of the final ''Islamic prophet and messenger'' of [[God in Islam|God]], who would be named "[[Ahmad|Ahmed]] and Muhammad". 

This narrative is found in "Chapter of the Ranks", Qur'an, 61:6 as Allah asked Jesus to remind the Children of Israel but they accused him of the prophecy:

&lt;big&gt;وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَـٰبَنِى إِسْرَٰعِيلَ إِنِّى رَسُولُ ٱللهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرىٰةِ وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِى مِن بَعْدِى ٱسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبينٌ&lt;/big&gt;  

''wa-idh qāla ‘Īsā ’b·nu Maryama: "yā Banī Israā‘īla innī Rasūlu ’llāhi ilay-kum muṣaddiqal li-mā bayna yadayya mina ’t-Tawraāti wa-mubash·shiram bi-Rasūlin ya’tī mim ba‘dī ’s·mu-huū Aḥmadu, fa-lammā jaā’a-hum bi’l-bayyināti, qālū "hādhā siḥrum mubīn!"''

{{quote|&lt;nowiki&gt;And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you, confirming the Law [=Torah] (which came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad." But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, "this is evident sorcery!"&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Quran, sura 61 (As-Saf), ''[[ayah]]'' 6|source=}}

== Etymology ==
In Arabic and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]],&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew root [[Nun (letter)|nun]]-[[Bet (letter)|vet]]-[[Aleph|alef]] ("navi") is based on the two-letter root nun-vet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself "open". Cf. [[Rashbam]]'s comment to {{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:7|105}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''nabī'' (Arabic plural form: &lt;big&gt;أَنْبِيَاء&lt;/big&gt; ''anbiyāʼ'') means "prophet". Forms of this noun occur 75 times in the Quran. The term ''[[nubuwwah]]'' ([[Arabic]]: &lt;big&gt;نُبُوَّة&lt;/big&gt; meaning "prophethood") occurs five times in the Quran. The terms ''rasūl'' ([[Arabic]] plural: &lt;big&gt;رُسُل&lt;/big&gt; ''rusul'') and  ''mursal'' ([[Arabic|ِArabic]] singular: &lt;big&gt;مُرْسَل&lt;/big&gt; ''mursal''; plural: &lt;big&gt;مُرْسَلُون&lt;/big&gt; ''mursalūn'') denote "messenger with law given/ received by GOD" and occur more than 300 times. The term for a prophetic "message" ([[Arabic|ِArabic]] singular: &lt;big&gt;رِسَالَة&lt;/big&gt; ''risālah''; plural: &lt;big&gt;رِسَالَات&lt;/big&gt; ''risālāt''), appears in the [[Quran]] in ten instances.&lt;ref name="EoQP"&gt;Uri Rubin, "Prophets and Prophethood", ''[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Syriac language|Syriac form]] of ''rasūl Allāh'' (literally: "messenger of God"), ''s̲h̲eliḥeh d-allāhā'', occurs frequently in the [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] ''[[Acts of Thomas|Acts of St. Thomas]]''. The corresponding verb for ''s̲h̲eliḥeh''—''s̲h̲alaḥ'', occurs in connection with the prophets in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:13-14|1000}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|4:13|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:8|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|1:7|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;A. J. Wensinck, "Rasul", ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "prophet" (Arabic: {{lang|ar|نبي}} {{transl|ar|''nabī''}}) and "messenger" (Arabic: {{lang|ar|رسول}} {{transl|ar|''rasūl''}}) appear several times in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]].

In the Hebrew Bible, the word ''[[Nevi'im|nabi]]'' ("spokesperson, prophet") occurs more commonly, and the Hebrew word ''mal'akh'' ("messenger") refers to [[Angels in Judaism]]. According to Judaism, [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zaqariah]], and [[Malachi]] were the last prophets, all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year [[Babylonian exile]]. With them, the authentic period of ''[[Prophecy#Judaism|Nevuah]]'' ("prophecy") died,&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Vilna Gaon]], based on the opinion that [[Nechemyah]] died in Babylon before 9th Tevet 3448 (313 BCE). Nechemya was governor of [[Yehud Medinata|Persian Judea]] under [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]] in the 5th century BCE. The [[Book of Nehemiah]] describes his work in rebuilding Jerusalem during the [[Second Temple period]]. {{Cite journal | title = Babylonian Talmud | first = Vilna |last=Gaon |authorlink=Vilna Gaon| volume = San.11a, Yom.9a/Yuch.1.14/Kuz.3.39,65,67/Yuch.1/Mag.Av.O.C.580.6 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nowadays only the "[[Bath Kol]]" (בת קול, lit. ''daughter of a voice'', "voice of God") exists ([[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 11a).

In the New Testament, however, the word "messenger" becomes more frequent, sometimes in association with the concept of a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|3:1|1000}}; [[Gospel of John|John]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|17:3|1000}}; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|11:10|1000}}; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:2|1000}}; [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|3:5|1000}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|4:11|1000}}; [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb||1Corinthians|28:12|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Messenger" may refer to Jesus, to his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] and to John the Baptist. But the last book of the Old Testament, the [[Book of Malachi]], speaks of a messenger that Christian commentators interpret as a reference to the future prophet [[John the Baptist]] (Yahya).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] under {{bibleverse||Malachi|2:7|1000}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Malachi|3:1|1000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2018}}
In Muslim belief, every Islamic prophet preached Islam. The beliefs of [[Charity (practice)|charity]], prayer, pilgrimage, worship of God and fasting are believed to have been taught by every prophet who has ever lived.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Quran itself calls Islam the "religion of [[Abraham]]" ([[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|67|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to [[Jacob]] ([[Jacob in Islam|Yaqub]]) and the [[Israelites|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] as being Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|123|e=133|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran says
{{quote|The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah—the which We have sent by inspiration to thee—and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein:...|Quran, sura 42 ([[Ash-Shura]]), ayah 13&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Status ===
Islam teaches that prophets were "protected from sin" by God, so unlike lesser human beings they cannot commit a sin.&lt;ref name="Auda-2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Auda |first1=Jasser |title=Were Prophets and Companions Infallible? |url=http://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-about-islam/prophets-companions-infallible/ |website=About Islam |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=Nov 17, 2016 |quote=Regarding the issue of the prophets being sinless or infallible, there is an agreement among scholars that prophets are protected from sins. The protection of all prophets from sins is an Islamic belief, which is a precondition to trusting the prophets’ message and following their example.
However, there is a debate among scholars on whether prophets (peace be upon them all) are subject to error in judgments in “human” matters. The word `issmah (literally: protection) is mentioned in the Quran in the context of the Prophet being protected from people’s whims and Satan’s delusions while he conveys the message of God.
However, the Quran did correct Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) on a few occasions in matters of human judgment (Quran 8:67; 9:43; and 80:1-3).
Nevertheless, some scholars rejected the possibility of erring in any prophetic decision whatsoever (for example, Al-Amedi, Al-Ihkaam fi Usul Al-Ahkam, vol.4, p. 99, Dar Al-Kitab Al-Arabi, Beirut, AH 1404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IQA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saalih al-Munajjid |first1=Muhammad |title=248875: Infallibility of the Prophets |url=https://islamqa.info/en/248875 |website=Islam Question and Answer |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=4 January 2017 |quote=The Prophets were infallible in conveying the message from Allah, may He be exalted, so their words could not be but true and they did not make any mistake, whether deliberate or otherwise, in conveying the message.  They were also infallible and protected from committing major sins such as zina (adultery) and theft.  They were also infallible and protected from committing minor sins that are indicative of baseness, such as stealing a morsel of food or giving short measure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran speaks of the ''Islamic prophets'' as being the greatest human beings of all time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wheeler, ''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', "Prophets"&lt;/ref&gt; A prophet, in the Muslim sense of the term, is a person whom God specially chose to teach the faith of Islam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some were called to prophesy late in life, in Muhammad's case at the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, ''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', "Noah"&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as John the Baptist, were called to prophesy while still at a young age and Jesus prophesied while still in his cradle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|30|e=33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Quran verse 4:69 lists various virtuous groups of human beings, among whom prophets (including messengers) occupy the highest rank. Verse 4:69 reads:&lt;ref name="EoQP"/&gt;

{{quote|All who obey [[Allah]] and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allah—of the prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of Truth), the witnesses (who testify), and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!|Quran, sura 4 (An-Nisa), ''[[ayah]]'' 69&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|69|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Biblical stories retold in the Quran in the Arabic language (e.g., Job, Moses, [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] ([[Joseph in Islam|Yusuf]]) etc.) certainly differ from the Jewish [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Greek Old Testament]] and the Greek [[New Testament]], in that the Quran always demonstrates that it is "God's practice" (''[[sunnat Allah]]'') to make faith triumph finally over the forces of evil and adversity. "We have made the [[Shaitan|evil ones]] friends to those without faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|27|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Assuredly God will defend those who believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|22|49|e=133|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eoi-84&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosskeen Gibb,|first1=Hamilton Alexander|last2=Pellat|first2=Charles|last3=Schacht|first3=Joseph|last4=Lewis,|first4=Bernard|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|date=1973|publisher=Brill|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|Islamic Isa]] did not die on the cross like the Christian thought about Jesus, but deceived his enemies and ascended to heaven.

The prophets and messengers "share no divine attributes", and possess "no knowledge or power" other than that granted to them by God.&lt;ref name=EHHoF&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Amriki|first1=Yusuf Talal Ali|last2=Ullah|first2=Qazi Thanaa|title=Essential Hanafi Handbook of Fiqh|date=1985|publisher=Kazi Publications|location=Lahore, Pakistan|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numbers ===
Muslims believe that many prophets existed, including many not mentioned in the Quran.

But Abu’l-Faraj ibn al-Jazwi disagreed with him and included this hadeeth in his book ''al-Mawdoo‘aat'' (the fabricated hadeeths) and accused Ibraaheem ibn Hishaam of fabricating the hadeeth. There is no doubt that more than one of the imams of ''al-jarh wa’t-ta‘deel'' (evaluation of hadeeth narrators) criticised him because of this hadeeth. "&lt;/ref&gt; and Shu'ayb al-Arna'oot&lt;ref&gt;''Tahqeeq Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan'', 2/79, "Shu‘ayb al-Arna’oot said: Its ''isnaad'' is ''da‘eef jiddan'' (very weak) – and he quoted the comments of the scholars about Ibraaheem ibn Hishaam."&lt;/ref&gt; the narration is weak, if not fabricated.

=== Female prophets ===
Most mainstream [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] scholars agree that prophets were males only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = There were no female prophets - Islam web - English|url = http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=31788|website = www.islamweb.net|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}} Still, some like [[Ibn Hazm]], [[Al-Qurtubi|Qartubi]], [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajir]], and [[Ash'ari|al Ash‘ari]] thought that the verses that mention angels speaking to Mary are proofs of her prophethood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Surat 'Ali `Imran [3:42] - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم|url = http://legacy.quran.com/3/42|website = legacy.quran.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://islamqa.info/en/158044&lt;nowiki/&gt;With regard to Prophethood, some of the scholars – such as Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari, al-Qurtubi and Ibn Hazm – were of the view that there were some female Prophets! including Maryam bint ‘Imraan. Their evidence is the verses in which it says that Allah, may He be exalted, sent revelation to the mother of Moosa, for example, and what it says about the angels speaking to Maryam (peace be upon her), and also what it says about Allah, may He be exalted, having chosen her above the women of the world.
&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}}  Also, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajir]] interprets the Hadith "Many among men attained perfection but among women none attained the perfection except Mary, the daughter of `Imran; and Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh." He said perfection is prophethood, hence his claim that Mary and [[Asiya]] were prophets.&lt;ref&gt;http://islamqa.info/en/7181&lt;nowiki/&gt;The scholars differed as to the meaning of the perfection of women. Some said, it refers to Prophethood.

Ibn Hajar said in "''al-Fath''":

"… it is as if he said: No women attained Prophethood except for So and so and So and so." (''al-Fath'', 6/447).
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scriptures and other gifts ==

=== Holy books ===
{{See also|Islamic holy books}}
The revealed books are the records which Muslims believe were dictated by God to various Islamic prophets throughout the history of mankind, all these books promulgated the code and laws of Islam. The belief in all the revealed books is an [[Creed#Islamic creed|article of faith]] in Islam and Muslims must believe in all the scriptures to be a Muslim. Muslims believe the Quran, the final holy scripture, was sent because all the previous holy books had been either [[Tahrif|corrupted]] or lost.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse, "Holy Books"&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Islam speaks of respecting all the previous scriptures, even in their current forms.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran mentions some Islamic scriptures by name, which came before the Quran:
* ''[[Torah in Islam|Tawrat]]'' ([[Torah]]): According to the Quran, the Tawrat (Torah) was revealed to Moses,&lt;ref name="Q5336"&gt;{{Cite quran|53|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Muslims believe that the current Pentateuch, although it retains the main message,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|87|18|e=19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suffered corruption over the years. Moses and his brother Haroon ([[Aaron]]) used the Torah to preach the message to the Children of Israel. The Quran implies that the Torah is the longest-used scripture, with the [[Jews|Jewish]] people still using the Torah today, and that all the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] prophets would warn the people of any corruptions that were in the scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|44|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus, in Muslim belief, was the last prophet to be taught the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]] in its true form.
* ''[[Zabur]]'' ([[Psalms]]): The Quran mentions the Psalms as being the holy scripture revealed to David. Scholars have often understood the Psalms to have been holy songs of praise.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', "Psalms"&lt;/ref&gt; The current Psalms are still praised by many Muslim scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Martin Lings, ''Mecca''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Abdul Malik, ''In Thy Seed''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Muslims generally assume that some of the current Psalms were written later and are not divinely revealed.
* Book of Enlightenment ([[Arabic]]: &lt;big&gt;كِتَابُ ٱلْمُنِير&lt;/big&gt; ''Kitābu ’l-Munīr''): The Quran mentions a ''Book of Enlightenment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|184|s=ns}} and {{Cite quran|35|25|s=ns|b=n}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has alternatively been translated as ''Scripture of Enlightenment'' or the ''Illuminating Book''. It mentions that some prophets, in the past, came with clear signs from God as well as this particular scripture.
* Books of Divine Wisdom ([[Arabic]]: possibly identified as &lt;big&gt;الْزُبُر&lt;/big&gt; ''az-Zubur''): The Quran mentions certain ''Books of Divine Wisdom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|184|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated by some scholars as ''Books of Dark Prophecies'', which are a reference to particular books vouchsafed to some prophets, wherein there was wisdom for man. Some scholars have suggested that these may be one and the same as the Psalms as their root Arabic word, ''Zubur'' (Quran 35:25) - the plural for the word "Scriptures", comes from the same source as the Arabic ''Zabur'' for the Psalms.
* ''[[Gospel in Islam|İnjil]]'' ([[Gospel]]): The İnjil (Gospel) was the holy book revealed to Jesus, according to the Quran. Although many lay Muslims believe the ''Injil'' refers to the entire New Testament, scholars have clearly pointed out that it refers not to the New Testament but to an original Gospel, which was sent by God, and was given to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary'', Appendix: "On the Injil"&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, according to Muslim belief, the Gospel was the message that Jesus, being divinely inspired, preached to the Children of Israel. The current [[Development of the New Testament canon|canonical Gospels]], in the belief of Muslim scholars, are not divinely revealed but rather are documents of the life of Jesus, as written by various contemporaries, disciples and companions. These Gospels contain portions of Jesus's teachings but do not represent the original Gospel, which was a single book written not by a human but was sent by God.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', "Injil"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scrolls of Abraham]]: ([[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ ٱلْأُولَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Ūlā'' - "Books of the Earliest Revelation" and/or [[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ إِبْرَهِيم ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’Ibrahīm'') The Scrolls of Abraham are believed to have been one of the earliest bodies of scripture, which were vouchsafed to Abraham,&lt;ref name="quran8719"&gt;{{Cite quran|87|19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later used by Ishmael and Isaac. Although usually referred to as 'scrolls/ manuscript', many translators have translated the Arabic ''Suhuf'' as 'the Scriptures'.&lt;ref&gt;Marmaduke Pickthall, ''The Meaning of the Glorious Quran''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scrolls of Abraham are now considered lost rather than corrupted, although some scholars{{who ?|date=May 2018}} have identified them with the [[Testament of Abraham]], an [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic piece of literature]] available in Arabic at the time of Muhammad{{source needed|date=May 2018}}. The verse mentioning the "Scriptures" is in Quran 87:18-19 where they are referred to "Books of the Earliest Revelation".
* [[Scrolls of Moses]]: ([[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ ٱلْأُولَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Ūlā'' - "Books of the Earliest Revelation" and/or [[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ مُوسَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Mūsā'') These scrolls, containing the revelations of Moses, which were perhaps written down later by Moses, Aaron and [[Joshua]], are understood by Muslims to refer not to the Torah but to revelations aside from the Torah. Some scholars have stated that they could possibly refer to the [[Book of the Wars of the Lord]],&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lost text spoken of in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 21:14&lt;/ref&gt; The verse mentioning the "Scriptures" is in Quran 87:18-19 where they are referred to "Books of the Earliest Revelation".

=== Holy gifts ===
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2011}}
The Quran mentions various divinely-bestowed gifts given to various prophets. These may be interpreted as books or forms of celestial knowledge. Although all prophets are believed by Muslims to have been immensely gifted, special mention of "wisdom" or "knowledge" for a particular prophet is understood to mean that some secret knowledge was revealed to him. The Quran mentions that Abraham prayed for wisdom and later received it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|26|83|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions that Joseph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|10|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|14|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; both attained wisdom when they reached full age; David received wisdom with kingship, after slaying [[Goliath]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|251|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] ([[Lot in Islam|Lut]] received wisdom whilst prophesying in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|21|74|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; John the Baptist received wisdom while still a mere youth;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|14|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jesus received wisdom and was vouchsafed the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|48|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To believe in God's messengers (Rusul) means to be convinced that God sent men as guides to fellow human beings and [[jinn]] (khalq) to guide them to the truth.

=== Prophethood in Ahmadiyya ===
{{main article|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}
The [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Community]] does not believe that messengers and prophets are different individuals. They interpret the Quranic words ''warner'' (''[[nadhir]]''), ''prophet'', and ''messenger'' as referring to different roles that the same divinely appointed individuals perform. Ahmadiyya distinguish only between law-bearing prophets and non-law-bearing ones. They believe that although law-bearing prophethood ended with Muhammad, non-law-bearing prophethood subordinate to Muhammad continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Alexa|date=2016|title=Placing the Marginalized Ahmadiyya in Context with the Traditional Sunni Majority|url=https://journals.gmu.edu/jmgr/article/download/1330/1142|dead-url=no|journal=3|publisher=Journal of Mason Graduate Research|volume=3|pages=122-123|issn=2327-0764|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006041014/https://journals.gmu.edu/jmgr/article/download/1330/1142|archive-date=2018-10-06|via=Mason Publishing Journals (at [[George Mason University]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e85|title=Ahmadis - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahmadiyya Community recognizes [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] also known as Mirza Qadiani (1835–1908) as such a “prophet” of gods and the promised [[Messiah]] and [[Imam]] [[Mahdi]] of the latter days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mirza-Ghulam-Ahmad|title=Mirza Ghulam Ahmad {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam|Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement]] rejects his status as a prophet, instead considering him to be a renewer of the faith.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, all other Muslims and their scholars argue and firmly establish that the Ahmadiyya community are not even Muslim due to the fact their beliefs violate the Muslim belief in Muhammad as the "Seal of the Prophets" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Other persons ==
The Quran mentions 25 prophets by name but also tells that God (Allah) sent many other prophets and messengers, to all the different nations that have existed on Earth. Many verses in the Qur'an discuss this:
* "We did aforetime send messengers before thee: of them there are some whose story We have related to thee, and some whose story We have not related to thee...."&lt;ref name="quran4078"&gt;{{cite quran|40|78|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger, ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|16|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other special persons in the Qur'an ===
* [[Caleb#Quranic account|Caleb (Kaleb)]]: In the Quran, Caleb is mentioned in the 5th [[surah]] of the Quran (5:20-26).
* [[Dhul-Qarnayn]]: Dhul-Qarnayn.  
* [[Joachim#In Islam|Joachim (Imran)]]: The [[Al Imran|Family of Imran]] ([[Arabic]]: '''آل عمران''') is the 3rd chapter of the Quran. ''Imran'' is [[Arabic]] for the biblical figure [[Amram]], the father of Moses and Aaron, who is regarded by Muslims as being the ancestor of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] ([[Mary in Islam|Maryām]]) and Jesus through his son Aaron. In Muslim belief, however, the [[Christian]] Joachim has been attributed the name Imran as well.
* [[Khidr]]: The Quran also mentions the mysterious Khidr (but does not name him), identified at times with [[Melchizedek]], who is the figure that Moses accompanies on one journey. Although most Muslims regard him as an enigmatic saint or an angel,&lt;ref&gt;Jill Caskey, Adam S. Cohen, Linda Safran ''Confronting the Borders of Medieval Art'' BRILL 2011 {{ISBN|978-9-004-20749-3}} page 124&lt;/ref&gt; some see him as a prophet as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863824465|title=The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism|last=Noegel|first=Scott B.|last2=Wheeler|first2=Brannon M.|date=2010-04-01|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9781461718956|location=Lanham|pages=196-197|oclc=863824465}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Luqman]]: The Quran mentions the [[Wise old man|sage]] Luqman in [[Luqman (sura)|the chapter]] named after him, but does not clearly identify him as a prophet. The most widespread Islamic belief&lt;ref&gt;''A-Z of Prophets in Islam'', B. M. Wheeler, "Luqman"&lt;/ref&gt; views Luqman as a [[saint]], but not as a prophet. The Arabic term ''[[wali]]'' (Arabic ولي, plural Awliyā' أولياء) is commonly translated into English as "Saint". However, the wali should not be confused with the Christian tradition of sainthood. A key difference is that the wali continues what a prophet taught without any change. However, other Muslims regard Luqman as a prophet as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse, "Prophets in Islam"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mary in Islam|Mary (Maryam)]]: A few scholars (such as [[Ibn Hazm]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/islam/gender/women_prophethood.html|title=Imam Ibn Hazm: On Prophethood of Women|last=Farooq|first=Mohammad Omar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312084433/http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/islam/gender/women_prophethood.html|archive-date=2005-03-12|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=Mohammed Zayki|date=2015|title=Ibn Ḥazm’s theory of prophecy of women: Literalism, logic, and perfection|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.831.1259&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|dead-url=no|journal=Intellectual Discourse|publisher=IIUM Press|volume=23|issue=1|pages=76-77|issn=0128-4878|eissn=2289-5639|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006035648/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.831.1259&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|archive-date=2018-10-05|via=[[CiteSeerX]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; see Maryam (Mary) as a ''nabi'' and a prophetess, since God sent her a message via an angel. The Quran, however, does not explicitly identify her as a prophet. Islamic belief regards her as one of the holiest of women, but not as a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond The Exotic: Women's Histories In Islamic Societies'', p. 402. Ed. Amira El-Azhary Sonbol.

* [[Saul#In Islam|Saul]] ([[Talut]]): Saul is not considered a prophet, but a divinely appointed king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2115|title=Saul - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jacob#Children of Jacob|Sons of Jacob]]: These men are sometimes not considered to be prophets, although most exegesis scholars consider them to be prophets, citing the hadith of Muhammad and their status as prophets in Judaism. The reason that some do not consider them as prophets is because of their behaviour with Yusuf (Joseph) and that they lied to their father.

=== Other people mentioned in Islamic literature ===
Numerous other people have been mentioned by scholars in the Hadith, [[exegesis]], [[Tafsir|commentary]]. These people include:

'''Qutalmish''' ({{lang-1ca|قُتَلمِش}}, {{lang-fa|قتلمش}}) (alternative spellings: '''Qutulmush''', '''Kutalmish''', {{lang|tr|'''Kutalmış'''}}) was a Turkic prince who was a member of Seljukid house in the 11th century. His son [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Kutalmışoglu Suleiman]], founded the [[Sultanate of Rum]] in what is now Turkey.

==Sultanate of Rûm==
Kutalmish was the son of [[Arslan Yabgu]] and a cousin of [[Tughril]] and played a vital role in the conquests of the [[Seljuq Turks]]. In 1046, he was sent with an army by Tughril to force back the Byzantine army at Ganja and was victorious.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker, ''The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna'', (Greenwood Publishing, 2000), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He supported a rebellion against Tughril and contested the succession to the throne with [[Alp Arslan]]. (''see'' [[Battle of Damghan (1063)]]) According to the historian [[Ali ibn al-Athir]], Kutalmish knew the sciences of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Institutionalisation of Science in the Medreses of pre-Ottoman and Ottoman Turkey'', Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, '''Turkish Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science''', Ed. Gürol Irzik and Güven Güzeldere, (Springer, 2005), 267.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Suleiman]], was recognized as Sultan of [[Sultanate of Rûm|Rûm]] by [[Malik Shah I]] in 1084.&lt;ref&gt;Köprülü, Mehmed Fuad.

Shamballah is said by the adherents to the Ascended Master Teachings, to be a floating city manifested on the [[etheric plane]] somewhere above the [[Gobi Desert]] in the borderlands of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;(See: '[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]' By [[Yogananda Paramahansa]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A Tibetan Journey]] By Alexandra David-Neale. 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great White Brotherhood]] is a spiritual 'fraternity' of Ascended Beings, including Lord Sunat Kumara, long since dedicated to the eventual Salvation of Mankind and the establishment of Divine Law again in this Three-dimensional reality.

According to Elizabeth Van Buren, the Brotherhood once maintained (earthly) headquarters hidden in a remote valley near a sacred lake in old Tibet, until relatively recently, when, possibly due to the surmised threat of Communist China, they withdrew, allegedly through subterranean tunnels to an alternative earthly location in [[Peru]], where they are still reported as having an earth base (circa 1985).&lt;ref&gt;[[Authors Notes: 'The Refuge of the Apocalypse.]] By Elizabeth Van Buren. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors believe that Lord Sunat Kumara is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, composed of [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] (called in the Ascended Master Teachings [[Ascended Master]]s) and volunteers from other worlds who have joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004. Describes the founding of Shamballah by Sunat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in Hinduism==
Sanat Kumara appears as a [[rishi]] in the [[Hindu]] [[religious text]] the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]. A shrine to Sanat Kumara which attracts and unites people of all religions and faiths is situated in the town of [[Kataragama]], [[Sri Lanka]]. In Sanskrit, "Sanat Kumara" is "Eternal Youth" (from [[Sant (religion)|Sanat]] "eternal", Ku "with difficulty" and Mara "mortal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danijel.org/index.php?id=clanak&amp;articleID=161&amp;pageID=22 O znalcima vraga] — Danijel Turina&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Kumar resides in the most sublime center of our planet, [[Shamballa]], the [[sahasrara]] of the world.  The Kumara has several names, relating to the sahasrara centers of different Systemic Existences: At the Supra-Cosmic plane, he is called ''Sanatana''; at the Cosmic plane, it is ''Subrahmanya''; at the Solar plane, the Kumara is ''Sanaka''; at the Planetary plane, it is ''Sanandana''; and on this planet, it is ''Sanath'' Kumara. So Sanath Kumara is an aspect of Kumara that resides in Shamballa.

Scriptures, especially the [[Mahabharata]], say that it is Sanath Kumara who comes down to help the Divine Plan of Creation, when [[Lord Krishna]] came to be. He was born to Lord Krishna as his son, and he was named [[Pradyumna]]. Sanath Kumara incarnates himself through the Divine Mother [[Rukmini]] as Pradyumna. On completion of his work, He again gets back to his original position and takes to the seat in Shambala as Sanath Kumara. These details are given in the last chapters of [[Mahabharata]].

==Shamballa in Buddhism – home of the King of the World==

''Shambhala'' ([[Wylie transliteration|Tib]]. ''bde 'byung'') in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] (the religion of [[Tibet]]) is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "place of peace/tranquility/happiness". [[Gautama Buddha]] is said by Vajrayana Buddhists to have taught the [[Kalachakra]] [[tantra]] on request of King [[Suchandra]] of Shambhala; the teachings are also said to be preserved in Shamballa.  The [[Stanzas of Dzyan]] from which [[Madame Blavatsky]] claimed to have gotten the information in [[The Secret Doctrine]] are believed by some scholars to have been a mistranslation of words ''Kalachakra tantra'' (''rGyud-sde'' in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reigle, David and Nancy ''Blavatsky's Secret Books'' San Diego 1999. {{ISBN|0-913510-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shambhala is ruled over by a line of [[Kings of Shambhala]] known as [[Kulika]] or [[Kalki]] Kings (Tib. ''Rigden''), a monarch who upholds the integrity of the ''Kalachakra tantra''. In the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, the King of Shamballa is often metaphorically referred to as ''The King of the World''.  Shamballa was thought by the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s to be somewhere north of [[Lake Manasarovar]] and its adjacent [[Mount Kailash|Mount Kailasa]], a [[sacred mountain]] in Tibet where it is thought that all the [[Ley line|dragon current]]s intersect.

==The Defender Lord at Kurama Temple==
The ancient Buddhist temple, [[Kurama-dera]] in [[Japan]], is host to a unique bodhisattva, the "Defender Lord", who is said to come from the planet Venus 6.5 million years ago. He is described as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Sanat Kumara in Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Sanat Kumara  was mentioned briefly  by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Sanat Kumara – Volume I: 89, 457–458; Volume II: pages 106, 140, 319, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the "Lords of the Flame", whom Christian tradition has presented as [[Lucifer]] and the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Volume II pp 243 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when Blavatsky's close-friend and colleague  [[Charles W. Leadbeater]] wrote that Sanat Kumara was the "King" or ''Lord of the World'', and the head of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] of [[Mahatma]]s who had revealed the principles of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Pages 296–299&lt;/ref&gt;

Later authors who draw from Theosophical teachings such as [[Alice Bailey]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have added to the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy, said to be the incarnation of the Will of the Logos, and purportedly possesses an unaging body not born of mortal woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q6xVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=sanat+kumara+theosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ts3XnQyt-F&amp;sig=IEXRZ-Z1gLLBh6-bQnczyiul1BM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP-I-i6bvKAhXGlh4KHbeKBhk4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sanat%20kumara%20theosophy&amp;f=false First Principles of Theosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Descent of Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Living Flame from Venus==
C.W. Leadbeater and later adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] such as Alice A. Bailey believe that Sanat Kumara descended from the [[etheric plane]] of the planet [[Venus]] to [[Earth]] 18,500,000 years ago (A.E. Powell gives a figure of 16,500,000 years ago; [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] of [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] does not give a specific date but says it was a minimum of 2,500,000 years ago). In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the beings that helped Sanat Kumara organize the expedition from [[Venus]] are called the "Lords of the Flame".  C.W. Leadbeater and [[Annie Besant]] said that Sanat Kumara brought 30 "Lords of the Flame" with him from Venus to help him set up his colony.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 299&lt;/ref&gt; In the later version of the story promulgated by [[Guy Ballard]], notable "Lords of the Flame" include [[Gautama Buddha]], and the [[World Teacher]] (the being referred to alternately as [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] or [[Christ]] by [[Benjamin Creme]]). [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]'s [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] teaches that Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Flame also brought [[144,000]] souls with them from Venus. Alice Bailey, on the other hand, gives the number 105 only. The prior incarnation and only incarnation of Maitreya, the Lord of Consciousness, according to some interpretations (not C.W. Leadbeater's), is Gauthama Siddartha Sakyamuni / Lord Buddha; according to these interpretations, he essentially 'overshadowed' the body of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha with Siddhartha's permission.

Sanat Kumara is regarded as the great guru, saviour of Earth. Believers in him see him in all the major religions, as [[Murugan|Skanda]]/[[Kartikkeya]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Brahma]]-'''Sanam Kumar''' in [[Buddhism]], the [[Ancient of Days]] in [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions, and identify him as [[Ahura Mazda]] in [[Zoroastrianism]] (although the last of these claims is contested from a lack of information on the subject). It is also considered that Sanat Kumara is [[Al Khdir]] (green man) known to [[Sufi]] Muslims (according to [[Dakshinamurti]]).

It is maintained in most of these versions of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that [[Venus]], the 'Planet of Love', is the most spiritually advanced [[planet]] of our [[solar system]]. The beings living on the [[etheric plane]] of [[Venus]] are said to be hundreds of millions of years ahead of us in their spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London: 1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See chart on Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofra.com/EC_etheric_planes.htm Planetary Schemes of Our Solar System According to Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the governing council of [[Venus]] – the ''Seven Holy Kumars'' – sent one of themselves, Sanat Kumara, here to guide us.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press, pages 339–341&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theosophy, once Sanat Kumara arrived here, he directed the construction of the city of Shamballa on the [[etheric plane]] above the [[Gobi Desert]] to serve as his headquarters. Elizabeth Clare Prophet teaches that Shamballa was built physically on the White Island in the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert), and was only later withdrawn from the physical to the etheric plane.

==City plan of Shamballa==
The main temple of Shamballa is topped with a [[Gold (color)|golden]] dome and is surrounded by seven smaller temples—one for each of the seven rays.  These temples are located on a number of wide [[boulevard]]s resembling the [[Champs-Elysees]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet, (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 465–470 Shamballa&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, [[George Washington]] was divinely inspired by the Ascended Masters to choose [[city planner]] [[Pierre L'Enfant]] to create the [[city plan]] of [[Washington DC]] which, it is claimed, he unconsciously modeled on the plan of the city of Shamballa.

==Appellations (titles) of Sanat Kumara==
The most common title attributed to Lord Sanat Kumara in the Theosophical religious tradition is "Lord of the World". [[C.W. Leadbeater]] also states that an important duty of Sanat Kumara is to participate in an elaborate ritual every [[Wesak]] (the Full Moon of May) led by [[Gautama Buddha]], and also participated in by the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] (the being Theosophists identify as [[Christ]]), in which [[Spiritual energy|cosmic energy]] is focused from the "Solar Logos" to Earth in order to keep our planet's cosmic energy in balance.  The ritual is said to take place in a ravine in southern [[Tibet]] (the Frontispiece of Leadbeater's book ''The Masters and the Path'' has a picture of the ritual taking place) and, it is stated by Leadbeater, can be viewed by in the [[etheric body]] or in the [[physical body]] by those who have [[third eye|etheric sight]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997) – Fold-out picture facing the title page of the book shows a picture of Lord Sananda Buddha performing the Wesak ritual&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, two other common appellations of Sanat Kumara are two opposite titles: "The Ancient of Days" (because he has been on [[Earth]] millions of years) and "The Youth of Sixteen Summers" (because even though he is millions of years old, he still looks like he is 16 years old).  Another of his titles is "The One Initiator" because it is said by C. W. Leadbeater in the ''Masters and the Path'' that he personally performs the initiation ceremony for anyone who has reached the third level of spiritual [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]].  [[Alice A. Bailey]] indicates the same in her writings.

In the all organizations subscribing to the "''Ascended Master Teachings''", Sanat Kumara is presented  as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]]. He is also currently, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, known as the "Regent Lord of the World" in deference to [[Gautama Buddha]] having taken the office of "Lord of the World". (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989. Describes Sanat Kumara and his role in founding the Brotherhood on Earth and passing the office of "Lord of the World" to Lord Sananda.&lt;/ref&gt; With Sananda Buddha taking on more of the day-to-day administrative tasks of governing the planet, this arrangement allows Sanat Kumara more time for the long-range [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] planning and interstellar diplomacy that is necessary for him to prepare Earth for its eventual admission to what [[Joshua David Stone]] calls the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Galactic Confederation of Planets|Galactic Confederation of Planets]].

Sanat Kumara's symbol of the authority of his office as ''Lord of the World'' is a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} [[magic wand]] called the ''Rod of Power'' made of the metal [[orichalcum]], with cone-shaped [[diamond]]s on each end.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Pages 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Venus==
[[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] and all other "[[Ascended Master Teachings]]" organizations believe that Sanat Kumara has a ''Divine Complement'' (''Twin Flame'') (i.e., a ''celestial wife'') – '''Lady Master Venus'''[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg Image of Lady Master Venus shown above is originally from the Church Universal and Triumphant):]&lt;/ref&gt; – the New Age "[[goddess|Goddess of Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Summarizes the beliefs about Sanat Kumara by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt; The Ascended ''Lady Master Venus'' is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.  Sanat Kumara is believed to have [[Marriage|married]] Lady Master Venus millions of years ago on Venus before he came to Earth.

==Lady Master Meta==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus have a daughter named the '''Lady Master Meta''' [http://www.ethericretreats.com/images/meta.jpg] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethericretreats.com/meta.htm Source of (not very clear) Image of the Lady Master Meta—Etheric Retreats website:]&lt;/ref&gt; who they brought with them from Venus.  She is said to have incarnated as an [[Avatar]] in Atlantis (where she served as the [[high priestess]] at the ''Temple of Healing'') and in [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian Persia]], where she married a [[wikt:mortality|mortal]] and had three children.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, she is revered as the ''Goddess of Healing'' and is the patron deity of [[physician|doctor]]s and [[nurse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt; Since she is [[Immortality|immortal]], possessing a celestial body like Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus, she, like the Lady Master Venus, also has the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.

==Master Cha Ara==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the '''Master Cha Ara''' [http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/BofLight/CHA-ARA.JPG ] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/brotherhoodoflight.htm Source of Image of Master Cha Ara – World Global Express Brotherhood of Light:]&lt;/ref&gt;
was originally one of the three children of Lady Master Meta when she incarnated as an Avatar in [[Sassanian empire|Sassanian Persia]].  He became a master [[alchemy|alchemist]] who formulated an [[elixir of immortality]] made from [[Rose|rose petals]], tea leaves from mcleod ganj and other ingredients.  This enabled him to quickly achieve ascended masterhood.  He uses small amounts of the elixir to heal people.  He is the protector of all [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]].  He works with [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]] to bring about the New Age in the West [[Americas]].  Lady Master Meta’s husband and her other two children from her descent as an Avatar to Sassanian Persia have also become ascended masters but their names have not yet been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 52 Master Cha Ara; pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Nada==

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of religions based on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], '''Lady Master Nada'''&lt;ref&gt;Artist concept:[http://www.summitlh.com/minneapolis/chohans/chohans_files/_notes/nada-lrg-n.jpg] - source of image Summit Lighthouse Teaching Center (Minneapolis-St. Paul, USA)&lt;/ref&gt; is the "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" (see [[Seven Rays]]), and is the [[Ascended master|Ascended Lady Master]] governing humanity's development of the Divine Qualities of Ministration, Service, and Peace. The colors of her [[Seven Rays|Ray]] are [[purple]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]], and also [[Ruby (color)|ruby]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and [[The Bridge to Freedom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also considered a Member of the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]]; she handles the appeals of those on the [[Seven Rays|third ray]].  She is believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have succeeded the previous Chohan, the '''Master Jesus / Sananda Buddha''', on January 1, 1956, when she is said to have fully taken on the Office of Chohan of the Sixth Ray.,&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and [[The Summit Lighthouse]] Pages 144 and 240&lt;/ref&gt; thus advancing from the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fifth to the sixth level of initiation]].  She primarily serves at ''Arabian  Retreat'' in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], northeast of the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Nada serves there with the Brothers and Sisters of the [[Indigo]] Cape, as well as with [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], his [[Mother Mary]] and El Samyam, the  Chief of the Arabian Council.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. The Compt de Saint-Germain Press 1935. Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves at ''The [[Rose (color)|Rose]] Temple'', located on the [[etheric plane]] above [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. Designed after the pattern of a [[rose]], with each "petal" being a room, this Retreat is the etheric counterpart of the "Temple of Love" on [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] where Nada once served as a High Priestess.  In another human incarnate life in Atlantis, she was a [[lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The [[I AM Activity]] and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; She was described as having raised her body and [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ascended]] approximately 2,776 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The I AM Discourses''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Lady Master Nada's home residence (called in the Ascended Master Teachings her "retreat") is underground on the etheric plane on the Arabian peninsula, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, she teleports to Shamballa every workday to her day job on the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]], hearing the cases of those souls who are on the third ray.

==Masters of the Ancient Wisdom==

According to  the [["I AM" Activity]], the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998. Refers also to the other six Kumars that assist Sanat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt; and others, the [[Ascended Master]]s (The great beings the original Theosophists called the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]"), such as the [[Master Jesus]], [[Count of St Germain|Saint Germain]], '''Megha Alcorn''' aka '''Megan Sebastian''' on [[Earth]],   [[Kuthumi]], '''Hatton''', [[Gopal Das]] and others are working for the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of our planet, under the leadership of Lord Sanat Kumara, [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]].  Many theosophists believe the "Masters" utilize the cosmic power of the [[Seven Rays]] to advance the ''Plan of the Masters'' to encourage the continual advance of [[civilization]] on [[Earth]] toward higher [[Initiation (Theosophy)|levels of consciousness]]. One of the beliefs of adherents of these belief systems is that the Masters of Wisdom have united together in an organization called the ''[[Great White Brotherhood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America''. Summit University Press 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara is also often referred to as the manifestation of the 'Solar Logos'==

The Theosophist '''A.E. Powell''' stated that Sanat Kumara (whom he refers to as the ''Lord of the World'') is in continuous telepathic rapport with '''ANNA''' / [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the ''Spirit of the Earth'' (i.e., the ''Planetary Logos'' – equivalent to the goddess known in some religions as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] or as Prithivi in Hinduism).&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution)&lt;/ref&gt;[[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] stated that Sanat Kumara is in continuous [[Telepathy|telepathic]] rapport with the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]] (the Being considered by Theosophists as the consciousness of the [[Sun]]). It is believed in Theosophy that Sanat Kumara captures the mystical power of the [[Seven Rays]] from the Solar Logos and distributes it to his assistants who guide the spiritual evolution of humanity, the ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' (the Ascended Masters), who then focus the power to us.  An intermediate trinity of [[Pratyeka]]-Buddhas assists Lord Buddha in stepping down this power from Sanat Kumara to Earth's [[Spiritual Hierarchy]], and these Buddhas are also said to be Kumars originally from Venus.

==The council chamber of the Lord of the World==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Lord Sanat Kumara conducts business in an enormous room in his palace called ''The Council Chamber of the Lord of the World''.  It is here that he regularly meets with [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the '''Maha Chohan''', [[Djwal Khul]], [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]], the [[Master Jesus]] and the other [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], of which it is said there are 24 principal council members, to assess the progress being made in implementing ''The Plan of the Masters'' to bring the [[human race]] to [[Level of consciousness|higher levels of consciousness]].  According to C.W. Leadbeater, it is also here that he periodically personally receives ambassadors from [[Planetary system|other solar systems]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Sanat Kumara has many assistants who help him in his arduous task of spiritually governing Earth as its presiding Regent. 
These include '''The Watcher''' (also called the ''Silent Watcher'' or the ''Great Silent Watcher''), whose function it is to continually watch the [[Akashic records]] and download daily all the [[information]] on them relevant to the life waves of Earth and forward it to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 300&lt;/ref&gt; (the Watcher is part of a special race of beings who fulfill this function that are posted on planets throughout the [[Cosmos]] &lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press (Note: the idea that Watcher was part of race of beings posted throughout the Cosmos to fulfill this functions was first promulgated by C.W. Leadbeater and continued by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet) The Great Silent Watchers Page 122&lt;/ref&gt; ); the '''Lords of Karma''' – Alice A. Bailey mentioned three ''Lords of Karma'' but did not name them; they are called in the Ascended Master Teachings the '''Karmic Board''' and they are stated to number seven and each of them is identified by name: '''The Great Divine Director''' (1st ray), '''The Goddess of Liberty''' (2nd ray), '''[[Lady Master Nada]]''' (3rd ray), '''Cyclopea''' (4th ray), '''[[Athena|Pallas Athena]]''' (5th ray), '''Lady Master Portia''' (6th ray), and '''[[Kwan Yin]]''' (7th ray).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm Identity of the seven members of the Karmic Board according to the Ascended Master Teachings—The Goddess of Liberty, Kwan Yin, Pallas Athena, The Great Divine Director, Cyclopea, Nada, and Portia:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118080316/http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm |date=18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 153–155 The Karmic Board&lt;/ref&gt;  The Karmic Board decides when [[soul]]s that are between lives are to reincarnate again (if a disembodied soul desires to reincarnate somewhere or somewhen else than where they have been assigned, they must file an appeal with the Karmic Board—each person has to file an appeal to the member of the board that handles the appeals for their ''soul ray''); and the one Alice A. Bailey calls the '''Custodian of the Hall of Records''' (called the '''Keeper of the Scrolls''' in the Ascended Master Teachings), the being who is in charge of the ''Hall of Records'', an enormous administrative complex near Sanat Kumara’s palace in the etheric city of Shamballa—this is where the ''Recording Angels'' and those souls who are between incarnations who volunteer to give up their time in [[The Summerland#Summerland in Theosophy|Summerland]] and help perform this work make visual records (utilizing the most advanced [[supercomputers]] on the etheric plane of Earth) of everything that happens in everyone’s lives on Earth.  The raw [[data]] is first downloaded daily by ''The Watcher'' from the [[Akashic records]] and fed by him to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records'' and thence forwarded to the ''recording angels'' and their volunteer helpers.  These [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] records are sorted daily first into one of seven general files by the ''soul ray'' (see [[seven rays]]) of the soul that is reincarnating, and then downloaded from that general file into a special individual file for each soul that can be consulted by the ''Karmic Board'' if that soul makes an appeal before it.

==Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet==

'''Omri-Tas''', the ''Ruler of the Violet Planet'', is a [[Milky Way Galaxy|Galactic]] level Ascended Master ('''[[Spiritual Hierarchy]], Cosmic Beings''') who with his celestial mate, Irmo-Sat, [http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/elohim_of_aquariuslrg_.jpg],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/cosmicos_setimo.htm Source of Image of Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet and his Twin Flame – "Sintonia / Saint Germain". Portuguese language Ascended Master Teachings website:]&lt;/ref&gt; is Sanat Kumara's [[Ascended Master Teachings#Violet Flame|violet flame]] supplier.  The violet flame is composed of a special type of [[Occult Chemistry (book)|etheric matter particles]], which may plausibly be called ''violetrons'',  that are capable of cleansing bad [[karma]].   ''Omri-Tas'' rules a planet on the [[etheric plane]] called the Violet Planet, which is apparently several dozen to several hundred [[light year]]s from Earth.  The Violet Planet is one of many throughout the Cosmos that serve as reservoirs for the violet flame.  Omri-Tas is the ruler of the Violet Planet that is closest to Earth and which is responsible for transmitting the violet flame from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy|'''Great Central Sun''']] of the Cosmos via the '''Galactic Logos''' to planets in [[Spiritual Hierarchy|Ursa Major (Our sector is reputedly 'Sector Nine' of the 48 Sectors in this spiral Galaxy)]].  Omri-Tas or one of his representatives periodically teleports from the Violet Planet to Shamballa with canisters of violet flame to replenish the violet flame in the large circular pool in the ''Temple of the Violet Flame'' in Shamballa (In return for the violet flame. Lord Sanat Kumara assigns to his care and tutelage worthy initiated Adepts/Chelas for etheric transport to their next assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 249–253 Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benjamin Creme's views==
[[Benjamin Creme]] subscribes to the modern esoteric view that [[Nordic aliens]] (like those mentioned by [[George Adamski]] – Creme accepts Adamski's sightings as valid.) pilot [[flying saucer]]s from the Way-Station on Venus that is thought to exist on the [[etheric plane]] (Esotericists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the ''etheric plane'', the planet's [[heat]] doesn't affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the [[physical plane]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 205&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Creme's followers assume that Sanat Kumara and the 'Lords of the Flame' [See Elizabeth Van Buren's Book of the same name.](Nordic aliens themselves) visit from Venus in a flying saucer. How, they ask, did Sanat Kumara get to Earth from Venus if it wasn't on a flying saucer?  Creme's disciples believe that there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballa as well as other locations on Earth, especially areas where [[crop circles]] appear.  Creme's acolytes believe that Shamballa is equipped with an [[Spaceport|astrodrome]] as well as with numerous flying saucer landing pads attached to the tops or the sides of the buildings to accommodate the heavy flying saucer traffic from Venus.  Since Shamballa is envisioned as a [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] about five miles above the surface of the earth on the etheric plane, there are also numerous entrances in the basements of the buildings, where flying saucers can enter from the bottom of the city and park in spacious flying saucer parking garages provided in the basement levels of the buildings. In addition, says Creme, the Venusians have cigar-shaped [[mother ship]]s up to four miles long to accommodate the transport of multiple individual flying saucers to and from Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 133&lt;/ref&gt; According to Creme, sometimes flying saucers from places more distant than Venus, such as from [[Mars]], the [[Moons of Jupiter]], [[Uranus]], [[Sirius]], the [[Pleiades]], and beyond, fly in to pay a visit at Shamballa.  Since, according to Creme, the Venusians flying saucer designers outsource the actual construction of their flying saucers to the [[Martians]] (who are said to dwell on the etheric plane of Mars),&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 337&lt;/ref&gt; whom he describes as the "master engineers of the [[solar system]]",&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 194&lt;/ref&gt; Shamballa provides a convenient neutral ground where the Venusians and the Martians can meet to evaluate new flying saucer designs and negotiate flying saucer construction contracts between themselves.

==Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet==
The Master [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] was first incorporated into the Ascended Master Teachings by [[Joshua David Stone]] in the early 1990s, based on his incorporation of the early 1980s revelations of the medium [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)#Tuella|Tuella]] into his own teachings. Stone had already begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the [[Master Jesus]], under his [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] name '''Sananda''' (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with '''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Commander Ashtar]]''', flying with '''[[Pallas Athena]]''' in their own flying saucer within the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet]] as its ''Commander-in-Chief''.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Joshua David ''Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home'' (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi-volume series, The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path) {{ISBN|0-929385-99-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, another name used by ''Commander Ashtar'' to denote his flying saucer fleet is ''The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood''. Although the Ashtar Command is ultimately under the titular authority of Sanat Kumara, the Master Jesus in consultation with Pallas Athena and Ashtar, make all the day to day command decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html The Ashtar Command by Joshua David Stone:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227160744/http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.

According to some, The Ashtar Command is simply a modern concept of the Sumerian/Babylonian goddess and deity [[Astarte]]/[[Ishtar]]/[[Isis]] and her entourage whose assigned function is to protect an evolving mankind from the [[Satan|Satanic forces]], then extant, on this planet, that sought to usurp the Earthly Regency of the local Ascended Masters in their role of protecting and engendering Divine Law upon the Earth until the arrival, at 'The Meridian of Time' of 'The [[Son of God]]'... Jesus/Sananda and his incarnation of 'The Christ Being'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Al Daoud.'' [By 'The Pen'. 1930].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lourene Altiery, also known as ''Karita'' to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from [[Joliet, Illinois]] who now resides in [[Sun Lakes, Arizona]] – she set up her website in 2001.  According to Altiery, there are four Masters originally from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near [[Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet]] who are now permanently stationed on Shamballa.  These are the Masters '''Ballerian''', who is the proprietor of a flying saucer repair facility in Shamballa called ''God's Garage''; '''Kumad''', an expert [[linguist]] who helps the Keeper of the Scrolls decipher and interpret ancient manuscripts; '''Ashlem''',  a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] Master who resides at the Hall of Records and helps people decipher their past lives by assisting them in accessing the [[Akashic records]]; and '''Sutko''', the "space detective", who helps the Master K-17 solve unusually difficult cases.  Elements of the ''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'' sometimes dock at Shamballa so the flying saucer crews can go on '[[shore leave]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Altiery, Lourene (Karita) ''The World's Greatest Teachings by Christ the Master and Other Avatars, Telepathically Communicated to Karita 2002'' {{ISBN|0-9718008-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery)—Images of the cosmic beings described above in the mid-level command hierarchy of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet are depicted on this web page:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hatonn and the Photon Belt==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], who began teaching in 1990, '''Hatonn''', an [[android (robot)|android]] [[Pleiadean]] Master who flies aboard the flying saucer ''Phoenix'' (one of the flying saucers of the ''Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'', piloted by Hatonn’s partner the Master '''Soltec'''), monitors events on Earth for the ''Galactic Hall of Records'' at the [[galactic Center|galactic core]].

He feeds information about events on Earth via [[Subspace radio|subspace relay]] to the [[supercomputer]]s at the "Galactic Hall of Records".  However, Bellringer says that this activity is secondary to Hatonn's primary task, which is functioning as the [[liaison officer]] between Sanat Kumara and the [[Pleiadeans]] in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate in [[2012 phenomenon|2012]] through the approaching so-called "[[photon belt]]", said to emanate from the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hatonnspeaksthetruth.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/hatonn-introduction-to-the-photon-belt/ Hatonn and the Photon Belt:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_static/general/about_fourwinds.php Four Winds10.com—website of Anne Bellringer:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian criticism==

According to many Christians, notably the anti-[[New Age]] author [[Constance Cumbey]], New Age Leaders, including Masters of the [[Illuminati]], are actually worshipping the Lord of this World, whose name is Sanat Kumara (Alice Bailey, ''Externalisation of the Hierarchy'', p.&amp;nbsp;676, 709, 725; and Elizabeth Van Buren, ''The Secret of the Illuminati'', p.&amp;nbsp;1). Bailey goes on to explain that Sanat Kumara is the "life and the forming intelligence", presiding over the Council of Shamballa [the Heaven of Earth according to New Age doctrine]. (''The New Age Dictionary'', p.&amp;nbsp;172) Further, Sanat Kumara is "the eternal youth from the Planet [[Venus]]". The name Lucifer is one of the ancient Greek names for Venus. Therefore, according to Cumbey, Sanat Kumara is merely another name for [[Satan]] or [[Lucifer]]. (Cumbey, ''Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow'') [7].

==Theosophical reply to Christian criticism==
Other [[New Age]] leaders have tried to separate themselves from the Illuminati movement, and view that burdening the two groups as entirely coexistent is inaccurate and ineffectual. New Age theosophy also counters these critics, teaching the fact that the being known as Sanat Kumara would rather see spiritual harmony and peace, a fact which many Illuminati members ignore and abuse.

In the glossary of in the back of the book ''Alchemy'', which [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] claims was dictated to her by [[Kuthumi]], Satan and Sanat Kumara are clearly distinguished as two different and opposed beings—Satan working for evil and Sanat Kumara for good.&lt;ref&gt;"Kuthumi" (dictated to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]) ''Alchemy'' 1982 Summit Lighthouse See glossary at end of book&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Sanat Kumara'', although mentioned in passing by Madame Blavatsky, was never mentioned by her as an important "Master" that Blavatsky claimed to have met.  He was first presented, under the name ''Lord of the World'', as the head of the "Masters" by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] in his 1925 book ''The Masters and the Path''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in popular culture==

'''[[Panelology]]'''
*Sanat Kumara’s helper ''The Watcher'' was apparently made into a [[Marvel Comics]] character called [[Uatu]] by [[Stan Lee]] in 1963. The [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher comic books]] have tales about a special race of beings talented at [[information processing]] called ''The Watchers'' spread throughout the [[Cosmos]], and it is believed in Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings that The Watcher belongs to.{{citationeeded|date=January 2016}}
'''Video games'''
*Sanat Kumara is the name of Helena Blavatsky's Noble Phantasm in ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]''. It takes the form of a flying saucer.

The '''Seven Bishops''' of the [[Church of England]] were those imprisoned and tried for [[seditious libel]] related to their opposition to the second [[Declaration of Indulgence]], issued by [[James II of England|James II]] in 1688. In a major embarrassment to the Crown, they were found not guilty.

==Background==
The Declaration granted broad religious freedom in England by suspending penal laws that enforced conformity to the Church of England, by allowing persons to worship in their homes or chapels as they saw fit, and by ending affirming religious oaths as a requirement for employment in government office.

==Sequence of events==
The Declaration of Indulgence had originally been given out on 4 April 1687. The King republished it, with some new prefatory matter, on 25 April 1688. On 4 May the King and his council ordered the bishops that the declaration should be read in all the (Anglican) churches – those of London on 20 May and outside London on 27 May and the two following Sundays. This was the only way to make the document swiftly and generally known, which was James's straightforward object. The Anglican clergy felt it a challenge to themselves, for many of them were opposed to the toleration of Roman Catholics and Nonconformists, as were very many English people.

Nine days passed with no objection; then, on 13 May, at [[Lambeth Palace]], Compton (Bishop of London), Sancroft (Archbishop of Canterbury), Turner (Bishop of Ely) and White (Bishop of Peterborough), resolved to defy James's order.&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, Robert, ''Bloody Jeffreys: the hanging judge'', André Deutsch, London, 1989,  p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; They summoned seven others, of whom four actually came – Lake (Bishop of Chichester), Lloyd (St Asaph), Trelawny (Bristol) and Ken (Bath and Wells) – to a meeting of eight. Compton was under suspension following another dispute with the King. The others, known as the Seven Bishops, signed a petition requesting that they be excused; they claimed that the King did not have the legal right to make exemptions from statutes, the dispensing power having been declared illegal by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Edward, ''The Protestant Bishop: Being the Life of Henry Compton, 1632–1713, Bishop of London'', [[Longmans, Green and Co.]], 1956, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the King's power to dispense individuals from the provisions of a statute – that is to declare that the individual need not observe its provisions – had recently been reaffirmed in ''Godden v Hales''&lt;ref&gt;''State Trials'' Vol. IX pp1196-9&lt;/ref&gt; after James had dismissed judges he knew to be opposed to his exercise of it.  The  Lord Chief Justice, Sir [[Edward Herbert (judge)|Edward Herbert]],  had  ruled   in ''Godden v Hales''  that : "It is an indispensable prerogative in the Kings of England to dispense with  penal laws in particular cases, and upon particular necessary reasons...Of those reasons and those necessities the King himself is the sole judge."&lt;ref&gt;''State Trials''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of Friday, 18 May, the Seven Bishops (apart from Sancroft) presented their petition to the King, who read it and was furious. He proclaimed it "a standard of rebellion" and dismissed them, saying that he expected to be obeyed and that "God hath given me this dispensing power and I will maintain it."&lt;ref name=C117&gt;Carpenter, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was soon printed and distributed for sale on the streets of London; Compton may have been responsible for that.&lt;ref name=C117/&gt; The seven were put on trial for seditious libel.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The council were not sure what to do, but summoned the Bishops to appear before them on Friday 8 June,&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; which became known as Black Friday.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Macaulay, Thomas Babington]], ''The History Of England From the Accession of James II'', Vol. II, Chapter VIII, [[Donohue, Henneberry &amp; Co.]], 1890, p. 332. [[s:The History Of England From the Accession of James II/Chapter VIII#II.332]].&lt;/ref&gt; The bishops could have given their own [[recognizance]]s for coming up for trial, and thereby avoided being imprisoned before their trial. Sancroft had urged this; even Compton agreed to it; but Sancroft changed his mind. The bishops seem to have been angling for a delay in the trial proceedings – by refusing to give recognizances, they would have the right to delay the trial until the beginning of Michaelmas term on 23 October. The king, however, wanted a speedy trial, and the only way to get it, apart from convincing the Bishops to give their own recognizances, was to imprison them in the [[Tower of London]] before their trial; within the Tower, however, they had complete freedom.  Their imprisonment lasted only a week and had the effect, desired by the king, of speeding up the proceedings so that a trial could be held in June.&lt;ref&gt;Sowerby, Scott, ''Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution'', Harvard University Press, 2013, pp. 178-81.&lt;/ref&gt; But, in [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s deliberately ironic words, "Compton had had the satisfaction of seeing a vast popular gathering acclaiming these fathers in God on the way to the horrid dungeon of a Tyrant."&lt;ref&gt;Belloc, Hilaire, "James the Second", Faber &amp; Gwyer, 1928, p. 216. The section from "The Declaration of Indulgence had originally" to this quotation is paraphrased from this book.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Lord Jeffreys]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], advised the King to drop the prosecution; on being overruled he asked caustically if the King was prepared to take advice from his Ministers   or whether "the Virgin Mary is to do all".&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
The trial took place at the Court of [[King's Bench]] on 29 June, with Sir [[Thomas Powys (judge)|Thomas Powys]] the Attorney General and [[Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Gray's Inn|William Williams]] the Solicitor General prosecuting and Sir [[Robert Wright (judge)|Robert Wright]], the [[Lord Chief Justice]] as the presiding judge, sitting with [[John Powell (judge)|John Powell]], Richard Holloway and [[Richard Allibond]]. The bishops had a formidable team of defence counsel, headed by [[Francis Pemberton]], a former Lord Chief Justice, and including former Attorneys General [[Robert Sawyer (Attorney General)|Sir Robert Sawyer]] and [[Sir Creswell Levinz]], as well as [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|John Somers]], a future [[Lord Chancellor]].&lt;ref name=K391&gt;Kenyon, J.P., ''The Stuart Constitution'', 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury deliberated all night and the bishops were found not guilty on the morning of 30 June. There was great rejoicing; those opposed to the royal dispensing power had gained their victory.

The verdict was a  political disaster for the Government, largely due to its own ineptitude. Of the four judges only Allibond, a [[Roman Catholic]], showed any real desire for a conviction, while Powell and Holloway would clearly be happy with an acquittal. Powys,  the Attorney General,  through sheer incompetence,   almost caused the case to collapse at the outset by failing to prove that the Petition had been presented at all;&lt;ref name=K391/&gt;  Williams, the Solicitor General, handled the case with greater skill, but his bitter personal feud with  Lord Chief Justice Wright  (who in the course of his summing-up to the jury  accused him, without any relevance whatever to the trial,  of taking bribes)&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; can scarcely have helped  the prosecution. A modern historian remarked that the trial "had a strong element of the grotesque".&lt;ref name=K391/&gt;

==Bishops==

The Seven Bishops were:

* [[William Sancroft]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]
* [[Thomas Ken]], [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]]
* [[John Lake (bishop)|John Lake]], [[Bishop of Chichester]]
* [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]], [[Bishop of St Asaph]]
* [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet|Jonathan Trelawny]], [[Bishop of Bristol]]
* [[Francis Turner (bishop)|Francis Turner]], [[Bishop of Ely]]
* [[Thomas White (bishop)|Thomas White]], [[Bishop of Peterborough]]

Despite their petition and their trial, five of these bishops (all but Lloyd and Trelawny) remained loyal to James II after the [[Glorious Revolution]] and were among the nine bishops who became [[Nonjuring schism|non-juror]]s, refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], and losing their bishoprics as a result.

==Rights of petition and religion==
The bishops exercised the right to petition preserved in ''[[Magna Carta]]'' (1215) (clause 61). The following year Parliament cited James II's trial of the Seven Bishops as a grievance. It explicitly preserved the right of petition in the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] (1689).
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he said Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons,&amp;nbsp;... do in the first place (as their ancestors in like case have usually done) for the vindicating and asserting their ancient rights and liberties declare&amp;nbsp;...
That it is the right of the subjects to petition the king, and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal;&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These rights of petition for redress of grievances and of religion and conscience were preserved in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

'''Share a Coke''' is a multi-national [[marketing campaign]] in for [[Coca-Cola]]. It [[debranding|debrands]] the traditional Coke logo, replacing "Coca-Cola" from one side of a bottle with the phrase "Share a Coke with" followed by a person's name.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; {{primary-inline|date=November 2018}} The campaign, which uses a list containing 250 of the country's most popular names (generic nicknames and titles are also used in some cases), aims to have people go out and find a bottle with their name on it, then share it with their friends.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Share a Coke FAQs|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/faq/products/share-a-coke.html|publisher=[[Coca-Cola]] Great Britain|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Lucy|title=Debranding: why Coca-Cola's decision to drop its name worked|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/aug/06/coke-debranding-name-dropping|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=November 2018}} The campaign began in Australia in 2011.{{Citation needed|reason=Not mentioned in body of article; see talk page |date=November 2018}}

==Campaign effectiveness and outcomes==

The Share a Coke campaign was subsequently rolled out in over 80 countries. &lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M. and Ferrell, O.C., ''Foundations of Marketing''  7th ed, Boston, Cengage Learning, p. 416; Wood, N.T. and Muñoz, C.

The campaign received multiple awards at the Creative Effectiveness Lion Awards at Cannes.&lt;ref&gt;''B &amp; T Weekly,'' "Cannes: Share a Coke 'most successful in decades'", ''B &amp; T Weekly'' [Australia], 18 June, 2014, http://www.bandt.com.au/advertising/Cannes-Share-a-Coke-most-successful-in-decades&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spary, S., "From Share a Coke to Mad Men: the campaigns that defined Coke under Wendy Clark," ''Campaign Live,'' 17 November, 2015, http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1372962/share-coke-mad-men-campaigns-defined-coke-wendy-clark&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, where the campaign is credited with increasing sales by more than 2%&lt;ref&gt;Esterl, M., "Marketing Campaign That Put First Names on Bottles Reversed Downward Slide," ''Wall Street Journal,'' 25 September, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and according to a piece by ''[[The Atlantic]]'' writer [[Kalle Oskari Mattila]], said to have reversed more than 10 years of decline in Coke consumption&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/the-age-of-the-wordless-logo/499166/|title=Why Are So Many of Today’s Logos Wordless?|last=Mattila|first=Kalle Oskari|date=2016-09-08|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the company and its agency has sought ways to extend the campaign while maintaining its relevance. In 2015, the company extended the campaign by increasing the number of names to 1,000. Nicknames such as "bro", "better half" and "sidekick"  were also added to the inventory of names.&lt;ref&gt;Rooney, B., 'Share a Coke' is back with more of your names on bottles,' ''CNN Money'' 14 April, 2014,  http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/14/news/companies/name-share-a-coke-bottle&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the company replaced people's names with lyrics from 70 popular songs including ''Lean on Me'' and ''We are the Champions''.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhlin, W., "Coke Swaps in Song Lyrics for Names in New 'Share a Coke' Campaign," ''AOL Business,'' 31 March, 2016,  https://www.aol.com/article/2016/03/31/coke-swaps-in-song-lyrics-for-names-in-new-share-a-coke-campai/21336287&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, the campaign returned to the US with a new variant; holiday destinations. Bottles of coke are labelled with favourite summer holiday spots such as Hawaii, Ibiza, Barbados etc.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, N., "Share a Coke Campaign Returns with Holiday Destinations instead of Names", ''The Drum,'' 19 April, 2017,  http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/04/19/share-coke-campaign-returns-with-holiday-destinations-instead-names&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Coca-Cola collaborated with [[McCann_(company)|Fitzco//Mccann]] and [[Score a Score]] to create over 1000 unique songs based on names found on bottles of Coke. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7865894/coke-share-name-songs-campaign|title=Coke Creates 1,000-Plus Songs for Its 'Share a Coke' Campaign|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12242">[[File:Siguanaba.JPG|thumb|right]]
The '''Sihuanaba''', '''La Siguanaba''', '''Cigua''' or '''Cegua''' is a supernatural character from [[Central America]]n folklore. It is a shape-changing spirit that typically takes the form of an attractive, long haired woman seen from behind. She lures men away into danger before revealing her face to be that of a horse or, alternatively, a skull.

The Siguanaba and its variants may have been brought to [[Latin America]] from [[Spain]] during the [[Spanish Empire|Colonial Period]], used by the colonists as a means of exercising control over the indigenous and ''[[mestizo]]'' population.&lt;ref name="FernandezPoncela95p107"&gt;Fernández-Poncela 1995, p.107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
When encountered, she is a beautiful woman who is either naked or dressed in flimsy white; she usually appears bathing in a public water tank, river, or other water source,&lt;ref name="Lara96p28-29"&gt;Lara Figueroa 1996, pp.28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; although she may also be found washing clothing.&lt;ref name="Lara96p32"&gt;Lara Figueroa 1996, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; She likes to lure lone men out late on dark, moonless nights, without letting them see her face at first.&lt;ref name="Lara96p29"&gt;Lara Figueroa 1996, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; She tempts such men away from their planned routes to lose them in deep canyons.&lt;ref name="Lara96p29"/&gt;

In Guatemala, the Siguanaba appears as a beautiful, seductive woman with very long hair. She will not reveal her face until the last moment, when it is revealed as either the face of a horse or, alternatively, a human skull.&lt;ref&gt;Lara Figueroa 1996, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; If her victim (usually an unfaithful man) does not die of fear then he is driven mad by the sight.&lt;ref name="Barnoya99p139"&gt;Barnoya Gálvez 1999, p.139.&lt;/ref&gt; From afar the Siguanaba can imitate the appearance of a man's girlfriend in order to lead him astray.&lt;ref name="Barnoya99p139"/&gt;

When appearing to children, the Siguanaba will take on the appearance of the child's mother in order to lure her victim into her grasp; once touched by the Siguanaba the child is driven mad and she will lead her victim into the wilderness to leave the child lost and insane.&lt;ref name="Molina06p31"&gt;Molina et al 2006, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence==
Traditional methods are said to ward off the Siguanaba. In the border regions between Guatemala and El Salvador, those who see the Siguanaba make the sign of the cross upon her or bite their [[machete]], while simultaneously banishing both the evil spirit and the fear that grips the victim.&lt;ref name="Molina06p30"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''siguanaba'' or ''sihuanaba'' has its origin in the [[Mesoamerican languages|indigenous languages]] of [[Mesoamerica]]. Various words have been suggested as its source. In parts of Mexico the Siguanaba is known as ''macihuatli'', a [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word that can be broken down to two elements; ''cihuatl'' (meaning "woman") and ''matlatl'' (meaning "net"). This "net-woman" encompasses the figurative idea of a woman capturing men in her metaphorical net of attraction.&lt;ref name="Lara96p38-39"&gt;Lara Figueroa 1996, pp.38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, ''cigua'' or ''cegua'', names for the spirit in Honduras and Costa Rica, also have their origin in the Nahuatl word ''cihuatl'', simply meaning "woman". Guatemalan historian and folklorist [[Adrián Recinos]] gave two possible origins for the word ''siguanaba''. In one of the 20+ languages of Guatemala, he claimed ''ciguanaba'' meant "naked woman" but he failed to identify the exact language of origin. In another source he claimed that its origin is the Nahuatl ''ciuanauac'' or ''ciguanauac'', meaning "concubine".&lt;ref name="Lara96p38-39"/&gt;

In Guatemala, the word ''siguanaba'' has been linked to ''siwan'', a [[K'iche' language|K'iche']] [[Maya languages|Maya]] word meaning a cliff or deep ravine, and Guatemalan [[folk etymology]] gives this as the origin of the word, although scholars such as Recinos and Roberto Paz y Paz disagree.&lt;ref name="Lara96p38-39"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christenson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
[[File:Degas - Frau sich die Haare kämmend.jpg|The Siguanaba is sometimes viewed as a naked woman combing her hair|thumb|right]]
In Guatemala the Sihuanaba is known as ''La Siguanaba''; she is known as ''Cigua'' in Honduras, ''Ciguanaba'' in El Salvador and as ''Cegua'' in Costa Rica. Although the name varies from place to place, the appearance and actions of the Sihuanaba remain unchanged.&lt;ref name="Lara96p33"/&gt;

===El Salvador===
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2017}}
The Salvadoran legend of La Siguanaba says that the woman, originally called Sihuehuet (''beautiful woman''), was a peasant girl that ascended to queen using her charms (and a witch's brew) to lure into marriage [[Tlaloc]]'s son, Yeisun, who was a [[Nahuatl]] prince. After marriage, when her husband went to war, she had affairs with other men, and [[Cipitio]] was the child of this relationship. Sihuehuet was a bad mother, neglecting her son, leaving him alone to meet her lovers. To inherit the throne she concocted a plot to use another magic potion to poison Yeisun during a festival, and so claim the throne for her lover.

But the plan worked too well. Yeisun was converted in a savage giant monster with two heads, who ravaged the attendants to the palace's feast. The guard struggled and defeated the creature, ending Yeisun's life. When [[Tlaloc]] found out about this, he sought the help of the almighty god, Teotl whom condemned and cursed Sihuehuet: She would be  called Sihuanaba ("hideous woman"); she would be beautiful at first sight, but she would turn into a horrible abomination after luring her victims to isolated gorges. She was forced to wander the countryside, appearing to men who travelled alone at night. She is supposed to be seen at night in the rivers of [[El Salvador]], washing clothes and always looking for her son, [[Cipitio]], who was also cursed by Teotl to remain a boy for eternity.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Guatemala===
In Guatemala, the Siguanaba is said to be encountered washing her hair with a golden bowl and combing her hair with a golden comb.&lt;ref name="Lara96p28-29"/&gt; She is said to wander the streets of [[Guatemala City]], luring away men who are in love.&lt;ref&gt;Lara Figueroa 2001, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; In Guatemala, the legend is more common in Guatemala City, [[Antigua Guatemala]] (the old colonial capital) and the eastern [[Departments of Guatemala|departments]] of the country.&lt;ref name="Lara96p31"&gt;Lara Figueroa 1996, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common variant in these areas is that where the spirit has the face of a horse.&lt;ref name="Lara96p31"/&gt; In Guatemala the Siguanaba is often said to appear to men who are unfaithful in order to punish them.&lt;ref name="FernandezPoncela95p107"/&gt;

A [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] Maya version of the Siguanaba from [[San Juan Comalapa]] describes her as a woman with enormous glowing eyes and a hoof for a hand. She wears a glittering dress and has very long hair and haunts the local rubbish dump, frightening disobedient children and drunken husbands.&lt;ref&gt;Staikidis 2006, pp.49, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Guatemalan side of [[Lake Güija]], in [[Jutiapa Department]], the Siguanaba is able to take on many forms but the most common is that of a slim, beautiful woman with long hair who bathes herself on the banks of the [[Ostúa River]], although she may also appear by other water sources or simply by lonely roadsides.&lt;ref name="Molina06p30"&gt;Molina et al 2006, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; To lustful men she appears just as a beautiful woman, while to lovestruck men she takes the form of the object of the man's affections.&lt;ref name="Molina06p30"/&gt; A tale from San Juan La Isla relates how a man went to meet his wife who was returning on horseback from El Salvador, and after accompanying her for a while his "wife" flung herself from her mount and revealed herself to be the Siguanaba.&lt;ref name="Molina06p30"/&gt; In this same region, the Siguanaba is said to appear on moonlit nights to horseriders on lonely roads, asking to ride pillion. After riding with her victim for a short while, she reveals her fingernails as fearsome claws and her face as that of a horse, causing the rider to die of terror.&lt;ref name="Molina06p30"/&gt; Those lucky few that manage to flee find themselves lost in the wilderness.&lt;ref name="Molina06p30"/&gt;

===Costa Rica===
In Costa Rica, the Cegua is largely a rural apparition.&lt;ref name="Lara96p33"&gt;Lara Figuaroa 1996, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as repeating the typical actions of the Sihauanaba in its nocturnal bathing habits, the Cegua also appears mounted among herds of horses, sowing panic.&lt;ref name="Lara96p33"/&gt;

Other spellings are: Cihuanaba, Sihuanaba, Ciguanaba, [[Ciguapa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1423">'''Simhika''', or '''Sinhika''', was the daughter of Demon king [[Hiranyakashipu]] and was the sister of the [[Vishnu]] devotee Bhakt [[Prahlada]]. She is also considered as the mother of [[Svarbhānu]], who was beheaded into two by Lord Vishnu into [[Rahu]], the head part and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]], the remaining body.

==Simhika in Ramayana and her death==
Simhika got the boon from [[Brahma]] that she can control anyone's shadow. Later, she controlled Devi [[Chhaya]], mother of Lord [[Shani]] and wife of [[Surya]], the sun god. And eventually got defeated by Shani and [[Hanuman]]. Simhika was forgiven by monkey god, Hanuman, but Hanuman told her that whenever he finds her in later phase of life he'll kill her. Later, when Hanuman was climbing the ocean to [[Lanka]], the kingdom of Demon [[Ravana]], Simhika was hiding in the ocean and captured Hanuman's shadow, Hanuman jumped into her mouth and came out tearing her stomach, ending the life of Simhika.

'''"Sing girls"''' ({{zh|c=星女郎|p=''xīng nǚ láng''}}) is a nickname for actresses who starred alongside [[Stephen Chow]], often as the main character's romantic interest.&lt;ref name=eastday&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enjoy.eastday.com/e/20071012/u1a3160012.html | title=张雨绮亲述一夜成名:30秒搞定周星驰 (Zhang Yuqi's overnight fame: 30 seconds to win over Stephen Chow) | author=邱致理 (Qiu Zhili) | publisher=南都周刊 | date=10 December 2007 | accessdate=28 June 2009|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are young, new actresses who go on to receive considerable media attention after appearing in one of Chow's films,&lt;ref name=dayoo&gt;{{cite web | publisher=大洋 (dayoo.com) | accessdate=28 June 2009 | url=http://life.dayoo.com/fashion/200906/09/33683_7956406_5.htm | title=从"翻版张柏芝"看女星整容是非 (From "New Cecilia Cheung", seeing if female stars are having makeovers or not) | editor=许慧健 (Xu Huijian) | date=9 June 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705203656/http://life.dayoo.com/fashion/200906/09/33683_7956406_5.htm | archivedate=5 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their success is often attributed to the attention brought to them by Chow&amp;mdash;[[Zhang Yuqi]], for example, has been referred to as Chow's "[[:wikt:protégée|protégée]]" after appearing in the 2007 film ''[[CJ7]]''.&lt;ref name="ChowsPlay"&gt;&lt;!--This URL should not be linked, as it appears to be copyvio, but here it is for quick reference: http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/158-Stephen-Chows-Play-CJ7.html--&gt;{{cite news |work = [[Straits Times]]|author = Boon Cheng|title = Stephen Chow's Play: CJ7|date = 6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese word 星 ''xīng'' refers both to Chow's nickname 星爷 (''Sing Yeh'', "Grandmaster Sing")&lt;ref name=dayoo/&gt; and to [[:wikt:明星|明星]], the word for a star or [[celebrity]].

Chow has not always chosen newcomer actresses to co-star with him; for example, [[Zhao Wei|Vicki Zhao]] already had a successful music and film career when she appeared as the female lead in ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'',&lt;ref name=eastday/&gt; and [[Gong Li]] was already famous as an "Yimou girl" ([[:zh:谋女郎|谋女郎]]) for her frequent collaboration with director [[Zhang Yimou]] before she starred in two Stephen Chow films in the early 1990s. Many times, though, starring with Chow has been a "Sing girl"'s first major role and has kick-started her career, as ''[[King of Comedy (film)|King of Comedy]]'' did for [[Cecilia Cheung]]. [[Eva Huang]] and [[Kitty Zhang]] both gained considerable attention from media and [[netizens]] after appearing in ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]'' and ''[[CJ7]]'', respectively, even though their roles were relatively small (Huang's role had no lines at all).&lt;ref name=eastday/&gt;

[[Kingdom Yuen]] appeared in numerous 1990s Stephen Chow films not as a lead female or romantic interest, but rather in minor roles as a comedic [[stock character]].&lt;ref name=kingdom&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=4 July 2009 | url=http://www.brns.com/hkactors/pages/page48.html | title=Yuen King-tan/Kingdom Yuen | work=Hong Kong Cinema: View from the Brooklyn Bridge | first=Yves | last=Gendron | date=5 October 2004}} {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The youngest "Sing girl" is 7 year old Zhang Yuwen, who appears in ''[[Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunantv.com/c/20130218/0947217139.html|title=揭秘《西游》最小星女郎 张煜雯喊星爷哥哥|publisher=Hunan TV|accessdate=2013-03-28|date=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bowery Boys''' are fictional [[New York City]] characters, portrayed by a [[repertory theater|company]] of New York actors, who were the subject of feature films released by [[Monogram Pictures]] from 1946 through 1958.

The Bowery Boys were successors of the "[[East Side Kids]]," who had been the subject of films since 1940. The group originated as the "[[Dead End Kids]]", who originally appeared in the 1937 film ''[[Dead End (1937 film)|Dead End]].'' A few of the actors previously appeared together as "[[Little Tough Guys|The Little Tough Guys]]."

==Origins==

===The Dead End Kids===
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
"The Dead End Kids" originally appeared in the 1935 play ''Dead End,'' dramatized by [[Sidney Kingsley]]. When [[Samuel Goldwyn]] turned the play into a [[Dead End (1937 film)|1937 film]], he recruited the original "kids" from the play—[[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Bobby Jordan]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Billy Halop]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]—to appear in the same roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films that shared the collective title "The Dead End Kids".

===The Little Tough Guys===
{{main|Little Tough Guys}}
In 1938, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] launched its own tough-kid series, "[[Little Tough Guys]]." Gradually, Universal recruited most of the original Dead End Kids, so the series ultimately featured "[[The Dead End Kids]] and [[Little Tough Guys]]." Universal made twelve feature films, and three 12-chapter serials with the gang. The final film in Universal's series, ''[[Keep 'Em Slugging]],'' was released in 1943, with [[Bobby Jordan]] replacing erstwhile ringleader [[Billy Halop]].

===The East Side Kids===
{{main|East Side Kids}}
When Warner Brothers released the remaining Dead End Kids from their contracts in 1939, producer [[Sam Katzman]] at Monogram acted quickly and hired several of them, including Jordan and the Gorcey brothers, Leo and David, as well as some of the Little Tough Guys, including Hally Chester, to star in a new series using the team name "The East Side Kids."  These films also introduced [[Sammy Morrison|'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison]], one of the original members of the [[Our Gang]] comedy team, as part of the gang.

The original members of the "Dead End Kids" were now working at several studios, so these films were made at the same time that Universal was making "The Dead End Kids" and "Little Tough Guys" series. A total of 21 films were made, with the final one, ''Come Out Fighting'', released in 1945.

==The Bowery Boys==

In 1945, when East Side Kids producer Katzman refused to grant Leo Gorcey's request to double his weekly salary, Gorcey quit the series, which then ended immediately. Bobby Jordan then suggested a meeting with his agent, Jan Grippo. Grippo, Gorcey, and Hall formed Jan Grippo Productions, revamped the format, and rechristened the series ''The Bowery Boys.'' (The earlier films's credits appear as "Leo Gorcey ''and'' The Bowery Boys".) Gorcey, who owned 40 percent of the company, starred, produced, and contributed to the scripts. The new series followed a more established formula than the prior incarnations of the team, with the gang usually hanging out at Louie's Sweet Shop (at 3rd &amp; Canal St.) until an adventure came along.

The original main characters were Terrence Aloysius "Slip" Mahoney ([[Leo Gorcey]]), Horace Debussy "Sach" Jones ([[Huntz Hall]]), Bobby ([[Bobby Jordan]]), Whitey ([[William "Billy" Benedict|Billy Benedict]]), and Chuck ([[David Gorcey]], sometimes billed as David Condon). [[Ernest Morrison|"Sunshine" Sammy Morrison]], "Scruno" in the East Side Kids films, declined the invitation to rejoin the gang. (He later stated in an interview that he "didn't like the setup", possibly referring to the idea of Gorcey and Hall being in the forefront, and being paid much more than the other members.) When Bobby Jordan quit the series for the same reason, his character was replaced by Butch Williams, with former East Side Kids [[Bennie Bartlett]] and [[Buddy Gorman]] alternating in the role. The proprietor of the malt shop where they hung out was the panicky Louie Dumbrowski ([[Bernard Gorcey]], Leo's and David's real-life father).

Like the previous incarnations of the team, the members went through a number of changes over the course of the series. Thirteen actors were members of the team at one time or another. Bobby Jordan, an original Dead End Kid, appeared in the first eight films, but left after being injured in an elevator accident. Jordan was also unhappy with the direction of the series, which favored Gorcey and Hall, and limited the participation of the other gang members.

[[Gabriel Dell]] returned in the fourth entry, ''[[Spook Busters]]'' (1946), as "Gabe Moreno," a former member of the gang just out of the Navy with a French war-bride in tow. He remained (minus spouse) for the next 16 features. Gabe was a convenient "utility" character, frequently changing jobs (private investigator, policeman, songwriter, reporter, Nazi spy) to suit the story at hand—and the limited casting budget. Dell often acted as a bridge between the real world and those of the Boys who he would summon to assist him. He reprised one of his East Side Kids roles in ''[[Hard Boiled Mahoney]]'' (1947), playing Gabe as a myopic nerd with thick glasses, ascot and cap. His final appearance was in ''[[Blues Busters (1950 film)|Blues Busters]]'' in 1950, generally regarded as one of the funniest in the series.

The early films such as ''[[In Fast Company]]'' (1946) flirted with the same humor-laced crime drama of the previous series, but they gradually shifted to all-out comedy, growing more slapstick and fantasy-oriented over the next decade. After 1950, the series began to resemble the farcical [[Abbott and Costello]] comedies—a far cry from the grim social realism of their 1930s films. The grittiness of the old days was sanitized with the gang's dingy basement club-house replaced by an ice cream parlor. The "boys" also adopted a more adult look, exchanging their sloppy, juvenile wardrobe for suits.

The team spirit of the ensemble cast faded as Huntz Hall was elevated to co-star status to showcase his comedic skills. The stories now focused entirely on Slip (the self-proclaimed leader of the bunch) and his zany sidekick, Sach, with the diminished three or four "boys" receding into the background with little to do. Time and again the plot revolved around Sach accidentally acquiring some strange power or ability (he becomes a psychic, champion wrestler, crooner, etc.) that Slip is quick to exploit. In most of the films, the gang pursues a scheme for quick riches or gets mixed up with neighborhood thugs. Story elements from their earlier films (haunted houses, mad scientists, nefarious spies) were also frequently incorporated into the new series.

Like a streetwise [[Abbott and Costello]], Gorcey and Hall became a cohesive comedy duo, extending their verbal and physical humor into broader slapstick comedy that served to increase the popularity of the series.  In 1953, [[Edward Bernds]], a new producer and director who had previously worked with [[The Three Stooges]], transformed the series into lucrative kiddie-matinée fodder, with Gorcey and Hall re-enacting gags borrowed from the Stooges. (Huntz Hall cited [[Shemp Howard]], who had appeared in three Little Tough Guys films, as a major influence during this latter phase in the series.)

Leo's character "Slip" was famed for his [[malaprop]]s (always delivered in a [[Brooklyn accent]]), such as "a clever seduction" for "a clever deduction," "I depreciate it!" ("I appreciate it!"), and "I regurgitate" ("I reiterate").

In the 1940s, [[Abbott and Costello]] appeared in a quartet of "service comedies", one for each branch of the military. The Bowery Boys duplicated this feat a decade later with ''[[Bowery Battalion]],'' ''[[Let's Go Navy!]],'' ''[[Here Come the Marines]],'' and ''[[Clipped Wings (1953 film)|Clipped Wings]].'' Abbott and Costello spoofed westerns: ''[[Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942 film)|Ride 'Em Cowboy]]'' (1942), the upper-classes: ''[[In Society]]'' (1944), and hillbillies: ''[[Comin' Round the Mountain]]'' (1951). The Bowery Boys repeated this formula in ''[[Bowery Buckaroos]]'' (1947), ''[[High Society (1955 film)|High Society]]'' (1955), and ''[[Feudin' Fools]]'' (1952), respectively.

Abbott and Costello went on safari: ''[[Africa Screams]]'' (1949), to the Middle East: ''[[Lost in a Harem]]'' (1944), and even tangled with pirates in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd]]'' (1952). Once again, the Bowery Boys followed suit with ''[[Jungle Gents]]'' (1954), ''[[Bowery to Bagdad]]'' (1955), and ''[[Hold That Hypnotist]]'' (1957). Abbott and Costello become private detectives in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man]]'' (1951); the Bowery Boys open up a detective agency in 1953's ''Private Eyes''.

After Abbott and Costello's haunted-house comedy ''[[Hold That Ghost]]'' (1941) became a smash hit, the East Side Kids released the similar ''Spooks Run Wild'' with Bela Lugosi later that year. Lugosi went on to help make ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]],'' one of A&amp;C's most popular and critically acclaimed comedies. The basic premise, centered around Dracula's scheme to transplant Costello's brain into the Frankenstein monster (played by [[Glenn Strange]]), was duplicated a few months later by The Bowery Boys in ''[[Master Minds]]'' (1949). Glenn Strange once again plays a hulking monster who switches minds with Sach (Huntz Hall). With a title suggesting a send-up of the Abbott and Costello "Meet" films, ''[[The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters]]'' (1954) was the highest grossing entry in the series.

After filming ''[[Dig That Uranium]]'' in 1955, Bernard Gorcey was killed in an automobile accident, devastating his son Leo, who began to drink heavily, and it visibly affected his performance in the following film, ''Crashing Las Vegas'', which was his last. (During filming, he became violently unhinged, trashing the set and destroying every prop in sight.{{cn|date=December 2017}}) At a subsequent meeting with Allied Artists, Gorcey demanded an increase on the 40% interest he held in the series. This was denied, and after a heated exchange, he quit the series and stormed off the studio lot.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The studio owed exhibitors three more films for the 1956 season, so Gorcey was replaced by [[Stanley Clements]], a former tough-teen actor who had been in a few East Side Kids movies. Clements, as "Duke Coveleskie," adapted to the series easily and completed the three films, which now starred "Huntz Hall and The Bowery Boys." The new Hall-Clements partnership was successful enough to be renewed for the 1957 season. Four more films were made, with Eddie LeRoy joining the cast as bespectacled "Blinky." With Bernard Gorcey gone, Louie's Sweet Shop was replaced by Clancy's Cafe with a similarly put-upon proprietor, "Mike" ([[Percy Helton]], later played by [[Dick Elliott]]).

==Legacy==

In all, there were 48 Bowery Boys films, making it the longest feature-film series of American origin in motion picture history (only the Mexican ''[[El Santo|Santo]]'' film series ran longer), with the final film, ''[[In the Money]],'' being released in 1958. Only Huntz Hall and David Gorcey had remained with the series since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;''Me and the Dead End Kid,'' Leo Gorcey, Jr., Spirit of Hope Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowery Boys and East Side Kids picked up a new generation of mostly younger fans when the films were repackaged and syndicated for television in the 1960s and 1970s. They became a staple for independent stations across the U.S., often used to fill up the early-afternoon time-slots on weekends.

==Home media==
All 48 Bowery Boys films were released on DVD by Warner Brothers via their "made-to-order" Archive Collection label in four volumes, each consisting of 12 films on 4 recordable media discs, beginning November 20, 2012. Initial distribution was advertised by Warner as being traditionally replicated on "pressed disc" media in anticipation of high demand for these first Bowery Boy releases to be "remastered from the best available elements."

A '''villain''' (also known as, "'''baddie'''", "'''bad guy'''", "'''evil guy'''", "'''heavy'''" or "'''black hat'''") is an "[[evil]]" character in a story, whether a [[history|historical]] narrative or, especially, a work of [[fiction]]. 

The villain is a [[antagonist]] (though can be the [[protagonist]]){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} who tends to have a negative effect on other characters. A female villain is occasionally called a '''villainess'''. Random House Unabridged Dictionary defines villain as "a cruelly malicious person who is involved in or devoted to wickedness or crime; scoundrel; or a character in a play, novel, or the like, who constitutes an important evil agency in the plot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/villain |website=[[Dictionary.com]] |publisher=[[Wayback Machine]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402110610/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/villain |archivedate=2014-04-02 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guralnik |title=[[Webster's New World Dictionary]] |date=1984 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=0671418149 |edition=2nd college}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2018}} The same etymology produced [[villein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/villain |website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to a person of less than knightly status and so came to mean a person who was not [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] and [[Politeness|polite]]. As a result of many unchivalrous and evil acts, such as [[betrayal|treachery]] or rape, being considered villainous in the modern sense of the word, it became used as a term of abuse and eventually took on its modern meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[C. S. Lewis]] |title=Studies in Words |date=2013 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781107688650 |pages=120-121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xONwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic word "[[churl]]", originally meaning "a non-servile peasant" and denoting the lowest rank of freemen in Saxon society, had gone through a similar degradation, as did the word "[[wikt:boor#Noun|boor]]" which originally meant "farmer".

==Folk and fairy tales==
[[Vladimir Propp]], in his analysis of Russian fairy tales, concluded that a [[fairy tale]] had only eight ''[[dramatis personae]]'', of which one was the villain,&lt;ref name="Propp"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Vladimir Propp |authorlink1=Vladimir Propp |title=Morphology of the Folk Tale |date=1968 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0292783760 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian tales. The actions that fell into a villain's sphere were:
* a story-initiating villainy, where the villain caused harm to the hero or his family 
* a conflict between the hero and the villain, either a fight or other competition
* pursuing the hero after he has succeeded in winning the fight or obtaining something from the villain

None of these acts necessarily occurs in a fairy tale, but when any of them do, the character that performs the act is the villain. The villain, therefore, could appear twice: once in the opening of the story, and a second time as the person sought out by the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

When a character performed only these acts, the character was a pure villain. Various villains also perform other functions in a fairy tale; a witch who fought the hero and ran away, and who lets the hero follow her, is also performing the task of "guidance" and thus acting as a helper.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

The functions could also be spread out among several characters. If a dragon acted as the villain but was killed by the hero, another character (such as the dragon's sisters) might take on the role of the villain and pursue the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

Two other characters could appear in roles that are villainous in the more general sense. One is the [[false hero]]: this character is always villainous, presenting a false claim to be the hero that must be rebutted for the happy ending.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Among these characters are [[Cinderella]]'s stepsisters, chopping off parts of their feet to fit on the shoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maria Tatar |authorlink1=Maria Tatar |title=The Annotated Brothers Grimm |date=2004 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|W.W. Norton]] |isbn=0393058484 |page=136 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another character, the dispatcher, sends a hero on his quest. This might be an innocent request, to fulfill a legitimate need, but the dispatcher might also, villainously, lie to send a character on a quest in hopes of being rid of him.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Villainous foil==
[[File:Wicked Witch of the West W.W. Denslow.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is an example of a literary villain.]]

In fiction, villains commonly function in the dual role of adversary and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the story's heroes. In their role as an adversary, the villain serves as an obstacle the hero must struggle to overcome. In their role as a foil, the villain exemplifies characteristics that are diametrically opposed to those of the hero, creating a contrast distinguishing heroic traits from villainous ones.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Others point out that many acts of villains have a hint of wish-fulfillment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Das |first1=Sisir Kumar |title=A History of Indian Literature: 1911-1956 |date=1995 |publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]] |isbn=9788172017989 |page=416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqBjpV9OzcsC&amp;pg=PA416 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes some people identify with them as characters more strongly than with the heroes. Because of this, a convincing villain must be given a [[characterization]] that provides a [[Base motive|motive]] for doing wrong, as well as being a worthy adversary to the hero. As put by film critic [[Roger Ebert]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Roger Ebert |authorlink1=Roger Ebert |title=Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Movie Review (1982) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-trek-ii-the-wrath-of-khan-1982 |website=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en |date=January 1, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Portraying and employing villains in fiction==
[[Tod Slaughter]] always portrayed villainous characters on both stage and screen in a melodramatic manner, with mustache-twirling, eye-rolling, leering, [[evil laughter|cackling]], and [[hand-rubbing]] (however, this often failed to translate well from stage to screen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bryan Senn |title=Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939 |date=1996 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786401758 |page=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jeffery Richards |title=The Unknown 1930s: An Alternative History of the British Cinema, 1929-39 |date=2001 |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]] |isbn=9781860646287 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brad Warner]] states that "only cartoon villains cackle with glee while rubbing their hands together and dream of ruling the world in the name of all that is wicked and bad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Brad Warner]] |title=Sit Down and Shut Up: Punk Rock Commentaries on Buddha, God, Truth, Sex, Death, and Dogen's Treasury of the Right Dharma Eye |date=2007 |publisher=New World Library |isbn=9781577315599 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Bova]] recommends to authors that their works not contain villains. He states, in his ''Tips for writers'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the real world there are no villains. No one actually sets out to do evil... Fiction mirrors life. Or, more accurately, fiction serves as a lens to focus on what they know in life and bring its realities into sharper, clearer understanding for us. There are no villains cackling and rubbing their hands in glee as they contemplate their evil deeds. There are only people with problems, struggling to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Ben Bova]] |title=Tips for writers |url=http://benbova.com/tips2.html |website=Ben Bova |accessdate=2008-12-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821135403/http://benbova.com/tips2.html |archivedate=2009-08-21 |date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[David Lubar]] adds: &lt;blockquote&gt;"This is a brilliant observation that has served me well in all my writing. (The bad guy isn't doing bad stuff so he can rub his hands together and snarl.) He may be driven by greed, neuroses, or the conviction that his cause is just, but he's driven by something, not unlike the things that drive a hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Darcy Pattinson |title=Villains Don't Always Wear Black |url=http://www.darcypattison.com/characters/villains-dont-always-wear-black/ |website=Fiction Notes |accessdate=2018-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122183445/http://www.darcypattison.com/characters/villains-dont-always-wear-black/ |archivedate=2009-01-22 |date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source is a blog.|date=October 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sympathetic villain===
In an attempt to add realism to their stories, many writers will try to create "sympathetic" villains, the [[antithesis]] to an [[antihero]] called an '''anti-villain'''. These villains come in just as many shapes and sizes as anti-heroes do. Some may wish to make the world a better place but go to antagonistic lengths to do so (such as [[Doctor Octopus]] in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', who commits various crimes in an attempt to complete his goal of creating a cheap, renewable source of energy, and Dr. Horrible in ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]]'', who wants to rule the world so that he can solve all of its problems), or may employ a code of honor in fighting his enemies, even if it is to achieve antagonistic goals (examples include Murdock, a secondary villain in the game ''[[Fire Emblem: Fūin no Tsurugi]]'', who is honorable, but fights the player's army due to loyalty to his country). Other sympathetic villains may be pushed to antagonistic lifestyles by society's mistreatment of him due to prejudice against something he is a part of (such as [[racism]], as is the case in ''[[American History X]]''), but goes to absurd lengths to achieve the equality he desires, like [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the ''[[X-Men]]'' comics and films. Others may include those manipulated by malevolent and opprobrious forces (such as [[Jack Torrance]] being manipulated by the Overlook Hotel in ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''). Plot based video games tend to have two villains where one is sympathetic. This creates a foreseeable plot twist wherein either they die or they switch sides.
