[[File:Frans Koppelaar - Landscape near Bologna.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Frans Koppelaar]], ''Landscape near Bologna'', 2001; a painting depicting aerial perspective: distant objects are lighter, of lower contrast, and bluer than nearer objects.]]

'''Aerial perspective''' or '''atmospheric perspective''' refers to the effect the atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as it is viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less [[saturation (color theory)|saturated]] and shift towards the background colour, which is usually blue, but under some conditions may be some other colour (for example, at sunrise or sunset distant colours may shift towards red).

==History==

Aerial perspective was used in paintings from the Netherlands in the 15th century, and explanations of its effects were with varying degrees of accuracy written by [[polymath]]s such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The latter used aerial perspective in many of his paintings such as the [[Mona Lisa]] and [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]. Atmospheric perspective was used in Pompeian Second Style paintings, one of the [[Pompeian Styles]], dating as early as 30 BCE. A notable example is the Gardenscape from the Villa of Livia in Primaporta, Italy.

==Optics==

The major component affecting the appearance of objects during [[daylight]] is [[scattering]] of light, called [[Diffuse sky radiation|skylight]], into the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] of the viewer. Scattering occurs from molecules of the air and also from larger particles in the atmosphere such as water vapour and smoke (see [[haze]]). Scattering adds the sky light as a [[veiling luminance]] onto the light from the object, reducing its contrast with the background sky light. Skylight usually contains more light of short [[wavelength]] than other wavelengths (this is why the sky usually appears blue), which is why distant objects appear bluish (see [[Rayleigh scattering]] for detailed explanation). A minor component is scattering of light out of the line of sight of the viewer. Under daylight, this either augments the contrast loss (e.g., for white objects) or opposes it (for dark objects). At night there is effectively no skylight (unless the [[moon]] is very bright), so scattering out of the line of sight becomes the major component affecting the appearance of [[self-luminous]] objects. Such objects have their contrasts reduced with the dark background, and their colours are shifted towards red.

==Why reducing contrast reduces clarity==

The ability of a person with normal [[visual acuity]] to see fine details is determined by his or her [[contrast sensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D. H. (1977). Visual contrast sensitivity. Optica Acta, 24, 107-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrast sensitivity is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the smallest contrast for which a person can [[Contrast (vision)|see]] a sine-wave [[grating]]. A person's [[contrast sensitivity function]] is contrast sensitivity as a function of [[spatial frequency]]. Normally, peak contrast sensitivity is at about 4 cycles per degree of [[visual angle]]. At higher spatial frequencies, comprising finer and finer lines, contrast sensitivity decreases, until at about 40 cycles per degree even the brightest of bright lines and the darkest of dark lines cannot be seen.

The high spatial frequencies in an image give it its fine details.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, R., &amp; Sekuler, R. (2006). Perception (5th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing the contrast of an image reduces the visibility of these high spatial frequencies because contrast sensitivity for them is already poor. This is how a reduction of contrast can reduce the clarity of an image—by removing its fine details.

It is important to emphasize that reducing the contrast is not the same as [[Focus (optics)|blurring]] an image. Blurring is accomplished by reducing the contrast only of the high spatial frequencies. Aerial perspective reduces the contrast of all spatial frequencies.

==In art==

In art, especially painting, ''aerial perspective''  refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects.

[[File:Frans Koppelaar - Backlight Langestraat.jpg|thumb|[[Frans Koppelaar]], Backlight Langestraat|left]]
(One caution: in common speech, the words ''perspective'' and ''viewpoint'' tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an [[aerial viewpoint]], such as that forming the basis of the [[aerial landscape]] genre. The example by [[Frans Koppelaar]] pictured here shows the difference. This landscape is a good example of aerial perspective; however, it is not an aerial landscape, since the observer is apparently standing on the ground.)

'''Africa Beyond''' is a project celebrating African arts and culture in the UK, supported by [[Arts Council England]], the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Southbank Centre]], iniva (Institute for International Visual Arts) and other partners.

Africa Beyond was founded in March 2006, based in [[London]]. It was created as a legacy of Africa 05, a major celebration of African arts, held throughout 2005. It organises artist residencies linking Africa and the UK, runs public events such as the Word from Africa festival (first hosted at the British Museum in May 2007), and works with arts venues to improve their links with African audiences and artists.

The BBC hosted the Africa Beyond website, which features articles on African music, film, theatre, dance, literature and visual arts, with a special focus on artists and stories relevant to audiences in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesouthafrican.com/bbc-launches-africa-beyond/ "BBC launches Africa Beyond"], TheSouthAfrica.com, 27 march 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The website is no longer updated.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2016}}
'''Altermodern''', a [[portmanteau word]] defined by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]], is an attempt at contextualizing art made in today's global context as a reaction against standardisation and commercialism. It is also the title of the [[Tate Britain]]'s fourth Triennial exhibition curated by Bourriaud.

==Concept==
In his keynote speech to the 2005 Art Association of Australia &amp; New Zealand Conference, Nicolas Bourriaud explained:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/aaanz05/abstracts/nicolas_bourriaud ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723130718/http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/aaanz05/abstracts/nicolas_bourriaud |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Artists are looking for a new modernity that would be based on translation: What matters today  is to translate the cultural values of cultural groups and  to connect them to the world network. This “reloading process” of  modernism according to the twenty-first-century issues could be called altermodernism, a movement connected to the creolisation of cultures and the fight for autonomy, but also the possibility of producing singularities in a more and more standardized world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Altermodern can essentially be read as an artist working in a [[hypermodernity|hypermodern]] world or with supermodern ideas or themes.

==Exhibitions==

===Tate Britain 2009===
The Tate exhibition includes a series of four one-day events (called "Prologues"), aiming to "introduce and provoke debate" around the Triennial’s themes. Each Prologue includes lectures, performances, film and a manifesto text and attempts to define what the curator sees as the four main facets of Altermodern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/tate-triennial-2009-prologue-1-okwui-enwezor-specious-modernity-speculations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''American folk music''' encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as ''traditional music'', ''traditional [[folk music]]'', ''contemporary folk music'', or ''roots music''. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as Great Britain, Europe, or Africa.&lt;ref name=afc&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/folklife/guide/folkmusicandsong.html "Folk Music and Song", American Folklife Center, Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; Musician [[Mike Seeger]] once famously commented that the definition of American folk music is "...all the music that fits between the cracks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.youranswerplace.org/(riylqzaouv3t2j55dvrnwt21)/NewCopyListing.aspx?QS0=&amp;QS1=2&amp;QS2=Folk%20music%20United%20States&amp;QS3=1&amp;QS4=2&amp;QS5=0&amp;QS6=99&amp;QS7=0&amp;QS8=9999&amp;QS9=0&amp;QS10=99&amp;QS11=263042&amp;QS12=1&amp;QS13=1&amp;QS14=457430&amp;QS15=9780399530333 catalog.youranswerplace.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roots music is a broad category of music including [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[old time music]], [[jug band]]s, [[Appalachian folk music|Appalachian folk]], [[blues]], [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Native American music]].  The music is considered American either because it is native to the United States or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck [[musicologist]]s as something distinctly new. It is considered "roots music" because it served as the basis of [[music of the United States|music later developed in the United States]], including [[rock and roll]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[jazz]].

==Early American folk music==
Most songs of the Colonial Fletch and Revolutionary period originated in England, Scotland and Ireland and were brought over by early settlers. "[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen"]] remains a popular [[ballad|traditional ballad]] originating in England and Scotland, which immigrants introduced to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Raph, Theodore. ''The American Song Treasury'', Dover Publications (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[murder ballad]] "[[Pretty Polly (ballad)|Pretty Polly]]" is an American version of an earlier British song, "The Gosport Tragedy".&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/americanrootsmusic/pbs_arm_es_folkballad.html "Folk Songs and Ballads", American Roots Music, PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirituals===
{{Main|Spiritual (music)}}
African American folk music in the area has roots in slavery and emancipation.  "Sacred music, both a Capella and instrumentally accompanied, is at the heart of the tradition. Early spirituals framed Christian beliefs within native practices and were heavily influenced by the music and rhythms of Africa."&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;  Spirituals are prominent, and often use a call and response pattern.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt; "Gospel developed after the Civil War (1861-65). It relied on biblical text for much of its direction, and the use of metaphors and imagery was common. Gospel is a "joyful noise," sometimes accompanied by instrumentation and almost always punctuated by hand clapping, toe tapping, and body movement."&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;

===Work songs===

====Sea shanties====
{{Main|Sea shanty}}
Sea shanties functioned to lighten the burden of routine tasks and provide a rhythm that helped workers perform as a team.&lt;ref name=afc/&gt;

====Cowboy songs====
Cowboys songs are typically ballads that [[cowboy|cowboys]] sang in the West and Southwest. The familiar [[Streets of Laredo (song)|Streets of Laredo]]" (or "Cowboys Lament") derives from an Irish folk song of the late 18th century called "[[The Unfortunate Rake]]",&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; which in turn appears to have descended from the even earlier "[[The Bard of Armagh]]". While "Streets of Laredo" uses the same melody as "The Unfortunate Rake", "[[St. James Infirmary Blues]]" adapts the story to a different tune. This illustrates how folk songs can change in the retelling and appear in a variety of versions.&lt;ref name=afc/&gt;

====Railroad songs====
The "Ballad of [[John Henry (folklore)]]" is about an African-American folk hero said to have worked as a "steel-driving man".&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

==Roots music==
Many roots musicians do not consider themselves folk musicians. The main difference between the [[American folk music revival]] and American "roots music" is that roots music seems to cover a broader range, including blues and country.

Roots music developed its most expressive and varied forms in the first three decades of the 20th century.  The [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] were extremely important in disseminating these musical styles to the rest of the country, as [[Delta blues]] masters, itinerant [[honky tonk]] singers, [[Cajun]] musicians spread to cities like [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and [[New York City|New York]].  The growth of the [[record industry|recording industry]] in the same period was also important; higher potential profits from music placed pressure on artists, songwriters, and label executives to replicate previous hit songs.  This meant that musical fads, such as [[Hawaii]]an [[slack-key guitar]], never died out completely, since a broad range of rhythms, instruments, and vocal stylings were incorporated into disparate popular genres.

By the 1950s, forms of roots music had led to pop-oriented forms.  Folk musicians like the [[Kingston Trio]], blues-derived [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]], pop-gospel, [[doo wop]] and [[R&amp;B]] (later secularized further as [[soul music]]) and the [[Nashville sound]] in country music all modernized and expanded the musical palette of the country.

The roots approach to music emphasizes the diversity of American musical traditions, the genealogy of creative lineages and communities, and the innovative contributions of musicians working in these traditions today.  In recent years roots music has been the focus of popular media programs such as [[Garrison Keillor]]'s public radio program, ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' and the feature film by the same name.

==Regional forms==
American traditional music is also called roots music.  Roots music is a broad category of music including [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[old time music]], [[jug band]]s, [[Appalachian folk music|Appalachian folk]], [[blues]], [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Native American music]].  The music is considered American either because it is native to the United States or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck [[musicologist]]s as something distinctly new. It is considered "roots music" because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including [[rock and roll]], contemporary folk music, [[rhythm and blues]], and [[jazz]].

===Appalachian music===
{{See also|Music of East Tennessee}}
[[Appalachian music]] is the traditional music of the region of [[Appalachia]] in the Eastern United States. It derives from various European and African influences—including English [[ballad]]s, Irish and Scottish traditional music (especially [[fiddle]] music), hymns, and African-American blues.  First recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of [[Old-time music]], [[country music]], and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and were an important part of the [[American folk music revival]].

Instruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the [[banjo]], [[American fiddle]], [[Appalachian dulcimer|fretted dulcimer]], and [[guitar]].&lt;ref name=olson&gt;Ted Olson, "Music&amp;nbsp;— Introduction".  ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109—1120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early recorded Appalachian musicians include [[Fiddlin' John Carson]], [[Henry Whitter]], [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], the [[Carter Family]], [[Clarence Ashley]], [[Frank Proffitt]], and [[Dock Boggs]], all of whom were initially recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Ola Belle Reed]], [[Lily May Ledford]], and [[Doc Watson]].

The Carter Family was a traditional American folk music group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[Southern Gospel]], [[popular music|pop]] and [[rock music]]ians. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars; a beginning of the divergence of country music from traditional folk music. Their recordings of such songs as "[[Wabash Cannonball]]" (1932), "[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]" (1935), "[[Wildwood Flower]]" (1928), and "[[Keep on the Sunny Side]]" (1928) made them country standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Definitive Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock |last=Heatley |first=Michael |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Star Fire |location=London, United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-84451-996-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Country and bluegrass artists such as [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Roy Acuff]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Chet Atkins]], and [[Don Reno]] were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music.&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;  Artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jerry Garcia]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] have performed Appalachian songs or rewritten versions of Appalachian songs.

===Cajun music===
[[Cajun music]], an emblematic [[music of Louisiana]], is rooted in the [[ballads]] of the French-speaking [[Acadian]]s of [[Canada]]. Cajun music is often mentioned in tandem with the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]]-based, [[Cajun]]-influenced [[zydeco]] form, both of [[Acadiana]] origin. These [[French Louisiana#Modern French Louisiana|French Louisiana]] sounds have influenced [[American popular music]] for many decades, especially country music, and have influenced pop culture through mass media, such as television commercials.

===Oklahoma and southern US plains===
[[File:Woody Guthrie NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Singer-songwriter [[Woody Guthrie]] emerged from the dust bowl of Oklahoma and the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] in the mid-20th Century, with lyrics that embraced his views on ecology, poverty, and [[Trade union|unionization in the USA.]], paired with melody reflecting the many genres of American folk music.]]
Before recorded history American Indians in this area used songs and instrumentation; music and dance remain the core of ceremonial and social activities.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;  "Stomp dance" remains at its core, a "call and response" form; instrumentation is provided by rattles or shackles worn on the legs of women.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/F/FO010.html Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture - Folk Music]&lt;/ref&gt;  "Other southeastern nations have their own complexes of sacred and social songs, including those for animal dances and friendship dances, and songs that accompany stickball games.

Central to the music of the southern Plains Indians is the drum, which has been called the heartbeat of Plains Indian music. Most of that genre traces back to the hunting and warfare that was a strong part of plains culture.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;  During the reservation period, they frequently used music to relieve boredom and despair. Neighbors gathered, exchanged and created songs and dances. This is a part of the roots of the modern intertribal [[powwow]]. Another common instrument is the courting flute.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;

[[Shape-note]] or [[sacred harp]] singing developed in the early nineteenth century as a way for itinerant singing instructors to teach church songs in rural communities. They taught using song books that represented musical notation of tones by geometric shapes that associated a shape with a pitch. Sacred harp singing became popular in many Oklahoma rural communities, regardless of ethnicity.&lt;ref name=OklahomaFolk/&gt;

Later, the blues tradition developed, with roots in and parallels to sacred music.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;   By the early 20th century, jazz developed, born from a "blend of ragtime, gospel, and blues"&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt; "Anglo-Scots-Irish music traditions gained a place in Oklahoma after the Land Run of 1889. Because of its size and portability, the fiddle was the core of early Oklahoma Anglo music, but other instruments such as the guitar, mandolin, banjo, and steel guitar were added later. Various Oklahoma music traditions trace their roots to the British Isles, including cowboy ballads, western swing, and contemporary country and western."&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt; "Mexican immigrants began to reach Oklahoma in the 1870s, bringing beautiful canciones and corridos love songs, waltzes, and ballads along with them. Like American Indian communities, each rite of passage in Hispanic communities is accompanied by traditional music.

The acoustic guitar, string bass, and violin provide the basic instrumentation for Mexican music, with maracas, flute, horns, or sometimes accordion filling out the sound."&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;  Other Europeans (such as Bohemians and Germans) settled in the late nineteenth century. Their social activities centered on community halls, "where local musicians played polkas and waltzes on the accordion, piano, and brass instruments."&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;

Later Asians contributed to the musical mix.  "Ancient music and dance traditions from the temples and courts of China, India, and Indonesia are preserved in Asian communities throughout the state, and popular song genres are continually layered on to these classical music forms"&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;

===The American Southwest and South Texas===
[[Tejano music|Tejano]] and [[New Mexico music]], heard throughout the [[American Southwest]] and [[South Texas]], is rooted in the musics of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic/Latino]] communities of the regions. Tejano music is also heavily influenced by [[Regional Mexican music|Regional Mexican]] and Country music, while New Mexico music is much more influenced by [[Hispanos of New Mexico|Hispano]] folk and [[Western music (North America)|Western music]]. Both styles have influenced one another over the years, and incorporated American popular music styles.

==Other American folk music==
Genres here range as widely as the definition of folk music itself; working definitions are based on the style and themes of the music regardless of its source.  Many are a part of the [[American Folk Music Revival]], including works by [[Pete Seeger]], [[Woody Guthrie]], [[The Weavers]],{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 18}} [[Burl Ives]], and others.  A more commercially oriented pop music version of folk emerged in the 1960s, including performers such as [[The Kingston Trio]],{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 18}} [[The Limeliters]], [[The Brothers Four]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Joan Baez]],{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 19}} [[The Highwaymen (folk band)|The Highwaymen]], [[Judy Collins]], [[The New Christy Minstrels]], and [[Gordon Lightfoot]], as well as counterculture and folk rock performers including [[Bob Dylan]],{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=shows 31-32}} [[The Byrds]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]].{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 33}} Folk composer and musician [[Robert Schmertz (artist)|Robert Schmertz]] composed and wrote [[List of songs by Robert Schmertz|pieces]] related to historical events in Western Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Journal_obituary"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://journals.psu.edu/wph/article/viewFile/3386/3217|title=Historical Society Notes and Documents: Robert Watson Schmertz|last=Swetnam|first=George|volume=54|number=4|journal=The Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine|year=October 1975|pages=537–538}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Covers,_Bio"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3528108/composer_architect_entertains_avon_club/|title=Composer, Architect Entertains Avon Club|newspaper=News Record|date=October 27–28, 1973|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art Deco''', sometimes referred to as '''Deco''', is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before [[World War I]].{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=128}} Art Deco influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewelry, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners.{{Sfn|Hillier|1968|page=12}} It took its name, short for ''Arts Décoratifs'', from the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts|Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes]] (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925.{{Sfn|Benton|Benton|Wood|Baddeley|2003|page=16}} It combined [[Modernism|modernist]] styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.

Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles, sometimes contradictory, united by a desire to be modern. From its outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of [[Cubism]]; the bright colors of [[Fauvism]] and of the [[Ballets Russes]]; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of [[Louis Philippe I]] and [[Louis XVI]]; and the exotic styles of [[Chinese art|China]] and [[Japanese art|Japan]], [[Indian art|India]], [[Persian art|Persia]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]] and [[ancient Maya art|Maya art]]. It featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite craftsmanship. The [[Chrysler Building]] and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style.

In the 1930s, during the [[Great Depression]], the Art Deco style became more subdued. New materials arrived, including [[chrome plating]], [[stainless steel]], and [[plastic]]. A sleeker form of the style, called [[Streamline Moderne]], appeared in the 1930s; it featured curving forms and smooth, polished surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Renaut, Christophe and Lazé, Christophe, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, pages 110–116&lt;/ref&gt; Art Deco is one of the first truly international styles, but its dominance ended with the beginning of World War II and the rise of the strictly functional and unadorned styles of [[modernism]] and the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] of architecture that followed.{{Sfn|Benton, Benton and Wood|''Art Déco (1910–1939)''|2010|pages=13–28}}

==Naming==
Art Deco took its name, short for ''Arts Décoratifs'', from the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] held in Paris in 1925,{{Sfn|Benton|Benton|Wood|Baddeley|2003|page=16}} though the diverse styles that characterize Art Deco had already appeared in Paris and [[Brussels]] before World War I.

The term ''arts décoratifs'' was first used in France in 1858; published in the Bulletin de la Société française de photographie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k111368q "M. Cunny présente une Note sur un procédé vitro-héliographique applicable aux arts décoratifs", ''Bulletin de la Société française de photographie'', Société française de photographie. Éditeur: Société française de photographie (Paris), 1858], Bibliothèque nationale de France, département Sciences et techniques, 8-V-1012, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, ''Le Figaro'' newspaper used the term ''objets d'art décoratifs'' with respect to objects for stage scenery created for the [[Salle Le Peletier|Théâtre de l'Opéra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2716231 "Enfin, dans les ateliers, on travaille à l'achèvement des objets d'art décoratifs, qui sont très nombreux", Le Figaro, Éditeur: Figaro (Paris), 1869-09-18, no. 260], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65463131 ''L'Art décoratif à Limoges'', La Voix de la province : Revue littéraire, artistique, agricole et commerciale, 1862], (1862/04/01 (N1)-1863/01/01 (N12)), Bibliothèque francophone multimédia de Limoges, 2013-220524, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32858171s/date Revue des arts décoratifs (Paris), 1880-1902], Bibliothèque nationale de France, département Sciences et techniques, 4-V-1113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, furniture designers, textile, jewelry and glass designers, and other craftsmen were officially given the status of artists by the French government. In response to this, the ''École royale gratuite de dessin'' (Royal Free School of Design) founded in 1766 under King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] to train artists and artisans in crafts relating to the fine arts, was renamed the National School of Decorative Arts (''[[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|l'École nationale des arts décoratifs]]''). It took its present name of ENSAD (''École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs'') in 1927.

During the 1925 Exposition the architect [[Le Corbusier]] wrote a series of articles about the exhibition for his magazine ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' under the title, "1925 EXPO. ARTS. DÉCO." which were combined into a book, "L'art décoratif d'aujourd'hui" (Decorative Art Today). The book was a spirited attack on the excesses of the colorful and lavish objects at the Exposition; and on the idea that practical objects such as furniture should have any decoration at all; his conclusion was that "Modern decoration has no decoration".{{Sfn|Le Corbusier, ''L'Art décoratif d'aujourd'hui'',|Éditions Crès, Collection de "L'Esprit Nouveau", Paris, 1925|page=70-81}}

The actual phrase "Art déco" did not appear in print until 1966, when it featured in the title of the first modern exhibit on the subject, called ''Les Années 25 : Art déco, Bauhaus, Stijl, Esprit nouveau'', which covered the variety of major styles in the 1920s and 1930s. The term Art déco was then used in a 1966 newspaper article by Hillary Gelson in the Times (London, 12 November), describing the different styles at the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gwYZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=the+term+art+deco+was+used+in+1966&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=evwzNMwV_h&amp;sig=V0-rrXusNYbSq3eS4oRIs08IPNU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiujouFzozPAhWFzRQKHTvSDFEQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20term%20art%20deco%20was%20used%20in%201966&amp;f=false David Raizman, Carma Gorman, ''Objects, Audiences, and Literatures: Alternative Narratives in the History of Design'', Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Mar 26, 2009], {{ISBN|1443809462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0kf0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=the+term+art+deco+was+used+in+1966&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FB0v14BG_y&amp;sig=R0aY_wYIx8EiSds5HUXQsH0S5Xo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiujouFzozPAhWFzRQKHTvSDFEQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20term%20art%20deco%20was%20used%20in%201966&amp;f=false Richard Poulin, ''Graphic Design and Architecture, A 20th Century History: A Guide to Type, Image, Symbol, and Visual Storytelling in the Modern World'', Rockport Publishers, 2012], {{ISBN|1610586336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco gained currency as a broadly applied stylistic label in 1968 when historian [[Bevis Hillier]] published the first major academic book on the style: ''[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]]''.{{Sfn|Hillier|1968|page=12}} Hillier noted that the term was already being used by art dealers and cites ''The Times'' (2 November 1966) and an essay named "Les Arts Déco" in ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine (November 1967) as examples of prior usage.{{Sfn|Benton|Benton|Wood|Baddeley|2003|page=430}} In 1971, Hillier organized an exhibition at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], which he details in his book about it, ''The World of Art Deco''.&lt;ref name="Hillier4"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hillier | first= Bevis | title=The World of Art Deco: An Exhibition Organized by The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, June- September 1971 | publisher=E.P.

==Origins==

===Society of Decorative Artists (1901–1913)===
[[File:Odilon Redon fireplace screen.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A fireplace screen by the [[Symbolist]] painter [[Odilon Redon]] now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris (1908)]]
The emergence of Art Deco was closely connected with the rise in status of decorative artists, who until late in the 19th century had been considered simply as artisans. The term "arts décoratifs" had been invented in 1875, giving the designers of furniture, textiles, and other decoration official status. The Société des artistes décorateurs (Society of decorative artists), or SAD, was founded in 1901, and decorative artists were given the same rights of authorship as painters and sculptors. A similar movement developed in Italy. The first international exhibition devoted entirely to the decorative arts, the ''Esposizione international d'Arte decorative moderna'', was held in [[Turin]] in 1902. Several new magazines devoted to decorative arts were founded in Paris, including ''Arts et décoration'' and ''L'Art décoratif moderne''. Decorative arts sections were introduced into the annual salons of the Sociéte des artistes français, and later in the'' [[Salon d'automne]]''. French nationalism also played a part in the resurgence of decorative arts; French designers felt challenged by the increasing exports of less expensive German furnishings. In 1911, the SAD proposed the holding of a major new international exposition of decorative arts in 1912. No copies of old styles were to be permitted; only modern works. The exhibit was postponed until 1914, then, because of the war, postponed until 1925, when it gave its name to the whole family of styles known as Déco.{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=165-170}}

Parisian department stores and fashion designers also played an important part in the rise of Art Déco. Established firms including the luggage maker [[Louis Vuitton]], silverware firm [[Christofle]], glass designer [[René Lalique]], and the jewelers [[Louis Cartier]] and [[Boucheron]], who all began designing products in more modern styles. Beginning in 1900, department stores had recruited decorative artists to work in their design studios. The decoration of the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] had been entrusted to the department store [[Printemps]].&lt;ref name="Salon d'Automne 2012"&gt;[http://www.salon-automne.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/catalogue-SA-2012.pdf Salon d'Automne 2012, exhibition catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year Printemps created its own workshop called "Primavera". By 1920 Primavera employed more than three hundred artists. The styles ranged from the updated versions of Louis XIV, Louis XVI and especially Louis Philippe furniture made by [[Louis Süe]] and the Primavera workshop to more modern forms from the workshop of the Au Louvre department store. Other designers, including [[Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann]] and Paul Foliot refused to use mass production, and insisted that each piece be made individually by hand. The early art deco style featured luxurious and exotic materials such as ebony, and ivory and silk, very bright colors and stylized [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]], particularly baskets and bouquets of flowers of all colors, giving a modernist look.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent, Stephane, "L'artiste décorateur", in ''Art Deco, 1910–1939'' by Charlotte Benton, Tim Benton and Ghislain Wood (2002), Renaissance du Livre, pages 165–171&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] (1910–1913), by [[Auguste Perret]] was the first landmark Art Deco building completed in Paris. Previously [[reinforced concrete]] had been used only for industrial and apartment buildings, Perret had built the first modern reinforced concrete apartment building in Paris on rue Benjamin Franklin in 1903-04. [[Henri Sauvage]], another important future Art Deco architect, built another in 1904 at 7 rue Trétaigne (1904). From 1908 to 1910, the 21-year old Le Corbusier worked as a draftsman in Perret's office, learning the techniques of concrete construction. Perret's building had clean rectangular form, geometric decoration and straight lines, the future trademarks of Art Deco. The decor of the theater was also revolutionary; the facade was decorated with [[Relief#High_relief|high reliefs]] by [[Antoine Bourdelle]], a dome by [[Maurice Denis]], paintings by [[Édouard Vuillard]], and an Art Deco curtain [[Ker-Xavier Roussel]]. The theater became famous as the venue for many of the first performances of the [[Ballets Russes]]. Perret and Sauvage became the leading Art Deco architects in Paris in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Collins, ''Concrete: The Vision of a New Architecture'', New York: Horizon Press, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages=318–319}}

At its birth between 1910 and 1914, Art Deco was an explosion of colors, featuring bright and often clashing hues, frequently in floral designs, presented in furniture upholstery, carpets, screens, wallpaper and fabrics. Many colorful works, including chairs and a table by [[Maurice Dufrene]] and a bright Gobelin carpet by [[Paul Follot]] were presented at the 1912 [[Société des artistes décorateurs|Salon des artistes décorateurs]]. In 1912–1913 designer [[Adrien Karbowsky]] made a floral chair with a parrot design for the hunting lodge of art collector [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]].&lt;ref&gt;Descriptive text in the decorative arts display at the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris&lt;/ref&gt; The furniture designers Louis Süe and [[André Mare]] made their first appearance at the 1912 exhibit, under the name of the ''Atelier Française,'' combining colorful fabrics with exotic and expensive materials, including ebony and ivory. After World War I they became one of the most prominent French interior design firms, producing the furniture for the first-class salons and cabins of the French transatlantic ocean liners.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=51-55}}

The vivid colors of Art Deco came from many sources, including the exotic set designs by [[Leon Bakst]] for the Ballets Russes, which caused a sensation in Paris just before World War I. Some of the colors were inspired by the earlier [[Fauvism]] movement led by [[Henri Matisse]]; others by the [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] of painters such as [[Sonia Delaunay]]; others by the movement known as the Nabis, and in the work of symbolist painter Odilon Redon, who designed fireplace screens and other decorative objects. Bright colors were a feature of the work of fashion designer [[Paul Poiret]], whose work influenced both Art Deco fashion and interior design.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=51-55}}

The art style known as [[Cubism]] appeared in France between 1907 and 1912, influencing the development of Art Deco. The Cubists, themselves under the influence of [[Paul Cézanne]], were interested in the simplification of forms to their geometric essentials: the cylinder, the sphere, the cone.&lt;ref name="Erle Lora"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Cézanne,+le+cylindres,+sphères,+et+le+cônes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWN2A52aTk&amp;sig=kFqKvxXeu6Q_DgjHn2GAb6TDbFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpsqUenwBom3hAfVvIGADg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=cylinder%2C%20sphere%2C%20cone&amp;f=false Erle Lora, ''Cézannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs''], Forward by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the artists of the [[Section d'Or]] exhibited works considerably more accessible to the general public than the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque. The Cubist vocabulary was poised to attract fashion, furniture and interior designers.&lt;ref&gt;''La Section d'or, 1912-1920-1925'', Cécile Debray, Françoise Lucbert, Musées de Châteauroux, Musée Fabre, exhibition catalogue, Éditions Cercle d'art, Paris, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/frdc/hd_frdc.htm|title=French Art Deco|author=Goss, Jared|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1912 writings of [[André Vera]]. ''Le Nouveau style'', published in the journal ''L'Art décoratif'', he expressed the rejection of [[Art Nouveau]] forms (asymmetric, polychrome and picturesque) and called for ''simplicité volontaire, symétrie manifeste, l'ordre et l'harmonie'', themes that would eventually become common within Art Deco; though with time the Deco style was often extremely colorful and anything but simple.&lt;ref&gt;André Vera, ''Le Nouveau style'', published in L'Art décoratif, January 1912, pp. 21–32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Art Décoratif'' section of the 1912 Salon d'Automne, an architectural installation was exhibited known as the ''[[La Maison Cubiste]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Blau, Nancy J.

The facade of the house, designed by Duchamp-Villon, was not very radical by modern standards; the lintels and pediments had prismatic shapes, but otherwise the facade resembled an ordinary house of the period. The rooms were furnished by Mare with neo-Louis XVI and Louis-Philippe style chairs and sofas that were updated with more angular features to make them go with the Cubist paintings. The critic Emile Sedeyn described Mare's work in the magazine ''Art et Décoration'': "He does not embarrass himself with simplicity, for he multiplies flowers wherever they can be put. The effect he seeks is obviously one of picturesqueness and gaiety. He achieves it."{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=52}} The Cubist element was provided by the paintings. Despite its tameness, the installation was attacked by some critics as extremely radical, which helped make for its success.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=54}} This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]], New York, Chicago and Boston.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt315s.html Kubistische werken op de Armory Show]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/detail-duchampvillons-faade-architecturale-14604 Detail of Duchamp-Villon's ''Façade architecturale'', catalog number 609, unidentified photographer, 1913.

The Cubist style continued within Art Deco, even as Deco branched out in many other directions. In 1927, Cubists [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Henri Laurens]], the sculptor [[Gustave Miklos]], and others collaborated in the decoration of a Studio House, rue Saint-James, [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], designed by the architect Paul Ruaud and owned by the French fashion designer Jacques Doucet, also a collector of [[Post-Impressionist]] art by Henri Matisse and [[Cubist]] paintings (including ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', which he bought directly from Picasso's studio). Laurens designed the fountain, Csaky designed Doucet's staircase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22jacques+doucet%22+staircase+by+joseph+csaky&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jvZeOQqDNb&amp;sig=FF6sbrEJ7QnZEljAmyquHlR6oJI&amp;hl=fr#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jacques%20doucet%22%20staircase%20by%20joseph%20csaky&amp;f=false |title=Joseph Csaky's staircase in the home of Jacques Doucet |publisher=Books.google.es |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipchitz made the fireplace mantel, and Marcoussis made a Cubist rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aestheticus Rex |url=http://aestheticusrex.blogspot.com.es/2011/04/jacques-doucets-studio-st-james-at.html |title=Jacques Doucet's Studio St. James at Neuilly-sur-Seine |publisher=Aestheticusrex.blogspot.com.es |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcKfjM9OknEC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=jacques+doucet,+rue+Saint-James,+Neuilly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QqQ4m-jgXG&amp;sig=5RJ8fjC4pmSaCE2b9sRNDNN3IfM&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=jacques%20doucet%2C%20rue%20Saint-James%2C%20Neuilly&amp;f=false |title='&amp;#39;The Modernist Garden in France'&amp;#39;, Dorothée Imbert, 1993, Yale University Press |publisher=Books.google.es |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=jacques+doucet,+joseph+Csaky&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wywyzJn6BX&amp;sig=SeI2no9a60nGo0uIEfOSpbjxWVM&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=jacques%20doucet%2C%20joseph%20Csaky&amp;f=false |title=Joseph Csáky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture, Edith Balas, 1998, p. 5 |publisher=Books.google.es |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Cubist artists, Doucet brought in other Deco interior designers to help in decorating the house, including Pierre Legrain, who was in charge of organizing the decoration, and [[Paul Iribe]], Marcel Coard, [[André Groult]], [[Eileen Gray]] and Rose Adler to provide furniture. The decor included massive pieces made of macassar ebony, inspired by African art, and furniture covered with Morocco leather, crocodile skin and snakeskin, and patterns taken from African designs.{{Sfn|Arwas|1982|page=70}}

Art Deco was not a single style, but a collection of different and sometimes contradictory styles. In architecture, Art Deco was the successor to and reaction against Art Nouveau, a style which flourished in Europe between 1895 and 1900, and also gradually replaced the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] that were predominant in European and American architecture. In 1905 [[Eugène Grasset]] wrote and published ''Méthode de Composition Ornementale, Éléments Rectilignes,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6109619d |title=Eugène Grasset, '&amp;#39;Méthode de composition ornementale, Éléments rectilignes'&amp;#39;, 1905, Librarie Centrale des Beaux-Arts, Paris (in French) |language=fr |publisher=Gallica.bnf.fr |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he systematically explored the decorative (ornamental) aspects of geometric elements, forms, motifs and their variations, in contrast with (and as a departure from) the undulating Art Nouveau style of [[Hector Guimard]], so popular in Paris a few years earlier. Grasset stressed the principle that various simple geometric shapes like triangles and squares are the basis of all compositional arrangements. The reinforced concrete buildings of Auguste Perret and Henri Sauvage, and particularly the [[Theatre des Champs-Elysees]], offered a new form of construction and decoration which was copied worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/mthodedecomposit01gras |title=Eugène Grasset, '&amp;#39;Méthode de composition ornementale'&amp;#39;, 1905, Full Text (in French) |publisher=Archive.org |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In decoration, many different styles were borrowed and used by Art Deco. They included pre-modern art from around the world and observable at the [[Musée du Louvre]], [[Musée de l'Homme]] and the [[Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie]]. There was also popular interest in archeology due to excavations at [[Pompeii]], [[Troy]], and the tomb of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]]. Artists and designers integrated motifs from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], Asia, [[Mesoamerica]] and [[Oceania]] with [[Machine Age]] elements.&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |title=Art Deco Style |publisher=Museum of London |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080207022236/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |archivedate=7 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Essential Art Deco"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Ghislaine |title=Essential Art Deco |publisher=VA&amp;A Publications |location=London |isbn=0-8212-2833-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Design: A Concise History"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hauffe |first=Thomas |title=Design: A Concise History |publisher=Laurence King |location=London |year=1998 |edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html |title=Art Deco Study Guide |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |accessdate=1 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025210428/http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html |archivedate=25 October 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Intro.html |title=Introduction to Art Deco |last=Juster |first=Randy |publisher=decopix.com |accessdate=7 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029202446/http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Intro.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University Times"&gt;{{cite journal |date=9 October 2003 |title=How Art Deco came to be |journal=University Times | publisher=University of Pittsburgh |volume=36 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other styles borrowed included Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and Italian [[Futurism]], as well as Orphism, [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], and [[Modernism]] in general.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=8-10}}&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Art, Design and Visual Thinking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/art/decart/artdeco/artdeco.htm |title=Art, Design and Visual Thinking |last=Jirousek |first=Charlotte |year=1995 |accessdate=7 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202040916/http://char.txa.cornell.edu/art/decart/artdeco/artdeco.htm |archivedate=2 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art Deco also used the clashing colors and designs of Fauvism, notably in the work of Henri Matisse and [[André Derain]], inspired the designs of art deco textiles, wallpaper, and painted ceramics.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;  It took ideas from the high fashion vocabulary of the period, which featured geometric designs, chevrons, zigzags, and stylized bouquets of flowers. It was influenced by discoveries in [[Egyptology]], and growing interest in the Orient and in African art. From 1925 onwards, it was often inspired by a passion for new machines, such as airships, automobiles and ocean liners, and by 1930 this influence resulted in the style called [[streamline moderne]].{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=7-8}}

Art Deco was associated with both luxury and modernity; it combined very expensive materials and exquisite craftsmanship put into modernistic forms. Nothing was cheap about Art Deco: pieces of furniture included ivory and silver inlays, and pieces of Art Deco jewelry combined diamonds with platinum, jade, and other precious materials. The style was used to decorate the first-class salons of ocean liners, deluxe trains, and skyscrapers. It was used around the world to decorate the great movie palaces of the late 1920s and 1930s. Later, after the [[Great Depression]], the style changed and became more sober.

A good example of the luxury style of Art Deco is the boudoir of the fashion designer [[Jeanne Lanvin]], designed by [[Armand-Albert Rateau]] (1882-1938) made between 1922-25. It was located in her house at 16 rue Barbet de Jouy, in Paris, which was demolished in 1965. The room was reconstructed in the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris. The walls are covered with molded ''lambris'' below sculpted bas-reliefs in stucco. The alcove is framed with columns of marble on with bases and a plinth of sculpted wood. The floor is of white and black marble, and in the cabinets decorative objects are displayed against a background of blue silk. Her bathroom had a tub and washstand made of sienna marble, with a wall of carved stucco and bronze fittings.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=82}}

By 1928 the style had become more comfortable, with deep leather club chairs. The study designed by the Paris firm of Alavoine for an American businessman in 1928-30, now in the [[Brooklyn Museum]], had a unique American feature. Since it was constructed during [[Prohibition]], when serving alcohol was prohibited, it included a secret bar hidden behind the panels.&lt;ref&gt;Home Page of the [[Brooklyn Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, the style had been somewhat simplified, but it was still extravagant. In 1932 the decorator Paul Ruoud made the Glass Salon for Suzanne Talbot. It featured a serpentine armchair and two tubular armchairs by Eileen Gray, a floor of mat silvered glass slabs, a panel of abstract patterns in silver and black lacquer, and an assortment of animal skins.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=77}}

{{main article|International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts}}
The event that marked the zenith of the style and gave it its name was the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] which took place in Paris from April to October in 1925.  This was officially sponsored by the French government, and covered a site in Paris of 55 acres, running from the [[Grand Palais]] on the right bank to [[Les Invalides]] on the left bank, and along the banks of the Seine. The Grand Palais, the largest hall in the city, was filled with exhibits of decorative arts from the participating countries. There were 15,000 exhibitors from twenty different countries, including England, Italy, Spain, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Japan, and the new [[Soviet Union]], though Germany was not invited because of tensions after the war and the United States, misunderstanding the purpose of the exhibit, declined to participate. It was visited by sixteen million people during its seven-month run. The rules of the exhibition required that all work be modern; no historical styles were allowed. The main purpose of the Exhibit was to promote the French manufacturers of luxury furniture, porcelain, glass, metal work, textiles and other decorative products. To further promote the products, all the major Paris department stores and major designers had their own pavilions. The Exposition had a secondary purpose in promoting products from French colonies in Africa and Asia, including ivory and exotic woods.

The Hôtel du Riche Collectionneur was a popular attraction at the Exposition; it displayed the new furniture designs of Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, as well as Art Deco fabrics, carpets, and a painting by [[Jean Dupas]]. The interior design followed the same principles of symmetry and geometric forms which set it apart from Art Nouveau, and bright colors, fine craftsmanship rare and expensive materials which set it apart from the strict functionality of the Modernist style. While most of the pavilions were lavishly decorated and filled with hand-made luxury furniture, two pavilions, those of the Soviet Union and Pavilion du Nouveau Esprit, built by the magazine of that name run by Le Corbusier, were built in an austere style with plain white walls and no decoration; they were among the earliest examples of [[modernist architecture]].{{Sfn|Charles|2013|pages=35-104}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

American skyscrapers marked the summit of the Art Deco style; they became the tallest and most recognizable modern buildings in the world. They were designed to show the prestige of their builders through their height, their shape, their color, and their dramatic illumination at night.&lt;ref&gt;John Burchard and Albert Bush Brown, ''The Architecture of America'' (1966), Atlantic, Little and Brown, page 277&lt;/ref&gt; The first New York skyscraper, the [[Woolworth Building]], in a neoclassical style, was completed in 1913, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Building (1924) had ionic and doric columns and a classical Doric [[hypostyle]] with a frieze. The [[American Radiator Building]] by [[Raymond Hood]] (1924) combined Gothic and Deco modern elements in the design of the building. Black brick on the frontage of the building (symbolizing coal) was selected to give an idea of solidity and to give the building a solid mass. Other parts of the facade were covered in gold bricks (symbolizing fire), and the entry was decorated with marble and black mirrors. Another early Art Deco skyscraper was Detroit's [[Guardian Building]], which opened in 1929. Designed by modernist [[Wirt C. Rowland]], the building was the first to employ stainless steel as a decorative element, and the extensive use of colored designs in place of traditional ornaments.

The New York skyline was radically changed by the [[Chrysler Building]] in Manhattan (completed in 1930), designed by [[William Van Alen]]. It was a giant seventy-seven floor tall advertisement for Chrysler automobiles. The top was crowned by a stainless steel spire, and was ornamented by deco "gargoyles" in the form of stainless steel radiator cap decorations. The base of the tower, thirty-three stories above the street, was decorated with colorful art deco friezes, and the lobby was decorated with art deco symbols and images expressing modernity.{{Sfn|Benton|202|pages=249-258}}

The Chrysler Building was followed by the [[Empire State Building]] by [[William F. Lamb]] (1931) and the RCA Building (now the [[Comcast Building]]) in [[Rockefeller Center]], by Raymond Hood (1933) which together completely changed the skyline of New York. The tops of the buildings were decorated with Art Deco crowns and spires covered with stainless steel, and, in the case of the Chrysler building, with Art Deco gargoyles modeled after radiator ornaments, while the entrances and lobbies were lavishly decorated with Art Deco sculpture, ceramics, and design. Similar buildings, though not quite as tall, soon appeared in Chicago and other large American cities. The Chrysler Building was soon surpassed in height by the Empire State Building, in a slightly less lavish Deco style. Rockefeller Center added a new design element: several tall building grouped around an open plaza, with a fountain in the center.{{Sfn|Morel|2012|pages=125-30}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In 1925 two different competing schools coexisted within Art Deco: the traditionalists, who had founded the Society of Decorative Artists; included the furniture designer Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, Jean Dunard, the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, and designer Paul Poiret; they combined modern forms with traditional craftsmanship and expensive materials. On the other side were the modernists, who increasingly rejected the past and wanted a style based upon advances in new technologies, simplicity, a lack of decoration, inexpensive materials, and mass production. The modernists founded their own organization, [[The French Union of Modern Artists]], in 1929. Its members included architects [[Pierre Chareau]], [[Francis Jourdain]], [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], Corbusier, and, in the Soviet Union, [[Konstantin Melnikov]]; the Irish designer Eileen Gray, and French designer Sonia Delaunay, the jewelers [[Jean Fouquet]] and [[Jean Puiforcat]]. They fiercely attacked the traditional art deco style, which they said was created only for the wealthy, and insisted that well-constructed buildings should be available to everyone, and that form should follow function. The beauty of an object or building resided in whether it was perfectly fit to fulfill its function. Modern industrial methods meant that furniture and buildings could be mass-produced, not made by hand.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture'', Flammarion, republished in 1995, page xix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larousse Encyclopedia on-line edition (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Deco interior designer Paul Follot defended Art Deco in this way: "We know that man is never content with the indispensable and that the superfluous is always needed...If not, we would have to get rid of music, flowers, and perfumes..!"{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=8}} However, Le Corbusier was a brilliant publicist for modernist architecture; he stated that a house was simply "a machine to live in", and tirelessly promoted the idea that Art Deco was the past and modernism was the future. Le Corbusier's ideas were gradually adopted by architecture schools, and the aesthetics of Art Deco were abandoned. The same features that made Art Deco popular in the beginning, its craftsmanship, rich materials and ornament, led to its decline. The Great Depression that began in the United States in 1929, and reached Europe shortly afterwards, greatly reduced the number of wealthy clients who could pay for the furnishings and art objects. In the Depression economic climate, few companies were ready to build new skyscrapers.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt; Even the Ruhlmann firm resorted to producing pieces of furniture in series, rather than individual hand-made items. The last buildings built in Paris in the new style were the Museum of Public Works by Auguste Perret (now the [[French Economic, Social and Environmental Council]]) and the [[Palais de Chaillot]] by [[Louis-Hippolyte Boileau]], [[Jacques Carlu]] and [[Léon Azéma]], and the [[Palais de Tokyo]] of the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]]; they looked out at the grandiose pavilion of Nazi Germany, designed by [[Albert Speer]], which faced the equally grandiose socialist-realist pavilion of Stalin's Soviet Union.

After World War II the dominant architectural style became the International Style pioneered by Le Corbusier, and [[Mies Van der Rohe]]. A handful of Art Deco hotels were built in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] after World War II, but elsewhere the style largely vanished, except in industrial design, where it continued to be used in automobile styling and products such as jukeboxes. In the 1960s, it experienced a modest academic revival, thanks in part to the writings of architectural historians such as Bevis Hillier. In the 1970s efforts were made in the United States and Europe to preserve the best examples of Art Deco architecture, and many buildings were restored and repurposed. [[Postmodern architecture]], which first appeared in the 1980s, like Art Deco, often includes purely decorative features.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Design Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fell | first=Charlotte |first2=Peter |last2=Fell |title=Design Handbook: Concepts, Materials and Styles |publisher=Taschen |year=2006 |edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |title=Art Deco (1920s to 1930s) |last=Heindorf |first=Anne |date=24 July 2006 |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080207022236/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |archivedate=7 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deco continues to inspire designers, and is often used in contemporary fashion, jewelry, and toiletries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf |title=The Decorative in Twentieth Century Art: A Story of Decline and Resurgence |first=Pamela |last=Gaunt |date=August 2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217013725/http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
There was no section set aside for painting at the 1925 Exposition. Art deco painting was by definition decorative, designed to decorate a room or work of architecture, so few painters worked exclusively in the style, but two painters are closely associated with Art Deco. Jean Dupas painted Art Deco murals for the Bordeaux Pavilion at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and also painted the picture over the fireplace in the Maison de la Collectioneur exhibit at the 1925 Exposition, which featured furniture by Ruhlmann and other prominent Art Deco designers. His murals were also prominent in the decor of the French ocean liner [[SS Normandie|SS ''Normandie'']]. His work was purely decorative, designed as a background or accompaniment to other elements of the decor.&lt;ref&gt;Louis René Vian, ''Les Arts décoratifs à bord des paquebots français'', Éditions Fonmare, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The other painter closely associated with the style is [[Tamara de Lempicka]]. Born in Poland, she emigrated to Paris after the [[Russian Revolution]]. She studied under [[Maurice Denis]] and [[André Lhote]], and borrowed many elements from their styles. She painted portraits in a realistic, dynamic and colorful Art Deco style.&lt;ref&gt;Blondel, Alain (1999). ''Tamara de Lempicka: a Catalogue Raisonné 1921–1980''. Lausanne: Editions Acatos.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s a dramatic new form of Art Deco painting appeared in the United States. During the Great Depression, the [[Federal Art Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] was created to give work to unemployed artists. Many were given the task of decorating government buildings, hospitals and schools. There was no specific art deco style used in the murals; artists engaged to paint murals in government buildings came from many different schools, from American regionalism to [[social realism]]; they included [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Rockwell Kent]] and the Mexican painter [[Diego Rivera]]. The murals were Art Deco because they were all decorative and related to the activities in the building or city where they were painted: Reginald Marsh and Rockwell Kent both decorated U.S. postal buildings, and showed postal employees at work while Diego Rivera depicted automobile factory workers for the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. Diego Rivera's mural ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'' (1933) for Rockefeller Center featured an unauthorized portrait of [[Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;Balfour, Alan (1978).

Most of the sculpture of the Art Deco period was, as the name suggests, purely decorative; it was designed not for museums, but to ornament office buildings, government buildings, public squares and private salons. It was almost always representational, usually of heroic or allegorical figures related to the purpose of the building; the themes were usually chosen by the patron, and abstract sculpture for decoration was extremely rare. It was frequently attached to facade of buildings, particularly over the entrances and lobbies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0671808044 Eva Weber, ''Art deco in America''], Exeter Books, 1985, p. 32, {{ISBN|0671808044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegorical sculptures of the dance and music by Antoine Bourdelle were the essential decorative feature of the earliest Art Deco landmark in Paris, the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] in Paris, in 1912. The sculptor [[Aristide Maillol]] reinvented the classical ideal for his statue of the River (1939), now at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. In the 1930s, a whole team of sculptors made sculpture for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at Chaillot. The buildings of the Exposition were covered with low-relief sculpture, statues. [[Alfred Janniot]] made the relief sculptures on the facade of the Palais de Tokyo. The [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], and the esplanade in front of the Palais de Chaillot, facing the Eiffel Tower, was crowded with new statuary by [[Charles Malfray]], Henry Arnold, and many others.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=165-66}}

In the United States, many European sculptors trained at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris, came to work; they included [[Gutzon Borglum]], sculptor of Mount Rushmore [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Other American sculptors, including [[Harriet Whitney Frishmuth]], had studied with [[Auguste Rodin]] in Paris. The 1929 stock market crash largely destroyed the market for monumental sculpture, but one grand project remained; the new Rockefeller Center. The American sculptors [[Lee Lawrie]] and [[Paul Manship]] designed heroic allegorical figures for facade and plaza. In San Francisco, [[Ralph Stackpole]] provided sculpture for the facade of the new [[San Francisco Stock Exchange]] building.

One of the best known and certainly the largest Art Deco sculpture is the ''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' by the French sculptor [[Paul Landowski]], completed between 1922 and 1931, located on a mountain top overlooking [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. [[François Pompon]] was a pioneer of modern stylized [[animalier]] sculpture. He was not fully recognized for his artistic accomplishments until the age of 67 at the Salon d'Automne of 1922 with the work ''Ours blanc'', also known as ''The White Bear'', now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kjellberg|first1=Pierre|title=Bronzes of the 19th Century|date=1994|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.|location=Atglen, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-88740-629-7|page=551|edition=First}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early Art Deco sculptures were small, designed to decorate salons. One genre of this sculpture was called the [[Chryselephantine]] statuette, named for a style of ancient Greek temple statues made of gold and ivory. One of the best-known Art Deco salon sculptors was the Romanian-born [[Demétre Chiparus]], who produced colorful small sculptures of dancers. Other notable salon sculptors included [[Ferdinand Preiss]], [[Josef Lorenzl]], Alexander Kelety, Dorothea Charol and Gustav Schmidtcassel.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=141-163}}

Parallel with these more neoclassical sculptors, more avant-garde and abstract sculptors were at work in Paris and New York. The most prominent were [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Henri Laurens]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Gustave Miklos]], [[Jean Lambert-Rucki]], [[Jan et Joël Martel]], [[Chana Orloff]] and [[Pablo Gargallo]].&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ Edith Balas, 1998, ''Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture''], Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Deco style appeared early in the graphic arts, in the years just before World War I. It appeared in Paris in the posters and the costume designs of Leon Bakst for the Ballets Russes, and in the catalogs of the fashion designers Paul Poiret.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/robesdePaulPoir00Irib Paul Iribe, ''Les robes de Paul Poiret'', 1908]&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations of [[Georges Barbier]], and Georges Lepape and the images in the fashion magazine ''La Gazette du bon ton'' perfectly captured the elegance and sensuality of the style. In the 1920s, the look changed; the fashions stressed were more casual, sportive and daring, with the woman models usually smoking cigarettes. American fashion magazines such as ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' quickly picked up the new style and popularized it in the United States. It also influenced the work of American book illustrators such as Rockwell Kent. In Germany, the most famous poster artist of the period was [[Ludwig Hohlwein]], who created colorful and dramatic posters for music festivals, beers, and, late in his career, for the Nazi Party.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=148-150}}

During the Art Nouveau period, posters usually advertised theatrical products or cabarets. In the 1920s, travel posters, made for steamship lines and airlines, became extremely popular. The style changed notably in the 1920s, to focus attention on the product being advertised. The images became simpler, precise, more linear, more dynamic, and were often placed against a single color background. In France popular Art Deco designers included, Charles Loupot and [[Paul Colin (artist)|Paul Colin]], who became famous for his posters of American singer and dancer [[Josephine Baker]]. Jean Carlu designed posters for Charlie Chaplin movies, soaps, and theaters; in the late 1930s he emigrated to the United States, where, during the World War, he designed posters to encourage war production. The designer Charles Gesmar became famous making posters for the singer [[Mistinguett]] and for [[Air France]]. Among the best known French Art Deco poster designers was [[Cassandre (artist)|Cassandre]], who made the celebrated poster of the ocean liner SS ''Normandie'' in 1935.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=148-150}}

In the 1930s a new genre of posters appeared in the United States during the Great Depression. The Federal Art Project hired American artists to create posters to promote tourism and cultural events.

The architectural style of art deco made its debut in Paris in 1903-04, with the construction of two apartment buildings in Paris, one by Auguste Perret on rue Trétaigne and the other on rue Benjamin Franklin by Henri Sauvage. The two young architects used reinforced concrete for the first time in Paris residential buildings; the new buildings had clean lines, rectangular forms, and no decoration on the facades; they marked a clean break with the [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] style.{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages 299 and 318}} Between 1910 and 1913, Perret used his experience in concrete apartment buildings to construct the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, 15 [[avenue Montaigne]]. Between 1925 and 1928 he constructed the new art deco facade of the [[La Samaritaine]] department store in Paris.{{Sfn|Plum|2014|page=134}}

After the First World War, art deco buildings of steel and reinforced concrete began to appear in large cities across Europe and the United States. In the United States the style was most commonly used for office buildings, government buildings, movie theaters, and railroad stations. It sometimes was combined with other styles; [[Los Angeles City Hall]] combined Art Deco with a roof based on the ancient Greek [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], while the [[Los Angeles railroad station]] combined Deco with Spanish mission architecture. Art Deco elements also appeared in engineering projects, including the towers of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and the intake towers of [[Hoover Dam]]. In the 1920s and 1930s it became a truly international style, with examples including the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] (Palace of Fine Arts) in [[Mexico City]] by {{ill|Federico Mariscal|es}}, the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya Metro Station]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[National Diet Building]] in Tokyo by Watanabe Fukuzo.

The Art Deco style was not limited to buildings on land; the ocean liner SS ''Normandie'', whose first voyage was in 1935, featured Art Deco design, including a dining room whose ceiling and decoration were made of glass by [[Lalique]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The grand showcases of Art deco interior design were the lobbies of government buildings, theaters, and particularly office buildings. Interiors were extremely colorful and dynamic, combining sculpture, murals, and ornate geometric design in marble, glass, ceramics and stainless steel. An early example was the [[Fisher Building]] in Detroit, by [[Joseph Nathaniel French]]; the lobby was highly decorated with sculpture and ceramics. The [[Guardian Building]] (originally the Union Trust Building) in Detroit, by [[Wirt Rowland]] (1929), decorated with red and black marble and brightly colored ceramics, highlighted by highly polished steel elevator doors and counters. The sculptural decoration installed in the walls illustrated the virtues of industry and saving; the building was immediately termed the "Cathedral of Commerce". The Medical and Dental Building called [[450 Sutter Street]] in San Francisco by [[Timothy Pflueger]] was inspired by [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] architecture, in a highly stylized form; it used pyramid shapes, and the interior walls were covered highly stylized rows of hieroglyphs.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=198-200}}

In France, the best example of an Art Deco interior during period was the [[Palais de la Porte Dorée]] (1931) by [[Albert Laprade]], [[Léon Jaussely]] and [[Léon Bazin]]. The building (now the National Museum of Immigration, with an aquarium in the basement) was built for the [[Paris Colonial Exposition of 1931]], to celebrate the people and products of French colonies. The exterior facade was entirely covered with sculpture, and the lobby created an Art Deco harmony with a wood parquet floor in a geometric pattern, a mural depicting the people of French colonies; and a harmonious composition of vertical doors and horizontal balconies.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=198-200}}

Many of the best surviving examples of Art Deco are movie theaters built in the 1920s and 1930s. The Art Deco period coincided with the conversion of silent films to sound, and movie companies built enormous theaters in major cities to capture the huge audience that came to see movies. Movie palaces in the 1920s often combined exotic themes with art deco style; [[Grauman's Egyptian Theater]] in Hollywood (1922) was inspired by ancient Egyptian [[tomb]]s and [[pyramid]]s, while the [[Fox Theater (Bakersfield, California)|Fox Theater]] in Bakersfield, California attached a tower in California Mission style to an Art Deco hall. The largest of all is [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City, which opened in 1932. Originally designed as a stage theater, it quickly transformed into a movie theater, which could seat 6,015 persons The interior design by [[Donald Deskey]] used glass, aluminum, chrome, and leather to create a colorful escape from reality The [[Paramount Theater (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]] in Oakland, California, by Timothy Pflueger, had a colorful ceramic facade a lobby four stories high, and separate Art Deco smoking rooms for gentlemen and ladies. Similar grand palaces appeared in Europe. The [[Grand Rex]] in Paris (1932), with its imposing tower, was the largest movie theater in Europe. The [[Gaumont State Cinema]] in London (1937) had a tower modeled after the Empire State building, covered with cream-colored ceramic tiles and an interior in an Art Deco-Italian Renaissance style. The [[Paramount (Shanghai)|Paramount]] Theater in [[Shanghai]], China (1933) was originally built as a dance hall called ''The gate of 100 pleasures''; it was converted to a movie theater after the Communist Revolution in 1949, and now is a ballroom and disco. In the 1930s Italian architects built a small movie palace, the Cinema Impero, in [[Asmara]] in what is now [[Eritrea]]. Today, many of the movie theaters have been subdivided into multiplexes, but others have been restored and are used as cultural centers in their communities.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=197-199}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the late 1930s, a new variety of Art Deco architecture became common; it was called [[Streamline Moderne]] or simply Streamline, or, in France, the Style Paqueboat, or Ocean Liner style. Buildings in the style were had rounded corners, long horizontal lines; they were built of reinforced concrete, and were almost always white; and sometimes had nautical features, such as railings that resembled those on a ship. The rounded corner was not entirely new; it had appeared in Berlin in 1923 in the [[Mossehaus]] by [[Erich Mendelsohn]], and later in the [[Hoover Building]], an industrial complex in the London suburb of [[Perivale]]. In the United States, it became most closely associated with transport; Streamline moderne was rare in office buildings, but was often used for bus stations and airport terminals, such as terminal at La Guardia airport in New York City that handled the first transatlantic flights, via the PanAm clipper flying boats; and in roadside architecture, such as gas stations and diners. In the late 1930s a series of diners, modeled after streamlined railroad cars, were produced and installed in towns in New England; at least two examples still remain and are now registered historic buildings.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=197}}

==Decoration and motifs==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Decoration in the Art Deco period went through several distinct phases. Between 1910 and 1920, as Art Nouveau was exhausted, design styles saw a return to tradition, particularly in the work of Paul Iribe. In 1912 André Vera published an essay in the magazine ''L'Art Décoratif'' calling for a return to the craftsmanship and materials of earlier centuries, and using a new repertoire of forms taken from nature, particularly baskets and garlands of fruit and flowers. A second tendency of Art Deco, also from 1910 to 1920, was inspired by the bright colors of the artistic movement known as the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] and by the colorful costumes and sets of the Ballets Russes. This style was often expressed with exotic materials such as sharkskin, mother of pearl, ivory, tinted leather, lacquered and painted wood, and decorative inlays on furniture that emphasized its geometry. This period of the style reached its high point in the 1925 Paris Exposition of Decorative Arts. In the late 1920s and the 1930s, the decorative style changed, inspired by new materials and technologies. It became sleeker and less ornamental. Furniture, like architecture, began to have rounded edges and to take on a polished, streamlined look, taken from the streamline modern style. New materials, such as chrome-plated steel, aluminum and [[bakelite]], an early form of plastic, began to appear in furniture and decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Explanatory text on Art Deco in the Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Art Deco period, and particularly in the 1930s, the motifs of the decor expressed the function of the building. Theaters were decorated with sculpture which illustrated music, dance, and excitement; power companies showed sunrises, the Chrysler building showed stylized hood ornaments; The friezes of Palais de la Porte Dorée at the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition showed the faces of the different nationalities of French colonies. The Streamline style made it appear that the building itself was in motion. The WPA murals of the 1930s featured ordinary people; factory workers, postal workers, families and farmers, in place of classical heroes.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=250}}

French furniture from 1910 until the early 1920s was largely an updating of French traditional furniture styles, and the art nouveau designs of [[Louis Majorelle]], [[Charles Plumet]] and other manufacturers. French furniture manufacturers felt threatened by the growing popularity of German manufacturers and styles, particularly the [[Biedermeier]] style, which was simple and clean-lined. The French designer Frantz Jourdain, the President of the Paris Salon d'Automne, invited designers from Munich to participate in the 1910 Salon. French designers saw the new German style, and decided to meet the German challenge. The French designers decided to present new French styles in the Salon of 1912. The rules of the Salon indicated that only modern styles would be permitted. All of the major French furniture designers took part in Salon: Paul Follot, Paul Iribe, Maurice Dufrene, André Groult, André Mare and Louis Suë took part, presenting new works that updated the traditional French styles of Louis XVI and [[Louis Philippe]] with more angular corners inspired by Cubism and brighter colors inspired by Fauvism and the Nabis.{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=91-93}}

The painter André Mare and furniture designer [[Louis Suë]] both participated the 1912 Salon. After the war the two men joined together to form their own company, formally called the ''Compagnie des Arts Française'', but usually known simply as Suë and Mare. Unlike the prominent art nouveau designers like Louis Majorelle, who personally designed every piece, they assembled a team of skilled craftsmen and produced complete interior designs, including furniture, glassware, carpets, ceramics, wallpaper and lighting. Their work featured bright colors and furniture and fine woods, such ebony encrusted with mother of pearl, abalone and silvered metal to create bouquets of flowers. They designed everything from the interiors of ocean liners to perfume bottles for the label of [[Jean Patou]].The firm prospered in the early 1920s, but the two men were better craftsmen than businessmen. The firm was sold in 1928, and both men left.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=51}}

The most prominent furniture designer at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition was Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann, from Alsace. He first exhibited his works at the 1913 Autumn Salon, then had his own pavilion, the "House of the Rich Collector", at the 1925 Exposition. He used only most rare and expensive materials, including [[ebony]], [[mahogany]], [[rosewood]], [[Ambon Island|ambon]] and other exotic woods, decorated with inlays of ivory, tortoise shell, mother of pearl, Little pompoms of silk decorated the handles of drawers of the cabinets.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=15}} His furniture was based upon 18th-century models, but simplified and reshaped. In all of his work, the interior structure of the furniture was completely concealed. The framework usually of oak, was completely covered with an overlay of thin strips of wood, then covered by a second layer of strips of rare and expensive woods. This was then covered with a veneer and polished, so that the piece looked as if it had been cut out of a single block of wood. Contrast to the dark wood was provided by inlays of ivory, and ivory key plates and handles. According to Ruhlmann, armchairs had to be designed differently according to the functions of the rooms where they appeared; living room armchairs were designed to be welcoming, office chairs comfortable, and salon chairs voluptuous. Only a small number of pieces of each design of furniture was made, and the average price of one of his beds or cabinets was greater than the price of an average house.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=56}}

[[Jules Leleu]] was a traditional furniture designer who moved smoothly into Art Deco in the 1920s; he designed the furniture for the dining room of the [[Élysée Palace]], and for the first-class cabins of the steamship ''Normandie''. his style was characterized by the use of ebony, Macassar wood, walnut, with decoration of plaques of ivory and mother of pearl. He introduced the style of lacquered art deco furniture at the end of in the late 1920s, and in the late 1930s introduced furniture made of metal with panels of smoked glass.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=18-19}} In Italy, the designer [[Gio Ponti]] was famous for his streamlined designs.

The costly and exotic furniture of Ruhlmann and other traditionalists infuriated modernists, including the architect Le Corbusier, causing him to write a famous series of articles denouncing the ''arts décoratif'' style. He attacked furniture made only for the rich, and called upon designers to create furniture made with inexpensive materials and modern style, which ordinary people could afford. He designed his own chairs, created to be inexpensive and mass-produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dsgn2/hd_dsgn2.htm Alexandra Griffith Winton, ''Design, 1925–50''. The Metropolitain Museum of Art, Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, furniture designs adapted to the form, with smoother surfaces and curved forms. The masters of the late style included Donald Deskey was one of the most influential designers; he created the interior of the Radio City Music Hall. He used a mixture of traditional and very modern materials, including aluminum, chrome, and bakelite, an early form of plastic.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=36}} The [[Waterfall style]] was popular the 1930s and 1940s, the most prevalent Art Deco form of furniture at the time. Pieces were typically of plywood finished with blond veneer and with rounded edges, resembling a waterfall.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Dan|title=Furniture of the Jazz Age|journal=Old-House Interiors|publisher=William J.

Streamline was a variety of Art Deco which emerged during the mid-1930s. It was influenced by modern [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] principles developed for aviation and [[ballistics]] to reduce aerodynamic drag at high velocities. The bullet shapes were applied by designers to cars, trains, ships, and even objects not intended to move, such as [[refrigerator]]s, [[Fuel dispenser|gas pumps]], and buildings.&lt;ref name="Design: A Concise History" /&gt; One of the first production vehicles in this style was the [[Chrysler Airflow]] of 1933. It was unsuccessful commercially, but the beauty and functionality of its design set a precedent; meant modernity. It continued to be used in car design well after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gartman |first=David |title=Auto Opium |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |pages=122–124 | isbn=978-0-415-10572-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.phxart.org/exhibition/exhibitioncurves.aspx |title=Curves of Steel: Streamlined Automobile Design |publisher=Phoenix Art Museum |year=2007 | accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Armi |first=C.

New industrial materials began to influence design of cars and household objects. These included [[aluminum]], [[chrome plating|chrome]], and bakelite, an early form of plastic. Bakelite could be easily molded into different forms, and soon was used in telephones, radios and other appliances.

Ocean liners also adopted a style of Art Deco, known in French as the ''Style Paquebot'', or "Ocean Liner Style". The most famous example was the SS ''Normandie'', which made its first transatlantic trip in 1935. It was designed particularly to bring wealthy Americans to Paris to shop. The cabins and salons featured the latest Art Deco furnishings and decoration. The Grand Salon of the ship, which was the restaurant for first-class passengers, was bigger than the Hall of Mirrors of the [[Palace of Versailles]]. It was illuminated by electric lights within twelve pillars of Lalique crystal; thirty-six matching pillars lined the walls. This was one of the earliest examples of illumination being directly integrated into architecture. The style of ships was soon adapted to buildings. A notable example is found on the San Francisco waterfront, where the Maritime Museum building, built as a public bath in 1937, resembles a ferryboat, with ship railings and rounded corners. The Star Ferry Terminal in Hong Kong also used a variation of the style.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Art Deco influenced fashion with a combination of geometric shapes, avant-garde style and luxury in clothing such as works of [[Paul Poiret]], [[Charles Worth]] and [[Jean Patou]]. In the 1920s, designers were inspired by the stage sets of the [[Ballets Russes]], fabric designs and costumes from [[Léon Bakst]] and creations by the [[Wiener Werkstätte]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, designers including René Lalique and Cartier tried reduce the traditional dominance of [[diamonds]] by introducing more colorful gemstones, such as small emeralds, rubies and sapphires. They also placed greater emphasis on very elaborate and elegant settings, featuring less-expensive materials such as enamel, glass, horn and ivory. Diamonds themselves were cut in less traditional forms; the 1925 Exposition saw a large number of diamonds cut in the form of tiny rods or matchsticks. The settings for diamonds also changed; More and more often jewelers used [[platinum]] instead of gold, since it was strong and flexible, and could set clusters of stones. Jewelers also began to use more dark materials, such as enamels and black [[onyx]], which provided a higher contrast with diamonds.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=121-123}}

Jewelry became much more colorful and varied in style. Cartier and the firm of Boucheron combined diamonds with colorful other gemstones cut into the form of leaves, fruit or flowers, to make brooches, rings, earrings, clips and pendants. Far Eastern themes also became popular; plaques of jade and coral were combined with platinum and diamonds, and vanity cases, cigarette cases and powder boxes were decorated with Japanese and Chinese landscapes made with mother of pearl, enamel and lacquer.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=121-123}}

Rapidly changing fashions in clothing brought new styles of jewelry. Sleeveless dresses of the 1920s meant that arms needed decoration, and designers quickly created bracelets of gold, silver and platinum encrusted with lapis-lazuli, onyx, coral, and other colorful stones; Other bracelets were intended for the upper arms, and several bracelets were often worn at the same time. The short haircuts of women in the twenties called for elaborate deco earring designs. As women began to smoke in public, designers created very ornate cigarette cases and ivory cigarette holders. The invention of the wrist-watch before World War I inspired jewelers to create extraordinary decorated watches, encrusted with diamonds and plated with enamel, gold and silver. Pendant watches, hanging from a ribbon, also became fashionable.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}}

The established jewelry houses of Paris in the period, Cartier, [[Chaumet]], Georges Fouquet, [[Mauboussin]], and [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]] all created jewelry and objects in the new fashion. The firm of Chaumet made highly geometric cigarette boxes, cigarette lighters, pillboxes and notebooks, made of hard stones decorated with [[jade]], [[lapis lazuli]], diamonds and sapphires. They were joined by many young new designers, each with his own idea of deco. [[Raymond Templier]] designed pieces with highly intricate geometric patterns, including silver earrings that looked like skyscrapers. [[Gerard Sandoz]] was only 18 when he started to design jewelry in 1921; he designed many celebrated pieces based on the smooth and polished look of modern machinery. The glass designer René Lalique also entered the field, creating pendants of fruit, flowers, frogs, fairies or mermaids made of sculpted glass in bright colors, hanging on cords of silk with tassels.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}} The jeweler [[Paul Brandt]] contrasted rectangular and triangular patterns, and embedded pearls in lines on onyx plaques. [[Jean Despres]] made necklaces of contrasting colors by bringing together silver and black lacquer, or gold with lapis lazuli. Many of his designs looked like highly polished pieces of machines. [[Jean Dunand]] was also inspired by modern machinery, combined with bright reds and blacks contrasting with polished metal.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}}

Like the Art Nouveau period before it, Art Deco was an exceptional period for fine glass and other decorative objects, designed to fit their architectural surroundings. The most famous producer of glass objects was René Lalique, whose works, from vases to hood ornaments for automobiles, became symbols of the period. He had made ventures into glass before World War I, designing bottles for the perfumes of [[François Coty]], but he did not begin serious production of art glass until after World War I. In 1918, at the age of 58, he bought a large glass works in Combs-la-Ville and began to manufacture both artistic and practical glass objects. He treated glass as a form of sculpture, and created statuettes, vases, bowls, lamps and ornaments. He used demi-crystal rather than lead crystal, which was softer and easier to form, though not as lustrous. He sometimes used colored glass, but more often used opalescent glass, where part or the whole of the outer surface was stained with a wash. Lalique provided the decorative glass panels, lights and illuminated glass ceilings for the ocean liners [[SS Ile de France|SS ''Ile de France'']] in 1927 and the SS ''Normandie'' in 1935, and for some of the first-class sleeping cars of the French railroads. At the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, he had his own pavilion, designed a dining room with a table settling and matching glass ceiling for the Sèvres Pavilion, and designed a glass fountain for the courtyard of the Cours des Métier, a slender glass column which spouted water from the sides and was illuminated at night.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}

Other notable Art Deco glass manufacturers included Marius-Ernest Sabino, who specialized in figurines, vases, bowls, and glass sculptures of fish, nudes, and animals. For these he often used an opalescent glass which could change from white to blue to amber, depending upon the light. His vases and bowls featured molded friezes of animals, nudes or busts of women with fruit or flowers. His work was less subtle but more colorful than that of Lalique.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}

Other notable Deco glass designers included Edmond Etling, who also used bright opalescent colors, often with geometric patterns and sculpted nudes; Albert Simonet, and Aristide Colotte and [[Maurice Marinot]], who was known for his deeply etched sculptural bottles and vases. The firm of [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] from the city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], which had been famous for its Art Nouveau glass, produced a line of Deco vases and glass sculpture, solid, geometric and chunky in form. More delicate multicolored works were made by [[Gabriel Argy-Rousseau]], who produced delicately colored vases with sculpted butterflies and nymphs, and Francois Decorchemont, whose vases were streaked and marbled.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}

The Great Depression ruined a large part of the decorative glass industry, which depended upon wealthy clients. Some artists turned to designing stained glass windows for churches. In 1937, the [[Steuben Glass Works|Steuben]] glass company began the practice of commissioning famous artists to produce glassware.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}} [[Louis Majorelle]], famous for his Art Nouveau furniture, designed a remarkable Art Deco stained glass window portraying steel workers for the offices of the [[Aciéries de Longwy]], a steel mill in [[Longwy]], France.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Art Deco artists produced a wide variety of practical objects in the Art Deco style, made of industrial materials from traditional wrought iron to chrome-plated steel. The American artist [[Norman Bel Geddes]] designed a cocktail set resembling a skyscraper made of chrome-plated steel. Raymond Subes designed an elegant metal grille for the entrance of the Palais de la Porte Dorée, the centerpiece of the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition. The French sculptor Jean Dunand produced magnificent doors on the theme "The Hunt", covered with gold leaf and paint on plaster (1935).{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=71-81}}

==Art Deco architecture around the world==
Art Deco architecture began in Europe, but by 1939 there were examples in large cities on every continent and in almost every country. This is a selection of prominent buildings on each continent. (For a comprehensive of existing buildings by country, see [[List of Art Deco architecture]].)

A large number of the Art Deco buildings in Asia were designed by European architects, but in the Philippines local architect [[Juan Nakpil]] was preeminent. Many Art Deco landmarks in Asia were demolished during the great economic expansion of Asia the late 20th century, but some notable enclaves of the architecture still remain, particularly in [[Shanghai]] and [[Mumbai]].

In Canada, surviving Art Deco structures are mainly in the major cities; [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and [[Vancouver]]. They range from public buildings like [[Vancouver City Hall]] to commercial buildings ([[College Park (Toronto)|College Park]]) to public works ([[R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant]]).
File:Edificios La Nacional I y II.JPG | La Nacional Buildings [[Mexico City]], Mexico (1932)
In [[Mexico]], the most imposing Art Deco example is interior of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] (Palace of Fine Arts), finished in 1934 with its elaborate decor and murals. Examples of Art Deco residential architecture can be found in the [[Condesa]] neighborhood, many designed by [[Francisco J. Serrano]].

In the United States, Art Deco buildings are found from coast to coast, in all the major cities. It was most widely used for office buildings, train stations, airport terminals, and movie theaters; residential buildings are rare. In the 1930s, the more austere streamline style became popular. Many buildings were demolished between 1945 and the late 1960s, but then efforts began to protect the best examples. The City of Miami Beach established the [[Miami Beach Architectural District]] to preserve the colorful collection of Art Deco buildings found there.

The architectural style first appeared in Paris with the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1910–13) by Auguste Perret but then spread rapidly around Europe, until examples could be found in nearly every large city, from London to Moscow. In Germany two variations of Art Deco flourished in the 1920s and 30s: The [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neue Sachlichkeit]] style and [[Expressionist architecture]]. Notable examples include Erich Mendelsohn's Mossehaus and [[Schaubühne]] theater in [[Berlin]], [[Fritz Höger]]'s [[Chilehaus]] in [[Hamburg]] and his [[Kirche am Hohenzollernplatz]] in Berlin, the Anzeiger Tower in [[Hannover]] and the Borsig Tower in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Kathleen|title=Erich Mendelsohn and the Architecture of German Modernism|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521571685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest Art Deco buildings in Western Europe is the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in Koekelberg, Brussels. In 1925, architect Albert van Huffel won the Grand Prize for Architecture with his scale model of the basilica at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basilicakoekelberg.be/documents/home.xml?lang=en |title=Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Koekelberg |publisher=Basilicakoekelberg.be |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain and Portugal have some striking examples of Art Deco buildings, particularly movie theaters. Examples in Portugal are the Capitólio Theater (1931) and the Éden Cine-Theater (1937) in [[Lisbon]], the [[Rivoli Theatre (Portugal)|Rivoli Theater]] (1937) and the [[Coliseu do Porto|Coliseu]] (1941) in [[Porto]] and the Rosa Damasceno Theater (1937) in [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]]. An example in Spain is the Cine Rialto in Valencia (1939).

During the 1930s, Art Deco had a noticeable effect on house design in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style" /&gt; as well as the design of various public buildings.&lt;ref name="Design Handbook" /&gt; Straight, white-rendered house frontages rising to flat roofs, sharply geometric door surrounds and tall windows, as well as convex-curved metal corner windows, were all characteristic of that period.&lt;ref name="Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm |title=Art Deco Buildings |year=2007 |publisher=london-footprints.co.uk |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211074839/http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm |archivedate=11 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php |title=Art Deco in Frinton on sea |year=2006 |publisher=Art Deco Classics |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201132519/http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php |archivedate=1 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[London Underground]] is famous for many examples of Art Deco architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00npm4g/Art_Deco_Icons_London_Transport |title=Four Programmes – Art Deco Icons |publisher=BBC |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are a number of buildings in the style situated along the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Golden Mile]] in Brentford. Also in West London is the Hoover Building, which was originally built for [[The Hoover Company]] and was converted into a superstore in the early 1990s.

===India===
{{See also|Art Deco in Mumbai}}

The Indian Institute of Architects, founded in Bombay in 1929, played a prominent role in propagating the Art Deco movement. In November 1937, this institute organized the ‘Ideal Home Exhibition’ held in the Town Hall in Bombay which spanned over 12 days and attracted about one hundred thousand visitors. As a result, it was declared a success by the 'Journal of the Indian Institute of Architects'. The exhibits displayed the ‘ideal’, or better described as the most ‘modern’ arrangements for various parts of the house, paying close detail to avoid architectural blunders and present the most efficient and well-thought-out models. The exhibition focused on various elements of a home ranging from furniture, elements of interior decoration as well as radios and refrigerators using new and scientifically relevant materials and methods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mumbai Fables|last=Prakash|first=Gyan|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780691142845|location=|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guided by their desire to emulate the west, the Indian architects were fascinated by the industrial modernity that Art Deco offered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The western elites were the first to experiment with the technologically advanced facets of Art Deco, and architects began the process of transformation by the early 1930s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bombay’s expanding port commerce in the 1930s resulted in the growth of educated middle class population. It also saw an increase of people migrating to Bombay in search of job opportunities. This led to the pressing need for new developments through Land Reclamation Schemes and construction of new public and residential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33153751|title=Bombay : the cities within|last=Sharada.|first=Dwivedi,|date=1995|publisher=India Book House|others=Mehrotra, Rahul., Mulla-Feroze, Umaima.|isbn=818502880X|location=Bombay|oclc=33153751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallelly, the changing political climate in the country and the aspirational quality of the Art Deco aesthetics led to a whole-hearted acceptance of the building style in the city’s development. Most of the buildings from this period can be seen spread throughout the city neighbourhoods in areas such as Churchgate, Colaba, Fort, Mohammed Ali Road, Cumbala Hill, Dadar, Matunga, Bandra and Chembur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300923025|title=Bombay Deco|last=Sharada.|first=Dwivedi,|date=2008|publisher=Eminence Designs|others=Mehrotra, Rahul., Gobhai, Noshir.|year=|isbn=8190382152|location=Mumbai|pages=|oclc=300923025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artdecomumbai.com/inventory/|title=Inventory {{!}} Art Deco|website=www.artdecomumbai.com|language=en-US|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Deco in South America is present especially at the countries that received a great wave of immigration on the first half of the 20th century, with notable works at their richest cities, like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in [[Brazil]] and Buenos Aires in [[Argentina]].The [[Kavanagh building]] in [[Buenos Aires]] (1934), by Sánchez, Lagos and de la Torre, was the tallest reinforced concrete structure when it was completed, and a notable example of late Art Deco style.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In many cities, efforts have been made to protect the remaining Art Deco buildings. In many U.S. cities, historic art deco movie theaters have been preserved and turned into cultural centers. Even more modest art deco buildings have been preserved as part of America's architectural heritage; an art deco cafe and gas station along Route 66 in Shamrock, Texas is an historic monument. The Miami Beach Architectural District protects several hundred old buildings, and requires that new buildings comply with the style. In [[Havana]], Cuba, a large number of Art Deco buildings have badly deteriorated. Efforts are underway to bring the buildings back to their original color and appearance.

In the 21st century, modern variants of Art Deco, called Neo Art Deco (or Neo-Art Deco), have appeared in some American cities, inspired by the classic Art Deco buildings of the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="Capitman"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0525934421 Barbara B.

'''Arts and letters''' is a traditional term for the [[fine arts]] and [[literature]] considered together. The category defined as "arts and letters" may also include the [[performing arts]], [[visual arts]], or [[liberal arts]].

==History==
By the late 19th century the term was used to name a few arts-related institutions in the [[United States]]. A [[subscription]]-based Theatre of Arts and Letters opened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1892, but closed within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last =Atherton | first =Gertrude | authorlink =Gertrude Atherton
 | title =The Theatre of Arts and Letters
 | journal =The Californian
 | volume = 5 | issue = 4
 | pages = 580–585
 | date = March 1893
 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g2gCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA580
 | accessdate = 11 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
| last=Hatlen | first=Theodore 
| title=The Independent Theatre Movement in New York, 1890-1900
| journal=Educational Theatre Journal
| volume=15 | issue=2 
| date=May 1963
| pages=136–142
| jstor=3204417
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] was founded in 1904.

The term has also figured in [[higher education]]. For example, by 1889 students at [[Swarthmore College]] were sorted into two categories of study: "Arts and Letters" or "Science and Engineering."&lt;ref&gt;''Twenty-first Annual Catalogue of Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa., 1889-90''. Philadelphia: Press of Friends' Book Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, course requirements at the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences have included a "sector" (category) called "Arts and Letters." The college defines the sector as including "visual arts, literature and music, together with the criticism surrounding them."&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences, ''The College Curriculum''  http://www.college.upenn.edu/curriculum/2010/sectors.php, accessed 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="949">'''Bond paper''' is a high quality durable [[writing paper]] similar to [[bank paper]] but having a [[Paper density|weight]] greater than 50&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The most common weights are 60&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (16&amp;nbsp;lb), 75&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (20&amp;nbsp;lb) and 90 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (24&amp;nbsp;lb). The name comes from its having originally been made for documents such as [[government bond]]s. It is now used for [[letterhead]]s and other [[stationery]] and as paper for electronic [[Computer printer|printers]]. Widely employed for graphic work involving pencil, pen and felt-tip marker, bond paper can sometimes contain rag fibre pulp, which produces a stronger, though rougher, sheet of paper.

'''''Chadam''''' is an animated web series by artist [[Alex Pardee]] based on characters he created for a number of [[The Used]]'s album artwork and distributed by [[The WB]] and [[Alex Pardee|Eye Suck Ink]]. ''Chadam'' is produced by [[Jason "Jace" Hall]] of HDFILMS Inc. The short series premiered June 15, 2010 on TheWB.com. [[The WB]] and its children's network, [[Kids WB!]] is closed, but the website is still open. ''Chadam'' appeared on the cover of ''[[Lies for the Liars]]''. The episodes are nearly 4 to 5 minutes long. [[iTunes]] has the episodes in a collection called ''Chadam, the Complete Series''. [[iTunes]] episodes are nearly the 13 minute mark because two short episodes are built into one, for example, "Cut from Cardboard" and "Ripley, Believe It or Not" are put together as "The Awakening".

Hall pushed the boundaries of traditional filmmaking by using a computer game engine, [[Unreal Engine 3]], in order to meet the challenge of animating Pardee's surreal work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hsu | first = Jeremy | title = Gaming Software Offers Cheap Alternative to Hollywood Animation Tools | work = InnovationNewsDaily | date = 2011-04-13 | url = http://www.innovationnewsdaily.com/games-take-aim-big-budget-hollywood-animation-1893/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Ofili''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} known as '''Chris Ofili''' (born 10 October 1968), is a [[Nigerian British]] [[Turner Prize]]-winning painter who is best known for his paintings incorporating elephant dung. He was one of the [[Young British Artists]]. Since 2005, Ofili has been living and working in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], where he currently resides in [[Port of Spain]]. He also lives and works in [[London]] and [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;[[Calvin Tomkins]] (6 October 2014), [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/06/unknown-6 "Into the Unknown: Chris Ofili returns to New York with a major retrospective"], ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Ofili was born in [[Manchester]] to May and Michael Ofili. When he was eleven, his father left the family and moved back to [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; Ofili was for some years educated at St. Pius X High School for Boys, and then at [[Xaverian College]] in [[Victoria Park, Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/artist/12782/chris-ofili.html Chris Ofili Brief biography] on ham. Retrieval Date: 26 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ofili completed a foundation course in art at [[Tameside College]] in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] in Greater Manchester&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; and then studied in [[London]], at the [[Chelsea School of Art]] from 1988 to 1991 and at the [[Royal College of Art]] from 1991 to 1993. In the fall of 1992, he got a one-year exchange scholarship to [[Berlin University of the Arts|Universität der Künste Berlin]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

Ofili visited [[Trinidad]] for the first time in 2000, when he was invited by an international art trust to attend a painting workshop in Port of Spain.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; He permanently moved to Trinidad in 2005. He lives with his wife Roba, former singer with [[trip-hop]] band [[Attica Blues (band)|Attica Blues]],&lt;ref name="Attica"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mowaxplease.com/exclusive-an-interview-with-charlie-dark-of-attica-blues/ | title=AN INTERVIEW WITH CHARLIE DARK OF ATTICA BLUES | publisher=Mo Wax Please | accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he married in 2002.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; He maintains a studio on Lady Chancellor Road, about ten minutes from downtown Port of Spain, in Trinidad.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

==Career==
Ofili's early work was heavily influenced by [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Georg Baselitz]], [[Philip Guston]], and [[George Condo]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; [[Peter Doig]] was doing graduate work at the [[Chelsea College of Arts]] when Ofili was an undergraduate, and they soon became friends.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; In 2014, art critic [[Roberta Smith]] held that Ofili has much in common with painters like [[Mickalene Thomas]], [[Kerry James Marshall]], [[Robert Colescott]] and [[Ellen Gallagher]], and with more distant precedents such as [[Bob Thompson (painter)|Bob Thompson]], [[Beauford Delaney]] and [[William Johnson (artist)|William H. Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (October 30, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/arts/design/chris-ofili-night-and-day-a-survey-at-the-new-museum.html "Medium and Message, Both Unsettling: ‘Chris Ofili: Night and Day,’ a Survey at the New Museum"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ofili was established through exhibitions by [[Charles Saatchi]] at his gallery in north London and the travelling exhibition ''[[Sensation exhibition|Sensation]]'' (1997), becoming recognised as one of the few British artists of African / Caribbean descent to break through as a member of the [[Young British Artists]] group. Ofili has also had numerous solo shows since the early 1990s, including at the [[Serpentine Gallery]]. In 1998, Ofili won the [[Turner Prize]], and in 2003 he was selected to represent Britain at the [[Venice Biennale]] of that year, where his work for the British Pavilion was done in collaboration with the architect [[David Adjaye]].

In 1992 he won a scholarship that allowed him to travel to [[Zimbabwe]]. Ofili studied [[cave painting]]s there, which had some effect on his style.

Between 1995 and 2005, Ofili focused on a series of watercolors, each about 9½ by 6½ inches and produced in a single sitting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kimmelman]] (May 8, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/arts/design/08kimm.html "Wake Up. Wash Face. Do Routine. Now Paint"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; They predominantly feature heads of men and women, as well as some studies of flowers and birds.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Carol Vogel (5 May 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/05/arts/05ofil.html "An Artist's Gallery of Ideas: Chris Ofili's Watercolors"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ofili's paintings also make reference to [[blaxploitation]] films and [[gangsta rap]], seeking to question racial and sexual stereotypes in a humorous way. In a series of faces that Ofili called ''Harems'', each arrangement consists of one man with as many as four women on each side of him.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Ofili's work is often built up in layers of paint, resin, glitter, dung (mainly elephant) and other materials to create a [[collage]]. Though Ofili's detractors often state that he "splatters"&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20000227/ai_n14292995 ''The Independent'', February 27, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; elephant [[Feces|dung]] on his pictures, this is inaccurate: he sometimes applies it directly to the canvas in the form of dried spherical lumps, and sometimes, in the same form, uses it as varnished foot-like supports on which the paintings stand.

Ofili has been founder and prime mover behind the short-lived ''Freeness Project''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A5861432 ''Free stuff''] by James Cowdery, 22 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This project involved the coming together of artists, producers and musicians of minority ethnic groups (Asian and African) in an attempt to expose the music that may be unheard in other spaces. Freeness allowed the creativity of unsigned contemporary British ethnic minority artists to be heard. The result of months of tours to 10 cities in the UK resulted in ''Freeness Volume 1'' - a compilation of works that were shown during the tour.

After relocating to Trinidad in 2005, Ofili began a series of blue paintings inspired by the ''Jab Jab'' or "blue devils" who participate in the [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]], and the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] group of German and Russian artists, ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]].'' These paintings often employed the use of a silver, acrylic background with layers of dark oil pigment on top.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://db-artmag.de/archiv/2006/e/4/2/448.html|title=db artmag - all the news on Deutsche Bank Art / db artmag - alle Infos zur Kunst der Deutschen Bank|last=www.absoluto.de|first=martin weise //|website=db-artmag.de|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/28/chris-ofilis-blue-devils-black-men-police|title=Chris Ofili's Blue Devils: between black men and the police|last=Ryder|first=Matthew|date=2014-10-28|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later iterations of these works were shown at Ofili's solo show ''Chris Ofili: Day and Night'' at [[New Museum|The New Museum of New York]] which were installed in a very dimly lit room, causing viewers to adjust their eyes to the darkness in order to see the paintings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/chris-ofili|title=Chris Ofili: Night and Day|website=www.newmuseum.org|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ofili was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[2017 New Year Honours]] for services to art.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61803 |supp=y|page=N9|date=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Ofili's work was featured in a museum in the 1995 exhibition ''Brilliant! New Art from London'' at the [[Walker Art Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.walkerart.org/item/object/8782 Chris Ofili, Third Eye Vision (1999)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506003109/http://collections.walkerart.org/item/object/8782 |date=6 May 2011 }} [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt; Significant solo exhibitions include the [[Arts Club of Chicago]] (2010), [[Kestnergesellschaft]], [[Hanover]] (2006), the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]], New York (2005), and Southampton City Art Gallery (1998). In 2010, [[Tate Britain]] presented the most extensive exhibition of his work to date.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Glover, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/shock-and-awe-the-art-of-chris-ofili-1874739.html "Shock and awe: The art of Chris Ofili"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 22 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Searle]] (25 January 2010), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jan/25/chris-ofili-tate?intcmp=239 "Chris Ofili heads into the shadows"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[New Museum|The New Museum in New York]] presented the first, major solo show of Ofili's work in the U.S. titled ''Chris Ofili: Night and Day''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Controversy==

===''The Holy Virgin Mary''===
One of his paintings, ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'', a depiction of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], was at issue in a lawsuit between the mayor of [[New York City]], [[Rudy Giuliani]], and the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art]] when it was exhibited there in 1999 as a part of the [[Sensation exhibition|"Sensation"]] exhibit. The painting depicted a [[Black Madonna]] surrounded by images from [[blaxploitation]] movies and close-ups of female genitalia cut from pornographic magazines, and elephant dung.&lt;ref&gt;Will Bennett, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1385616/Elephant-dung-artist-gives-a-little-back.html "Elephant dung artist gives a little back"], ''The Telegraph'', 22 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These were formed into shapes reminiscent of the [[cherubim]] and [[seraphim]] commonly depicted in images of the [[Immaculate Conception]] and the [[Assumption of Mary]]. Following the scandal surrounding this painting, [[Bernard Goldberg]] ranked Ofili No. 86 in ''[[100 People Who Are Screwing Up America]]''. [[Red Grooms]] showed his support of the artist by purchasing one of Ofili's paintings in 1999, even after Giuliani famously exclaimed, "There’s nothing in the First Amendment that supports horrible and disgusting projects!”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Red Grooms’s Chris Ofili Drawing | author=Robert Ayers | publisher=ARTINFO | date= 20 November 2007| url= http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/26119/red-groomss-chris-ofili-drawing/| accessdate=17 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was owned by [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]] and was on display at the [[Museum of Old and New Art]] in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Collector |author=Gabriella Coslovich |publisher=[[The Age]] |date=14 April 2007 |url=http://moorilla.com.au/files/pdf/thecollector.pdf/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710060657/http://moorilla.com.au/files/pdf/thecollector.pdf/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven A. Cohen then owned it for three years and donated the painting to the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/28/giuliani-vs-the-virgin|title=Giuliani vs. the Virgin|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Upper Room'' and the Tate Gallery===
{{main|Tate's purchase of The Upper Room}}
''The Upper Room'' is an installation of 13 paintings of [[rhesus macaque]] monkeys by Ofili in a specially designed room. It was bought by the [[Tate Gallery]] in 2005 and caused controversy as Ofili was on the board of the Tate Trustees at the time of the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Higgins, [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1823781,00.html "How the Tate broke the law"], ''The Guardian'', 19 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the [[Charity Commission]] censured the Tate for this purchase.

==Art market==
His ''Orgena'', a glittery portrait of a black woman created by the artist for his Turner Prize-winning exhibit at the Tate in 1998 was sold to an American collector for a record GBP 1.8 million, over its GBP 1 million high estimate, at [[Christie's]] London in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Crow (1 July 2010), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703426004575339413012478790 "Christie's Sells Warhol 'Silver Liz' for GBP 6.8 Million"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, art collector [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]] sold Ofili’s 8-foot-tall ''The Holy Virgin Mary'' for 2.9 million pounds at [[Christie’s]].&lt;ref&gt;Katya Kazakina (June 30, 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-30/giuliani-blasted-madonna-with-dung-art-sells-for-4-6-million Ofili’s Madonna Sets Record at Christie’s $150.3 Million Sale], ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Academy of Classical Design ~ Cast Hall.jpg|thumb|300px|Academy of Classical Design, Cast Studio - Southern Pines, NC.]]
'''Classical Realism''' refers to an artistic movement in late-20th and early 21st century in which [[drawing]] and [[painting]] place a high value upon [[skill]] and [[beauty]], combining elements of 19th-century [[neoclassicism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]].

==Origins==

[[Image:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. ''[[Pollice Verso]]'' (1872). Classical Realism traces its lineage from Gérôme.]]

The term "Classical Realism" first appeared as a description of literary style, as in an 1882 criticism of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s poetry.&lt;ref&gt;S. Birch, ''The Educational Times''. Vol. 35, No. 249, January 1, 1882, page 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage relating to the visual arts dates back to at least 1905 in a reference to [[Masaccio]]'s paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Arthur; Blacker; Carlos; Slater, William Albert. ''Paintings of the Louvre, Italian and Spanish'', Doubleday, 1905, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It originated as the title of a contemporary but traditional artistic movement with Richard Lack (1928–2009), who was a pupil of Boston artist [[R. H. Ives Gammell]] (1893–1981) during the early 1950s. Ives Gammell had studied with [[William McGregor Paxton]] (1869–1941) and Paxton had studied with 19th-century French artist, [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904). In 1967 Lack established Atelier Lack, a studio-school of fine art patterned after the ateliers of 19th-century Paris and the teaching of the Boston impressionists. By 1980 he had trained a significant group of young painters. In 1982, they organized a traveling exhibition of their work and that of other artists within the artistic tradition represented by Gammell, Lack and their students. Lack was asked by Vern Swanson, director of the [[Springville Museum of Art]], [[Springville, Utah]], (the exhibition's originating venue), to coin a term that would differentiate the realism of the heirs of the Boston tradition from that of other representational artists. Although he was reluctant to label this work, Lack chose the expression "Classical Realism." It was first used in the title of that exhibition: ''Classical Realism: The Other Twentieth Century''. The term, "Classical Realism", was originally intended to describe work that combined the fine drawing and design of the European academic tradition as exemplified by Gérôme with the observed color values of the American Boston tradition as exemplified by Paxton.

In 1985 Atelier Lack began publishing the ''Classical Realism Quarterly'', featuring articles written by Richard Lack and his students to educate and inform the public about traditional representational painting. In 1988 Lack and several associates founded The American Society of Classical Realism, a society organized to preserve and promote fine representational art. The ASCR functioned until 2005 and published the influential ''Classical Realism Journal'' and ''Classical Realism Newsletter.''

In a separate vein, another major contributor to the revival of traditional drawing and painting knowledge is the painter and  art instructor Ted Seth Jacobs (born 1927), who taught students at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] and the New York Academy of Art in New York City.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, Ted Seth.  ''Light for the Artist'',  Watson-Guptill Pubns (June 1988), {{ISBN|0-8230-2768-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their lineage is rooted in the [[Académie Julian]], the Golden Age of Illustration in New York, and the School of Paris. In 1987 Ted Seth Jacobs created his own art school, L'Ecole Albert Defois in Les Cerqueux sous Passavant, France (49).  Many of Jacobs' students such as Anthony Ryder and Jacob Collins became influential teachers and acquired their own student following.&lt;ref name="ryder"&gt;Ryder, Anthony.  ''The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing: A Contemporary Perspective on the Classical Tradition'',  Watson-Guptill; 1st edition (June 1, 1999), {{ISBN|0-8230-0303-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and philosophy==

Classical Realism is characterized by love for the visible world and the great traditions of Western art, including [[Classicism]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and [[Impressionism]].  The movement's aesthetic is Classical in that it exhibits a preference for order, beauty, harmony and completeness; it is Realist because its primary subject matter comes from the representation of nature based on the artist's observation.&lt;ref name="lack"&gt;Gjertson, Stephen.  ''Richard F. Lack: An American Master'',  American Society of Classical Realism: 2001, {{ISBN|0-9636180-3-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists in this genre strive to draw and paint from  the direct observation of nature, and eschew the use of photography or other mechanical aids. In this regard, Classical Realism differs from the art movements of [[Photorealism]] and  [[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]]. Stylistically, classical realists employ methods used by both [[Impressionist]] and [[Academic art]]ists.

Classical Realist painters have attempted to restore curricula of training that develop a sensitive, artistic eye and methods of representing nature that pre-date [[Modern Art]].  They seek to create paintings that are personal, expressive, beautiful, and skillful.  Their subject matter includes all of the traditional categories within Western Art: [[figurative art|figurative]], landscape, portraiture, indoor and outdoor genre and [[still life]] paintings.

A central idea of Classical Realism is the belief that the [[Modern Art]] movements of the 20th century opposed the tenets and production of traditional art and caused a general loss of the skills and methods needed to produce it. Modernism was antagonistic to art as it was conceived by the Greeks, resurrected in the [[Renaissance]], and carried on by the academies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Panero|first=James|title=The New Old School|work=[[The New Criterion]]|volume=25|date=September 2006|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classical Realist artists attempt to revive the idea of art production as it was traditionally understood: mastery of a craft in order to make objects that gratify and ennoble those who see them.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Roger:  "Why the Art World Is a Disaster", ''The New Criterion'', Volume 25, June 2007, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This craftsmanship is then applied to drawing, painting or sculpting contemporary subjects which the artist observes in the modern world.

Like the 19th-century academic models from which it derives inspiration, the movement has drawn criticism for the premium placed upon technical performance, a tendency toward contrived and idealized depictions of the figure, and rhetorical overstatement when applied to epic narrative.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; Maureen Mullarkey of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' referred to the school as "a contemporary style with retro appeal—like Chrysler's PT Cruiser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/nothing-left-to-hide/41413/|author=Maureen Mullarkey|title=Nothing Left To Hide|work=[[New York Sun]]|date=October 12, 2006|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==

The Classical Realist movement is currently sustained through art schools based on the [[Atelier Method]]. Many present-day academies and ateliers follow the [[Charles Bargue]] drawing course. Richard Lack is generally regarded as the founder of the contemporary atelier movement. His school, Atelier Lack, was founded in 1969 and became a model for similar schools.&lt;ref name="atelier"&gt;Aristedes, Juliette.  ''Classical Drawing Atelier: A Contemporary Guide to Traditional Studio Practice'', Watson-Guptill Publications: 2006.  {{ISBN|0-8230-0657-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modern ateliers are founded with the goal of revitalizing art education by reintroducing rigorous training in traditional drawing and painting techniques, employing teaching methodologies that were used in the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. These schools pass on a method of instruction which melds formal [[academic art]] training with the influence of the French [[Impressionists]].

Under the atelier model, art students study in the studio of an established master to learn how to [[drawing|draw]] and [[paint]] with realistic accuracy and an emphasis on rendering form convincingly. The foundation of these programs rests on an intensive study of the human figure, renderings of plaster casts of [[classical sculpture]], and the emulation of their instructors. The goal is to make students adept at observation, theory, and craft while absorbing classical ideals of beauty.&lt;ref name="atelier"/&gt;

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Death of Caesar, the well-known climax of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'']]

The '''climax''' (from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word ''κλῖμαξ'', meaning "staircase" and "ladder") or '''turning point''' of a [[narrative|narrative work]] is its point of highest tension and drama, or it is the time when the action starts during which the solution is given.&lt;ref Name="Herrick"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Robert Herrick |author2=Lindsay Todd Damon  | title = Composition and Rhetoric for Schools  | publisher = Scott, Foresman and Co.  | year=  1902  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 382  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XwABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA382&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1   | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Jefferson Butler Fletcher |author2=George Rice Carpenter  | title = Introduction to Theme-writing  | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon  | year=  1893  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 84  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dP0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax of a story is a [[literary element]].

== Examples ==
The [[punch line]] of a [[joke]] is an analogy for the climax of a fictional narrative, though the absence of any [[falling action]] is an essential difference, which may reflect the nature of [[humor]] as opposed to the nature of [[drama]].

In non-fictional narrative [[genre]]s, even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and "plot" as in works of fiction, the selection of subject matter, degree of detail, and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures, i.e., to construct a dramatization.

In the play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', by the famous Greek playwright, [[Euripides]], the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him. That is the moment that [[Aphrodite]]'s curse is finally fulfilled, and it is the turning point of the play.

== {{anchor|Anti-climax}} Anticlimax ==
An anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial. For example, destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology, teamwork, and weaponry for a climax, but for an anticlimax, it may just require pushing a red button which reads, "Emergency Self-Destruct", or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building. A famous example is the ending of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet [[Earth]], the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism: the common cold virus. Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal, despite what appears to be a turning point for the character.

'''Color-blocking''' is thought of as the exploration of taking colors that are opposites on the color wheel and pairing them together to make interesting and complementary color combinations.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Color-blocking|url=http://blog.blisshomeanddesign.com/2015/06/15/building-blocks-a-brief-history-of-color-blocking/|website=Bliss by Design|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly associated in fashion as a trend that originated from the artwork of Dutch painter, [[Piet Mondrian]]. However, other experts argue whether his artwork is the true origin of color-blocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|first=Ellen|last=Duffer|date=23 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mondriaanmode_door_Yves_St_Laurent_(1966).jpg|thumb|Mondrian dresses by Yves Saint Laurent]]
It’s widely believed by most historians that [[Piet Mondrian]], a turn of the century artist, whose paintings were a collection of stark lines and flat squares, inspired this current color-blocking trend.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mondrian valued simplicity and therefore experimented with how far he could simplify his work, maximizing simplicity while still maintaining recognizable, although abstract, geometric shapes. Mondrian later named this style of painting Neo-Plasticism.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; In Piet Mondrian's Neoplasticism movement, his art directly inspired the fashion world, as well as home décor and baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color Blocking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mondrian is said to be the key figure of the modern art movement, there are others that believe the credit for this trend lies with [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Claude Monet]].&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; However sources report that it is Piet Mondrian who inspired other designers such as [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] to create the famous Mondrian Dresses.&lt;ref name="College Fashion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color-blocking|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Mondrian's aesthetic overtook the fashion world, pop art's materialization in the 50s opened America's eyes to a more vibrant but structured world. [[Pop Art]] incorporated the same clean lines and solid colors that Piet Mondrian's work encompassed. Proponents of the Georges Seurat and Monet origin theory claim that this novel acceptance lead to the color-blocking revolution.&lt;ref name="Origins of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|url=http://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism aesthetic evolved through the decades, coming to include aspects such as synthetic color and a strong imposed structure in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; The color-blocking trend took off in the 60s as fashion designers like Yves Saint Laurent adopted this revolutionary aesthetic. It wasn't long before this new trend was reaching as far as London; the youth of London began wearing ensembles that would come to be known as mod fashion.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mod fashion much resembled the artistic style of Piet Mondrian; mismatched, solid color separates that were composed of blocks in different hues.

As for today color-blocking is more frequently seen in the home as a latest thing in interior design.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Although some argue that color-blocking is a thing in the past, high fashion figures and enthusiasts believe that this retro trend continues to thrive as a result of the hipster generation, whom revive the trend and turn it into something seen as fashion-forward.

==Process==
In the fashion world, the process of color-blocking refers to wearing blocks of colors. Color-blocking is different than how people usually dress because the colors in the outfit are considered louder, or colors that clash. Fashion figures explain color-blocking as wearing multiple articles of solid-colored clothing in a single outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2013/10/15/the-art-of-colorblocking/20743446/?swp=1|title=The art of colorblocking|first=AOL|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional color-blocking consists of putting together two or three different, but complementary colors together in one outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashiondujourdaily.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/color-blocking-101-what-how/|title=Color Blocking 101: What &amp; How|first=FASHION du|last=jour|date=11 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered color-blocking even if the colors are not direct opposites on the color wheel. For example, yellow and orange are right next to each other, but adding purple (a color on the opposite of the wheel) creates a color-blocked outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://achicdirection.com/2011/03/29/what-is-color-blocking/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=achicdirection.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Fashion icons, designers, and figures have developed rules that go along with the art of color-blocking. Basic rules for color-blocking are centered on the colour theory. The colour theory states that there are unwritten rules in color-blocking such as not wearing too many colors together at once, and balancing an outfit with a neutral such as grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|title=Rules of colour blocking - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=21 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Since color-blocking is an abstract form of art, it is easy to create illusions for accentuating body shapes, making people look taller and thinner. Color-blocking provides versatility to clothing that other trends and styles don't provide.&lt;ref name="Rules of Colour blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules of Colour Blocking|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|website=DNA|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior design==
Color-blocking has recently spilled over into home décor and interior design. This trend takes the same idea in home design that is does in fashion: the colors are paired with no concern of matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decorlove.com/color-blocking-in-home-decor-tips-and-inspirations/|title=Color Blocking In Home Decor – Tips And Inspirations|date=23 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the home color-blocking is used mainly in room décor and walls. Décor clashing with each other, or in more mild cases the opposite colors complement each other to provide an interesting and refreshing atmosphere in a room.

'''Comprachicos''' (also '''Comprapequeños''' and '''Cheylas''') is a compound [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[neologism]] meaning "child-buyers", which was coined by [[Victor Hugo]] in his novel ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]''.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite journal

The most common methods said to be used in this practice included stunting children's growth by [[physical restraint]], [[Muzzle (device)|muzzling]] their faces to deform them, slitting their eyes, dislocating their joints, and malforming their bones.&lt;ref name="Hugo"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting dwarfed and deformed adults made their living as [[Charlatan|mountebanks]] or were sold to lords and ladies to be used as pages or [[Jester|court fools]].

==Historical references==
[[Victor Hugo]]'s novel ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]'' is the story of a young aristocrat kidnapped and disfigured by his captors to display a permanent malicious grin. At the opening of the book, Hugo provides a description of the Comprachicos:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Comprachicos worked on man as the Chinese work on trees. A sort of fantastic stunted thing left their hands; it was ridiculous and wonderful. They could touch up a little being with such skill that its father could not have recognized it. Sometimes they left the spine straight and remade the face. Children destined for tumblers had their joints dislocated in a masterly manner; thus gymnasts were made. Not only did the Comprachicos take away his face from the child; they also took away his memory. At least, they took away all they could of it; the child had no consciousness of the mutilation to which he had been subjected. Of burnings by sulphur and incisions by the iron he remembered nothing. The Comprachicos deadened the little patient by means of a stupefying powder which was thought to be magical and which suppressed all pain.&lt;ref name="Hugo" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to research by John Boynton Kaiser in the Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology, "Victor
Hugo has given us a pretty faithful picture of many characteristic details of social England of the 17th century; but the word Comprachicos is used to describe a people whose characteristics are an unhistorical conglomeration of much that was once actual but then obsolete in the history of human society."&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt; Much that seems unimaginable today may have authentic roots in common practices of the seventeenth century.

One of the common creations of the Comprachicos was supposed to be artificial dwarfs, formed "by anointing babies' spines with the grease of bats, moles and dormice" and using drugs such as "dwarf elder, [[knotgrass]], and daisy juice". The conception was known to [[Shakespeare]], as Beatrice K. Otto pointed out, quoting ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last= Otto
|first= Beatrice K.
|title= Fools are Everywhere: The Court Jester Around the World

|accessdate= 2008-04-28
|publisher= [[University Of Chicago Press]]
|isbn= 0-226-64091-4

|origyear= 2001-04-01 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Get you gone, dwarf;&lt;br&gt;You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other means of creating this result were conjectured to include physical stunting by breaking or dislocating bones, and forcible constraint, whereby growth was inhibited for a long enough period to create permanent deformation. Because of the demand for dwarfs and other novelties in the courts of kings at this time, this could have been a profitable occupation.

==Modern references==

The term ''comprachico'' is very uncommonly used in modern English except in reference or allusion to the antiquated folklore {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}, but similar stories do exist in the English speaking world. For instance, a tale circulating since at least the 1980s tells of a [[Japan]]ese bride who disappears during her honeymoon in [[Europe]]; years later her husband discovers she has been abducted, mutilated, and forced to work in a freak show.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara (November 12, 2006). [http://www.snopes.com/weddings/horrors/shanghai.asp "The Shanghai'd Bride"]. Snopes.com. Retrieved March 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Comprachico" has been adopted as a pejorative term used for individuals and entities who manipulate the minds and attitudes of children in a way that will permanently distort their beliefs or worldview. Twentieth-century philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] referred to educators of the time as "the Comprachicos of the mind" in her article "The Comprachicos". Her criticism was targeted especially toward [[Educational progressivism|educational progressivists]], but also grade-school and high-school educators who, in her view, used psychologically harmful methods of education.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn: "The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution", pp. 41–95. Signet/NAL/Penguin, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr005=vqt6kzx6s2.app7a&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=6151&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1069 Ayn Rand and her thoughts on Rational Education] Michael S. Berliner, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 album ''[[Immersion (album)|Immersion]]'' by [[Australia]]n [[Drum and Bass]] band [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], one of the songs was named "Comprachicos", where the lyrics had references to manipulation and restraint.

The 2011 DC comic Batman and Robin #26 contained a villain whose father disfigured him after reading about the "Comprachicos" in Hugo's novel.

[[James Ellroy]] refers to them and Victor Hugo's novel in ''[[The Black Dahlia (novel)|The Black Dahlia]]'' which forms a major motivation for the murder of Elizabeth Short.

The word '''diorama''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|m|ə}} can either refer to a 19th-century mobile theatre device, or, in modern usage, a three-dimensional full-size or miniature model, sometimes enclosed in a glass showcase for a museum. Dioramas are often built by hobbyists as part of related hobbies such as [[Model military vehicle|military vehicle modeling]], [[Model figure|miniature figure modeling]], or [[Model airplane|aircraft modeling]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Etymology ==
The word "diorama" originated in 1823 as a type of picture-viewing device, from the French in 1822. The word literally means "through that which is seen", from the [[greek language|Greek]] di- "through" + orama "that which is seen, a sight". The diorama was invented by [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[Charles Marie Bouton]], first exhibited in [[Paris]] in July 1822 and in [[London]] on September 29, 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Daguerre#Diorama theatres|Diorama Theatres - Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=January 2017}} The meaning "small-scale replica of a scene, etc." is from 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/diorama Diorama - Word Origin &amp; History] - Online Etymology Dictionary - ''Dictionary.com''. Retrieved 1 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daguerre's and Bouton's diorama consisted of a piece of material painted on both sides. When illuminated from the front, the scene would be shown in one state and by switching to illumination from behind another phase or aspect would be seen. Scenes in daylight changed to moonlight, a train travelling on a track would crash, or an earthquake would be shown in before and after pictures.

== The modern diorama ==
[[File:Cooling tower construction diorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cooling tower]] construction diorama]]
The current, popular understanding of the term "diorama" denotes a partially three-dimensional, full-size replica or [[scale model]] of a landscape typically showing historical events, nature scenes or cityscapes, for purposes of education or entertainment.

One of the first uses of dioramas in a museum was in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], where the [[Biological museum (Stockholm)|Biological Museum]] opened in 1893. It had several dioramas, over three floors. They were also implemented by the National Museum Grigore Antipa from Bucharest Romania and constituted a source of inspiration for many important museums in the world (such as the Museum of Natural History of New York and the Great Oceanographic Museum in Berlin) [reference below]. 

===Miniatures===
Miniature dioramas are typically much smaller, and use scale models and landscaping to create historical or fictional scenes. Such a scale model-based diorama is used, for example, in [[Chicago]]'s [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] to display [[Rail transport|railroading]]. This diorama employs a common [[Rail transport modelling|model railroading]] scale of 1:87 ([[HO scale]]). Hobbyist dioramas often use scales such as 1:35 or 1:48.

An early, and exceptionally large example was created between 1830 and 1838 by a British Army officer. [[William Siborne]], and represents the [[Battle of Waterloo]] at about 7.45 pm, on 18 June, 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nam.ac.uk/online-collection/detail.php?acc=1975-05-56-1 |title=Model of the field of Waterloo with troops positioned as at 19.45 hours, 18 June 1815. |publisher=National Army Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diorama measures {{convert|8.33|by|6|m}} and used around 70,000 model soldiers in its construction. It is now part of the collection of the [[National Army Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waterloo200.org/200-object/captain-sibornes-model-of-waterloo/ |title=Captain Siborne’s Model of Waterloo |website=Waterloo 200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheperd Paine]], a prominent hobbyist, popularized the modern miniature diorama beginning in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== Full size dioramas ===
[[Image:DSC01677 Diorama isole Lofoten - Museo di storia naturale, Milano - Foto di G. Dall'Orto - 20-12-2006.jpg|thumbnail|A diorama in the Museum of Natural History in [[Milan]] (Italy)]]

Modern museum dioramas may be seen in most major natural history museums. Typically, these displays use a tilted plane to represent what would otherwise be a level surface, incorporate a painted background of distant objects, and often employ false perspective, carefully modifying the scale of objects placed on the plane to reinforce the [[illusion]] through [[depth perception]] in which objects of identical real-world size placed farther from the observer appear smaller than those closer. Often the distant painted background or sky will be painted upon a continuous curved surface so that the viewer is not distracted by corners, seams, or edges. All of these techniques are means of presenting a realistic view of a large scene in a compact space. A photograph or single-eye view of such a diorama can be especially convincing since in this case there is no distraction by the [[binocular disparity|binocular perception]] of depth.

=== Uses ===

[[Image:GenealogicalDiorama.jpg|thumb|A [[genealogy|genealogical]] diorama for an elementary school class project; the featured subject is a maternal great-grandfather of the student]]

Miniature dioramas may be used to represent scenes from historic events. A typical example of this type are the dioramas to be seen at [[Norway's Resistance Museum]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

Landscapes built around model railways can also be considered dioramas, even though they often have to compromise scale accuracy for better operating characteristics.

Hobbyists also build dioramas of historical or quasi-historical events using a variety of materials, including [[plastic model]]s of military vehicles, ships or other equipment, along with scale figures and landscaping.

In the 19th and beginning 20th century, building dioramas of sailing ships had been a popular handcraft of mariners. Building a diorama instead of a normal model had the advantage that in the diorama, the model was protected inside the framework and could easily be stowed below the bunk or behind the sea chest. Nowadays, such antique sailing ship dioramas are valuable collectors' items.

One of the largest dioramas ever created{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} was a model of the entire State of [[California]] built for the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] of 1915 and that for a long time was installed in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]].

Dioramas are widely used in the [[American educational system]], mostly in elementary and middle schools. They are often made to represent historical events, ecological [[biomes]], cultural scenes, or to visually depict literature. They are usually made from a shoebox and contain a [[trompe-l'œil]] in the background contrasted with two or three-dimensional models in the foreground.

==Historic dioramas==
===The Daguerre and Bouton Dioramas===
[[File:Diorama diagram.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ground-plan of the Diorama Building, London 1823, by A. Pugin and J. Morgan (illustration reproduced from Gernsheim 1968, p 21)]]
The Diorama was a popular entertainment that originated in Paris in 1822. An alternative to the also popular "[[Panorama]]" ([[panoramic painting]]), the Diorama was a theatrical experience viewed by an audience in a highly specialized theatre. As many as 350 patrons would file in to view a landscape painting that would change its appearance both subtly and dramatically. Most would stand, though limited seating was provided. The show lasted 10 to 15 minutes, after which time the entire audience (on a massive turntable) would rotate to view a second painting. Later models of the Diorama theater even held a third painting.

The size of the [[proscenium]] was {{convert|24|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|21|ft|m}} high (7.3 meters x 6.4 meters). Each scene was hand-painted on linen, which was made transparent in selected areas. A series of these multi-layered, linen panels were arranged in a deep, truncated tunnel, then illuminated by sunlight re-directed via skylights, screens, shutters, and colored blinds. Depending on the direction and intensity of the skillfully manipulated light, the scene would appear to change. The effect was so subtle and finely rendered that both critics and the public were astounded, believing they were looking at a natural scene.

The inventors and proprietors of the Diorama were [[Charles Marie Bouton|Charles-Marie Bouton]] (1781– 1853), a Troubador painter who also worked at the Panorama under Pierre Prévost, and [[Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre]] (1787–1851), formerly a decorator, manufacturer of mirrors, painter of Panoramas, and designer and painter of theatrical stage illusions. Daguerre would later co-invent the [[daguerreotype]], the first widely used method of [[photography]].

A second Diorama building in [[Regent's Park]] in London was opened by an association of Englishmen (having a contract to purchase Daguerre's tableaux) in 1823, a year after the debut of Daguerre's Paris original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midley.co.uk/diorama/Diorama_Wood_1_1.htm|title=The Diorama in Great Britain by R. D. Wood: Introduction|last=Wood|first=R. Derek|website=www.midley.co.uk|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building which exhibited the diorama was designed by [[Augustus Charles Pugin]], father of the notable English architect and designer [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin]]. The show was a popular sensation, and spawned immediate imitations. British artists like [[Clarkson Stanfield]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] produced ever-more elaborate (moving) dioramas through the 1830s; sound effects and even living performers were added. Some "typical diorama effects included moonlit nights, winter snow turning into a summer meadow, rainbows after a storm, illuminated fountains," waterfalls, thunder and lightning, and ringing bells.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Lambourne, ''Victorian Painting'', London, Phaidon Press, 1999; p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; A diorama painted by Daguerre is currently housed in the church of the French town [[Bry-sur-Marne]], where he lived and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/sites/bry/fichier/diaporama_diorama.pdf All about Daguerre's diorama in Bry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/bry/2308.htm About the diorama on Bry's official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Gottstein Dioramas ===
Until 1968, Britain boasted a large collection of dioramas. These collections were originally housed in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum, (formerly the [[Banqueting House]]), in [[Whitehall]]. However, when the museum closed, the various exhibits and their 15 known dioramas were distributed to smaller museums throughout [[England]], some ending up in [[Canada]] and elsewhere. These dioramas were the brainchild of the wealthy furrier Otto Gottstein (1892–1951) of [[Leipzig]], a Jewish immigrant from [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's Germany]], who was an avid collector and designer of flat model figures called flats. In 1930, Gottstein's influence is first seen at the Leipzig International Exhibition, along with the dioramas of Hahnemann of [[Kiel]], Biebel of [[Berlin]] and Muller of [[Erfurt]], all displaying their own figures, and those commissioned from such as Ludwig Frank in large diorama form. In 1933, Gottstein left Germany, and in 1935 founded the British Model Soldier Society. Gottstein persuaded designer and painter friends in both [[Germany]] and [[France]] to help in the construction of dioramas depicting notable events in English history. But due to the war, many of the figures arrived in England incomplete. The task of turning Gottstein's ideas into reality fell to his English friends and those friends who had managed to escape from the Continent. Dennis (Denny) C. Stokes, a talented painter and diorama maker in his own right, was responsible for the painting of the backgrounds of all the dioramas, creating a unity seen throughout the whole series. Denny Stokes was given the overall supervision of the fifteen dioramas.

# The Landing of the Romans under [[Julius Caesar]] in 55 B.C.
# The [[Battle of Hastings]].
# The Storming of [[Siege of Acre (1189–91) | Acre]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Battle of Crecy]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].
# The [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] reviewing her troops at [[Tilbury]].
# The [[Battle of Marston Moor]].
# The [[Battle of Blenheim]]. (Painted by Douchkine.)
# The [[Battle of Plessey]].
# The [[Battle of Quebec (1759)|Battle of Quebec]]. (Engraved by Krunert of Vienna.)
# The [[Old Guard (France)|Old Guard]] at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].
# The [[Charge of the Light Brigade]].
# The [[Battle of Ulundi]]. (figures by Ochel, and Petrocochino - ''pseudonym of Paul Armont''.)
# The Battle of Fleurs.
# The [[D-Day landings]].

Krunert, Schirmer, Frank, Frauendorf, Maier, Franz Rieche, and Oesterrich were also involved in the manufacture and design of figures for the various dioramas. Krunert (a Viennese), like Gottstein an exile in London, was given the job of engraving for ''‘The Battle of Quebec’''. Unfortunately, the ''‘death of Wolfe’'' was found to be inaccurate and had to be re-designed. The names of the vast majority of painters employed by Gottstein are mostly unknown, most lived and worked on the continent, among them Gustave Kenmow, Leopold Rieche, L. Dunekate, M. Alexandre, A. Ochel, Honey Ray, and, perhaps Gottstein's top painter, Vladimir Douchkine (a Russian émigré who lived in Paris). Douchkine was responsible for painting two figures of the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] on horseback for ''‘The Blenheim Diorama’'', one of which was used, the other, Gottstein being the true collector, was never released.

Denny Stokes painted all the backgrounds of all the dioramas, Herbert Norris, the Historical Costume Designer, whom Dr. J. F. Lovel-Barnes introduced to Gottstein, was responsible for the costume design of the [[Ancient Britons]], the [[Normans]] and [[Saxons]], some of the figures of ''‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’'' and the [[Elizabethan]] figures for ''‘Queen Elizabeth at Tilbury’''. Dr. J.F. Lovel-Barnes was himself responsible for the ''‘Battle of Blenheim’'' diorama, selecting the figures, and arrangement of the scene. Due to World War II, when flat figures became unavailable, Gottstein completed his ideas by using Greenwood and Ball's 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures. In time, a fifteenth diorama was added, using these 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures, this diorama representing the ''‘D-Day landings’''. When all the dioramas were completed, they were displayed along one wall in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum. When the museum was closed the fifteen dioramas were distributed to various museums and institutions. The greatest number are to be found at the [[Glenbow Museum]], (130-9th Avenue, S. E. Calgary, Alberta, Canada): RE: '''The Landing of the Romans under Julius Caesar in 55 BC', 'The Battle Of Crecy', 'The Battle of Blenheim', 'The Old Guard at Waterloo', 'The Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava'.''
 
The state of these dioramas is one of debate; John Garratt (''The World of Model Soldiers'') claimed in 1968, that the dioramas "appear to have been partially broken up and individual figures have been sold to collectors". According to the Glenbow Institute (Barry Agnew, Curator) "the figures are still in reasonable condition, but the plaster groundwork has suffered considerable deterioration". Unfortunately, there are no photographs available of the dioramas. ''‘The Battle of Hastings’'' diorama was to be found in the Old Town Museum, [[Hastings]], and is still in reasonable condition. It shows the Norman cavalry charging up [[Senlac Hill]] towards the Saxon lines. 
'‘The Storming of Acre’'' is in the Museum of Artillery at the Rotunda, [[Woolwich]]. John Garratt, in the "Encyclopedia of Model Soldiers", states that ''‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’'' was in the possession of the [[Royal Military School of Music]], [[Kneller Hall]]; however, according to the Curator, the diorama had not been in his possession since 1980, nor is it listed in their Accession Book, so the whereabouts of this diorama is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the British Flat Figure Society'': Issue One – April 1986.

===The Frank Wong dioramas===

[[San Francisco, California]] artist '''Frank Wong''' (born 22 September 1932) created [[Dioramas|miniature dioramas]] that depict the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco Chinatown]] of his youth during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name = sfchron&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guthrie|first1=Julian|title=Frank Wong recalls life in Chinatown through miniature dioramas|url=http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Frank-Wong-recalls-life-in-Chinatown-through-5706947.php|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2004, Wong donated seven miniatures of scenes of Chinatown, titled "The Chinatown Miniatures Collection", to Chinese Historical Society of America (CHSA).&lt;ref name = histsociety/&gt; The dioramas are on permanent display in CHSA's Main Gallery:&lt;ref name = sfchron/&gt;&lt;ref name = histsociety&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinatown Miniatures Collection|url=http://chsa.org/2007/03/frank-wong-miniatures/|publisher=Chinese Historical Society of America|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Chinatown in Miniature" Presentation by Artist Frank Wong|url=http://chsa.org/event/march-second-saturday-at-chsachinatown-in-miniature-presentation-by-artist-frank-wong/|publisher=Chinese Historical Society of America|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Midway.jpg|thumb|This photorealistic diorama of the [[Battle of Midway]] was created during World War II on the basis of information then available.]]
Painters of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era like [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[Francis Danby]] were influenced to create large and highly dramatic pictures by the sensational dioramas and panoramas of their day. In one case, the connection between life and diorama art became intensely circular. On 1 February 1829, John Martin's brother Jonathan, known as "Mad Martin," set fire to the roof of [[York Minster]]. Clarkson Stanfield created a diorama re-enactment of the event, which premiered on 20 April of the same year; it employed a "safe fire" via chemical reaction as a special effect. On 27 May, the "safe" fire proved to be less safe than planned: it set a real fire in the painted cloths of the imitation fire, which burned down the theater and all of its dioramas.&lt;ref&gt;Lambourne, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, dioramas remained popular in England, Scotland, and Ireland through most of the 19th century, lasting until 1880.

A small scale version of the diorama called the [[Polyrama Panoptique]] could display images in the home and was marketed from the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10302430&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=1 Science &amp; Society Picture Library: the collections of the Science Museum, the National Railway Museum and the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural history dioramas==
Natural history dioramas seek to imitate nature and, since their conception in the late 19th century, aim to "nurture a reverence for nature [with its] beauty and grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been described as a means to visually preserve nature as different environments change due to human involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-v1.amnh.org/exhibitions/dioramas/ Diorama Exhibition at the American Natural History Museum] – Retrieved 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They were extremely popular during the first half of the 20th century, both in the USA and UK, later on giving way to television, film, and new perspectives on science.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carla Yanni, Nature’s Museums: Victorian Science and the Architecture of Display, Princeton Architectural Press, New York, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like historical dioramas, natural history dioramas are a mix of two- and three-dimensional elements. What sets natural history dioramas apart from other categories is the use of taxidermy in addition to the foreground replicas and painted background. The use of taxidermy means that natural history dioramas derive not only from Daguerre's work, but also from that of taxidermists, who were used to preparing specimens for either science or spectacle. It was only with the dioramas' precursors (and, later on, dioramas) that both these objectives merged. Popular diorama precursors were produced by [[Charles Willson Peale]], an artist with an interest in taxidermy, during the early 19th century. To present his specimens, Peale "painted skies and landscapes on the back of cases displaying his taxidermy specimens".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, the [[British Museum]] held an exhibition featuring taxidermy birds set on models of plants.

The first habitat diorama created for a museum was constructed by taxidermist [[Carl Akeley]] for the [[Milwaukee Public Museum]] in 1889,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; where it is still held. Akeley set taxidermy muskrats in a three-dimensional re-creation of their wetland habitat with a realistic painted background. With the support of curator [[Frank M. Chapman]], Akeley designed the popular habitat dioramas featured at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Combining art with science, these exhibitions were intended to educate the public about the growing need for [[habitat conservation]]. The modern [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab]] is charged with the creation of all dioramas and otherwise immersive environments in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York,. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A predecessor of Akeley, naturalist and taxidermist [[Martha Maxwell]], created a famous habitat diorama for the [[Centennial Exposition|first World's Fair]] in 1876. The complex diorama featured taxidermied animals in realistic action poses, running water, and live prairie dogs.&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Marbury|title=Taxidermy Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoJLBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Artisan|isbn=978-1-57965-558-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated this display was the first of its kind [outside of a museum].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; Maxwell's pioneering diorama work is said to have influenced major figures in taxidermy history who entered the field later, such as   Akeley and [[William Temple Hornaday]].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; 

Soon, the concern for accuracy came. Groups of scientists, taxidermists, and artists would go on expeditions to ensure accurate backgrounds and collect specimens,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; though some would be donated by game hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hanson, Animal Attractions: Nature on Display in American Zoos, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural history dioramas reached the peak of their grandeur with the opening of the [[American Museum of Natural History#African Mammal Hall|Akeley Hall of African Mammals]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; which featured large animals, such as elephants, surrounded by even larger scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, various institutions lay different claims to notable dioramas. The Milwaukee Public Museum still displays the world's first diorama, created by Akeley; the [[American Museum of Natural History]], in New York, has what might be the world's largest diorama: a life-size replica of a blue whale; the [[Powell-Cotton Museum]], in Kent, UK, is known for having the world's oldest, unchanged, room-sized diorama, built in 1896.

===Constructing a diorama===

Natural history dioramas consist of 3 parts:

#The painted background
#The foreground
#Taxidermy specimens

Preparations for the background begin on the field, where an artist takes photographs and sketches references pieces. Once back at the museum, the artist has to depict the scenery with as much realism as possible. The challenge lies in the fact that the wall used is curved: this allows the background to surround the display without seams joining different panels. At times the wall also curves upward to meet the light above and form a sky. By having a curved wall, whatever the artist paints will be distorted by perspective; it is the artist's job to paint in such a way that minimises this distortion.

The foreground is created to mimic the ground, plants and other accessories to scenery. The ground, hills, rocks, and large trees are created with wood, wire mesh, and plaster. Smaller trees are either used in their entirety or replicated using casts. Grasses and shrubs can be preserved in solution or dried to then be added to the diorama. Ground debris, such as leaf litter, is collected on site and soaked in wallpaper paste for preservation and presentation in the diorama. Water is simulated using glass or plexiglass with ripples carved on the surface. For a diorama to be successful, the foreground and background must merge, so both artists have to work together.

Taxidermy specimens are usually the centrepiece of dioramas. Since they must entertain, as well as educate, specimens are set in lifelike poses, so as to convey a narrative of an animal's life. Smaller animals are usually made with rubber moulds and painted. Larger animals are prepared by first making a clay sculpture of the animal. This sculpture is made over the actual, posed skeleton of the animal, with reference to moulds and measurements taken on the field. A papier-mâché mannequin is prepared from the clay sculpture and the animal's tanned skin is sewn onto the mannequin. Glass eyes substitute the real ones.

If an animal is large enough, the scaffolding that holds the specimen needs to be incorporated into the foreground design and construction.

'''Eavesdropping''' is the act of secretly or stealthily listening to the private [[conversation]] or [[communication]]s of others without their consent.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Garner, p. 550{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is widely regarded as unethical, and in many jurisdictions is illegal.

==Etymology==
The verb ''eavesdrop'' is a back-formation from the noun ''eavesdropper'' ("a person who eavesdrops"), which was formed from the related noun ''eavesdrop'' ("the dripping of water from the eaves of a house; the ground on which such water falls").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eavesdrop|title=eavesdrop - Definition of eavesdrop in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eavesdropper was someone who would hang from the eave of a building so as to hear what is said within. The PBS documentaries, ''Inside the Court of Henry VIII'' (April 8, 2015)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside the Court of Henry VIII|url=https://www.pbs.org/program/inside-court-henry-viii/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|date=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Secrets of Henry VIII’s Palace'' (June 30, 2013) include segments that display and discuss "eavedrops", carved wooden figures [[Henry VIII]] had built into the [[eaves]] (overhanging edges of the beams in the ceiling) of [[Hampton Court]] to discourage unwanted gossip or dissension from the King's wishes and rule, to foment paranoia and fear,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and demonstrate that everything said there was being overheard; literally, that the walls had ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stollznow, Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|date=August 7, 2014|title=Eavesdropping: etymology, meaning, and some creepy little statues|url=http://karenstollznow.com/eavesdropping/|website=KarenStollznow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Eavesdropping vectors include [[telephone]] lines, [[cellular network|cellular networks]], [[email]], and other methods of private instant messaging. [[VoIP]] communications software is also vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping via infections such as [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Network attacks==
Network eavesdropping is a network layer attack that focuses on capturing small ''packets'' from the network transmitted by other computers and reading the data content in search of any type of information. This type of network attack is generally one of the most effective as a lack of encryption services are used. It is also linked to the collection of metadata. Those who perform this type of attack are generally black hat hackers; however, government agencies, such as the [[National Security Agency]], have also been connected.

'''Hardstone carving''' is a general term in [[art history]] and [[archaeology]] for the artistic carving of predominantly semi-precious stones (but also of [[gemstone]]s), such as [[jade]], rock crystal (clear [[quartz]]), [[agate]], [[onyx]], [[jasper]], [[serpentine group|serpentine]], or [[carnelian]], and for an object made in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=CAMEO database: Hardstone|publisher=[[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] |url=http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Hardstone|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610180653/http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Hardstone|archivedate=10 June 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author =Carvalho, Pedro de Moura|year=2010|title=Gems and Jewels of Mughal India|publisher=Nour Foundation|location=London|isbn=978-1-874780-72-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the objects are small, and the category overlaps with both [[jewellery]] and [[sculpture]]. Hardstone carving is sometimes referred to by the Italian term ''pietre dure'';&lt;ref&gt;''This catalogue provides a comprehensive history of pietre dure, a virtuoso form of hardstone carving that reached an artistic peak in Italy in the 16th century and subsequently spread throughout Europe.'' {{Cite book|editor1=Giusti, Annamaria |editor2=Koeppe, Wolfram |year=2008|title=Art of the Royal Court: Treasures in Pietre Dure from the Palaces of Europe|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art in association with Yale University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58839-288-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, ''[[pietra dura]]'' (with an "a") is the common term used for stone inlay work, which causes some confusion.&lt;ref&gt;That confusion is a good reason for not using the term ''pietre dure''.{{Citation needed|reason=opinion|date=June 2014}} See ''[[pietra dura]]'' for more on the distinction.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Neolithic period]] until about the 19th century such objects were among the most highly prized in a wide variety of cultures, often attributed special powers or religious significance, but today coverage in non-specialist art history tends to be relegated to a catch-all [[decorative arts]] or "minor arts" category. The types of objects carved have included those with ritual or religious purposes, [[engraved gems]] as [[signet ring]]s and other kinds of [[seal (insignia)|seal]], handles, [[belt hook]]s and similar items, vessels and purely decorative objects.

==Scope of the term==
[[File:Serpentine paten Louvre MR415.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Dish of [[serpentinite|serpentine]] with inlaid gold fish, 1st century BCE or CE, with 9th-century mounts]]
Hardstone carving falls under the general category of [[glyptic art]], which covers small carvings and [[sculpture]] in all categories of stone. The definition in this context of "[[hardstone]]" is unscientific and not very rigid, but excludes "soft" stones such as [[soapstone]] (steatite) and [[mineral]]s such as [[alabaster]], both widely used for carving, as well as typical stones for building and [[monumental sculpture]], such as [[marble]] and other types of [[limestone]], and [[sandstone]]. These are typically not capable of a fine finish in very small carvings, and would wear in prolonged use. In other contexts, such as architecture, "hard stone" and "soft stone" have different meanings, referring to actual measured hardness using the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]] and other measures. Some rocks used in architecture and monumental sculpture, such as [[granite]], are at least as hard as the gemstones, and others such as [[malachite]] are relatively soft but counted as hardstones because of their rarity and fine colour.

Essentially, any stone that is often used in jewellery is likely to count as a hardstone. Hard organic minerals such as [[amber]] and [[jet (lignite)|jet]] are included, as well as the [[mineraloid]] [[obsidian]]. Hardstones normally have to be drilled rather than worked with edged tools to achieve a fine finish. [[Geology|Geologically]] speaking, most of the gemstones traditionally carved in the West are varieties of [[quartz]], including: [[chalcedony]], [[agate]], [[amethyst]], [[sard]], [[onyx]], [[carnelian]], [[heliotrope (mineral)|heliotrope]], [[jasper]], and quartz in its uncoloured and transparent form, known as rock crystal. The various materials called jade have been dominant in East Asian and [[Mesoamerica]]n carving. Stones typically used for buildings and large sculpture are not often used for small objects such as vessels, although this does occur. For example, in the [[Uruk period]] of [[Sumerian culture]] (4th millennium BCE) heavy vases, cups and [[ewer]]s of [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]] have been found,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfort|1970|pages=28&amp;ndash;31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were not for common use, as the people of [[Uruk]] had well-developed [[pottery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Behnam Abu alsouf|Abu Al-Soof, Bahnam]] |year=1985|title=Uruk Pottery: Origin and distribution|publisher=State Organization of Antiquities and Heritage, Ministry of Culture and Information, Republic of Iraq|location=Baghdad|oclc=17476966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Jade disk.JPG|thumb|left|300px|[[Han Dynasty]] jade ''[[Bi (jade)|bi]]'']]
{{anchor|Islamic hardstone carving}}

===Asia and the Islamic world===
{{further|Pietra dura}}

The art is very ancient, going back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] and beyond, and major traditions include [[cylinder seal]]s and other small carvings in the Ancient [[Near East]], which were also made in softer stones. Inlays of semi-precious stones were often used for decoration or highlights in sculptures of other materials, for example statues often had eyes inlaid with white shell and blue [[lapis lazuli]] or another stone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ebish-Il_Louvre_AO17551.jpg Louvre], Sumerian example, c. 2400 BCE&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese jade]] carving begins with the carving of ritual objects, including blades for ''[[ji (halberd)|ji]]'' and [[dagger-axe]]s clearly never intended for use, and the "Six Ritual Jades" including the ''[[bi (jade)|bi]]'' and ''[[cong (jade)|cong]]'', which according to much later literature represented heaven and earth respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Henessey, Chapter IV on the six ritual jades, Chapter V on blades&lt;/ref&gt; These are found from the [[Neolithic]] [[Liangzhu culture]] (3400-2250 BCE) onwards, and blades from the 2nd millennium BCE [[Shang Dynasty]] on.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, 19-22&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Chinese culture attaches strong powers to jade; the [[jade burial suit]]s in which aristocrats of the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE) were buried were intended to preserve the body from decay.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Henessey, Chapter II on ''The Significance of Jade''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ewer birds Louvre MR333.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fatimid]] carved rock crystal ewer, c. 1000, with 11th-century Italian lid.]]

The Chinese and other cultures often attributed specific properties for detecting and neutralizing [[history of poison|poison]] to gemstones, a belief still alive in the European [[Renaissance]], as shown by the works of [[Georgius Agricola]], the "father of [[mineralogy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qNOB-vcob88C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=poison+gemstone&amp;ei=Xqm6SvHiA4XgywSgscnvDg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''De Natura Fossilium''], Book l.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word "jade" derives (via the Spanish ''piedra de ijada'') from the [[Aztec]] belief that the mineral cured ailments of the [[kidney]]s and sides.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 33&lt;/ref&gt; The Han period also saw the beginning of the tradition of fine decorative jade carving which has lasted until modern times, though the fine carving of other hardstones did not develop until the 17th century, and then appears to have been produced in different workshops and styles from those for jade.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 77, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lYYvsRdxsX4C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Hardstone+carving+Watson+China&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=6DS5Sum2MIjSMrLAibEP#v=onepage&amp;q=Hardstone%20carving%20Watson%20China&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; In general whiteish [[nephrite]] jade was the most highly regarded in China until about 1800, when the deeper and brighter green of the best [[jadeite]] became more highly favoured. There are related Asian traditions of [[Korean jade carving]], in [[Southeast Asia]] and, to a much lesser extent, [[Japan]].

Smallish [[Sassanian]] carvings are known, mostly for seals or jewellery; the central medallion of the "Cup of [[Chosroes]]" (gallery) is one of the largest. [[Ancient Egyptian art|Egyptian carving]] of rock crystal into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040. In 1062 the [[Cairo]] palace of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was looted by his mercenaries, and the examples found in European treasuries, like the one illustrated, may have been acquired as the booty was dispersed. The rock crystal used in Egypt was apparently traded from [[East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Mitchell, 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently it was thought that jade carving was introduced to the central Asian Islamic world in the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] period, but it is becoming clearer that archers' [[thumb ring]]s, knife hilts, and various other objects had been carved for centuries, even millennia before, though in limited numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, 193-99&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic jades and other carvings reached a particular peak in the [[Mughal Empire]], where apart from portable carvings inlaid [[pietra dura|panels of carved stones]] were included in buildings such as the [[Taj Mahal]].&lt;ref&gt;Markel&lt;/ref&gt; The great wealth of the Mughal court allowed [[precious stone]]s like [[ruby|rubies]] and [[emerald]]s to be inset freely in objects. The court workshops of the [[Ottoman Empire]] also produced lavish and elaborate objects, in similar styles but without reaching the artistic peaks of Mughal carving.&lt;ref&gt;There are several examples in: Rogers J.M. and Ward R.M.; ''Süleyman the Magnificent'', 1988, 136-9, British Museum Publications {{ISBN|0-7141-1440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western traditions===
[[File:Coupe des Ptolémées 01.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Cup of the Ptolemies]] in [[onyx]], probably [[Alexandria]], 1st century BCE or CE.]]
From the early civilizations of the near East descended the carving of vessels and small statues in Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and subsequent Western art, and also [[Sassanian]] [[Persia]]; however it is not very significant in the [[art of ancient Egypt]], outside jewellery, as [[alabaster]] was a more common material. The jade signet ring of [[Tutankhamun]] has been called a "unique specimen" of Egyptian jade.&lt;ref&gt;If it is indeed jade, as seems to be the case. see Keene, 194-5&lt;/ref&gt; Hardstone carving more often refers to vessels and figures than smaller [[engraved gem]]s for [[seal ring]]s or made as [[objéts d'art]], which were the main artistic expression of hardstone carving in the Greek classical and Hellenistic periods, and are regarded separately. From the Hellenistic period elaborate vessels in semi-precious stone begin to appear, mostly carved, some in cameo. The [[Cup of the Ptolemies]] and [[Farnese Cup]] both appear to have been made in [[Alexandria]] in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], as does a simpler fluted [[sardonyx]] cup in Washington which, like the Cup of the Ptolemies, was adapted to be a Christian [[chalice (cup)|chalice]], and given elaborate gold and jewelled mounts by [[Abbot Suger]] for his [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St Denis]] about 1140.&lt;ref&gt;The mounts of the Cup of the Ptolemies were lost in the French Revolution; other hardstone treasures from St Denis are in the [[Louvre]]. For a full catalogue description of the Washington cup, see Luchs, 4-12&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Late Antique plainer shapes for vessels appear, concentrating on showing the natural patterns of figured stones - survivals of these are hard to date, and mostly have survived in church treasuries with medieval mounts in goldsmith work. The best collection of Byzantine liturgical vessels is in the Treasury of [[San Marco, Venice]], some of them booty from the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;Angold, 252 &amp; 254 [https://books.google.com/books?id=NkvZWO3CymoC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=Treasury+of+St+Mark+Venice&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=f3S6SuyLIZiwMoiS3cAP# Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine art]]ists maintained a tradition throughout the Middle Ages, often working in clear rock crystal. There are a few large pieces from [[Carolingian art]], including the [[Lothair Crystal]], and then a continuing tradition of rock crystal work, often used undecorated in reliquaries and other pieces in the same way as modern glass, for which they are often mistaken by modern viewers. By the end of the Middle Ages a wider variety of stones and objects are seen, used for both religious objects and secular ones.
[[File:Roses over crossed canes, from Museo dell'Opificio delle Pietre Dure, Florence.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Detail of 19th-century [[pietra dura]] panel]]

The [[Opificio delle pietre dure]] ("Hardstone workshop") founded by the Medici in [[Florence]] in 1588 soon became the leading workshop in Europe, and developed the [[pietra dura]] style of multi-coloured [[inlay]]s, which use coloured marbles as well as gemstones. They also produced vessels and small sculptures from a single piece of stone, often mounted with gold, which was also a speciality of [[Milan]]ese workshops.&lt;ref&gt;See external link to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]exhibition feature.&lt;/ref&gt; Other rulers followed their example, including [[Peter the Great]], whose [[Peterhof Lapidary Works]], founded in 1721, began the passion among Russian royalty and aristocrats for hardstones. Engraved gem production had already revived, centred on [[Venice]] but with artists in many countries, and gems of very high quality continued to be produced until the mid-19th century. The [[Mannerist]] court taste of the 16th century delighted in extravagant vessels for serving fruit or sweetmeats, or display as table centrepieces or on sideboards, with hardstones augmented with mounts and bases in precious metal, [[enamel paint|enamel]] and jewels. One collection that has remained mostly together is the "Dauphin's Treasure" of [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661–1711)]], which passed to his son [[Philip V of Spain]]; over 120 objects are now displayed together in the [[Museo del Prado]], many of which were already over a century old in the Dauphin's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/the-decorative-arts/the-dauphins-treasure/ Prado] The Dauphin’s Treasure&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the vast [[malachite]] vases that rather typify Russian carving (picture below),&lt;ref&gt;See [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Vases_in_Hermitage here for several more]&lt;/ref&gt; the last notable modern producer was [[Fabergé]] in pre-Revolutionary Russia. Before he produced the famous [[Imperial Easter Egg]]s he made his reputation with small hardstone figures of animals and people, typically only 25–75mm long or wide, and small vases with a few flowers—the vase and "water" in rock crystal and the flowers in various hardstones and enamel.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 363 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jGsVHV098K0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA363&amp;dq=Hardstone+carving+Faberge&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=G_K3SqWWNIbgNdX2nboP#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books].

===Pre-Columbian and other traditions===
[[File:Olmec mask 802.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Olmec]] face mask in jade]]

Beyond the Old World, hardstone carving was important in various [[Pre-Columbian art|Pre-Columbian cultures]], including [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade in Mesoamerica]] and [[obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian in Mesoamerica]]. Because its colour had associations with water and vegetation, jade was also a symbol of life to many cultures; the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] placed jade beads in the mouths of the dead. Lacking [[iron]], jade was the hardest material the Pre-Columbians were able to work with, apart from [[emery (rock)|emery]].

A particular type of object running through the long history of [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures from the [[Olmec]] to the Maya and [[Aztec]] is the face "mask" in semi-precious stone (they do not seem to have been for actually wearing), either carved from a single piece or of pieces inlaid on a backing of another material. Curators refer to "Olmec-style" face masks as despite being Olmec in style, to date no example has been recovered in a controlled archaeological Olmec context. However they have been recovered from sites of other cultures, including one deliberately deposited in the ceremonial precinct of [[Tenochtitlan]] ([[Mexico City]]), which would presumably have been about 2,000 years old when the [[Aztec]]s buried it, suggesting these were valued and collected as Roman antiquities were in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artworld.uea.ac.uk/cms/index.php?q=node/873 Artworld University of East Anglia collections]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, see also [http://www.lapidaryjournal.com/feature/feb01str.cfm Lapidiary Journal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003161004/http://www.lapidaryjournal.com/feature/feb01str.cfm# |date=2009-10-03 }} article, &amp; MMA&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztecs' own masks are more typically of [[turquoise]] inlay, the Mayans' of jade inlay (see gallery).

Another supposed type of Pre-Columbian hardstone carving is the rock [[crystal skull]]; however experts are now satisfied that all known large (life-size) examples are 19th-century forgeries, though some miniature ones may be genuinely Pre-Columbian.

The [[Māori people]] of [[New Zealand]], developed the carving of ''[[pounamu]]'' (jade) for weapons, tools and ornaments to a high standard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://teara.govt.nz/en/pounamu-jade-or-greenstone/page-1 "Pounamu – jade or greenstone"] in Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
[[File:Ermitáž.jpg|thumb|left|upright|250px|Enormous [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] vase in [[malachite]] in the [[Hermitage Palace]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
Most hardstones, including jade and quartz varieties, have a [[crystalline]] structure that does not allow detailed carving by edged tools without great wastage and a poor finish. Working them has always been very time-consuming, which together with the cost of rare materials often traded from very far away, has accounted for the great expense of these objects. After sawing and perhaps chiselling to reach the approximate shape, stones were mostly cut by using abrasive powder from harder stones in conjunction with a hand-drill, probably often set in a [[lathe]], and by grinding-wheels. [[Emery (rock)|Emery]] has been mined for abrasive powder on [[Naxos]] since antiquity, and was known in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by cutters in antiquity. The Chinese sometimes tipped their straight drills with less-valued [[diamond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from [[Theophilus Presbyter]]. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear how they learned this technique. Mughal carvers also used drills.&lt;ref&gt;Markell&lt;/ref&gt; Inlay sections could be sawed by [[bow saw]]s. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, 8-16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8bWo5T2JdVUC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Engraved+gem&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Engraved%20gem&amp;f=false quotes passages] from Theophilius and others, and discusses various techniques. See Theophilius's article for full on-line texts.&lt;/ref&gt; The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity - since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.&lt;ref&gt;Thoresen, "Gemstone enhancement"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imitations==
As a highly prestigious artform using expensive materials, many different techniques for imitating hardstone carvings have been developed, some of which have themselves created significant artistic traditions. [[Celadon ware]], with a jade coloured glaze, was important in China and Korea, and in early periods used for shapes typical of jade objects. Roman [[cameo glass]] was invented to imitate cameo gems, with the advantage that consistent layers were possible even in objects in the round. The small group of 11th(?)-century [[Hedwig glass]]es are inspired by Fatimid rock-crystal vessels. In the [[Italian Renaissance]] [[agate glass]] was perfected to imitate agate vessels with multicoloured figuration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K4yIWBD05qEC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=agate%20glass&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=agate%20glass&amp;f=false agate glass]. An inventory of the treasures of [[John, Duke of Berry]] already records such a vase in 1416, but no example from this early seems to have survived.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ceramic art|Ceramics]] have often been decorated to imitate gemstones, and wood, plaster and other materials painted to imitate stones. [[Scagliola]] developed in Italy to imitate pietra dura inlays on plaster; less elaborate forms are called [[marbleizing]]. Medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s often imitated both inlaid stone and engraved gems, and after printing took over [[paper marbling]] continued as a manual craft for decorating [[end-papers]] and covers.

'''Hybrid arts''' is a contemporary art movement in which artists work with frontier areas of science and emerging technologies.  Artists work with fields such as biology, robotics, physical sciences, experimental interface technologies (such as speech, gesture, face recognition), artificial intelligence, and information visualization.  They address the research in many ways such as undertaking new research agendas, visualizing results in new ways, or critiquing the social implications of the research.  The worldwide community has developed new kinds of art festivals, information sources, organizations, and university programs to explore these new arts.
'''Hybrid arts''' is also the name of a non profit Arts education company in the United Kingdom. Set up in 2003 after a four-year development period to create a new species of training and arts engagement provider in the cultural industries...see Hybrid:arts

==Overview/ history of the term==
Many artists are responding to the central role scientific and technological research plays in contemporary culture. They are going beyond merely using technological tools and gadgets (e.g. computers) in their work to engage deeply with the processes of research. They are creating revolutionary art at the frontiers of [[Scientific method|scientific research]]. They see art as an independent zone of research that pursues areas of science and research ignored by mainstream [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]]. They are developing technologies that would be rejected by the marketplace but are nonetheless culturally critical. They are pursuing inquiries that are seen as too controversial, too wacky, too improbable, too speculative for regular science and technology. Their theoretical orientation ranges from celebration of human curiosity to critique of science's arrogance. They enter into the processes in research at all stages: setting research agendas, development of research processes, visualization, interpretations of findings, and education of the public.

There has been some confusion over the last years of what to call this kind of art that crosses so many disciplines. It is descended from computer and [[internet art]] but reaches out to cover many new disciplines. [[Ars Electronica]], which is considered one of leading world organizations concerned with experimental arts, decided three years ago to create a new category to encompass these kinds of arts. Every year they host an international competition for artists working in these experimental fields. They decided to use the name 'Hybrid Arts'. The worldwide community of artists, theorists, and journalists interested in this art are increasingly using this term. Here is a quote from their web site that offers their definition and a preliminary list of kinds of art covered.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The “Hybrid Art” category is dedicated specifically to today’s hybrid and transdisciplinary projects and approaches to [[New media art|media art]]. Primary emphasis is on the process of fusing different media and genres into new forms of artistic expression as well as the act of transcending the boundaries between art and research, art and social/political [[activism]], art and [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Jurors will be looking very closely at how dynamically the submitted work defies classification in a single one of the Prix categories of long standing.

This category is open to all types of current works in any form:

 * Autonomic Installations and Artworks&lt;br /&gt;
 * Autonomous Sculptures&lt;br /&gt;
 * Performance and Stageprojects&lt;br /&gt;
 * Media architectures&lt;br /&gt;
 * Media based Interventions in public spaces&lt;br /&gt;
 * Mechatronics / Kinetics / Robotics&lt;br /&gt;
 * Location-based and geospatial storytelling&lt;br /&gt;
 * [[Multi-user]] environments&lt;br /&gt;
 * Annotation software tools&lt;br /&gt;
 * Artificial Life&lt;br /&gt;
 * Transgenic Art&lt;br /&gt;
 * [[Software art|Software Art]], Generative Art&lt;br /&gt;
 --- Ars Electronica Website [http://www.aec.at/prix_categories_en.php?cat=Hybrid%20Art Ars Electronica Website]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many new support systems have evolved to nurture, show, and interpret this kind of art. New educational programs have been developed. Books have been written.

==Sample of the research fields addressed in hybrid arts==
-Genetics, Bioengineering, [[stem cell]]s, proteomics &lt;br /&gt;
-Art and Biology of Living Systems: microorganisms, plants, animals, ecology&lt;br /&gt;
-Human Biology: the body, bionics, [[Body modification|body manipulation]], brain &amp; body processes, body imaging, and medicine&lt;br /&gt;
-Physical Sciences: [[particle physics]], [[atomic energy]], geology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, [[space science]], nanotechnology, [[materials science]] &lt;br /&gt;
-Kinetics, Electronics, Robotics: [[physical computing]], [[ubiquitous computing]], mixed reality&lt;br /&gt;
-Alternative Interfaces: motion, gesture, touch, [[facial expression]], speech, [[wearable computing]], [[3D audio effect|3-d sound]], and VR
-Code: algorithms, software art, genetic art, [[Artificial life|A-life]], artificial intelligence&lt;br /&gt;
-Information Systems: databases, surveillance, RFID/barcodes, synthetic cinema, information visualization&lt;br /&gt;
Telecommunications: telephone, radio, telepresence, web art, mobiles, locative media

==Festivals, shows, conferences related to hybrid arts==
Since much of the art does not fit into historical categories such as painting or sculpture, many museums and art festivals did not show the work.  Curators who were interested created new kinds of festivals, competitions, museums and shows to present the work.  Examples include Ars Electronica (note especially Interactive and Hybrid priz competitions. ISEA (International symposium of Electronic Arts), V2 - DEAF (Dutch Electronic Arts Festival), VIDA - Art &amp; Artificial Life International Competition.  Ars Electronica offers a festival each year that addresses transdisciplinary themes.Both artists and scientists are invited to speak at the conferences. Recent exhibitions focused on themes such as New Sex, Simplicity and Privacy.

==Organizations, information sources, art/science collaboration support, educational programs==
The hybrid arts community also established organizations and information sources to promote, disseminate, and interpret these new art activities. There are hundreds of such organizations of which a few examples are offered here. The external links show where to get more information.  The Journal Leonardo published by MIT Press has a 40-year history of ‘promoting and documenting work at the intersection of the arts, sciences, and technology, and… encouraging and stimulating collaboration between artists, scientists, and technologists.’ The organization also has web sites, abstract services, and collaborates with other organizations in presenting conferences.  The website  We Make Money Not Art covers media/research conferences, interviews artists/researchers, and discusses developments in various fields from activism and biology to surveillance and wearables.

Other organizations offer public events and facilitate the process of artists collaborating with researchers.  For example, [[Arts Catalyst|The Arts Catalyst]] in the UK seeks to ‘extend the practice of artists engaging with scientific processes, facilities and technologies in order to reveal and illuminate the social, political and cultural contexts that brought them into being’ through public symposia, exhibitions, and commissions.  SymbioticA in Australia is an ‘artistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning and critique of life sciences.’ It ‘provides an opportunity for researchers to pursue curiosity-based explorations free of the demands and constraints associated with the current culture of scientific research.’ The arts lab is sponsored by the medicine department of a university.  Other examples include the Art and Genomics Centre(NL), the [[LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial]] (ES) and Artists in Labs (CH) program.

New forms of educational programs are being established at universities around the world.  Students are expected to master topics in art, media, and research disciplines. For example, the  U of Washington’s DXArts program offers a ‘creative research convergence zone for intrepid artists and scholars’ who seek to reach out beyond the arts.  The Conceptual/Information Arts (CIA) is the "experimental program within the Art Department at San Francisco State University dedicated to preparing artists and media experimentors to work at the cutting edge of science and technology".  Courses cover topics such as art &amp; biology, robotics, locative media, and physical computing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5559">'''Indigenous Futurisms''' is a movement consisting of art, literature, comics, games, and other forms of media which express Indigenous perspectives of the future, past, and present in the context of science fiction and related sub-genres. Such perspectives may reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, traditional stories, historical or contemporary politics or other cultural realities. 

Like [[Afrofuturism]], Indigenous futurism encapsulates multiple modes of art making from literature to visual arts, fashion and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guzmán|first1=Alicia Inez|title=Indigenous Futurisms|url=https://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/indigenous-futurisms/|website=InVisible Culture: An Electronic Journal for Visual Culture|publisher=University of Rochester|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Grace Dillon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaertner|first1=David|title=“WHAT’S A STORY LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?”: CYBERSPACE AND INDIGENOUS FUTURISM|url=https://novelalliances.com/2015/03/23/whats-a-story-like-you-doing-in-a-place-like-this-cyberspace-and-indigenous-futurism-in-neal-stephensons-snow-crash/#_ftn1|website=Novel Alliances: Allied Perspectives on Literature, Art and New Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor in the Indigenous Nations Studies Program at Portland State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grace Dillon|url=https://www.pdx.edu/nas/grace-l-dillon-2|website=Portland State University|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous Futurisms critiques the historization of Indigenous people which is used to separate from them the contemporary world while challenging notions of what constitutes advanced technology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenewinquiry.com/the-space-ndns-star-map/|title=The Space NDN’s Star Map|last=Cornum|first=Lou Catherine|date=January 26, 2015|website=The New Inquiry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Psychological Morphology38?.jpg|thumb| [[Roberto Matta]]'s ''Psychological Morphology'', (painted in about 1938), with its landscape-like blue sky and horizon, combined with [[biomorphism|biomorphically]] suggestive and fluidly interacting figures, is a good example of what Prof. Claude Cernuschi ([[Boston College]]) has identified in Matta's work as "the psychoanalytic view of the mind as a three-dimensional space: the 'inscape'."]] 

'''Inscape''', in [[visual art]], is a term especially associated with certain works of [[Chile]]an artist [[Roberto Matta]], but it is also used in other senses within the [[visual arts]]. Though the term ''inscape'' has been applied to stylistically diverse artworks, it usually conveys some notion of representing the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as a kind of interior [[landscape art|landscape]]. The word ''inscape'' can therefore be read as a kind of [[portmanteau]], combining ''interior'' (or ''inward'') with ''landscape''.

==The psychological inscape: surrealist, abstract, and fantastic art==

According to Professor Claude Cernuschi, writing in a catalogue for a Matta exhibition at [[Boston College]] (see external link below), Matta's use of the term ''inscape'' for a series of [[landscape art|landscape]]-like [[abstract art|abstract]] or [[surrealist]] [[painting]]s reflects "the [[psychoanalytic]] view of the mind as a three-dimensional space: the 'inscape'." The 'inscape' concept is particularly apt for Matta's works of the late 1930s. As [[Dawn Adès]] (p. 233) writes, "A series of brilliant oil paintings done during the years of his [Matta's] first association with the [[Surrealist]]s explore visual metaphors for the mental landscape." And Valerie Fletcher, in ''Crosscurrents of Modernism'' (p. 241), writes that during this time Matta "created with startling mastery the paintings he called 'inscapes' or 'psychological morphologies.' " See also Miriam Basilio's essay, "[[Wifredo Lam]]'s 'The Jungle' and Matta's 'Inscapes' ".

The term ''inscape'' was later taken up by the leading Australian surrealist [[James Gleeson]], American [[abstract art]]ists such as [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Jane Frank]], and [[Mary Frank]] (no relation), and even a group of British [[fantasy art]]ists founded by [[Brigid Marlin]] in 1961 and calling themselves the 'Inscape Group.' (The latter group may have had in mind another sense of the word '[[inscape]]', associated with the British poet [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]. See the article titled simply '[[inscape]]' for more information on this.)  More recently, in a 1998 review of a Mary Frank exhibition in [[New York City]] (cited below), Carol Diehl writes, "Titled 'Inscapes', the [[painting]]s are [[landscape art|landscapes]] of the [[soul]]...."

Also clearly referring to the psychoanalytical meaning of the word as described by Prof. Cernuschi and others above, the leading journal of [[art therapy]] was formerly called simply ''Inscape''.  The journal is now called ''International journal of art therapy : Inscape.'' (This is not to be confused with the ''Inscape'' magazine produced by Brigid Marlin's [[Society for Art of Imagination]].)

==Architectural interiors as 'inscapes'==
The word "inscape" is sometimes used, perhaps with a bit of poetic license, to refer to the domain of [[interior design]], suggesting that the interior of a house or building is a kind of interior (or indoor) landscape, a counterpart to the landscape surrounding the structure. This is the sense suggested by the name of the [[South Africa]]n interior design school [[Inscape Design College]], which see. It could be, however, that this use of the term is intended as a [[double-entendre]], evoking those other meanings of "inscape".

[[File:Stop Defacing Signs.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[stop sign]] ironically defaced with a plea ''not'' to deface stop signs.]]

'''Irony''' ({{ety|grc|''εἰρωνεία'' eirōneía|dissimulation, feigned ignorance}}&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp; Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'', v. sub {{lang|grc|εἰρωνεία}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), in its broadest sense, is a [[rhetorical device]], [[literary technique]], or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. 

Irony can be categorized into different types, including: ''verbal irony'', ''dramatic irony'', and ''situational irony''. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of [[simile]], used in [[sarcasm]], and some forms of [[litotes]] can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Compass_of_Irony.html?id=7PsNAAAAQAAJ Muecke, DC., ''The Compass of Irony'', Routledge, 1969. p. 80]&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms, as identified by historian [[Connop Thirlwall]], include dialectic and practical irony.&lt;ref name="NPE" /&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Henry Watson Fowler]], in ''[[The King's English]]'', says, "any definition of irony—though hundreds might be given, and very few of them would be accepted—must include this, that the surface meaning and the underlying meaning of what is said are not the same." Also, Eric Partridge, in ''[[Eric Partridge|Usage and Abusage]]'', writes that "Irony consists in stating the contrary of what is meant."

The use of irony may require the concept of a ''double audience''. Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Irony is a form of utterance that postulates a double audience, consisting of one party that hearing shall hear &amp; shall not understand, &amp; another party that, when more is meant than meets the ear, is aware both of that more &amp; of the outsiders' incomprehension.&lt;ref name="Fowler, HW 1926"&gt;Fowler, H. W., ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage'', 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term is sometimes used as a synonym for ''incongruous'' and applied to "every trivial oddity" in situations where there is no double audience.&lt;ref name="Fowler, HW 1926"/&gt; An example of such usage is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]], whose real interest was, ironically, serious music, which he composed with varying degrees of success, achieved fame for his comic opera scores rather than for his more earnest efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Gassner, J., Quinn, E., ''The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]''{{'s}} secondary meaning for ''irony'': "incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony |title="irony" at dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218045412/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony |archivedate=2010-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense, however, is not synonymous with "incongruous" but merely a definition of dramatic or situational irony. {{Anchor|Incongruity_plus_human_folly}} It is often included in definitions of irony ''not only'' that incongruity is present ''but also'' that the incongruity must reveal some aspect of human vanity or folly. Thus the majority of ''American Heritage Dictionary'''s usage panel found it unacceptable to use the word ''ironic'' to describe mere unfortunate coincidences or surprising disappointments that "suggest no particular lessons about human vanity or folly."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Free Dictionary'' under ''ironic'': http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ironic&lt;/ref&gt;

On this aspect, ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') has also:&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "irony" entry, second definition.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|1=A condition of affairs or events of a character opposite to what was, or might naturally be, expected; a contradictory outcome of events as if in mockery of the promise and fitness of things. (In French, ''ironie du sort'').}}

==Origin of the term==
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=irony |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294609/irony |accessdate=18 September 2014 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150212010710/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294609/irony |archive-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Quote|1=The term irony has its roots in the Greek comic character [[Eiron]], a clever underdog who by his wit repeatedly triumphs over the boastful character [[Alazon]]. The Socratic irony of the [[Platonic dialogues]] derives from this comic origin.}}

According to Richard Whately:&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; "Rhetoric", ''Encyclopedia Metropolitan'', I. 265/1; 1845 (cited in the ''OED'' entry)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=[[Aristotle]] mentions ''Eironeia'', which in his time was commonly employed to signify, not according to the modern use of 'Irony, saying the contrary to what is meant', but, what later writers usually express by [[Litotes]], i.e. 'saying less than is meant'.}}

The word came into English as a [[figure of speech]] in the 16th century as similar to the French ''ironie''. It derives from the Latin ''ironia'' and ultimately from the Greek ''εἰρωνεία'' eirōneía, meaning ''dissimulation, ignorance purposely affected''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "irony" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Situational irony - Baker Street tube station.jpg|thumb|A "No smoking" sign surrounded by images of a smoking [[Sherlock Holmes]] at [[Baker Street tube station]]]]

''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' distinguishes between the following types of irony:&lt;ref name="NPE"&gt;Preminger, A. &amp; Brogan, T. V. F. Brogan, 
''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', MJF Books, 1993, {{ISBN|9780691032719}},  pp. 633–635.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Classical''' irony: Referring to the origins of irony in Ancient Greek comedy, and the way classical and medieval rhetoricians delineated the term.
*'''Romantic''' irony: A self-aware and self-critical form of fiction.
*'''Cosmic''' irony: A contrast between the absolute and the relative, the general and the individual, which Hegel expressed by the phrase, "general [irony] of the world."&lt;ref name="NPE" /&gt;
*'''Verbal''' irony: A contradiction between a statement's stated and intended meaning
*'''Situational''' irony: The disparity of intention and result; when the result of an action is contrary to the desired or expected effect.
*'''Dramatic''' irony and '''tragic''' irony: A disparity of awareness between an actor and an observer: when words and actions possess significance that the listener or audience understands, but the speaker or character does not; for example when a character says to another "I'll see you tomorrow!" when the audience (but not the character) knows that the character will die before morning. It is most often used when the author causes a character to speak or act erroneously, out of ignorance of some portion of the truth of which the audience is aware. In tragic irony, the audience knows the character is making a mistake, even as the character is making it.

===Verbal irony===
According to ''A glossary of literary terms'' by Abrams and Hartman,&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Verbal irony''' is a statement in which the meaning that a speaker employs is sharply different from the meaning that is ostensibly expressed. An ironic statement usually involves the explicit expression of one attitude or evaluation, but with indications in the overall speech-situation that the speaker intends a very different, and often opposite, attitude or evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, M. H., &amp; Harpham, G. G., ''A glossary of literary terms'', 9th Ed., Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Verbal irony is distinguished from situational irony and dramatic irony in that it is produced ''intentionally'' by speakers. For instance, if a man exclaims, "I'm not upset!" but reveals an upset [[emotional]] state through his voice while truly trying to claim he's not upset, it would not be verbal irony by virtue of its verbal manifestation (it would, however, be situational irony). But if the same speaker said the same words and intended to communicate that he was upset by claiming he was not, the utterance would be verbal irony. This distinction illustrates an important aspect of verbal irony—speakers communicate implied propositions that are intentionally contradictory to the propositions contained in the words themselves. There are, however, examples of verbal irony that do not rely on saying the opposite of what one means, and there are cases where all the traditional criteria of irony exist and the utterance is not ironic.

In a clear example from literature, in Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar'', Mark Antony's speech after the assassination of Caesar appears to praise the assassins, particularly Brutus ("But Brutus says he was ambitious; / And Brutus is an honourable man"), while actually condemning them. "We're left in no doubt as to who's ambitious and who's honourable. The literal truth of what's written clashes with the perceived truth of what's meant to revealing effect, which is irony in a nutshell".
&lt;ref&gt;
Horberry, R., ''Sounds Good on Paper: How to Bring Business Language to Life'', A&amp;amp;C Black, 2010. p. 135. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sounds_Good_on_Paper.html?id=rlBIvHRkExsC] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironic [[simile#irony|similes]] are a form of verbal irony where a speaker intends to communicate the opposite of what they mean. For instance, the following explicit similes begin with the deceptive formation of a statement that means ''A'' but that eventually conveys the meaning ''not A'':
* as soft as concrete
* as clear as mud
* as pleasant as a [[Endodontic therapy|root canal]]
* "as pleasant and relaxed as a coiled rattlesnake" (Kurt Vonnegut from ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'')

The irony is recognizable in each case only by using knowledge of the source concepts (e.g., that mud is opaque, that root canal surgery is painful) to detect an incongruity.

====Verbal irony and sarcasm====
A fair amount of confusion has surrounded the issue of the relationship between verbal irony and [[sarcasm]].

Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' states: &lt;blockquote&gt;Sarcasm does not necessarily involve irony and irony has often no touch of sarcasm. &lt;/blockquote&gt;This suggests that the two concepts are linked but may be considered separately. ''The Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s entry for [[sarcasm]] does not mention irony, but the irony entry includes:
{{Quote|1=A figure of speech in which the intended meaning is the opposite of that expressed by the words used; usually taking the form of sarcasm or ridicule in which laudatory expressions are used to imply condemnation or contempt.}}

The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' has "Non-literary irony is often called sarcasm"; while the ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' entry is:
{{Quote|1=Sarcasm: 1&amp;thinsp;: a sharp and often satirical or ironic utterance designed to cut or give pain. 2 a&amp;thinsp;: a mode of satirical wit depending for its effect on bitter, caustic, and often ironic language that is usually directed against an individual.}}

Partridge in ''[[Usage and Abusage]]'' would separate the two forms of speech completely: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Irony must not be confused with sarcasm, which is direct: sarcasm means precisely what it says, but in a sharp, caustic, ... manner. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The psychologist Martin, in ''The Psychology of Humour'', is quite clear that irony is where "the literal meaning is opposite to the intended" and sarcasm is "aggressive humor that pokes fun".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R. A., ''The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach'', Elsevier Academic Press, 2007. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He has the following examples: for irony he uses the statement "What a nice day" when it is raining. For sarcasm, he cites [[Winston Churchill]], who is supposed to have said, when told by [[Bessie Braddock]] that he was drunk, "But I shall be sober in the morning, and you will still be ugly", as being sarcastic, while not saying the opposite of what is intended.

Psychology researchers Lee and Katz (1998) have addressed the issue directly. They found that ridicule is an important aspect of sarcasm, but not of verbal irony in general. By this account, sarcasm is a particular kind of personal criticism levelled against a person or group of persons that incorporates verbal irony. For example, a woman reports to her friend that rather than going to a medical doctor to treat her cancer, she has decided to see a spiritual healer instead. In response her friend says sarcastically, "Oh, brilliant, what an ingenious idea, that's really going to cure you." The friend could have also replied with any number of ironic expressions that should not be labeled as sarcasm exactly, but still have many shared elements with sarcasm.

Most instances of verbal irony are labeled by research subjects as sarcastic, suggesting that the term ''sarcasm'' is more widely used than its technical definition suggests it should be (Bryant &amp; Fox Tree, 2002; Gibbs, 2000). Some [[psycholinguistic]] theorists (e.g., Gibbs, 2000) suggest that [[sarcasm]] ("Great idea!", "I hear they do fine work."), [[hyperbole]] ("That's the best idea I have heard in years!"), [[understatement]] ("Sure, what the hell, it's only cancer..."), [[rhetorical question]]s ("What, does your spirit have cancer?"), [[double entendre]] ("I'll bet if you do that, you'll be communing with spirits in no time...") and [[jocularity]] ("Get them to fix your bad back while you're at it.") should all be considered forms of verbal irony. The differences between these rhetorical devices ([[trope (literature)|tropes]]) can be quite subtle and relate to typical emotional reactions of listeners, and the rhetorical goals of the speakers. Regardless of the various ways theorists categorize figurative language types, people in conversation who are attempting to interpret speaker intentions and discourse goals do not generally identify, by name, the kinds of tropes used (Leggitt &amp; Gibbs, 2000).

====Verbal irony and echoic allusion====
Echoic allusion is the main component involved in conveying verbally ironic meaning. It is best described as a [[speech act]] by which the speaker simultaneously represents a thought, belief or idea, and implicitly attributes this idea to someone else who is wrong or deluded. In this way, the speaker intentionally dissociates themselves from the idea and conveys their tacit dissent, thereby providing a different meaning to their utterance. In some cases, the speaker can provide stronger dissociation from the represented thought by also implying derision toward the idea or outwardly making fun of the person or people they attribute it to.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Deirdre. "The Pragmatics Of Verbal Irony: Echo Or Pretence?." Lingua 116.10 (2006): 1722-1743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoic allusion, like other forms of verbal irony, relies on semantically disambiguating cues to be interpreted correctly. These cues often come in the form of [[paralanguage|paralinguistic markers]] such as prosody, tone, or pitch,&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Gregory A., and Jean E. Fox Tree. "Recognizing Verbal Irony in Spontaneous Speech." Metaphor and Symbol 17.2 (2002): 99-119. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal cues]] like hand gesture, facial expression and eye gaze.&lt;ref&gt;González-Fuente, Santiago, Victoria Escandell-Vidal, and Pilar Prieto. "Gestural Codas Pave The Way To The Understanding Of Verbal Irony." Journal of Pragmatics 90.(2015): 26-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of echoic allusion and its disambiguating paralinguistic markers is as follows:
* Person 1: I wasn't going to eat the cake, you know.
* Person 2: Interesting, that's what it looked like you were doing, but I just must have been mistaken.
From simple semantic analysis, Person 2 appears to believe Person 1. However, if this conversation is given the context of Person 2 walking in on Person 1 about to eat some cake, and Person 2 speaking their sentence in a significantly decreased rate of speech and lowered tone, the interpretation of "I just must have been mistaken" changes. Instead of being taken as Person 2 believing Person 1, the utterance calls to mind someone who would believe Person 1, while also conveying Person 2's implication that said individual would be considered gullible. From this, Person 2 negates the possible interpretation that they believe Person 1.

===Dramatic irony===
Dramatic irony exploits the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously), thus placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters. [[Connop Thirlwall]] in his 1833 article ''On the Irony of [[Sophocles]]'' originally highlighted the role of irony in drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/irony.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604184251/http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/irony.htm |archivedate=2016-06-04 |df= }}; cf. G.M. Kirkwood, ''A Study of Sophoclean Drama'', p. 258: "The now familiar concept of 'dramatic irony' was originally developed in an early nineteenth century article, "On the Irony of Sophocles," by the English scholar Connop Thirlwall, who explains that in a play the sequence of events can lead to two different interpretations of the action so far: the situation as it appears to the characters in the play, and to the situation as it really is."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thirlwall's original article appears in ''Philological Museum'' (edited by J.C. Hare), vol. 2, pp. 483-537, available at https://archive.org/details/philologicalmus01haregoog&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' defines dramatic irony as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
{{Quote|1=the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned; the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.}}

According to Stanton,&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, R., "Dramatic Irony in Hawthorne's Romances", ''Modern Language Notes'', Vol. 71, No. 6 (Jun., 1956), pp. 420–426, The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; dramatic irony has three stages—installation, exploitation, and resolution (often also called preparation, suspension, and resolution)
—producing dramatic conflict in what one character relies or appears to rely upon, the ''contrary'' of which is known by observers (especially the audience; sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true. In summary, it means that the reader/watcher/listener knows something that one or more of the characters in the piece is not aware of.

For example:
* In ''[[City Lights]]'', the audience knows that [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s character is not a millionaire, but the blind flower girl ([[Virginia Cherrill]]) believes him to be rich.&lt;ref&gt;
Clausius, C., ''The Gentleman Is a Tramp: Charlie Chaplin's Comedy'', P. Lang, 1989, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[North by Northwest]]'', the audience knows that Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is not Kaplan; Vandamm ([[James Mason]]) and his accomplices do not. The audience also knows that Kaplan is a fictitious agent invented by the CIA; Roger (initially) and Vandamm (throughout) do not.&lt;ref&gt;Gulino, P., ''Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach'', Continuum, 2004, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Othello]]'', the audience knows that Desdemona has remained faithful to Othello, but Othello does not. The audience also knows that Iago is scheming to bring about Othello's downfall, a fact hidden from Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Roderigo.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, W. C., ''A Rhetoric of Irony'', University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 63. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Rhetoric_of_Irony.html?id=jbgufPEUD6QC]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]", the reader knows that Montresor is planning on murdering Fortunato, while Fortunato believes they are friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe, Edgar Allan]], ''[[The Cask of Amontillado]]'', The Creative Company, 2008, pp. 22–23.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Cask_of_Amontillado.html?id=4b6PnHfQ1y8C]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Truman Show]]'', the viewer realizes that Truman is on a television show, but Truman himself only gradually learns this.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, A., ''Parallel Lives of Jesus: A Guide to the Four Gospels'', Presbyterian Publishing Corp, 2011, p. 30.

====Tragic irony====
Tragic irony is a special category of dramatic irony. In tragic irony, the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation, which the spectators fully realize. ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' defines this as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
{{Quote|the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned, the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.}}

[[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek drama]] was especially characterized by tragic irony because the audiences were so familiar with the [[legend]]s that most of the plays dramatized. [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' provides a classic example of tragic irony at its fullest. Colebrook writes:&lt;ref&gt;Colebrook, Claire. ''Irony''. London and New York: Routledge, 2004, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|1=Tragic irony is exemplified in ancient drama.... The audience watched a drama unfold, already knowing its destined outcome.... In Sophocles' ''Oedipus the King'', for example, 'we' (the audience) can see what Oedipus is blind to. The man he murders is his father, but he does not know it.}}

Further, Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for the plague that he has caused, not knowing that the murderer he has cursed and vowed to find is himself. The audience knows that Oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking; Oedipus, Creon, and Jocasta do not.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, I. C.; Allan, A.; ''A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 125. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Guide_to_Ancient_Greek_Drama.html?id=z2t1cIVk-A8C]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irony has some of its foundation in the onlooker's perception of [[paradox]] that arises from insoluble problems. For example, in the [[William Shakespeare]] play ''Romeo and Juliet'', when Romeo finds Juliet in a drugged, deathlike sleep, he assumes her to be dead. The audience knows that Juliet has faked her death, yet Romeo believes she is truly dead, and commits suicide. Upon awakening to find her dead lover beside her, Juliet stabs herself with a dagger thus killing herself, too.&lt;ref&gt;William, J., ''Cliffs Complete Romeo and Juliet'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009, pp. 135, 169, 181. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/CliffsComplete_Romeo_and_Juliet.html?id=c7MyAImulJ0C]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situational irony===
Situational irony is a relatively modern use of the term, and describes a sharp discrepancy between the expected result and actual results in a certain situation.
Lars Elleström writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Situational irony'' ... is most broadly defined as a situation where the outcome is incongruous with what was expected, but it is also more generally understood as a situation that includes contradictions or sharp contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;Elleström, L., ''Divine Madness: On Interpreting Literature, Music and the Visual Arts'', Bucknell University Press, 2002, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For example:
*When [[Reagan assassination attempt|John Hinckley attempted to assassinate]] [[Ronald Reagan]], all of his shots initially missed the President; however, a bullet ricocheted off the bullet-proof Presidential limousine and struck Reagan in the chest. Thus, a vehicle made to protect the President from gunfire instead directed gunfire to the president.&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/hinckleyaccount.html The Trial of John W.

[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sounds_Good_on_Paper.html?id=rlBIvHRkExsC]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is a story whose plot revolves around situational irony. Dorothy travels to a wizard and fulfills his challenging demands in order to go home, before discovering she'd had the ability to go back home all along. The Scarecrow longs for [[intelligence]], only to discover he is already a [[genius]], and the [[Tin Woodman]] longs to have a heart, only to discover he is already capable of [[love]]. The Lion, who at first appears to be a whimpering [[coward]], turns out to be bold and fearless. The people in [[Emerald City]] believed the Wizard to be a powerful [[deity]], only to discover that he is a bumbling, eccentric old man with no special powers at all.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

*In [[O. Henry]]'s story "[[The Gift of the Magi]]", a young couple are too poor to buy each other Christmas gifts.  The wife cuts off her treasured hair to sell it to a wig-maker for money to buy her husband a chain for his heirloom pocket watch. She's shocked when she learns he had pawned his watch to buy her a set of combs for her long, beautiful, prized hair. "The double irony lies in the particular way their expectations were foiled." &lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, W. G.; Colston, H. L.; ''Irony in Language and Thought: A Cognitive Science Reader'', Routledge, 2007, p. 59.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Cosmic irony}}Cosmic irony (irony of fate)====
The expression cosmic irony or "irony of fate" stems from the notion that the gods (or the [[Moirai|Fates]]) are amusing themselves by toying with the minds of mortals with deliberate ironic intent. Closely connected with situational irony, it arises from sharp contrasts between reality and human ideals, or between human intentions and actual results. The resulting situation is poignantly contrary to what was expected or intended.

According to Sudhir Dixit, "Cosmic irony is a term that is usually associated with [Thomas] [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]]. ... There is a strong feeling of a hostile [[deus ex machina]] in Hardy's novels." In ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' "there are several instances of this type of irony."&lt;ref&gt;Dixit, S., ''Hardy's Tess Of The D'urbervilles'', Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, 2001, p. 182.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Hardys_Tess_Of_The_Durbervilles.html?id=n45KUGyNsYQC]&lt;/ref&gt; One example follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Hardy|Hardy, Thomas]], ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', Oxford World's Classics, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Justice" was done, and the President of the Immortals (in Æschylean phrase) had ended his sport with Tess.

====Historical irony====
When history is seen through modern eyes, there often appear sharp contrasts between the way historical figures see their world's future and what actually transpires. For example, during the 1920s ''The New York Times'' repeatedly scorned [[crossword|crossword puzzles]]. In 1924, it lamented "the sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern." In 1925 it said "the question of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast." Today, no U.S. newspaper is more closely identified with the crossword than ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puzzles.about.com/library/weekly/blwordplaydoc.htm|title=Puzzles|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318011533/http://puzzles.about.com/library/weekly/blwordplaydoc.htm|archivedate=18 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more tragic example of historical irony, what people now refer to as the "[[First World War]]" was  called by [[H. G. Wells]] "the war that will end war",&lt;ref&gt;[[H. G. Wells|Wells, H. G.]], ''The War That Will End War'', 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; which soon became "[[the war to end war]]" and "the war to end all wars", and this became a widespread truism, almost a [[cliché]]. Historical irony is therefore a subset of cosmic irony, but one in which the element of time is bound to play a role. Another example could be that of the [[Vietnam War]], where in the 1960s the US attempted to stop the [[Viet Cong]] (Viet Minh) taking over South Vietnam. However, it is an often ignored fact that, in 1941, the US originally supported the [[Viet Minh]] in its fight against Japanese occupation.&lt;ref name="Neale, Jonathan page 17"&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', p. 17, {{ISBN|1-898876-67-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to ''The Irony of American History'', [[Andrew Bacevich]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;Bacevich, A., in Niebuhr, R., ''The Irony of American History'', University of Chicago Press, 2010, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=After 9/11, the Bush administration announced its intention of bringing freedom and democracy to the people of the Middle East. Ideologues within the Bush administration persuaded themselves that American power, adroitly employed, could transform that region ... The results speak for themselves.}}

Gunpowder was, according to prevailing academic consensus, discovered in the 9th century by [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemists]] searching for an [[Elixir of life|elixir of immortality]].&lt;ref name="Jack Kelly 2005"&gt;Jack Kelly ''Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World'', Perseus Books Group, 2005, {{ISBN|0465037224}}, 9780465037223: pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical irony also includes [[List of inventors killed by their own inventions|inventors killed by their own creations]], such as [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]] – unless, due to the nature of the invention, the risk of death was always known and accepted, as in the case of [[Otto Lilienthal]], who was killed by flying a glider of his own devising.

In certain kinds of situational or historical irony, a factual truth is highlighted by some person's complete ignorance of it or his belief in its opposite. However, this state of affairs does not occur by human design. In some religious contexts, such situations have been seen as the deliberate work of [[divine providence]] to emphasize truths and to taunt humans for not being aware of them when they could easily have been enlightened (this is similar to human use of irony). Such ironies are often more evident, or more striking, when viewed retrospectively in the light of later developments which make the truth of past situations obvious to all.

Other prominent examples of outcomes now seen as poignantly contrary to expectation include:

*In the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruling in 1856, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] barred any law that would deprive a slaveholder of his property, such as his slaves, upon the incidence of migration into free territory. So, in a sense, the Supreme Court used the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to deny rights to slaves. Also, Chief Justice Taney hoped that the decision would resolve the slavery issue, but instead it helped cause the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Fehrenbacher, D. E., ''Slavery, Law, and Politics: The Dred Scott Case in Historical Perspective'', Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 90.

*In the [[Kalgoorlie]] (Australia) gold rush of the 1890s, large amounts of the little-known mineral [[calaverite]] (gold telluride) were ironically identified as [[fool's gold]]. These mineral deposits were used as a cheap building material, and for the filling of potholes and ruts. When several years later the mineral was identified, there was a minor gold rush to excavate the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Kean, S., ''The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements'', Random House, 2011, pp. 226–228.

*[[John F. Kennedy]]'s last conversation was ironic in light of events which followed seconds later. During the motorcade in Dallas, in response to Mrs. Connolly's comment, "Mr. President, you can't say that Dallas doesn't love you," Kennedy replied, "That's very obvious." Immediately after, he was mortally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplom.org/manus/Presidents/faq/last.html Last words of presidents] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120731092431/http://www.diplom.org/manus/Presidents/faq/last.html |date=2012-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

===Comic irony===
Irony is often used in literature to produce a comic effect.  This may also be combined with [[satire]].  For instance, an author may facetiously state something as a well-known fact and then demonstrate through the narrative that the fact is untrue.

Jane Austen's ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' begins with the proposition "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." In fact, it soon becomes clear that Austen means the opposite: women (or their mothers) are always in search of, and desperately on the lookout for, a rich single man to make a husband. The irony deepens as the story promotes this romance and ends in a double marriage proposal. "Austen's comic irony emerges out of the disjunction between Elizabeth's overconfidence (or pride) in her perceptions of Darcy and the narrator's indications that her views are in fact partial and prejudicial."&lt;ref&gt;Ferriss, S.; Young, M.; ''Chick Lit: The New Woman's Fiction'', Routledge, 2006, p. 77. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Chick_Lit.html?id=lMjey3Bese0C]&lt;/ref&gt;

"''[[The Third Man]]'' is a film that features any number of eccentricities, each of which contributes to the film's perspective of comic irony as well as its overall cinematic self-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. E.; Vice, S.; ''Ethics at the Cinema'', Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 295.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Ethics_at_the_Cinema.html?id=QdP_xLImIugC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about performances of Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' in apartheid South Africa, Robert Gordon suggests: "Could it be that black people in the audience ... may have viewed as a comic irony his audacity and naïvety in thinking he could pass for white."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, R., in ''The Shakespearean  International Yearbook: Special Section, South African Shakespeare in the Twentieth Century'', Volume 9, Ashgate Publishing, 2009. p. 147. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Shakespearean_International_Yearbook.html?id=ZQ3LrE-Iy-kC]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romantic irony and metafiction===
Romantic irony is "an attitude of detached scepticism adopted by an author towards his or her work, typically manifesting in literary self-consciousness and self-reflection". This conception of irony originated with the German Romantic writer and critic [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "romantic irony" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Dane writes "From a twentieth-century perspective, the most crucial area in the history of irony is that described by the term romantic irony." He discusses the difficulty of defining romantic irony: "But what is romantic irony? A universal type of irony? The irony used by romantics? or an irony envisioned by the romantics and romanticists?" He also describes the arguments for and against its use.&lt;ref&gt;Dane, J. A., ''The Critical Mythology of Irony'', University of Georgia Press, 2011, Ch. 5 [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Critical_Mythology_of_Irony.html?id=6EAw-H8zvDkC]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to earlier self-conscious works such as [[Don Quixote]] and [[Tristram Shandy]], Douglas Muecke points particularly to [[Peter Weiss]]'s 1964 play, ''[[Marat/Sade]]''. This work is a play within a play set in a lunatic asylum, in which it is difficult to tell whether the players are speaking only to other players or also directly to the audience. When The Herald says, "The regrettable incident you've just seen was unavoidable indeed foreseen by our playwright", there is confusion as to who is being addressed, the "audience" on the stage or the audience in the theatre. Also, since the play within the play is performed by the inmates of a lunatic asylum, the theatre audience cannot tell whether the paranoia displayed before them is that of the players, or the people they are portraying. Muecke notes that, "in America, Romantic irony has had a bad press", while "in England ... [it] is almost unknown."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Compass_of_Irony.html?id=7PsNAAAAQAAJ Muecke, DC., ''The Compass of Irony'', Routledge, 1969. pp. 178–180]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a book entitled ''English Romantic Irony'', Anne Mellor writes, referring to Byron, Keats, Carlyle, Coleridge, and Lewis Carroll:&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, Anne K., ''English Romantic Irony'', Harvard University Press, 1980, pp. 4, 187.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/English_romantic_irony.html?id=M_C1AAAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|1=Romantic irony is both a philosophical conception of the universe and an artistic program. Ontologically, it sees the world as fundamentally chaotic. No order, no far goal of time, ordained by God or right reason, determines the progression of human or natural events.... Of course, romantic irony itself has more than one mode. The style of romantic irony varies from writer to writer.... But however distinctive the voice, a writer is a romantic ironist if and when his or her work commits itself enthusiastically both in content and form to a hovering or unresolved debate between a world of merely man-made being and a world of ontological becoming.}}

Similarly, [[metafiction]] is: "Fiction in which the author self-consciously alludes to the artificiality or literariness of a work by parodying or departing from novelistic conventions (esp. naturalism) and narrative techniques."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "metafiction" entry.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of fiction that self-consciously addresses the devices of fiction, thereby exposing the fictional illusion.

Gesa Giesing writes that "the most common form of metafiction is particularly frequent in Romantic literature. The phenomenon is then referred to as Romantic Irony." Giesing notes that "There has obviously been an increased interest in metafiction again after World War II."&lt;ref&gt;Giesing, G., ''Metafictional Aspects in Novels by Muriel Spark'', GRIN Verlag, 2004, p. 6.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Metafictional_Aspects_in_Novels_by_Murie.html?id=4gRwgvoY_ysC]&lt;/ref&gt;

For examples, Patricia Waugh quotes from several works at the top of her chapter headed "What is metafiction?". These include:

"The thing is this./ That of all the several ways of beginning a book ... I am confident my own way of doing it is best" - ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''

"Since I've started this story, I've gotten boils ..." - ''The death of the novel and other stories'' by [[Ronald Sukenick]]&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, P., ''Metafiction: The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction'', Routledge, 2002, p. 1.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Metafiction.html?id=O2MkrWv6RIUC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction'' refers to [[John Fowles]]'s ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, B., ''The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction'', Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp. 108–109.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Cambridge_Introduction_to_Postmodern.html?id=PoKi_TnntzcC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the first twelve chapters ... the reader has been able to immerse him or herself in the story, enjoying the kind of 'suspension of disbelief ' required of realist novels ... what follows is a remarkable act of metafictional 'frame-breaking'. Chapter 13 notoriously begins:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do not know. This story I am telling is all imagination. These characters I create never existed outside my own mind. ... if this is a novel, it cannot be a novel in the modern sense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Socratic irony===&lt;!--'Socratic irony' redirects here--&gt;
{{Main article|Socratic method}}
'''Socratic irony'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is "the dissimulation of ignorance practised by [[Socrates]] as a means of confuting an adversary".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Socrates would pretend to be ignorant of the topic under discussion, to draw out the inherent nonsense in the arguments of his interlocutors. ''[[The Chambers Dictionary]]'' defines it as "a means by which a questioner pretends to know less than a respondent, when actually he knows more".

Zoe Williams of ''The Guardian'' wrote: "The technique [of Socratic irony], demonstrated in the Platonic dialogues, was to pretend ignorance and, more sneakily, to feign credence in your opponent's power of thought, in order to tie him in knots."&lt;ref name="Guardian Online: The Final Irony"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2 |title=Online: The Final Irony |publisher=Guardian |date=28 June 2003 |access-date=12 December 2010 |location=London |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131104230808/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2 |archive-date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more modern example of Socratic irony can be seen on the American crime fiction television series, ''[[Columbo]]''.  The character Lt. Columbo is seemingly naïve and incompetent.  His untidy appearance adds to this fumbling illusion.  As a result, he is underestimated by the suspects in murder cases he is investigating.  With their guard down and their false sense of confidence, Lt. Columbo is able to solve the cases, leaving the murderers feeling duped and outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, G. ''How to Be a Philosopher: Or How to Be Almost Certain That Almost Nothing Is Certain,'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irony as infinite, absolute negativity===
Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and others, see irony, such as that used by Socrates, as a disruptive force with the power to undo texts and readers alike.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, S, ''The concept of irony with continuous reference to Socrates'' (1841), Harper &amp; Row, 1966, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase itself is taken from [[Hegel]]'s ''[[Lectures on Aesthetics]]'', and is applied by Kierkegaard to the irony of Socrates. This tradition includes 19th-century German critic and novelist [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] ("On Incomprehensibility"), [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stendhal]], and the 20th century [[deconstruction]]ist [[Paul de Man]] ("The Concept of Irony"). In Kierkegaard's words, from [[On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Socratic] irony [is] the infinite absolute negativity. It is negativity, because it only negates; it is infinite, because it does not negate this or that phenomenon; it is absolute, because that by virtue of which it negates is a higher something that still is not. The irony established nothing, because that which is to be established lies behind it...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sorenkierkegaard.org/concept-of-irony.html|title=Kierkegaard, D. Anthony Storm's Commentary on - The Concept of Irony|author=|date=|website=sorenkierkegaard.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009222139/http://sorenkierkegaard.org/concept-of-irony.html|archivedate=9 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where much of philosophy attempts to reconcile opposites into a larger positive project, Kierkegaard and others insist that irony—whether expressed in complex games of authorship or simple [[litotes]]—must, in Kierkegaard's words, "swallow its own stomach". Irony entails endless reflection and violent reversals, and ensures incomprehensibility at the moment it compels speech. Similarly, among other literary critics, writer [[David Foster Wallace]] viewed the pervasiveness of ironic and other [[postmodern]] tropes as the cause of "great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that for aspiring fictionists [ironies] pose terrifically vexing problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=David Foster|title=E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction|journal=Review of Contemporary Fiction|volume=13|issue=2|pages=151–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irony and awkwardness===

The '90s saw an expansion of the definition of irony from "saying what one doesn't mean" into a "general stance of&amp;nbsp;detachment&amp;nbsp;from life in general",&lt;ref&gt;Kotsko, Adam, ''Awkwardness.'', O-Books, 2010, pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt; this detachment serving as a shield against the awkwardness of everyday life. Humor from that era (most notably, ''[[Seinfeld]]'') relies on the audience watching the show with some detachment from the show's typical signature awkward situations.

The generation of people in the United States who grew up in the 90s, [[Millennials]], are seen as having this same sort of detachment from serious or awkward situations in life, as well. [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipsters]] are thought to use irony as a shield against those same serious or genuine confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/|title=How to Live Without Irony|first=Christy|last=Wampole|date=17 November 2012|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325230612/https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/|archivedate=25 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misuse==

Some speakers of English complain that the words ''irony'' and ''ironic'' are often misused,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/06/05/how-learned-love-alanis-morissette-irony/Em8dl58iYReUmXrYElJOPN/story.html|title=Learning to love Alanis Morissette’s ‘irony’ - The Boston Globe|author=|date=|website=bostonglobe.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125191124/http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/06/05/how-learned-love-alanis-morissette-irony/Em8dl58iYReUmXrYElJOPN/story.html|archivedate=25 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the more general casual usage of a contradiction between circumstance and expectation originates in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=irony|title=irony - Origin and meaning of irony by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614210204/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=irony|archivedate=14 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{examples needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Dan Shaughnessy]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;
We were always kidding about the use of irony. I maintained that it was best never to use the word because it was too often substituted for coincidence. (Alanis Morissette's song [[Ironic (song)|"Isn't it Ironic?"]] cites multiple examples of things that are patently not ironic.)&lt;ref&gt;Shaughnessy, D., ''Senior Year: A Father, A Son, and High School Baseball'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008, pp. 91-92.

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tim Conley cites the following:
"Philip Howard assembled a list of seven implied meanings for the word "ironically", as it opens a sentence:
# By a tragic coincidence
# By an exceptional coincidence
# By a curious coincidence
# By a coincidence of no importance
# You and I know, of course, though other less intelligent mortals walk benighted under the midday sun
# Oddly enough, or it's a rum thing that
# Oh hell! I've run out of words to start a sentence with."&lt;ref&gt;Conley, T., ''Joyces Mistakes: Problems of Intention, Irony, and Interpretation'', University of Toronto Press, 2011, p. 81.

==Punctuation==
{{main article|Irony punctuation}}
No agreed-upon method for indicating irony in written text exists, though many ideas have been suggested. For instance, an [[Irony punctuation|irony punctuation mark]] was proposed in the 1580s, when Henry Denham introduced a rhetorical question mark or [[percontation point]], which resembles a reversed question mark. This mark was also advocated by the French poet Marcel Bernhardt at the end of the 19th century, to indicate irony or [[sarcasm]]. French writer [[Hervé Bazin]] suggested another ''pointe d'ironie'': the Greek letter ''[[Psi (letter)|psi]]'' {{lang|el|Ψ}} with a dot below it, while [[Tom Driberg]] recommended that ironic statements should be printed in italics that lean the other way from conventional italics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3fbWAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Houston, K., ''Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2013, pp. 211-244.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808104355/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3fbWAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=2016-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Lookism''' is discriminatory treatment toward people considered physically [[unattractive]], mainly in the workplace but also in dating and other social settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Lookism | publisher = The Free Dictionary | url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/lookism | accessdate = September 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While not classified in the same way as racial, cultural, sexual discrimination, "lookism" is widespread and affects how people are perceived as well as affecting their opportunities in terms of romantic relationships, job opportunities, etc.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[Physical attractiveness]] is associated with good things; in contrast, physical unattractiveness is associated with negative things. Many people make judgments of others based on their physical appearance that influence how they respond to those people. Research on the "What is beautiful is good" stereotype shows that, overall, those who are physically attractive benefit from their good looks: physically attractive individuals are perceived more positively and physical attractiveness has a strong influence on judgment of a person's competence.&lt;ref name="Eagly et al., 1991)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = Alice| last2 = Ashmore | first2 = Richard | last3 = Makhijani| first3 = Mona G.| last4 = Longo| first4 = Laura C.| year = 1991 | title = What is beautiful is good, but. | journal = Psychological Bulletin| volume = 110 | pages = 109–128 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.110.1.109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, physically attractive people benefit from these stereotypical beliefs. Research shows that on average, physically attractive individuals have more friends, better social skills, and more active sex lives. However, attractiveness does not have any effect on the level of happiness experienced by the individual.&lt;ref name="Rhodes, Simmons, &amp; Peters, 2005)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhodes | first1 =  Gillian | last2 =  Simmons | first2 = Leigh | last3= Peters | first3= Marianne | year = 2005 | title = Attractiveness and Sexual Behavior: Does Attractiveness Enhance Mating Success?| journal = Evolution and Human Behavior| volume = 26 | issue =  2 | pages = 186–201 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2004.08.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicology==
Though the term "lookism" is of recent coinage, cultures and traditions worldwide have often warned against placing undue value on physical appearance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To judge by appearances is to get entangled in the Veil of Maya [in Buddhist thought] ... From ancient times until relatively recently, there was widespread worry about lookism, because the appearance of others may deceive, especially in romance, or it may be personally or politically imprudent to judge or act on appearances. Judging by appearances was prohibited by monotheistic religions ("no graven images") and criticized in ancient and medieval philosophies. [[Philosophical skepticism|Skeptics]], [[Stoics]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], [[Epicureans]] and [[Scholastics]] elaborated various reasons to avoid or subordinate the role of appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Tietje and Steven Cresap (2005). "[https://mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_2.pdf Is Lookism Unjust? The History and Ethics of Aesthetics and Public Policy Implications]." ''Journal of Libertarian Studies'', Vol. 19 No. 2, Spring 2005, pp. 31–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the term "lookism" was first coined in the 1970s within the [[fat acceptance movement]]. It was used in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' Magazine in 1978, which asserted that the term was coined by fat people who created the word to refer to "discrimination based on looks."&lt;ref&gt;John Ayto, ''20th Century Words'', Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word appears in several major English language dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com Bartleby.com] — "[http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/L0246450.html Lookism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205050857/http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/L0246450.html |date=2008-12-05 }}". ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.'' 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some overlap between the terms teratophobia, cacophobia and lookism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Scherer, Bee. "Buddhism and disability: toward a socially engaged Buddhist ‘theology’of bodily inclusiveness." Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Universities (JIABU) 9.1 (2017): 26–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Narozny, W. A. L. D. E. M. A. R., J. E. R. Z. Y. Kuczkowski, and B. O. G. U. S. L. A. W. Mikaszewski. "Measuring severity of tinnitus with a visual analog scale." Am Fam Physician 71.5 (2005): 855–856.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Lookism has received scholarly attention both from a [[cultural studies]] and an [[economics]] perspective. In the former context, lookism relates to preconceived notions of [[beauty]] and cultural [[stereotyping]] based on appearance as well as [[gender role]]s and expectations. Important economic considerations include the question of income gaps based on looks, as well as increased or decreased productivity from workers considered beautiful or ugly by their co-workers. Due to this, new problems arise that are tied to other social issues like racism and ageism (young over old). The idea of beauty is also linked directly to social class because people who have more free time and money have the ability to work on their appearance. Weight is also linked to social class because people who are overweight do not have the exercise equipment or the healthy food choices that wealthier people do. Judging people on the basis of attractiveness decreases a person's self-esteem leading to a negative self-image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grollman|first1=Dr. Eric Anthony|title=Prejudice And Attraction: Is Beauty Really In The Beholder's Eye?|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/prejudice-attraction-beauty-beholders-eye/|website=Kinsey Confidential|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have examined this phenomenon among [[gay men]]. According to the block quote on page 117 of a 2004 work by Todd Morrison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Michelangelo Signorile]] (in a 1997 overview of contemporary trends in the gay male community) described "body fascism" as&lt;blockquote&gt;the setting of a rigid set of standards of physical beauty that pressures everyone within a particular group to conform to them. Any person who doesn't meet those very specific standards is deemed physically unattractive and sexually undesirable. In a culture in which the physical body is held in such high esteem and given such power, body fascism then not only deems those who don't or can't conform to be sexually less desirable, but in the extreme – sometimes dubbed "looksism" – also deems an individual completely worthless ''as a person,'' based solely on his exterior. In this sense it is not unlike racism or sexism or homophobia itself. ... (p. 28)&lt;ref name="Morrison"&gt;Morrison, Todd Eclectic Views on Gay Male Pornography: Pornucopia, Volume 47, Psychology Press,  {{ISBN|9781560232919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Empirical support==
According to [[Nancy Etcoff]], a psychologist at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], "we face a world where lookism is one of the most pervasive but denied prejudices".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/27/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-8-27-00-on-language-lookism.html "The Way We Live Now: 8-27-00: On Language; Lookism"], ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', August 27, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to several studies, Angela Stalcup writes that "The evidence clearly indicates that not only is there a premium for prettiness in Western culture, there is also penalty for plainness."&lt;ref&gt;Angela Stalcup. [http://angelastalcup.com/sample_article.pdf ''The Plainness Penalty: Lookism in Western Culture''.]&lt;/ref&gt; When discrimination on the grounds of a person's appearance turns into fear or conveyed aversion, it is referred to as cacophobia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Sometimes cacophobia may be internalized and thus directed inwards rather than towards others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/10/28/2003603118|title=Woman sues clinic after it refuses her cosmetic surgery – Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on newborns have found that human infants as young as 14 hours from birth prefer to look at attractive faces rather than unattractive faces.&lt;ref name=gaze&gt;New Scientist, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6355-babies-prefer-to-gaze-upon-beautiful-faces/ Babies prefer to gaze upon beautiful faces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newborn&gt;Slater et al., [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016363839890011X Newborn infants prefer attractive faces]&lt;/ref&gt; The preference also extends to non-human animals such as cats.&lt;ref name=conspecifics&gt;Quinn et al., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2566458/ Preference for attractive faces in human infants extends beyond conspecifics]&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that lookism is an innate product of how the human visual system functions.&lt;ref name=asa&gt;American Psychological Association, [http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct06/pretty.aspx Pretty faces: Easy on the brain?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by [[Dan Ariely]] found that American women exhibit a marked preference for dating taller men, and that for shorter men to be judged attractive by women, they must earn substantially more money than taller men.&lt;ref&gt;"Ariely found that a 5'4" man would need to make $229,000 more than a 6' man to have equal appeal; a 5'6" man would need $183,000 more; a 5'10" man would need $32,000 more." Lori Gottlieb (2010). ''Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough''. Penguin, {{ISBN|9781101185209}} p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Ethics===
In the article "Is Lookism Unjust", Louis Tietje and Steven Cresap discuss when discrimination based on looks can legitimately be described as unjust.&lt;ref name = "xxx"&gt;Louis Tietje and Steven Cresap. (2005). "[https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_2.pdf Is Lookism Unjust?: The Ethics of Aesthetics and Public Policy Implications]". ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'' 19 (2): 31–50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tietje and Cresap quote evidence that suggests there exists "a 7–to–9 percent 'penalty' for being in the lowest 9 percent of looks among all workers, and a 5 percent 'premium' for being in the top 33 percent". While accepting that the evidence indicates that such discrimination does occur, the authors argue that it has been pervasive throughout history and that judgments of aesthetics appear to be a biological adaptation (rather than culturally conditioned) to aid reproduction, survival and social interaction, allowing people to determine viable mates (level of attractiveness being indicative of health) and the status of others as "friend or enemy, threat or opportunity". The authors also argue that if physical attractiveness can improve a company's success, then awarding people for it is justifiable, as the trait is thus relevant to the job and discrimination only occurs when irrelevant traits are used. In addition, the authors question the practicality of both redressing any injustices based on lookism and of determining whether such injustices have in fact occurred. Thus the authors conclude that there can be no clear model of injustice in such discrimination, nor would legislation to address it be practicable – "We do not see how any policy interventions to redress beauty discrimination can be justified."&lt;ref name = "xxx"/&gt;

==Political lookism==
Lookism has been an issue in politics for centuries, with a long tradition in the United Kingdom of "mercilessly exaggerat[ing]" the physical flaws of politicians in newspaper cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Johnathan (2012). "[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/10/too-ugly-for-politics-ed-miliband Can you be too ugly for politics?]", ''The Guardian'' 10 January 2012; accessed 19 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1960#Debates|1960 Presidential race between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon]], it was often believed that Kennedy's more conventionally handsome appearance contributed to his winning more approval in their first televised debate,&lt;ref name="museum.tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=kennedy-nixon |title=THE KENNEDY-NIXON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, 1960 – The Museum of Broadcast Communications |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications (MBC) |date= |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some researchers have challenged this widespread idea and argued that Kennedy's appearance had little or no influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978709368226 |title=The myth of viewer‐listener disagreement in the first Kennedy‐Nixon debate|journal=Central States Speech Journal|volume=38|pages=16|publisher=The Central States Speech Journal  |year= 1987 |accessdate=August 7, 2012|doi=10.1080/10510978709368226|last1=Vancil|first1=David L.|last2=Pendell|first2=Sue D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several variables that might contribute to the objectification of masculinity and femininity in politics. Scholar Charlotte Hooper argued that "gender intersects with other social divisions such as class, race and sexuality to produce complex hierarchies of (gendered) identities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hooper|first=Charlotte|title=Masculinities, IR and the 'gender variable': a cost-benefit analysis for (sympathetic) gender sceptics|journal=Review of International Studies|year=1999|volume=25|issue=3|pages=475–480|doi=10.1017/s0260210599004751}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hooper argues that institutional practices, such as military combat in war, have greatly defined what it means to be a man. Furthermore, the symbolic dimension, which includes sports, media, current affairs, etc. has "disseminate[d] a wealth of popular iconography which links Western masculinities to the wider world beyond the borders of the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hooper|first=Charlotte|title=Masculinities, IR and the 'gender variable': a cost-benefit analysis for (sympathetic) gender sceptics|journal=Review of International Studies|year=1999|volume=25|issue=3|pages=475–580|doi=10.1017/s0260210599004751}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where the ideology of lookism is firmly entrenched according to Hooper. Similarly, Laura Shepherd suggests that men are required to fit into the "matrix of intelligibility"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Laura J.|title=Sex or Gender? Bodies in World Politics and Why Gender Matters|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; by acting a certain way, dressing a certain way, and have a mentality that is devoid of emotion or anything effeminate; if they are successful in becoming the ultimate "man's man" then they are virtually untouchable. However, others have suggested that there is only an explicit interest in the analysis of masculinity within this political sphere, it will be impossible to develop a reliable analysis of femininity within this same sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Enloe|first=Cynthia|title='Gender' is not enough: the need for a feminist consciousness|journal=International Affairs |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing examples from [[Madeleine Albright]]'s TED talk in 2010, "On Being a Woman and Diplomat", Albright expressed her frustrations with how her male colleagues and media commentators would pick apart her appearance. Being the first female Secretary of State for the United States, Albright was in the spotlight on the domestic and international stage; everything from her age, weight, hairstyle and choice of dress were scrutinized; yet ironically, the policy positions she believed to be her most important accomplishments (initiation of the G7, attempts to promote gender equality, etc.) were hardly taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Albright|first=Madeleine|title=On Being a Woman and a Diplomat|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/madeleine_albright_on_being_a_woman_and_a_diplomat.html|work=TED Talk|publisher=TEDwomen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Albright's general appearance didn't fit into the narrow category of "attractive" made it even more difficult for her to navigate the space between being a woman and a diplomat. Albright is not the only woman in a position of power, or otherwise, that has been discriminated against because of her appearance. An article published in ''The Washington Post'' in 2005 labeled Secretary of State, [[Condoleezza Rice]], as a "[[dominatrix]]" when she stepped out in knee-high black-heeled boots during a visit to Wiesbaden Military Base in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Givhan|first=Robin|title=Condoleezza Rice's Commanding Clothes|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the article was meant to give credit to Rice for "challeng[ing] expectations and assumptions",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gavhin|first=Robin|title=Condoleezza Rice's Commanding Clothes|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; some{{who|date=October 2013}} argue that the article gave her a hyper-sexualized image, and further removed the audience from focusing on the purpose of her visit to the military place. Similarly, media commentators have often chosen to report on Hillary Clinton's "man suits" and Julia Gillard's short hairstyle, instead of focusing on these women's professional accomplishments.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican Vice-Presidential candidate, was the subject of much media attention due to her conventionally attractive appearance,&lt;ref&gt;Frick, Ali (2008).

==Law==

===United States===
Until the 1970s, lookism in the [[United States]] was sometimes codified into law.

{{Citation style|date=January 2010}}

'''Micrography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], literally small-writing – "Μικρογραφία"), also called '''microcalligraphy''', is a [[Jew]]ish form of [[calligram]]s developed in the 9th century, with parallels in Christianity and Islam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/134.htm Torah, Bible, Coran] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing minute [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] to form representational, geometric and abstract designs. Colored micrography is especially distinctive because these rare artworks are customarily rendered in black and white.

== Description ==
The artwork is created from text that forms an image when viewed at a distance, creating an interplay between the text and image. The [[photomosaic]], whose tiny individual images form a mosaic when viewed from a distance, is a modern analogue.

== Motivation ==
{{see also|Calligram}}
[[File:Caligrafia arabe pajaro.jpg|thumb|An Arabic [[calligram]] in the form of a peacock.]]
There is a relationship between this form of art, employing both digital and analogic symbols, and the restrictions on images found in the [[Ten commandments#Traditional division and interpretation|second commandment]]. Micrography provides a unique solution to the visual artist who wishes to remain devout in observation of [[Jewish law]], by using only text, not images per se. As similar restrictions exist in certain [[Islam|Muslim]] societies, this solution has been adapted in [[Islamic calligraphy]] to the [[Arabic alphabet]] as well.

{{Main|Tulsa, Oklahoma}}
'''[[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]]''' is the second-largest city in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Oklahoma]]. It has many diverse neighborhoods due to its size.

[[Downtown Tulsa]] is an area of approximately {{convert|1.4|sqmi|km2}} surrounded by an inner-dispersal loop created by Interstate 244, Highway 64, and Highway 75. The area serves as Tulsa's financial and business district, and is the focus of a large initiative to draw tourism, which includes plans to capitalize on the area's historic architecture. Much of Tulsa's convention space is located in downtown, such as the [[Tulsa Performing Arts Center]], the [[Tulsa Convention Center]], and the [[BOK Center]]. Prominent downtown sub-districts include the Blue Dome District, the Brady Arts District, the "Oil Capital Historic District", the Greenwood Historical District, [[Owen Park]] Historical Neighborhood, and the site of [[ONEOK Field]], a baseball stadium for the [[Tulsa Drillers]] opened in 2010.

The city's historical residential core lies in an area known as Midtown, containing upscale neighborhoods built in the early 20th century with architecture ranging from art deco to [[Greek Revival]]. The University of Tulsa, the [[Swan Lake (Tulsa)|Swan Lake]] neighborhood, [[Philbrook Museum]], and the upscale shopping districts of [[Utica Square]], Cherry Street, and Brookside are located in this region. A large portion of the city's southern half has developed since the 1970s, containing low density housing and retail developments. This region, marked by secluded homes and suburban neighborhoods, contains one of the state's largest shopping malls, [[Woodland Hills Mall]], as well as [[Southern Hills Country Club]], and Oral Roberts University.

East of Highway 169 and north of 61st street, a diverse racial makeup marks the eastern portions of the city, with large [[Asian people|Asian]] and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] communities and much of the city's manufacturing industry.

Areas of Tulsa west of the Arkansas River are called [[West Tulsa]], and are marked by large parks, wilderness reserves, and large oil refineries. The northern tier of the city is home to [[OSU-Tulsa]], [[Gilcrease Museum]], [[Tulsa International Airport]], the [[Tulsa Zoo]], the [[Tulsa Air and Space Museum]], and the nation's third-largest municipal park, Mohawk Park.

==Downtown==
{{Main|Downtown Tulsa}}
[[Image:Downtown Tulsa OK.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Tulsa]]
Tulsa includes many structures built during the Oil Boom in the 1920s and 1930s, including [[Art Deco]] buildings such as [[Boston Avenue Methodist Church]] and [[Union Depot (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Tulsa Union Depot]]. [[Waite Phillips]] left a significant architectural impact on downtown Tulsa through the [[Philtower Building|Philtower]] and [[Philcade Building]].  Other notable downtown Tulsa buildings include the Exchange Bank Building (today known as the [[320 South Boston Building]], the Cosden Building (later expanded into today's [[Mid-Continent Tower]]),  [[Atlas Life Building]], [[Holy Family Cathedral in Tulsa|Holy Family Cathedral]], Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, and the [[Mayo Hotel]].

The core downtown area was designated on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Oil Capital Historic District (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Oil Capital Historic District]] in 2010.
[[Image:BostonAvenueMethodist.jpg|thumb|left|Boston Avenue Methodist Church]]

Downtown Tulsa is in the northwest quadrant of the city and is ringed by an expressway called the [[Interstate 444|Inner Dispersal Loop]]. Downtown's buildings include many large office towers. At {{convert|667|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the [[BOK Tower]] (formerly One Williams Center) was the tallest building in any of the 5 "plains states" ([[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]]) until the [[Devon Tower]] in Oklahoma City was completed in 2012. The BOK Tower was designed in 1975 by [[Minoru Yamasaki]] &amp; Associates, the same architect who designed the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]].

The [[Tulsa Performing Arts Center]] occupies a half city block in Tulsa's historical downtown. The PAC is also the design of [[Minoru Yamasaki]]. It houses five theatres and a reception hall. More than a quarter of a million people visit the Center each year to attend a performance from one of Tulsa's seven acclaimed musical and dramatic companies including the [[Tulsa Ballet]], [[Tulsa Symphony Orchestra]], [[Tulsa Opera]], [[Theatre Tulsa]], and a variety of symphonic groups. The PAC hosts a multitude of cultural events through the fall, winter and spring.

In 2005 the City of Tulsa broke ground on a 19,199 seat regional events center designed by [[architect]] [[César Pelli]]. The arena was named the [[BOK Center]] (or [[Bank of Oklahoma Center]]) and opened on August 30, 2008.

Its period of architectural significance was 1913 - 1933. One of the supporting properties, the [[James Alexander Veasey House]] at 1802 South Cheyenne Avenue West, was added to the NRHP in its own right on July 27, 1989.

===The Pearl District===
The Pearl District is emerging as a cultural hub just east of downtown. Once suffering from significant blight, The Pearl District has seen fervent restoration and new business development thanks to a concerted infill effort on the part of the City of Tulsa,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cityoftulsa.org/COTlegacy/documents/3ExecutiveSummary.pdf Reinventing the Pearl District.

==Midtown==
Midtown is a largely residential district in the heart of the city. This area consists mostly of homes built from the early 1900s to the 1950s and has a wide variety of American styles ranging from the [[American Craftsman|Craftsman bungalow]] to the [[ranch-style house|ranch-style home]] to [[Greek Revival]]. The neighborhood is even home to a relocated saltbox home from colonial New England. Schools in this part of the city include [[Bishop Kelley High School|Bishop Kelley]], [[Edison Preparatory School]], Eliot Elementary, Francis Scott Key Elementary, Monte Cassino, Robert E. Lee Elementary, Patrick Henry Elementary, Wright Elementary and Undercroft Montessori. [[Woodward Park, Tulsa|Woodward Park]], located in Midtown, is known for its [[azalea]]s and gardens and is a popular destination for [[photography]] and [[picnics]]. Other popular Midtown Parks include Swan Lake, Zink Park, Darlington Park and Whiteside Park.

[[Utica Square]], Tulsa's first suburban shopping center, is an upscale outdoor center with a mix of locally owned retailers, including Miss Jackson's, Tulsa's oldest department store, and national chains.  Adjacent to Utica Square is [[Temple Israel (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Temple Israel]], a [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] congregation housed in a building by prolific synagogue architect [[Percival Goodman]], and [[Cascia Hall Preparatory School]], a [[University-preparatory school|college preparatory school]] now also known as a key location in the [[fantasy]]/[[Horror fiction|horror]] ''[[House of Night (series)|House of Night]]'' novel series written by [[P.C. Cast]] and Kristin Cast. Tulsa's conservative synagogue, [[B'nai Emunah]], is also located in Midtown.

[[File:HouseofNight4.jpg|left|thumb|A courtyard in Utica Square]]

Some of the other major shopping centers in this part of the city include the Promenade Mall, Highland Park Shopping Center, Southroads, Ranch Acres, The Farm Shopping Center, and The Plaza. [[University of Oklahoma|OU]]-[http://www.tulsa.ouhsc.edu/ Tulsa] is across the street from the Promenade Mall at 41st and Yale, on the southern edge of Midtown.

In northeast Midtown, the Tulsa State Fairgrounds, now called [[Expo Square]], is home to several Tulsa landmarks. In addition to the site being the former home to the [[minor league baseball]] [[Tulsa Drillers]], the [[Art Deco]] [[Expo Square Pavilion]], the Fair Meadows horse racing track, and the annual Tulsa State Fair, it boasts the Quick Trip Expo Center, the largest clearspan building in the world, providing 354,000 square feet (33,000 m²) of column-free space under a cable-suspended roof. In front of the Expo Center is the [[Golden Driller]], standing 76 feet (23 m) tall. Built in 1966 as a symbol for the International Petroleum Expo, the statue serves as a reminder of Tulsa's oily past.

The Expo Center is also home to the annual Darryl Starbird Rod and Custom Show. Held in early February, it is touted as 'The World's Largest Indoor Car Show' and often draws around 1,500 custom and classic cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Antique car auctions are also held here and draw many visitors from across the nation.

===Arkansas River Parks===
The Tulsa area boasts nearly {{convert|40|mi|km}} of [[river]] shoreline along the [[Arkansas River]]. River Parks lines more than {{convert|20|mi|km}} of that stretch, spread along both banks of the 1/4 mile wide channel and connected by a [http://cdm15020.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16063coll1/id/1702 pedestrian bridge] between 21st and 31st streets. River Parks is a popular destination for outdoor recreation. Miles of asphalt-surfaced recreation trails weave past picnic areas, [[playgrounds]], [[fountains]] and [[sculptures]]. The park's landscape ranges from manicured lawns to the rugged terrain of the [[Turkey Mountain (Oklahoma)|Turkey Mountain Urban Wilderness Area]]. Recreation in River Parks includes [[fishing]], [[Watercraft rowing|rowing]], [[kayaking]], [[disc golf]], [[hiking]], [[biking]] and [[horseback riding]].

During the spring, summer, and early fall, concerts, festivals and the state's largest free [[fireworks]] display (on the [[Fourth of July]]) are popular draws to the river. The festival park on the river's west bank is the site of Tulsa's [http://www.tulsaoktoberfest.org/ Oktoberfest], one of the oldest and largest in the U.S.

===Cherry Street===
[[Image:SwanLake.jpg|thumb|right|Swan Lake]]
The Cherry Street District is set near downtown in the northern midtown area, defined by a portion of 15th Street dubbed "Cherry Street." 15th Street has been a major east-west thoroughfare in Tulsa since This street was named Cherry Street prior to the early 1900s, when a city ordinance mandated a numerical street name. The eastern and western boundaries of the present-day district are rather vaguely defined in common usage. A 1992 article in the ''Tulsa World'' stated that the district extends from Peoria Avenue on the west to Utica Avenue on the east.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.tulsalibrary.org/content.php?pid=210234&amp;sid=2702864#9396387 "What is the history of Cherry Street?"] Tulsa City-County Library.

[[File:McGregor House (Tulsa, Oklahoma).jpg|thumb|right|McGregor House]]
South Quaker Avenue intersects Cherry Street one block east of Peoria. The 1400 block of South Quaker contains five houses of historical interest because they represent the style of homes constructed during the very early 1920s.

===Lortondale===
This is a subdivision of modern homes along South Yale Avenue near 26th Street.   Based on a master plan by Tulsa architect Donald Honn, the low-pitch roofs and clean lines of the houses typify the style known as Mid-Century Modern, and the neighborhood was the city's first housing development with a community pool.  Construction began in 1953 and all Lortondale homes featured central heating and air conditioning—reportedly the first such subdivision in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;David R.

Tulsa's north side originally referred to the area north of the Frisco Railroad tracks up to the northern city limits. It was annexed by the city of Tulsa in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Tulsa Preservation Commission Website. "Urban Development (1901 - 1945)." Accessed May 5, 2011.[http://www.tulsapreservationcommission.org/history/urban/]&lt;/ref&gt; The north side is home to a large percentage of Tulsa's [[African-American]] community in addition to working-class Tulsans of other races and ethnicities.

==="Black Wall Street:" The Greenwood Historical District===
{{Main|Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma}}

The [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood Historical District]] is just north of downtown and east of the Brady District. It was once one of the most affluent African-American communities in the United States and referred to as Black Wall Street.  In 1921, thirty-five blocks of businesses and residences were burned in this district during the infamous [[Tulsa Race Riot]], the bloodiest racial riot in the history of the United States. The [[Oklahoma Legislature]] passed laws in 2001 aimed at revitalizing Greenwood, setting up a [[scholarship]] fund for college-bound descendants of riot victims and appropriating $2 million for a riot memorial. As of 2004, two blocks of the old neighborhood have been restored and are part of the Greenwood Historical District. It is now home to the Greenwood Cultural Center, the Tulsa Race Riot Memorial, and the John Hope Franklin Center for Reconciliation, as well as [[Oklahoma State University - Tulsa]] and [[Langston University]]-Tulsa.

===Brady Arts District===
The Brady Arts District is located north across the Sante Fe Railroad tracks from the central business district and centered at Main Street &amp; Brady Avenue. The Brady District is one of Tulsa's oldest areas, characterized by two-story brick warehouses.

[[Image:Cains Ballroom Tulsa Night.jpg|thumb|right|Cain's Ballroom]]

The [[Brady Theater]], built between 1912 and 1914, was originally designed to serve as the city's municipal auditorium and was simply called "Convention Hall" for the first forty years of its life and was one of three internment camps where African Americans were detained after the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot.  In 1952, major additions were added and the building was renamed Tulsa Municipal Theater.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  Supplanted as the city auditorium in 1979 by construction of the Performing Arts Center in downtown, "the Old Lady on Brady" continues to be used today for a wide variety of concerts and theatrical productions.

North of the Brady on Main Street is the [[Cain's Ballroom]], formerly the garage of the Brady family&lt;ref&gt;''This Land'', "The Nightmare of Dreamland." Accessed September 12, 2011.[http://thislandpress.com/09/01/2011/tate-brady-battle-greenwood/]&lt;/ref&gt; and the home of [[Bob Wills]] and his band, the Texas Playboys. The district is also the location of many local artists' galleries, restaurants with late night hours, bars and dance clubs. It is also an emerging gay neighborhood, with several gay or gay-friendly bars and numerous supportive shops and restaurants.

Today, The Brady Arts District is one of the most diverse areas in all of Tulsa. It hosts restaurants, clubs, museums, and businesses and is a prime example of urban living. There is presently construction which will more than double the number of permanent residents in this artistic enclave. The neighborhood's renaissance got a significant boost in late 2012 with the opening of Guthrie Green, a public garden and outdoor stage, on a central plot of land formerly inhabited by commercial buildings. Guthrie Green has quickly emerged as a neighborhood focal point, hosting community events, live music and a farmers market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tulsaworld.com/article.aspx/Guthrie_Green_opens_with_a_weekend_of_entertainment/20120908_11_a15_cutlin472304&lt;/ref&gt;

The district and the street were originally named for [[W. Tate Brady]], an early Tulsa business owner and active civic promoter. However, Tate Brady's involvement as a leader in the Tulsa [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the 1920s led to residents expressing their wish that the name be changed, and on August 15, 2013, the City Council voted to retain the street name, but instead officially honor [[American Civil War|Civil War]] photographer [[Mathew Brady]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kjrh.com/dpp/news/local_news/tulsa-city-council-expected-to-continue-debate-over-brady-street-name-change-at-thursdays-meeting&lt;/ref&gt; Street signs have since been changed to reflect the official street name as "M.B.

The history of the Owen Park neighborhood can be traced to the early 19th Century. A description of the area was given by Washington Irving in his book, ''Tour of the Prairies''. A monument in Tulsa's Owen Park denotes the point where the lands of the Osage, Creek and Cherokee nations met. The first American settler was Chauncey Owen, husband of a Creek woman who qualified for a land allotment. This land later became the Owen Park neighborhood. Its borders are Edison Avenue on the north, the municipal Owen Park on the east, the Keystone Expressway (Hwy 412) on the south, and Zenith Avenue on the west. Owen Park is a rapidly gentrifying historic neighborhood that has historic mansions and Crafstman style homes. It is one of the closest neighborhoods to the Brady District and downtown Tulsa.

==Southside==
Tulsa's south side is popularly considered to be south of the Skelly Bypass (I-44), bounded on the south by the city of [[Bixby, Oklahoma|Bixby]], on the west by the Arkansas River and the city of [[Jenks, Oklahoma|Jenks]], and on the east by the city of [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma|Broken Arrow]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Many new luxurious homes have been constructed here in the last few decades, as well as numerous apartments, in various price ranges. Land in the area is becoming scarce, however, and development now has begun to spread to neighboring Jenks and Bixby to the south and west, as well as Broken Arrow to the east. As a more affluent demographic has moved into the area, businesses tailored to such residents have also opened nearby. The city's largest automotive dealer strips are located along S. Memorial Dr. from 91st to 101st Streets and from 51st to 31st Streets. The [http://www.riverwalkcrossing.com/ Riverwalk Crossing Shopping Center], just over the river in Jenks at 96th st. includes a movie theater, fine dining, and shopping. Nearby lies the [[Oklahoma Aquarium]], the only one in the state of Oklahoma. Local freshwater fish are complemented by a fine selection of saltwater animals, including sharks. The Karl and Beverly White National Fishing Tackle Museum has over 20,000 pieces valued at more than $4 million. This exhibit makes up the largest and most comprehensive antique fishing tackle collection in the world.

St. Francis Hospital and its surrounding medical practitioner's offices is located at 61st and Yale and is one of the largest in the state. Prominent in that area of town is the upscale Braeswood neighborhood, East 61st to 63rd Streets and Louisville to Oswego Avenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://braeswoodtulsa.com/|title=Braeswood Homeowners Association website, About Braeswood | accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Another healthcare cluster exists around South 91st and Mingo, including SouthCrest Hospital, [[Cancer Treatment Centers of America|Cancer Treatment Center of America]] and Saint Francis Hospital South.
[[Woodland Hills Mall]], the largest in the state anchors the 71st street corridor. Numerous dining options are available in the area. Additionally, shopping centers surrounding the mall are panoramic in scope, as the options for shopping are seemingly endless. It is in this area that the 4-star John Q. Hammonds Renaissance Hotel is located, including conference and meeting rooms. It is located right off [[US 169]], a major north-south highway in eastern south Tulsa. This road curves to the west at around 96th street and soon turns into the [[Creek Turnpike]], a toll road that has been extended to the west to [[I-44]] and to the east to I-44, nearly forming a semi-circular loop around southern Tulsa and its surrounding suburbs.
The schools in the area are some of the state's largest, including Jenks and Union High School, with neighboring Broken Arrow being the largest. Tulsa Public School's Memorial High School is located here, along with prestigious, private [[Holland Hall (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Holland Hall]]. Jenks, and Union High Schools are annually among the best in the state and nation in football and their rivalry has drawn national attention.

===Southeast Tulsa===
Southeast Tulsa is generally considered as south of 41st St S and east of S Sheridan Rd, all the way to the Bixby and Broken Arrow city limits.  Union Schools service most of these residents, with a handful of neighborhoods being served by Tulsa Public Schools and Broken Arrow Public Schools (further east).  Neighborhood Parks, soccer fields, sports fields, and public pools can be found within the area. There are multiple corporate offices and other business in the area that staff large work forces. A large diversity of shopping and eating-out opportunities can be found in southeast Tulsa. The area provides easy access to I 244, I 44, Hwy 169 (Mingo Valley Exp), The Creek Turnpike, and the Broken Arrow expressway. Such easy access makes it quick for driving to desired locations and businesses in Downtown, Midtown, Southside, Westside, the Airport, all the major shopping/entertainment areas of the city, and to the outlying cities of Broken Arrow, Owasso, Bixby, and Jenks. The area offers housing built from the early 1970s to the present.

==Eastside==
Tulsa's east side is a suburban-style area laying roughly east of Sheridan Road, north of 41st St S, and south of Tulsa International Airport.  Constructed largely in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, attractions in this part of the city include McClure Park, which is notable for its [[disc golf]] course, the Carl Smith Athletic Complex, and the popular Admiral Twin Drive-In movie theatre. There is also a large portion of [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] on Tulsa's east side. Areas that fall in Union and Broken Arrow School districts are increasingly attracting high-income professionals looking for suburban life within the city limits. Mayo Demonstration Academy, a magnet school of the Tulsa Public School system, is located in this area. Eastgate Metroplex and East Central High School are also in this area. Also the area is home to Tulsa's Eastern hospitality district, where many hotels are located.

East Tulsa is also home to growing [[Mexican-American]] and [[Vietnamese-American]] populations (the latter centered around St. Joseph Vietnamese Catholic Church).

Redbud Valley Nature Preserve is also located in this part of the city.

==Westside==
{{Main|West Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma}}
Communities of Tulsa's west side in city limits are [[Red Fork, Oklahoma|Red Fork]], Carbondale, Garden City, and [[Turkey Mountain (Oklahoma)|Turkey Mountain]]. Other communities considered a part of the west side, but located in [[Creek County]], are [[Oakhurst, Oklahoma|Oakhurst]], Oakridge, and Allen-Bowden.

[[West Tulsa, Oklahoma|West Tulsa]] is another reminder of Tulsa’s oil-rich past. Two oil refineries remain in operation to this day on the west bank of the river. This large industrial area gives way to wooded and hilly neighborhoods. The classic art deco [[Webster High School (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Webster High School]] is here, as is the popular train-themed Ollie’s Station Restaurant, sitting next to the Tulsa rail yard. Other schools in West Tulsa include Berryhill High School, Remington Elementary, Robertson Elementary, Park Elementary and Clinton Middle School. Webster is the oldest existing high school facility in Tulsa, and has an active alumni association. Portions of Route 66 pass through west side. The area is broken up into several sections, including Carbondale and Red Fork, among others.

The Riverparks system, also here on the bank of the river, includes the Riverwest Festival Park, with its floating stage amphitheater overlooking downtown. Riverwest is home to such popular events as Tulsa's [[Oktoberfest]], one of the largest of its kind in [[North America]], and the Gatesway Balloon Festival.

Tulsa's westside is also home to The Oaks Country Club, one of Tulsa's three major country clubs, and Inverness Village, a large [[retirement community]]. In addition to these companies, [[Camp Loughridge]], a Christian [[Summer Camp]] operates on 186 [[acres]] of land in West Tulsa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15253">'''[[Philosophy]] of music''' is the study of "...fundamental questions about the nature of [[music]] and our experience of it".&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Andrew Kania, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/music/ The Philosophy of Music]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Spring 2014 edition, edited by Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]]. 
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:

* What is the [[definition of music]]? (what are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What is the relationship between music and language?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions? (in the 19th century there was a debate over whether instrumental music could convey emotion)
* What is meaning in relation to music?

===Definition of music===
{{main article|Definition of music}}
"Explications of the concept of music usually begin with the idea that music is organized sound. They go on to note that this characterization is too broad, since there are many examples of organized sound that are not music, such as human speech, and the sounds non-human animals and machines make."&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; There are many different ways of denoting the fundamental [[Aspect of music|aspects of music]] which are more specific than "sound": popular aspects include [[melody]] ([[pitch (music)|pitches]] that occur consecutively), [[harmony]] (pitches regarded as groups—not necessarily sounding at the same time—to form [[chord (music)|chord]]s), [[rhythm]], [[meter (music)|meter]] and [[timbre]] (also known as a sound's "color"). However, [[noise music]] may consist mainly of noise. [[Musique concrète]] often consists only of sound samples of non-musical nature, sometimes in random juxtaposition. [[Ambient music]] may consist of recordings of wildlife or nature. The arrival of these avant-garde forms of music in the 20th century have been a major challenge to traditional views of music as being based around melodies and rhythms, leading to broader characterizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Absolute music vs program music===
{{main article|Absolute music|Program music}}
There was intense debate over absolute music versus program music during the late Romantic Era. Advocates of the "[[absolute music]]" perspective argued that instrumental music does not convey emotions or images to the listener. They claimed that music is not explicitly "about" anything and that it is non-[[Representation (arts)|representational]].&lt;ref name=horowitz&gt;M. C. Horowitz (ed.), ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', {{ISBN|0-684-31377-4}}, vol.1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early [[German Romanticism]], such as [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref name=horowitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahlhaus|first=Carl|title=The Idea of Absolute Music|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of the "[[program music]]" perspective believed that music could convey emotions and images. One example of program music is [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', in which the fourth movement is the composer's depiction of a story about an artist who poisons himself with opium and then is executed. The majority of opposition to absolute instrumental-based music came from composer [[Richard Wagner]] and the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Wagner's works were chiefly programmatic and often used vocalization, and he said that "Where music can go no further, there comes the word… the word stands higher than the tone." Nietzsche wrote many commentaries applauding the music of Wagner and was in fact an amateur composer himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |title=Nietzsche and Music |accessdate=17 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717140220/http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Romantic philosophers and proponents of absolute music, such as [[Johann von Goethe]] saw music not only as a subjective human "language" but as an absolute transcendent means of peering into a higher realm of order and beauty. Some expressed a spiritual connection with music. In Part IV of his chief work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1819), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] said that "music is the answer to the mystery of life. The most profound of all the arts, it expresses the deepest thoughts of life." In "The Immediate Stages of the Erotic, or Musical Erotic", a chapter of ''[[Either/Or]]'' (1843), [[Søren Kierkegaard]] examines the profundity of music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and the sensual nature of ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

===Meaning and purpose===
In his 1997 book ''How the Mind Works'', [[Steven Pinker]] dubbed music "auditory cheesecake",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=How The Mind Works|date=1997|publisher=W.W.

In a filmed debate, Ball suggests that music might get its emotive power through its ability to mimic people and perhaps its ability to entice us lies in music's ability to set up an expectation and then violate it.&lt;ref name="http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery"&gt;{{cite web|last=How The Light Gets In|first=2013|title=Music's Mystery|url=http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery|publisher=The Institute of Art and Ideas|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics of music===
{{main article|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Orchestra conservatorio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[symphony orchestra]] is not only the main large ensemble used in [[classical music]]; one work for orchestra, [[Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] has been called the supreme masterpiece of the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cook, Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (Cambridge Music Handbooks), Cambridge University Press (24 June 1993). {{ISBN|9780521399241}}. "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is acknowledged as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Western tradition. More than any other musical work it has become an international symbol of unity and affirmation."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the pre-modern tradition, the aesthetics of music or musical aesthetics explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;!-- This is a remarkably sweeping claim, presented without citation. --&gt; Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy. In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]]. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also, many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a [[musical tuning|system of tuning]] called [[just intonation]].

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

It is often thought &lt;!-- By whom? --&gt;that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in the ''Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

'''''Pronkstilleven''''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for 'ostentatious', 'ornate' or 'sumptuous' still life) is a style of ornate [[still life]] painting, which was developed in the 1640s in [[Antwerp]] from where it spread quickly to the [[Dutch Republic]]. 

==Development==
Flemish artists such as [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] started to paint still lifes that emphasized abundance by depicting a diversity of objects, fruits, flowers and dead game, often together with living people and animals.

The style was soon adopted by artists from the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref name=ox&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/pronkstilleven Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms: Pronkstilleven]&lt;/ref&gt;  A leading Dutch representative was [[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], who spent a long period of his active career in Antwerp and was one of the founders of the style in Holland.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/36842 Jan Davidsz. de Heem] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitage.nl/nl/pers/rubens_van_dyck_en_jordaens/achtergrond.htm [[Ben van Beneden]], ''Massijs, Rubens, Van Dyck en de anderen.]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Schilderkunst in Antwerpen, 1500-1650'' {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other leading representatives in Flanders and the Dutch Republic were [[Nicolaes van Verendael]], [[Alexander Coosemans]], [[Carstian Luyckx]], [[Jasper Geeraards]], [[Peter Willebeeck]], [[Abraham van Beyeren]] and [[Willem Kalf]].&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;

[[Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts]] developed the style further by incorporating pronkstillevens in the [[trompe-l'œil]] compositions for which he was known.  An example is his ''[[:File:Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts - Silverware in an Open Cabinet.jpg|Silverware in an Open Cabinet]]'' at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent]].&lt;ref name=gijs&gt;[http://barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/nl/collectie/pronkstilleven-in-openstaande-kast Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts, ''Pronkstilleven in an open cabinet''] at barokinvlaanderen {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Meaning==
[[File:Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts - Silverware in an Open Cabinet.jpg|thumb|''Silverware in an Open Cabinet'' by Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts]]
Pronkstillevens are usually interpreted as a form of [[vanitas]] painting that conveys a moral lesson.  The various objects in the compositions serve as symbols that can be read as an admonition or a life lesson. The objects usually refer to the transience and emptiness of wealth and possessions and the ultimate extinction and emptiness of earthly life.

For instance, roses are often used as a vanitas motif, as they recall that all life and earthly beauty are fleeting. Hourglasses are an admonition that life is fleeting and will end.  Empty containers such as glasses or vases point to the emptiness of earthly wealth and aspirations.  The paintings remind the viewer of the need to practice moderation and temperance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tento.be/OKV-artikel/abraham-van-beyeren-pronk-stilleven L.J., Bol, ''Abraham van Beyeren - Pronk-stilleven''] at okv {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor''' (December 1, 1940&amp;nbsp;– December 10, 2005) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, and social critic. Pryor was known for uncompromising examinations of racism and topical contemporary issues, which employed vulgarities and profanity, as well as [[racial epithets]]. He reached a broad audience with his trenchant observations and storytelling style, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential stand-up comedians of all time.

Pryor's body of work includes the concert movies and recordings: ''[[Live &amp; Smokin'|Richard Pryor: Live &amp; Smokin']]'' (1971), ''[[That Nigger's Crazy]]'' (1974), ''[[...Is It Something I Said?]]'' (1975), ''[[Bicentennial Nigger]]'' (1976), ''[[Richard Pryor: Live in Concert]]'' (1979), ''[[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip]]'' (1982), and ''[[Richard Pryor: Here and Now]]'' (1983). As an actor, he starred mainly in comedies such as ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), but occasionally in dramas, such as [[Paul Schrader]]'s ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), or action films, such as ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983). He collaborated on many projects with actor [[Gene Wilder]]. Another frequent collaborator was actor/comedian/writer [[Paul Mooney (comedian)|Paul Mooney]].

Pryor won an [[Emmy Award]] (1973) and five [[Grammy Award]]s (1974, 1975, 1976, 1981, and 1982). In 1974, he also won two American Academy of Humor awards and the [[Writers Guild of America Award]]. The first-ever [[Kennedy Center]] [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] was presented to him in 1998. He was listed at number one on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of all-time greatest stand-up comedians.&lt;ref name=cc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.voxmagazine.com/stories/2004/09/30/why-chappelle-is-the-man/ |title=Why Chappelle is the man |work=[[Columbia Missourian|Vox Magazine]] |date=September 30, 2004 |access-date=September 1, 2016 |quote=Pryor was voted No. 1 in Comedy Central's ''100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time'' in April. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914220958/http://archive.voxmagazine.com/stories/2004/09/30/why-chappelle-is-the-man/ |archivedate=September 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him first on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref name = "RS"&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time].

==Early life==
Born on December 1, 1940 in [[Peoria, Illinois]], Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor grew up in the brothel run by his grandmother, Marie Carter, where his alcoholic mother, Gertrude L. (née Thomas), was a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/richard_the_great_FmHiNQqrDQ08jcRI576TUI |title=Richard the Great |work=[[New York Post]] |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, LeRoy "Buck Carter" Pryor (June 7, 1915&amp;nbsp;– September 27, 1968), was a former boxer and [[Hustling|hustler]].&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richardpryor.com/biography.php|website=RichardPryor.com|title= Richard Pryor's official biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gertrude abandoned him when he was ten, Pryor was raised primarily by Marie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardpryor.com/0/4113/0/1240D1271/ |title=Richard Pryor website |publisher=Richardpryor.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523025200/http://www.richardpryor.com/0/4113/0/1240D1271 |archivedate=May 23, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a tall, violent woman who would beat him for any of his eccentricities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/342/000022276/ |title=Richard Pryor |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pryor was one of four children raised in his grandmother's brothel. He was sexually abused at age seven,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jones, Steve|url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-12-10-richard-pryor-obit_x.htm |title=Comedian Richard Pryor dies at 65|work=[[USA Today]]|date= December 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expelled from school at the age of fourteen.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/09/13/a-pryor-love|title=A Pryor Love|author=[[Hilton Als|Als, Hilton]]|date=September 13, 1999|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Peoria, he became a [[Freemason]] at a local lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/pryor_r/pryor_r.html |title=Richard Pryor|website= GLBCY|accessdate= October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pryor served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] from 1958 to 1960, but spent virtually the entire stint in an army prison. According to a 1999 profile about Pryor in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Pryor was incarcerated for an incident that occurred while he was stationed in [[West Germany]]. Angered that a white soldier was overly amused at the racially charged scenes of [[Douglas Sirk]]'s film ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]'', Pryor and several other black soldiers beat and stabbed him, although not fatally.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt;

==Relationships and children==
Pryor was married seven times to five women:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===1960s===
[[File:Richard Pryor 1969.JPG|thumb|Publicity photo of Pryor for one of his [[Mister Kelly's]] appearances, 1968–1969]]
In 1963, Pryor moved to New York City and began performing regularly in clubs alongside performers such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Woody Allen]]. On one of his first nights, he opened for singer and pianist [[Nina Simone]] at New York's [[Village Gate]]. Simone recalls Pryor's bout of [[performance anxiety]]:

{{quote|He shook like he had malaria, he was so nervous. I couldn't bear to watch him shiver, so I put my arms around him there in the dark and rocked him like a baby until he calmed down. The next night was the same, and the next, and I rocked him each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[Nina Simone|Simone, Nina]] &amp; Cleary, Stephen |date=1991|title=[[I Put a Spell on You (book)|I Put a Spell on You: The Autobiography of Nina Simone]]|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York City|pages=70–71|isbn=978-0-679-41068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Inspired by Bill Cosby, Pryor began as a [[middlebrow]] comic, with material far less controversial than what was to come. Soon, he began appearing regularly on television [[variety shows]], such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. His popularity led to success as a comic in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The first five tracks on the 2005 compilation CD ''[[Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974)]]'', recorded in 1966 and 1967, capture Pryor in this period.

In September 1967, Pryor had what he described in his autobiography ''[[Pryor Convictions]]'' (1995) as an "[[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]". He walked onto the stage at the [[Aladdin, Las Vegas|Aladdin Hotel]] in Las Vegas (with [[Dean Martin]] in the audience), looked at the sold-out crowd, exclaimed over the microphone, "What the fuck am I doing here!?", and walked off the stage. Afterward, Pryor began working profanity into his act, including the word "[[nigger]]". His first comedy recording, the eponymous 1968 debut release on the [[Reprise Records|Dove/Reprise]] label, captures this particular period, tracking the evolution of Pryor's routine. Around this time, his parents died—his mother in 1967 and his father in 1968.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/richard-pryor-personal-life "Richard Pryor-Personal Life"] Retrieved August 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Pryor moved to [[Berkeley, California]], where he immersed himself in the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and rubbed elbows with the likes of [[Huey P. Newton]] and [[Ishmael Reed]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===1970s===
In the 1970s, Pryor wrote for such television shows as ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]'', and a 1973 [[Lily Tomlin]] special, for which he shared an [[Emmy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/richard-pryor |title=Richard Pryor Emmy Winner |work=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Pryor tried to break into mainstream television. He also appeared in several popular films, including ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' (1972), ''[[The Mack]]'' (1973), ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]'' (1974), ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'' (1976), ''[[Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings]]'' (1976), ''[[Which Way Is Up?]]'' (1977), ''[[Greased Lightning]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979).

Pryor signed with the comedy-oriented independent record label [[Laff Records]] in 1970, and in 1971 recorded his second album, ''Craps (After Hours)''. Two years later, the relatively unknown comedian appeared in the documentary ''[[Wattstax]]'' (1972), wherein he riffed on the tragic-comic absurdities of [[race relations]] in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] and the nation. Not long afterward, Pryor sought a deal with a larger label, and he signed with [[Stax Records]] in 1973.

When his third, breakthrough album, ''[[That Nigger's Crazy]]'' (1974), was released, Laff, which claimed ownership of Pryor's recording rights, almost succeeded in getting an injunction to prevent the album from being sold. Negotiations led to Pryor's release from his Laff contract. In return for this concession, Laff was enabled to release previously unissued material, recorded between 1968 and 1973, at will. ''That Nigger's Crazy'' was a commercial and critical success; it was eventually certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UCQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=that+nigger's+crazy+RIAA+Gold&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PgkZ-6WDZs&amp;sig=wxKBEmpo3wnh2-UKdlKRTaWH4a0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB7ITTuYHKAhXE1B4KHYXCDFsQ6AEIJzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=that%20nigger's%20crazy%20RIAA%20Gold&amp;f=false Paul Green, "Richie Sets Multiplantium Record: Boston Has RIAA Top Debut Album," ''Billboard'', November 15, 1986.]&lt;/ref&gt; and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1975|1975 Grammy Awards]].

During the legal battle, Stax briefly closed its doors. At this time, Pryor returned to [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]/[[Warner Bros. Records]], which re-released ''That Nigger's Crazy'', immediately after ''[[...Is It Something I Said?]]'', his first album with his new label. Like ''That Nigger's Crazy'', the album was a hit with both critics and fans; it was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA and won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording at the 1976 Grammy Awards.

Pryor's release ''[[Bicentennial Nigger]]'' (1976) continued his streak of success. It became his third consecutive gold album, and he collected his third consecutive Grammy for Best Comedy Recording for the album in 1977. With every successful album Pryor recorded for Warner (or later, his concert films and his 1980 [[Freebase (chemistry)|freebasing]] accident), Laff quickly published an album of older material to capitalize on Pryor's growing fame—a practice they continued until 1983. The covers of Laff albums tied in thematically with Pryor movies, such as ''Are You Serious?'' for ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), ''The Wizard of Comedy'' for his appearance in ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' (1978), and ''Insane'' for ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/richard-pryor |title=Richard Pryor Fast Facts |last= |first= |date= |website=Yourdictionary |access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alan Alda Lily Tomlin Richard Pryor 1973.jpg|thumb|180px|Pryor also performed in the [[Lily Tomlin]] specials. He is seen here with Tomlin and [[Alan Alda]] in Tomlin's 1973 special.]]

Pryor co-wrote ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), directed by [[Mel Brooks]] and starring [[Gene Wilder]]. Pryor was to play the lead role of Bart, but the film's production studio would not insure him, and Mel Brooks chose [[Cleavon Little]], instead. Before his horribly damaging 1980 freebasing incident, Pryor was about to start filming Mel Brooks' ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'' (1981), but was replaced at the last minute by [[Gregory Hines]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Pryor was also originally considered for the role of Billy Ray Valentine on ''[[Trading Places]]'' (1983), before [[Eddie Murphy]] won the part.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 1975, Pryor was a guest host on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and the first black person to host the show. Pryor took longtime girlfriend, actress-talk show host Kathrine McKee (sister of [[Lonette McKee]]), with him to New York, and she made a brief guest appearance with Pryor on ''SNL''. He participated in the "word association" skit with [[Chevy Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ginterview.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Richard Pryor: 12/13/75: Racist Word Association Interview |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later do his own variety show,''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]'', which premiered on [[NBC]] in 1977. The show was cancelled after only four episodes probably because television audiences did not respond well to his show's controversial subject matter, and Pryor was unwilling to alter his material for network censors. During the short-lived series, [[Black president in popular culture (United States)|he portrayed the first black]] President of the United States, spoofed the ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' [[Mos Eisley]] cantina, took on gun violence, and in another skit, used costumes and visual distortion to appear nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Silverman, David S. |date=2007|title=You Can't Air That: Four Cases of Controversy and Censorship in American Television Programming|location= Syracuse, NY|publisher=Syracuse University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, at the height of his success, Pryor visited Africa. Upon returning to the United States, Pryor swore he would never use the word "[[nigger]]" in his stand-up comedy routine again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/opinion/the-nwordand-richard-pryor.html|title=The N-word and Richard Pryor|date=2005-12-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|JZCS5I80X-8|The word 'Nigger'&amp;nbsp;– Richard Pryor &amp; George Carlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
[[File:Richard Pryor (1986) (cropped)-2.jpg|thumb|right|Pryor in February 1986]]
Late in the evening of June 9, 1980, during the making of the film ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'', and after days of [[Free base|freebasing]] [[cocaine]], Pryor poured 151-proof [[rum]] all over himself and lit himself on fire. While ablaze, he ran down Parthenia Street from his [[Los Angeles]] home, until being subdued by police. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for second- and third-degree burns covering more than half of his body. Pryor spent six weeks in recovery at the Grossman Burn Center at [[Sherman Oaks Hospital]]. His daughter, [[Rain Pryor|Rain]], stated that the incident happened as a result of a bout of drug-induced [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Rain Pryor|date= November 6, 2006|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]| page =76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pryor incorporated a description of the incident into his comedy show ''[[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip]]'' (1982). He joked that the event was caused by dunking a cookie into a glass of low-fat and [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] milk, causing an explosion. At the end of the bit, he poked fun at people who told jokes about it by waving a lit match and saying, "What's that? Richard Pryor running down the street."

After his "final performance", Pryor did not stay away from stand-up comedy long. Within a year, he filmed and released a new concert film and accompanying album, ''[[Richard Pryor: Here and Now]]'' (1983), which he directed himself. He also wrote and directed a fictionalized account of his life, ''[[Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling]]'' (1986), which revolved around the 1980 freebasing incident.

In 1983, Pryor signed a five-year contract with [[Columbia Pictures]] for $40&amp;nbsp;million and he started his own production company, Indigo Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Richard Pryor Ouster of Blacks Criticized |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/17/movies/richard-pryor-ouster-of-blacks-criticized.html |quote=Mr. Pryor announced in May that he had signed a five-year, $40&amp;nbsp;million production deal with Columbia Pictures and promised to open up opportunities for minorities at his Indigo Productions. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date= December 17, 1983 |accessdate=2015-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCobit"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Staff writer]] |date=December 10, 2005| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4517714.stm |title=Comedian Richard Pryor Dead at 65&amp;nbsp;– Groundbreaking Black U.S. Comedian Richard Pryor Has Died after Almost 20 Years with Multiple Sclerosis |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate= January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Softer, more formulaic films followed, including ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983), which earned Pryor $4&amp;nbsp;million; ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'' (1985), ''[[Moving (1988 film)|Moving]]'' (1988), and ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' (1989). The only film project from this period that recalled his rough roots was Pryor's semiautobiographic debut as a writer-director, ''[[Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling]]'' (1986), which was not a major success.

Despite a reputation for constantly using profanity on and off camera, Pryor briefly hosted a children's show on [[CBS]] called ''[[Pryor's Place]]'' (1984). Like ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''Pryor's Place'' featured a cast of puppets, hanging out and having fun in a surprisingly friendly inner-city environment along with several children and characters portrayed by Pryor himself. However, ''Pryor's Place'' frequently dealt with more sobering issues than ''Sesame Street''. It was cancelled shortly after its debut, despite the efforts of famed puppeteers [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] and a theme song by [[Ray Parker, Jr.]] of "[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]" (1984) fame.

Pryor co-hosted the [[Academy Awards]] twice and was nominated for an Emmy for a guest role on the television series ''[[Chicago Hope]]''. Network censors had warned Pryor about his profanity for the Academy Awards, and after a slip early in the program, a five-second delay was instituted when returning from a commercial break. Pryor is also one of only three ''Saturday Night Live'' hosts to be subjected to a rare five-second delay for his 1975 appearance (along with [[Sam Kinison]] in 1986 and [[Andrew Dice Clay]] in 1990).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Pryor developed a reputation for being demanding and disrespectful on film sets, and for making selfish and difficult requests. In his autobiography ''Kiss Me Like a Stranger'', co-star Gene Wilder says that Pryor was frequently late to the set during filming of ''Stir Crazy'', and that he demanded, among other things, a helicopter to fly him to and from set because he was the star. Pryor was also accused of using allegations of on-set racism to force the hand of film producers into giving him more money:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day during our lunch hour in the last week of filming, the [[craft service]] man handed out slices of watermelon to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during ''Stir Crazy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilder |first=Gene |date=2005 |title=Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJgIe5j1bTsC&amp;pg=PA185#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |pages=185–186 |isbn=978-0-312-33706-3 |oclc=475142187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He appeared in ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' (1989), a comedy-drama crime film starring three generations of black comedians (Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and [[Redd Foxx]]).

===1990s and 2000s===
In his later years starting in the early to mid-1990s, Pryor used a power-operated [[mobility scooter]] due to multiple sclerosis (MS, which he said stood for "More Shit").{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} He appears on the scooter in his last film appearance, a small role in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997) playing an auto-repair garage manager named Arnie.

[[Rhino Records]] remastered all of Pryor's Reprise and WB albums for inclusion in the box set ''[[...And It's Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings (1968–1992)|...And It's Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings]]'' (2000).

In early 2000, Pryor appeared in the cold open of ''[[The Norm Show]]'' in the episode entitled "Norm vs. The Boxer". He played an elderly man in a wheelchair who lost the rights to in-home nursing when he kept attacking the nurses before attacking Norm himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Norm Show&amp;nbsp;– Norm vs. the Boxer |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0662160/ |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Pryor and his wife/manager, Jennifer Lee Pryor, won legal rights to all the Laff material, which amounted to almost 40 hours of reel-to-reel analog tape. After going through the tapes and getting Richard's blessing, Jennifer Lee Pryor gave Rhino Records access to the tapes in 2004. These tapes, including the entire ''Craps'' album, form the basis of the February 1, 2005, double-CD release ''[[Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=CD Universe|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/6817862/a/evolution%2Frevolution%3A+the+early+years+%281966-1974%29.htm|title=Richard Pryor – Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974) CD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
In November 1977, after many years of heavy smoking and drinking, Pryor suffered a mild heart attack. He recovered and resumed performing by January the following year. He was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richardpryor.com/biography.php |title=The Official Biography of Richard Pryor |publisher=Indigo, Inc. |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Pryor suffered a second heart attack while in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-23/news/mn-756_1_heart-attack|title=Richard Pryor Suffers a Minor Heart Attack in Australia|last=Writer|first=From a Times Staff|date=1990-03-23|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent triple [[heart bypass]] surgery in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-06-01/news/9106010694_1_richard-pryor-mcelwaine-cracking-jokes|title=Richard Pryor Cracking Jokes After Triple Bypass|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, his sister said he had lost his voice as a result of his multiple sclerosis. However, on January 9, 2005, Pryor's wife, Jennifer Lee, rebutted this statement in a post on Pryor's official website, citing Richard as saying: "I'm sick of hearing this shit about me not talking... not true... I have good days, bad days... but I still am a talkin' motherfucker!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardpryor.com |title=Richard Pryor |publisher=Richard Pryor |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

On December 10, 2005, nine days after his 65th birthday, Pryor suffered a heart attack in Los Angeles. He was taken to a local hospital after his wife's attempts to resuscitate him failed. He was pronounced dead at 7:58&amp;nbsp;am [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]].

[[Jerry Seinfeld]] called Pryor "the [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] of our profession"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Morton, Bruce |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/21/morton.thosewelost/index.html |title=Those We Lost|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=January 11, 2010|date=December 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bob Newhart]] heralded Pryor as "the seminal comedian of the last 50 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/newhart_b.html |work=PBS American Masters |title= Bob Newhart}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Chappelle]] said of Pryor, "You know those, like, evolution charts of man?

As [[Bill Cosby]] reportedly once said, "Richard Pryor drew the line between comedy and tragedy as thin as one could possibly paint it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Benson |first=Tambay |title=Richard Pryor Retrospective at BAMcinématek, Brooklyn (10 Days, 20 Films, All in 35&amp;nbsp;mm) |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/richard-pryor-retrospective-at-bamcinematek-brooklyn-10-days-20-films-all-in-35mm |work=Indiewire |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and honors===
In 1998, Pryor won the first [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] from the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]. According to former Kennedy Center President Lawrence J. Wilker, Pryor was selected as the first recipient of the Prize because 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
as a stand-up comic, writer, and actor, he struck a chord, and a nerve, with America, forcing it to look at large social questions of race and the more tragicomic aspects of the human condition. Though uncompromising in his wit, Pryor, like [[Mark Twain|Twain]], projects a generosity of spirit that unites us. They were both trenchant social critics who spoke the truth, however outrageous.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 2004, Pryor was voted number one on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time.&lt;ref name=cc/&gt; In a 2005 British poll to find "The Comedian's Comedian", Pryor was voted the 10th-greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.

Pryor was posthumously awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Pryor to Get Posthumous Grammy Award |date=January 11, 2006 |work=Voice of America |url=http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/Richard-Pryor-to-Get-Posthumous-Grammy-Award.cfm |accessdate=January 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913185314/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/Richard-Pryor-to-Get-Posthumous-Grammy-Award.cfm |archivedate=September 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animal rights organization [[PETA]] gives out an award in Pryor's name to people who have done outstanding work to alleviate animal suffering. Pryor was active in animal rights and was deeply concerned about the plight of elephants in circuses and zoos.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Artist Preston Jackson created a life-sized bronze statue in dedication to the beloved comedian and named it "Richard Pryor: More than Just a Comedian". It was placed at the corner of State and Washington Streets in downtown Peoria, on May 1, 2015, close to the neighborhood in which he grew up with his mother.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">In philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s ''[[Either/Or]]'', the '''rotation method''' is the mechanism used by higher level aesthetes in order to avoid [[boredom]]. The method is an essential [[hedonism|hedonistic]] aspect of the aesthetic way of life.

==Overview==
Kierkegaard likens the rotation method to the [[crop rotation]] used in [[agriculture]], in which the soil is constantly rotated in order to maximize the use of nutrients for the crops. For the aesthete, one constantly changes what one is doing in order to maximize the enjoyment and pleasure derived from each activity.

A consequence of the rotation method would be the aesthete's lack of commitment to any one thing. Commitment requires one to constantly repeat an activity; however, for the aesthetic, repeating an activity leads to boredom, as this activity is no longer novel.

The rotation method, Kierkegaard argues, would eventually lead aesthetes to a state of [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], because all activities, no matter how unique or new, will eventually become boring:

:''I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding – the motion is too powerful; I don't feel like walking – it is too tiring; I don't feel like lying down, for either I have to stay down, and I don't feel like doing that or I would have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that, either. ''Summa Summarum'': I don't feel like doing anything.'' – ''Either/Or'', p. 4&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Either/Or''. Princeton, 1985. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthete, Kierkegaard predicts, realizing and responding to the futility of one's hedonistic finite aims, will yearn to experience a more meaningful life.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard''. Oneworld, 2003. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropology==
[[Julian A. Pitt-Rivers|Julian Pitt-Rivers]] reports&lt;ref name="Pitt-Rivers"&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/peopleofthesierr001911mbp/peopleofthesierr001911mbp_djvu.txt The People of the Sierra]'', [[J. A. Pitt-Rivers]], page 205, 1954, [[Criterion Books]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; in his study of [[Alcalá de la Sierra]] the belief that village children can be stolen by an outsider, disguised as a beggar or a trader, who is hired by a [[anti-rich sentiment|rich man]] whose ill child can only be cured with the blood of healthy babies.
The practice of [[blood donation]] lent credence to the myth.

[[Gerald Brenan]]&lt;ref name="Brenan"/&gt; describes the ''mantequero'' as a monster in human form who lives in deserted areas and feeds on ''manteca''&lt;ref name="DRAEmanteca"&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/drae/srv/search?val=manteca&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0 manteca] in the DRAE&lt;/ref&gt; ("[human] [[adipose tissue|fat]]").
Upon capture, he shouts in a high pitch and, unless just fed, looks thin.
Brenan found the myth alive during his stays in the [[Alpujarra]] (Andalusia):
In 1927 or 1928, he had sublet his [[Yegen]] home to the British writer [[Dick Strachey]], nephew of [[Lytton Strachey]].
One day, Strachey was walking on rough terrain where he saw three suspicious men.
Fearing of [[wikt:bandolero|bandolero]]s, he ran away, but the three [[Romani people in Spain|Gipsies]] chased him and drew their knives shouting at him as a ''mantequero''.
The first impulse of the Gipsies was to kill the ''mantequero'' and [[blood magic|use his blood]] for magical remedies.
However the eldest Gipsy, a convict, judged safer to bring Strachey to the mayor.
They offered to slit his throat themselves, but the British man claimed in his rudimentary Spanish to be a relative of king [[George V of England]], convincing the mayor that he was not dealing with a monster.

A friend of Brenan found that in [[Torremolinos]] all the girls believed in ''mantequeros''.
In the urban version of the legend,&lt;ref name="Brenan"/&gt; an old evil marquis needs baby [[blood transfusion]]s to rejuvenate.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}
The '''seventh son of a seventh son''' is a concept from [[folklore]] regarding special powers given to, or held by, such a son. The seventh son must come from an unbroken line with no female siblings born between and, in turn, be born to such a seventh son.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Thousand Wonderful Things, Edmund Fillingham King, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; The number {{num|seven}} has a long history of [[7 (number)#In mythology|mystical]] and [[7 (number)#relious|biblical]] significance: [[seven virtues]], [[seven deadly sins]], [[Seven Sleepers]], [[Genesis creation narrative|seven days of creation]], etc. In this case, it refers to a man who is the seventh son of a man who is himself a seventh son.

In some beliefs, the special powers are inborn, inherited simply by virtue of his birth order; in others the powers are granted to him by God or the gods because of his birth order.

==Regional variations==

===Ireland===
The seventh son of a seventh son is gifted as a healer. The seventh son of a seventh son is part of a more general phenomenon known as the "cure" (sometimes also called the "charm").&lt;ref&gt;See A D Buckley 1980 'Unofficial healing in Ulster.' ''Ulster Folklife'' 26, 15–34&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S.===
According to [[Edward Augustus Kendall|Kendall's]] ''Travels through the Northern Parts of the United States, in the year 1807–1808'' while visiting the [[Old Newgate Prison|Newgate copper mine and prison]], the author met an innkeep who told him that "there was to be found in [[Talcott Mountain|the surrounding hills]], a black stone, of a certain species, through which a seventh son of a seventh son, born in the month of February, with a [[Caul#Types|caul]] on his head, can discern everything that lies in the depths and interior of the globe." The author speculates that the importance of mining to the community gave rise to this localized belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holcombegenealogy.com/data/p877.htm |title=Thomas Holcombe of Connecticut - Person Page 877 |publisher=Holcombegenealogy.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Denis Larionov &amp; Alexander Zhulin |url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/edward-augustus-kendall/travels-through-the-northern-parts-of-the-united-states-in-the-year-1807-and-18-ala/page-12-travels-through-the-northern-parts-of-the-united-states-in-the-year-1807-and-18-ala.shtml |title=Travels through the northern parts of the United States, in the year 1807 and 1808 (Volume 2) by Edward Augustus Kendall |page=12 |publisher=Ebooksread.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American author [[Jackson Pearce]] uses the folklore around seventh sons in her novel ''Sisters Red'', in which potential werewolves are seventh sons of seventh sons.&lt;ref&gt;''Werewolves and Other Shapeshifters in Popular Culture'' by Kimberley McMahon-Coleman and Roslyn Weaver, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
It is believed that he will be a [[werewolf]], ''lobizón'' or ''lobisomem'' (the word in Portuguese language that means "werewolf"). To stop the curse the newborn should be baptized in seven different churches, or be baptized by the name of ''Benito'' while the eldest son is his godfather. It is important to note that the local myth of the ''lobizón'' is not connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/29/argentina-kirchner-adopt-child-werewolf |title=No, Argentina's president did not adopt a Jewish child to stop him turning into a werewolf |date= |accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
"Ciarallo" was the seventh son who had the power to enchant and recall snakes, and who was immune to snake venom. It wasn't enough to be a seventh son but was needed a special initiation rite called "inciaramazione". Recourse was made to Ciarallo when a snake sneaked into the house and it is said that the reptile was promptly attracted by the sound of his whistle. Another social task of Ciarallo was "inciaramare" other people by spreading a special oil, complete with a special recipe, on the arm of those who requested the treatment to ensure protection from snakes bites. Children were led to Ciarallo by their mothers to get protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monteneronline.it/arte/tradizioni.htm |title=TRADIZIONI E MITI POPOLARI |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''talent agent''', or '''booking agent''', is a person who finds jobs for [[actor]]s, [[author]]s, [[film director]]s, [[musician]]s, [[model (profession)|model]]s, [[professional athlete]]s, [[writer]]s, [[screenwriter]]s, [[broadcast journalist]]s, and other professionals in various entertainment or broadcast businesses. In addition, an agent defends, supports and promotes the interest of their clients. Talent agencies specialize, either by creating departments within the agency or developing entire agencies that primarily or wholly represent one specialty. For example, there are [[modeling agency|modeling agencies]], commercial talent agencies, [[literary agent|literary agencies]], voice-over agencies, broadcast journalist agencies, sports agencies, music agencies and many more.

Having an agent is not required, but does help the artist in getting jobs (concerts, tours, movie scripts, appearances, signings, sport teams, etc.). In many cases, casting directors, or other businesses go to talent agencies to find the artists for whom they are looking. The agent is paid a percentage of the star's earnings (typically 10%). Therefore, agents are sometimes referred to as "10 percenters." Various regulations govern different types of agents. The regulations are established by artist's unions and the legal jurisdiction in which the agent operates. There are also professional associations of talent agencies.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}Talent agents are considered gatekeepers to their client's careers. They have the ability to reshape and reconstruct their client's image. They are dealmakers and assist their client by orchestrating deals within the entertainment industry, more specifically in the Hollywood entertainment industry. 

In California, because talent agencies are working with lucrative contracts, the agencies must be licensed under special sections of the California Labor Code, which defines an agent as a "person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment for an artist or artists."&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Paul.(2008) "Hollywood Film Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p.167-168&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the largest agencies by size are [[William Morris Endeavor]] (WME), [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304419104579322721786447490 | title=Hollywood Isn't Enough for Talent Agency CAA | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=Feb 3, 2014 | accessdate=20 March 2014 | author=BEN FRITZ, ERICH SCHWARTZEL}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Talent Agency]] (UTA) and [[ICM Partners]] {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

==Types of talent agents and agencies==

===Sports agents===
{{main article|Sports agent}}

===Literary agent===
{{main article|Literary agent}}

===Broadcast journalist agencies===
Some talent agencies specialize in the representation of television news broadcast journalists and television news magazine hosts. The journalists and hosts represented by these agents primarily work at television stations in local markets or at networks. There are many job titles for broadcast news journalists such as anchors, reporters, weathercasters, sportscasters, correspondents and hosts.

===Commercial and Theatrical agents===
Actors may be interested in working theatrically (stage, film or television) as well as in commercials. Some agents will handle all types of acting work, while others may specialize in a particular area. Some agents work only in the field of television, or only in film and television. Typically, the larger the agency, the more specialized the agents within the agency.

An agent has two sets of clients:  the "talent" (actors, models, voice-over artists, etc.) and the "buyer". The buyer can be a casting director, advertising agency, [[film studio|production company]], photographer, or direct client if the client has an "in-house" production staff. Agents promote talent to the buyers, submitting talent who have the appropriate age, race, sex, look, talent, etc. that the buyer is seeking for his/her project. Usually, an agent submits the actor's [[head shot]] or the model's [[composite card]] or [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] to the buyer. After the buyer has made choices, the agent then arranges an audition (or for models, a "go-see" or open call). After the buyer has met the talent, the buyer will contact the agent if any of the talent will be hired. The agent will coordinate the details of wardrobe, directions, etc., as well as negotiate the contract or pay.

Note that the agent's job is to get the talent auditions; the talent is the only person who can get the job. For their work, agents take a 10 to 20% commission of the gross, depending on whether the job is [[trade union|union]] (such as SAG-AFTRA) or not. Union jobs are paid per negotiated guidelines, but in non-union jobs the pay is sometimes delayed.

A well established agent will have networks upon networks of contacts. Also, agents have access to professional casting services. Many of these casting resources are not available to the general public.

Although most of the successful agents are private individuals unknown to the public, some are celebrities in their own right. Notable current and former talent agents includes [[David Begelman]], [[Ari Emanuel]], [[Freddie Fields]], [[Johnny Hyde]], [[Irving Paul Lazar|Irving "Swifty" Lazar]], [[Sue Mengers]], Quincy Sims, [[Lew Wasserman]], [[Jadin Wong]] and The Handbook.

===Modeling agencies===
{{main article|Modeling agency}}

===Music agents===
In the music world, booking agents are different from [[talent manager]]s. Booking agents are the people who actually book [[Concert|shows]] for the artists they represent. These agents make all of the arrangements with the promoters of the shows. The booking agent presents the [[music promoter|promoter]] or producer of the concert with a [[contract|performance agreement]], which stipulates the artist's requirements. Items may include [[stage lighting|lighting]], sound, meals, hotel accommodations, and transportation. For concert buyers, they work to find the artist who will fit in the need and available budget.

Many of the major booking agencies refuse to represent clients who are not already signed to a major [[record label]] and have national distribution of their music. Because of this, artists on [[independent record labels]] often seek representation with an independent booking agency.

Bars and nightclubs that specialize in presenting live music on a regular basis often employ an individual to assemble the schedule of events. This individual is the venue's buyer, and should not be confused with the booking agent, who presents a roster of available acts to the buyer. Booking agents may also have contacts known as free-lance promoters. These are individuals who agree to produce a concert by locating a venue, providing a sound system and assembling a staff. Producing a show in this manner, at a location rented out for a single evening, is called “four-walling,” as the process entails renting a venue and receiving no additional services or technical equipment other than the space itself. This has often been the only available option for underground musicians lacking enough popular appeal to gain access to more conventional performance venues (see: [[Punk rock]]), but is also used among the genre of [[rave]]s and various DJ-related events.

The cost factor of having a booking agent must be weighed against what the agent can do for clients and buyers alike. Some agents represent several different types of artists, while others represent artists in one main area/genre.

Some music agencies deal exclusively with [[cover bands]], listing exclusive and non-exclusive artists on their rosters. In addition, some agencies will also work with a third party company to build specific bands using their own database of vetted musicians, whilst other cover band agencies work with [[session musicians]], that provide a 'flexible' line up for each act.

===Cruise ship industry===
Booking agents are also used for the cruise ship industry where several different categories of entertainers are needed. These can include individual musicians to be part of the ship's orchestra, small bands and ensembles as well as variety entertainers such as singers, instrumentalists, magicians, comedians and acrobats. Artists looking to work on cruise ships will sign an employment contract with the cruise line and a separate commission contract with the booking agent. The agent will usually be based in the country of origin for the artist.

===Music managers===&lt;!--Linked to from "Music management"--&gt;
{{main|Talent manager#Music managers}}
A music manager (or band manager) handles many career issues for bands, singers, record producers, and DJs. A music manager is hired by a musician or band to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotions, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers is extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, business manager (who is sometimes a [[certified public accountant]]), [[Tour promoter|tour managers]], and sometimes even a personal assistant. Responsibilities of a business manager are often divided among many individuals who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers must assume multiple roles: booking agent, graphic designer, [[publicist]], promoter, and accountant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getsigned.com/trench01.html When Does My Band Need A Manager?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203221153/http://www.getsigned.com/trench01.html |date=3 February 2009 }} Getsigned.com 16 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As an artist's career develops, responsibilities grow. A music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding music producers, and developing relationships with record companies, publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. The duties of an active music manager will focus on developing a reputation for the musician and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, and booking shows. A music manager will gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility.

===Online voice talent agents===
With the advent of the internet, established and new talent can have a thriving career in the voice over industry through online casting websites. Whilst there are sites that allow any person to join, a new wave of 'professionals only' casting websites is emerging. In an industry where radio and television voice overs can be recorded in home studios because of technology becoming so affordable, high paying jobs are no longer sourced exclusively through traditional voice talent agents.

==History==

Since the decline in viewership in theaters, from the 1950s to 1960s, a monumental shift occurred in how studios produced films and reduced the cost of exclusive and expensive actors. After the shift, actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity, and so were able to work with other studios. This shift has meant that agents were now seen as a necessity instead of an option. Agents became third parties who negotiated between studios and clients, making the need for the agents' services an imperative for each party.

In the 1980s new agencies were established to compete with the "Big five."  In 1991 Bauer-Benedek merged with Leading Artists Agency to form what became United Talent Agency. These agencies were Traid Artists and InterTalent. Traid Artist would eventually be sold to [[William Morris Agency]] in 1992, and InterTalent would diminish when its partners dispersed between UTA and ICM in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Paul(2008). The Star System: The Production of Hollywood Stardom in the Post-Studio Era, p. 168-171. Blackwell Publishing, Inc., MA. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-3388-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 2000s, Hollywood's largest talent agencies were known as the "big five"&lt;ref&gt;"Though suits are still the standard at the Big Five agencies (C.A.A., William Morris, I.C.M., U.T.A. and Endeavor)" Laporte, Nicole. "[http://www.observer.com/node/51319 Let's Dress It Down, Ari.]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414175729/http://www.observer.com/node/51319 |date=14 April 2009 }} ''[[New York Observer]]'', 25 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; or "top five".&lt;ref&gt;"Skirmishes among [Hollywood]'s top five agencies are escalating." Horn, John. "[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/03/entertainment/et-word3 Summer battle royale for agents.]" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 3 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Creative Artists Agency (CAA), William Morris Agency (WMA), United Talent Agency (UTA), [[International Creative Management]] (ICM), and [[Endeavor Talent Agency|Endeavor]].  In 2009 two of the agencies, Endeavor and the William Morris Agency, merged to form William Morris Endeavor (WME). In 2012, International Creative Management completed a management buyout and formed a partnership with the new name, ICM Partners.

==Difference between agents and managers==
The difference between the roles of agents and managers has become smaller and more blurred.&lt;ref&gt;"The Difference Between an 'Agent' and a 'Manager', Slate.com. "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/1998/12/the_difference_between_an_agent_and_a_manager.html&lt;/ref&gt;  A frequent definition of the role of a talent manager is to "oversee the day-to-day business affairs of an artist; advise and counsel talent concerning professional matters, long-term plans and personal decisions which may affect their career."&lt;ref&gt;26,900 results returned from search of quoted phrase on Google. https://www.google.com/#q=%22oversee+the+day-to-day+business+affairs+of+an+artist%3B+advise+and+counsel+talent+concerning+professional+matters%2C+long-term+plans+and+personal+decisions+which+may+affect+their+career.%22&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable overlap exists as talent agents may opt to fill exactly the same roles for their clients out of a financial interest in developing the careers of their talent and currying their favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~usclrev/pdf/076405.pdf | title=TALENT AGENTS, PERSONAL MANAGERS, AND THEIR CONFLICTS IN THE NEW HOLLYWOOD | publisher=The University of Southern California | accessdate=20 March 2014 | author=DAVID ZELENSKI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various state laws and labor guild rules govern the roles reserved to agents, as well as specifying certain special rights, privileges, and prohibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Talent Agents.  "Talent Agency Licensing," http://www.agentassociation.com/frontdoor/agency_licensing.cfm{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the state of California, the labor code requires licensing of talent agencies and includes regulations such as criminal background checks, maintaining separate operating accounts and client trust accounts, and limits total commissions to twenty-five percent, among other regulations.&lt;ref&gt;"Laws Relating to Talent Agencies," California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/talent/talent_laws_relating_to_talent_agencies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, management companies are described as "often unregulated."&lt;ref&gt;"Agents and Managers," SAG-AFTRA Website.  http://www.sagaftra.org/content/agents-and-managers&lt;/ref&gt; Agents also have certain privileged powers in situations of verbal agreement and can legally agree to a binding employment offer on behalf of their client.

A prominent difference between agents and managers under California state law is that licensed talent agents and employment agents are the only entities legally allowed to seek work on behalf of their clients.&lt;ref&gt;Busch, Richard (March 25, 2013). "Walking on the California Talent Agency Act's Thin Ice: Personal Managers Beware," Forbes. https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbusch/2013/03/25/walking-on-the-california-talent-agency-acts-thin-ice-personal-managers-beware/&lt;/ref&gt;  This legal distinction has enabled artists such as the Deftones, Pamela Anderson, Nia Vardalos, Freddie Prinze Jr., and others to break contracts with their managers and avoid commissions owed according to those contracts by proving "unlicensed procurement" in court.&lt;ref&gt;DLSE - Talent Agency Cases. http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/dlse-tacs.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Because the enforcement against talent managers procuring work is largely carried out through civil litigation and not criminal penalties, managers directly seek out work in defiance of state laws, as clients out of self-interest will seldom object to them doing so and cases alleging illegal procurement are infrequent.

The Writer's  Guild, Screen Actor's Guild, and Director's Guild, among labor guilds, strike agency franchise agreements that specify certain regulations and privileges reserved solely for agents including setting maximum commissions at ten percent of a talent's gross earnings.  Managers do not face the same restrictions.

A '''tall tale''' is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual. Some stories such as these are [[exaggeration]]s of actual events, for example [[wikt:fish story|fish stories]] ("the fish that got away") such as, "That fish was so big, why I tell ya', it nearly sank the boat when I pulled it in!" Other tall tales are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the [[Europe]]an [[countryside]], the [[American frontier]], the Canadian Northwest, or the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Things are often told in a way that makes the narrator seem to have been a part of the story, and are good-natured. The line between legends and tall tales is distinguished primarily by age; many legends exaggerate the exploits of their heroes, but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large, to the extent of becoming the whole of the story.

=={{anchor|American tall taIe}}American tall tale==
The tall tale is a fundamental element of [[Folklore of the United States|American folk literature]]. The tall tale's origins are seen in the bragging contests that often occurred when the rough men of the [[American frontier]] gathered. The tales of legendary figures of the Old West, some listed below, owe much to the style of tall tales.

The semi-annual speech contests held by [[Toastmasters International]] public speaking clubs may include a Tall Tales contest. Each and every participating speaker is given three to five minutes to give a short speech of a tall tale nature, and is then judged according to several factors. The winner proceeds to the next level of competition. The contest does not proceed beyond any participating district in the organization to the International level.

The [[comic strip]] ''[[Non Sequitur (comic strip)|Non Sequitur]]'' sometimes features tall tales told by the character Captain Eddie; it is left up to the reader to decide if he is telling the truth, exaggerating a real event, or just telling a [[wikt:whopper|whopper]].

==Similar traditions in other cultures==
[[File:Skvader.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[skvader]], an example of a tall tale hunting story.]]
Similar [[storytelling]] traditions are present elsewhere. For instance:

===Australian tall tales===
The Australian frontier (known as the bush or the outback) similarly inspired the types of tall tales that are found in American folklore. The Australian versions typically concern a mythical [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]] called [[The Speewah]]. The heroes of the Speewah include:
*[[Rodney Ansell]] 
*Big Bill &amp;ndash; The dumbest man on the Speewah who made his living cutting up [[mining]] shafts and selling them for post holes
*[[Crooked Mick]] &amp;ndash; A champion [[Sheep shearer|shearer]] who had colossal strength and quick wit.

Another folk hero in Australian folklore is [[Charlie McKeahnie]], the hero of [[Banjo Paterson]]'s poem "[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]", whose bravery, adaptability, and risk-taking could epitomise the new Australian spirit.

===Canadian tall tales===
The Canadian frontier has also inspired the types of tall tales that are found in American folklore, such as: 
*[[French Canadian]] tales of [[Big Joe Mufferaw]], a giant of a lumberjack and woodsman from the [[Ottawa Valley]], loosely based on real-life lumberjack  [[Joseph Montferrand]]
*Johnny Chinook, a Canadian cowboy and rancher [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] of the Canadian West's [[Alberta]]
*Ti-Jean, a giant 10-year-old French-Canadian lumberjack boy{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
*Sam McGee, the hero of Robert Service's poem "[[The Cremation of Sam McGee]]" (1907)

===European tall tales===
[[File:Giants causeway closeup.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The [[Columnar basalt]] that makes up the Giant's Causeway; in legend, a fine set of [[hexagonal]] stepping stones to Scotland, made by Fionn mac Cumhaill]] 
Some European tall tales include:
*[[Toell the Great]] was one of the great tall tales of Estonia.
*The [[Babin Republic]], in Renaissance Poland (1568) was a satirical society dedicated entirely to mocking people and telling tall tales
*Juho Nätti (1890–1964), known as Nätti-Jussi, was a Finnish lumberjack known for telling tall tales; his stories have also circulated as folk tales and been collected in books.
*''[[The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel]]'' (16th Century) by the French writer [[Rabelais]] told the tale of two giants; father and son.
*The many farfetched adventures of the fictional German nobleman [[Baron Munchausen]], some of which may have had a [[folklore]] basis.
*Legends of the Irish mythological hunter-warrior [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]], also known as Finn MacCool, have it that he built the [[Giant's Causeway]] as stepping-stones to Scotland, so as not to get his feet wet, and that he also once scooped up part of Ireland to fling it at a rival, but it missed and landed in the [[Irish Sea]]; the clump became the [[Isle of Man]], the pebble became [[Rockall]], and the void became [[Lough Neagh]].
*A [[brown bear]] coating himself in baking soda to be acceptable to humans as a [[polar bear]], a young boy selling frozen words, and a woman whose voice cuts through a giant tree to release oranges that light the Polar night are all tales told by a [[Pomor]] elder in the Soviet animation film ''[[Laughter and Grief by the White Sea]]'' (1988). 
*The Cumbrian Liars, a United Kingdom association who follow in the [[Seven-league boots|seven-league footsteps]] of Will Ritson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grizedale.org/lying/history/index.htm |title=Cumbrian Liars|website=grizedale.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern-day tall tales==
[[Arlo Guthrie]]'s ''[[Alice's Restaurant (album)|Motorcycle Song]]'' is often accompanied by a tall tale about the origin of the song.

'''''The Perfect Moment''''' was the most comprehensive retrospective of works by New York photographer [[Robert Mapplethorpe]]. The show spanned twenty-five years of his career, featuring [[celebrity portrait]]s, [[self-portrait]]s, [[interracial]] figure studies, floral still lifes, [[homoerotic]] images, and collages. The exhibition, organized by [[Janet Kardon]] of the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia|Institute of Contemporary Arts in Philadelphia]], opened in the winter of 1988 just months before Mapplethorpe’s death from [[AIDS]] complications on March 9, 1989.  On tour, in the summer of 1989, the exhibition became the centerpiece of a controversy concerning federal funding of the arts and censorship.

== Exhibition ==
=== Background ===
''The Perfect Moment'' covered all aspects of the photographer’s career from the late 1960s to 1988. The traveling exhibition had been scheduled to appear at five other museums in various regions of the country during the next year and a half. It included more than 150 images. Despite the controversial character of some of the [[photograph]]s, critical response was enthusiastic and attendance was robust throughout the show's [[Philadelphia]] run (from December 1988 through January 1989).

''The Perfect Moment'' traveled to the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago]]. Again, it generated no unfavorable public or critical attention. In June 1989, after the cancellation of the exhibition by the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington D.C.]], two and a half weeks before it was to open there, ''The Perfect Moment'' unexpectedly provoked national controversy and ICA became a key player in the congressional debate over what public funds should and should not fund. The issues of censorship and artistic freedom that the show raised occupied the forefront of the debates between conservatives and liberals during the [[Ronald Reagan]] era and in its aftermath. Members of the religious right, especially, criticized academics and artists for what they regarded as their indecent, subversive and blasphemous works. 

=== Layout and works displayed ===
''The Perfect Moment'' grouped photos into three categories: 
*Rigorously conceived portraits and figure studies;
*Dramatically lit flower arrangements in color, and in black and white;
*Photographs of gay [[sadomasochism]] (S&amp;M) that left nothing to the imagination.

Robert Mapplethorpe’s XYZ portfolios, explored three subjects: homosexual [[sadomasochism]] (X); flower still lifes (Y); and nude portraits of [[African American]] men (Z). The extremely graphic S&amp;M photos from Mapplethorpe’s X Portfolio were displayed in a separate, age-restricted area during at each venue of the exhibition. The portfolios were displayed with a series of poems by poet and singer [[Patti Smith]]. The poems echo Mapplethorpe's X,Y,Z trope.

{{quote|“Y is the symbol of the covenant which exists between the artist and his creator/ Y is the consummation of this idea thru the projection of the perfect shot. ”Please use the poetry as sandwich quotes; I want them to be obvious.” (Patti Smith)}}

The images that sparked the most controversy include:
*Jim and Tom, Sausalito, 1977
*Man in a Polyester Suit, 1980
*Jesse McBride, 1976
*Rosie (Honey), 1976
 
Rosie, a black and white portrait of a very young girl crouched down on a bench outdoors with part of her dress lifted, exposing her genitals, generated controversy because of the subject's age and the issue of consent. This photograph was deemed [[child pornography]] by Mapplethorpe's detractors, and it is surprising that it was featured in the exhibition catalogue, considering that the printer had refused to print it for the Mapplethorpe retrospective at the [[Whitney Museum of Art]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=Playing with the Edge: The Photographic Achievement of Robert Mapplethorpe|date=1996|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was one other photograph of a naked child, "Jessie McBride" which also contributed to the controversy created by "Rosie". 
 
A 55-minute videotape of a [[BBC]] interview with the photographer accompanied the exhibition.

== Reception ==
The art critics in Philadelphia, the show's first venue, critiqued Mapplethorpe's work along formalist lines, without commenting on the provocative content of the X portfolio photographs. Overall, the exhibition was met enthusiastically by critics both Philadelphia and in Chicago, where the show appeared at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]].

However, a campaign launched by the [[American Family Association]], a conservative watchdog group, to censor what they considered “indecent” art changed the climate of reception. In June 12, 1989 [[Christina Orr-Cahall]], the director of the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], cancelled “The Perfect Moment,” which was scheduled to open there on June 30. Orr-Cahall feared that ''The Perfect Moment'' would endanger [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) appropriations in the [[United States Congress]].

The exhibition set off one of the fiercest episodes of America's "[[culture war]]s" —  and sparked a recurring debate about state-funded cultural production and the support of [[sexually explicit]] or [[sacrilegious]] art by public funds.

=== Debate about National Endowment for the Arts ===
The canceling of the ''Perfect Moment'' provoked a [[censorship]] battle about national funding for the arts that was front page news for the next year.

On June 30, 1989, protesters angered by the cancellation of the show by the Corcoran Gallery projected slides of Mapplethorpe’s photographs on the facade of the museum. Seven hundred people rallied to express their outrage about the Corcoran's decision. [[Michael Brenson]], art critic for the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote, “This exhibit should be seen. It is extremely unfortunate that the Corcoran Gallery of Art canceled it last month in the hope of averting a political outcry…. As much as he has been made out to be a renegade and outlaw, Mapplethorpe is an utterly mainstream artist. He loved freshness and glamor and was obsessed with the moment, which his photographs always reflect. In his restricted spaces and his feeling for abstraction and attentiveness to every shape, edge and texture, Mapplethorpe is a child of the Formalism of the 1960’s."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brenson|first1=Michael|title=The Many Roles of Mapplethorpe, Acted out in Ever Shifting Images,|date=July 22, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington Project for the Arts (WPA) stepped in to host the show, and on July 22, 1989, “The Perfect Moment” opened at this alternative art space. No incidents marred the show's run at the Washington Project for the Arts.

However, Senator [[Jesse Helms]] introduced legislation that would stop the NEA from funding artwork he considered “obscene.” The legislation subsequently required any recipients of NEA funds to sign an oath that declared they would not promote obscenity. The oath provoked protests from artists and arts organizations. When, during the next grant cycle, in this climate of fear, applications for support equaling hundreds of thousands of dollars were rejected. Outraged artists filed lawsuits against the agency. A compromise was reached in Congress. Although the radically restrictive Helms amendment did not pass, restrictions were placed on NEA funding procedures.

=== Censorship ===
In March 1990, anti-pornography advocates in [[Cincinnati Ohio]], the [[Citizens for Community Values]], launched a campaign to pressure the [[Contemporary Arts Center]] (CAC) to cancel “The Perfect Moment.” Cincinnati law enforcement ordered four hundred visitors from the museum to leave while they videotaped Mapplethorpe’s photographs as evidence to support obscenity charges brought against [[Dennis Barrie]], the director of the CAC, and against the CAC. This was the first time a museum in the [[United States]] faced prosecution for the art it displayed.

On October 5, 1990, Dennis Barrie and the CAC were acquitted in the [[obscenity]] case. The prosecution failed to convince the jury that Mapplethorpe’s photographs lacked [[artistic merit]]. In Cincinnati, more than 80,000 people saw the show. The censorship proceedings doubtless brought more attention to Mapplethorpe's work than it would have otherwise received.

=== Legacy ===
Since the CAC debacle, images from ''The Perfect Moment'', including the X, Y, and Z portfolios, have circulated to in hundreds of exhibitions internationally. Mapplethorpe's work is currently represented by 12 galleries worldwide, with the largest collection of his works at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]. These photographs and history of their attempted censorship during the 1990s have influenced artists, inspired [[LGBTQ]] advocates, and generated much scholarship.

'''''The Spitting Image: Myth, Memory and the Legacy of Vietnam''''' (1998) is a book by Vietnam veteran and Sociology professor Jerry Lembcke. The book is an analysis of the widely believed, but historically inaccurate, [[urban legend]] that American soldiers were spat upon and insulted by [[Anti-war movement|antiwar protesters]] upon returning home from the [[Vietnam War]]. The book examines the origin of the earliest stories; the popularization of the "spat-upon image" through Hollywood movies and fiction literature, and the role of print news media in perpetuating the now iconic image through which the history of the war and antiwar movement has come to be represented.

Lembcke contrasts the absence of credible evidence of spitting by antiwar activists with the large body of evidence showing a mutually supportive, empathetic relationship between veterans and antiwar forces.  The book documents the efforts of the Nixon Administration to drive a wedge between military servicemen and the antiwar movement by portraying democratic dissent as betrayal of the troops, effectively redirecting blame for failure in Vietnam onto protesters.  Coupled with American society's exaggeration of medical conditions like [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and drug abuse among veterans to the point of broadly vilifying the Vietnam veteran as mentally unfit, emotionally volatile and a "loser" and "victim", the collective memory about Vietnam has been refocused onto the veteran and away from the war. Lembcke equates this disparagement of the antiwar movement and veterans with the similar [[Stab-in-the-back myth|'stab in the back' myths]] propagated by Germany and France after their war defeats, as an alibi for why they lost the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/06/0081080 Stabbed in the back! The Past and Future of a Right-wing Myth] Kevin Baker; ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''; June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Lembcke details the resurrection of this myth of the spat-upon veteran by later administrations during subsequent Gulf War efforts as a way of silencing public dissent.

==Origins==
A persistent but unfounded criticism leveled against [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|those who protested]] the United States's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] is that protesters spat upon and otherwise derided returning soldiers, calling them "baby-killers", etc. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, years after the war in Vietnam ended, the proliferation of these spitting stories increased greatly. As both a Vietnam veteran and a member of the antiwar movement, Lembcke knew this criticism ran counter to what he personally experienced and witnessed. To the contrary, one of the hallmarks of the period's antiwar movement was its support for the troops in the field and the affiliation of many returning veterans with the movement. Lembcke was motivated to look further into the truth and origins of this spat-upon veteran myth, and the contradiction between historical fact and popular collective memory. Other observers had already noticed the proliferation of stories and questioned whether the spitting stories even made sense. In 1987, columnist [[Bob Greene]] noted: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even during the most fervent days of anti-war protest, it seemed that it was not the soldiers whom protesters were maligning.  It was the leaders of government, and the top generals—at least, that is how it seemed in memory. One of the most popular chants during the anti-war marches was, "Stop the war in Vietnam, bring the boys home." You heard that at every peace rally in America. "Bring the boys home." That was the message. Also, when one thought realistically about the image of what was supposed to have happened, it seemed questionable.  So-called "hippies," no matter what else one may have felt about them, were not the most macho people in the world. Picture a burly member of the Green Berets, in full uniform, walking through an airport.  Now think of a "hippie" crossing his path.  Would the hippie have the nerve to spit on the soldier?  And if the hippie did, would the soldier—fresh from facing enemy troops in the jungles of Vietnam—just stand there and take it?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1992, the Director of the Connelly Library and curator of the Vietnam War Collection at [[La Salle University|LaSalle University]] listed the spitting myth as one of the "Top Six Myths" from the Vietnam era, and observed the myth "derives from the mythopoeic belief that returning GI's were routinely spat upon at some time during their repatriation to the USA. This particular round of tales has become so commonplace as to be treated reverently even among otherwise wisely observant veterans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Texts/Scholarly/Baky_White_Cong_01.html The Ambient Truth of Vietnam War Legendry]; John Baky, March 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, scholar Paul Rogat Loeb wrote, "to consider spitting on soldiers as even remotely representative of the activist response is to validate a lie", and noted that myths like that of antiwar activists spitting on soldiers have rewritten or "erased history".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=--FmCtmAO2QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Generation+at+the+Crossroads:+Apathy+and+Action+on+the+American+Campus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=odh0VNMT2OegBLDLgpgP&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=spitting&amp;f=false Generation at the Crossroads: Apathy and Action on the American Campus]; Paul Rogat Loeb; Rutgers University Press; 1995; pgs. 77-80&lt;/ref&gt; An academic study into the making and shaping of a collective memory found that evidence of antiwar activists targeting troops was virtually nonexistent. Instead, it found popular memory was manipulated by national security elites and a complicit news media by frequently labeling resistors to U.S. war efforts as "anti-troop".&lt;ref&gt;Beamish, Thomas D., Harvey Molotch, and Richard Flacks. 1995. "Who Supports the Troops? Vietnam, the Gulf War, and the Making of Collective Memory." Social Problems Journal 42 (3):344-60&lt;/ref&gt; As observed by [[Clarence Page]] after interviewing Lembcke and Greene, "the stories have become so widely believed, despite a remarkable lack of witnesses or evidence, that ironically the burden of proof now falls on the accused, the protesters; not their accusers, the veterans. Antiwar protesters must prove the episodes didn't happen, instead of the veterans having to prove they did."&lt;ref name="JWR"&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/page090298.html Whose history?]; [[Jewish World Review]]; September 2, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this complete lack of evidence that spitting occurred, but acknowledging that it is impossible to prove something never happened, Lembcke set out:&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; pg. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;to show how it is possible for a large number of people to believe that Vietnam veterans were spat upon when there is no evidence that they were. In effect, my strategy was to set aside the question of whether or not such acts occurred and to show why even if they did not occur it is understandable that the image of the spat-upon veteran has become widely accepted. Indeed, given the manipulation of information and images that began with the Nixon administration and continued at the hands of filmmakers and the news media during the 1970s and 1980s, it would be remarkable if a majority of Americans had not come to believe that Vietnam veterans were abused by the antiwar movement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Synopsis==

At the time he wrote ''The Spitting Image'', Lembcke had not found a single substantiated media report to support the now common claims of spitting. He theorizes that the reported "spitting on soldiers" scenario was a mythical projection by those who felt "spat upon" by an American society tired of the war; an image which was then used to discredit future antiwar activism and serve political interests. He suggests that the manufactured images of pro-war antipathy against antiwar protesters also helped contribute to the myth. Lembcke asserts that memories of being verbally and physically assaulted by antiwar protesters were largely conjured, noting that not even one case could be reliably documented. He further suggests the "baby-killer" and "murderer" components of the myth may have been reinforced, in part, by the common chants by protesters aimed at President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Baines Johnson]], like "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?"

''The Spitting Image'' asserts that the image of abuse of soldiers by antiwar demonstrators only really became ingrained in the American consciousness years after the war had come to a close. Lembcke attributes part of the legend's growth to films relating to Vietnam, notably ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'', in which a "spat-upon veteran" image is popularized. He writes that the myth of the spat-upon veteran was later revived by President [[George H. W. Bush]] as a way to help suppress dissent when selling the [[Gulf War]] to the American people. Lembcke believes that resurrection of the myth was useful in promoting the [[yellow ribbon#United States|yellow ribbon]] ''Support our Troops'' campaign, as it implies that for one to support the troops, one must also support the war. It conflates the ideas of antiwar sentiment and anti-troop sentiment, despite a common antiwar chant being "Support the Troops: Bring them Home!"

The "spat-upon veteran" meme became so pervasive that some found it hard not to believe. In 1989, Bob Greene's book ''[[Homecoming: When the Soldiers Returned from Vietnam|Homecoming]]'' reprinted letters he had solicited, asking to hear from veterans if they had been spat upon.&lt;ref name="JWR"/&gt; Greene's book includes 63 alleged accounts involving spitting, and 69 accounts from veterans who do not believe anyone was spat upon after returning from Vietnam, among other stories. Greene admits he couldn't validate the authenticity of the accounts in the letters he received, but he did believe spitting must have occurred, stating, "There were simply too many letters, going into too fine a detail, to deny the fact." Greene concluded, "I think you will agree, after reading the letters, that even if several should prove to be not what they appear to be, that does not detract from the overall story that is being told."&lt;ref&gt;''Homecoming; When the Soldier Returned from Vietnam''; Bob Greene; G. P. Putnam's Sons; 1989; Pgs. 10-16&lt;/ref&gt; "Greene was too willing to suspend disbelief", says Lembcke, who cited Greene's book as an example of how prolific the stories had become and also for the patterns that appeared in them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; Pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Lembke said, "These stories have to be taken very seriously, but as historical evidence they are problematic. In the first place, stories of this type didn't surface until about ten years after the end of the war. If the incidents occurred when the story tellers say they did, in the closing years of the war, why is there no evidence for that? Moreover, many of the stories have elements of such exaggeration that one has to question the veracity of the entire account."&lt;ref name="RLG"/&gt;

Lembcke points out that there were several newspaper accounts of pro-war demonstrators spitting on antiwar demonstrators and suggests that these oral accounts could easily have been reinterpreted and inverted and made into stories about activists spitting on veterans.&lt;ref name="RLG"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051014023306/http://www.rlg.org/en/page.php?Page_ID=95 1999 Annual Membership Meeting]; Research Libraries Group; 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He highlights the contradictions between the collective memory of today and contemporaneous historical records, like the results from a 1971 poll showing over 94% of returning Vietnam soldiers received a "friendly" welcome.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; Pgs. 68, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Lembcke also notes how it was older vets from previous wars who most often scorned the returning Vietnam Vets; in 1978 the [[Vietnam Veterans of America]] vowed in its founding principle: Never again will one generation of veterans abandon another.&lt;ref name="Mazur"&gt;''A More Perfect Military: How the Constitution Can Make Our Military Stronger''; Diane H. Mazur; Oxford University Press, 2010; Pgs. 98-101&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Spitting Image'' Lembcke acknowledges that he cannot prove the negative—that no Vietnam veteran was ever spat on—saying it is hard to imagine there not being expressions of hostility between veterans and activists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt; "I cannot, of course, prove to anyone's satisfaction that spitting incidents like these did not happen. Indeed, it seems likely to me that it probably did happen to some veteran, some time, some place. But while I cannot prove the negative, I can prove the positive: I can show what did happen during those years and that that historical record makes it highly unlikely that the alleged acts of spitting occurred in the number and manner that is now widely believed."&lt;ref name="RLG"/&gt;

Shafer's ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]'' online articles on the matter, which frequently cited Lembcke's research, generated enormous feedback; the May 2000 article alone received nearly 300 postings on the subject in just a few days, one of its largest-ever responses.&lt;ref name="HSJournal"&gt;''[[Humanity and Society]]''; Volume 26, Number 1; February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shafer, the myth persists primarily because: 

{{quote box|width=50%|align=left|1) Those who didn't go to Vietnam—that being most of us—don't dare contradict the "experience" of those who did;

2) The story helps maintain the perfect sense of shame many of us feel about the way we ignored our Vietvets;

3) The press keeps the story in play by uncritically repeating it, as the Times and U.S. News did;

4) Because any fool with 33 cents and the gumption to repeat the myth in his letter to the editor can keep it in circulation. Most recent mentions of the spitting protester in Nexis are of this variety.}}

Shafer acknowledges that it's possible that a Vietnam veteran somewhere might have been spat upon during the war years, and notes that Lembcke concedes as much because nobody can prove something never happened.  Shafer announced a challenge to his readers, "Indeed, each time I write about the spit myth, my inbox overflows with e-mail from readers who claim that a spitting protester targeted them while they were in uniform. Or the e-mail writer claims it happened to a brother or a friend at the airport or bus station. I expect similar e-mails this time, and I will share with readers any account that comes with some sort of evidence—such as a contemporaneous newspaper story or an arrest report—that documents the sordid event.  If you can point me to a documented case of a returning Viet vet getting spat upon, please drop a line to slate.pressbox@gmail.com. E-mail may be quoted by name unless the writer stipulates otherwise."

Likewise, Lembcke joined the discussion and also commented on it in the ''[[Humanity &amp; Society]]'' journal, saying the stories just keep getting better, and asking for any evidence to be raised. The discussions spawned yet another round of more than 60 stories, yet only one was credible.&lt;ref name="HSJournal"/&gt;

Northwestern Law School professor [[James Lindgren]] also joined the discussions and, after a review of contemporary news sources, initially claimed to have found news accounts that discussed spitting incidents.  Lembcke provided an 18-point response to Lindgren's research, refuting each of his claims but expressing interest in one of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2007/02/more_spit_takes.html]; Slate Magazine; 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A December 27, 1971 CBS Evening News report on veteran Delmar Pickett who said he was spat at in Seattle appeared, according to Lembcke, to have some validity as a claim, but still not as evidence that the incident reported actually happened.&lt;ref&gt;[[CBS Evening News]], ([[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]] reporting) [http://www.slate.com/id/2161038/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=214568 Vietnam Veteran CBS News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some second-hand news accounts that mention spitting do actually exist, although there has been no evidence to support the narrative that antiwar demonstrators were responsible. Documented accounts exist where the antiwar demonstrators were actually the victims, not the perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Kulik1"/&gt;  Other commentators have since addressed the myth to various degrees, even referencing the debate spawned by the Slate files.

In his 2009 book, ''War Stories'', historian and Vietnam veteran Gary Kulik devoted a whole chapter to the myth of "Spit-upon veterans".  He closely examined Greene's book of letters and the Slate files, as well as the research by Lindgren and Lembcke.&lt;ref name="Kulik1"&gt;''War Stories: False Atrocity Tales, Swift Boaters, and Winter Soldiers - What Really Happened in Vietnam; Gary Kulik; [[Potomac Books]], Inc., 2009; Pgs. 79-96&lt;/ref&gt;  Kulik noted the contradictory nature of the stories in Greene's book and concluded that Greene arrogantly dismissed the "surprising number" of veterans who "refuse to believe" the spitting stories, and wrote, "Greene was not just credulous, but negligently irresponsible."  Kulik also criticized Lindgren's research, writing, "Lindgren's evidence includes only one single first-person ("I was spit upon") account—the stories that are at the heart of Lembcke's book—and it appears the none of the accounts he cites were actually witnessed by a reporter. Moreover, Lindgren does not cite a single case of a Vietnam veteran spit upon as he returned home, and that was the story that would ultimately be repeated and believed."  Kulik concluded that the spitting stories were formulaic and unbelievable, and were propagated to serve the political goals of those who wished to vilify the antiwar movement. "The image of 'hippie' men and women hawking up gobs of phlegm to hurl at the ribbons of veterans, as a pervasive and commonplace act, is surely false."&lt;ref name="Kulik1"/&gt;
   
Specialist in civil-military relations and advisor to the National Institute of Military Justice, Diane Mazur, also examined the works by Greene, Lembcke and Lindgren, and concluded: "There is no contemporaneous evidence that Americans who opposed the war expressed those beliefs by spitting on or otherwise assaulting returning Vietnam Veterans. [...] The idea, however, that spitting on or mistreating Vietnam veterans was in any way typical or representative of anything in that era is completely false. [...] It is by far the most powerful Vietnam War meme—a cultural unit of information passed from one person to another, like a biological gene—because it can be deployed instantly to silence difficult but necessary conversations about the military.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' review:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;The image is ingrained: A Vietnam veteran, arriving home from the war, gets off a plane only to be greeted by an [[angry mob]] of antiwar protesters yelling, 'Murderer!' and 'Baby killer!' Then out of the crowd comes someone who spits in the veteran's face. The only problem, according to Jerry Lembcke, is that no such incident has ever been documented. It is instead, says Lembcke, a kind of [[urban legend|urban myth]] that reflects our lingering national confusion over the war."&lt;ref name="NYU Press"&gt;[http://nyupress.org/books/book-details.aspx?bookId=5151 The Spitting Image]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}; New York University Press; 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Well-argued and documented."&lt;ref name="NYU Press"/&gt;

Karl Helicher, [[Library Journal]] review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Images of long-haired antiwar protesters, almost always women, spitting on returning Vietnam veterans have become a shameful part of America's collective memory. Lembcke (sociology, Holy Cross Univ.), a member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, here presents a stunning indictment of this myth, an illusion created, he maintains, by the Nixon-Agnew administration and an unwitting press to attribute America's loss in Vietnam to internal dissension. In fact, the antiwar movement and many veterans were closely aligned, and the only documented incidents show members of the VFW and American Legion spitting on their less successful Vietnam peers. But Lembcke's most controversial conclusion is that posttraumatic stress disorder was as much a political creation?a means of discrediting returning vets who protested the war as unhinged?as it was a medical condition. The image of the psycho-vet was furthered through such Hollywood productions as The Deer Hunter and Coming Home. This forceful investigation challenges the reader to reexamine assumptions about the dark side of American culture that glorifies war more than peace. Highly recommended for large public libraries and for all academic peace studies collections.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/The-Spitting-Image-Memory-Vietnam/dp/product-description/0814751474/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books Editorial reviews - The Spitting Image]; Amazon Books - Product Overview&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Maurice Isserman]], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The myth of the spat-upon veteran is not only bad history, but it has been instrumental in selling the American public on bad policy.&lt;ref name="NYU Press"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Christian G. Appy]], ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lembcke's debunking of the spitting stories is quite persuasive. But he has much broader aims. Not only was there no spitting, he argues, but there was no hostility or tension at all between veterans and protesters. In fact, he characterizes their relationship as "empathetic and mutually supporting." It is certainly true that a remarkable number of veterans opposed the war, and that the antiwar movement did forge alliances with veterans. It is also true that American culture has given too little in-depth attention to antiwar veterans. But Lembcke insists on a strict either/or argument: Veterans and peaceniks were either enemies or comrades. "Antiwar activists could not have been spitting on veterans while at the same time befriending them in off-base coffeehouses," he writes. [...] My own view is that the spitting stories are largely mythic, but that the myth itself reflects the deep anger and animosity that many veterans harbored toward the antiwar movement. Their anger often reflected a sense of class injustice that gave their more privileged peers greater freedom to avoid the war. [...] I base my conclusions on extensive interviews I have conducted with Vietnam veterans since the early 1980s. Lembcke, however, gives no credence to the possibility that veterans themselves played a role in creating the myth of antiwar spitters, or that the myth teaches us anything meaningful about the class and wartime experiences of veterans. For him, the myth is almost entirely a product of Hollywood and right-wing politicians.&lt;ref name="Appy"&gt;[http://www.wright.edu/~tdung/vn.htm The Muffling of Public Memory in Post-Vietnam America]; ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''; February 12, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\

:"The best history I have seen on the impact of the war on Americans, both then and now."&lt;ref name="NYU Press"/&gt;

Mary Carroll, [[Booklist]] review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, Holy Cross College sociology professor Lembcke can't prove a negative, but he makes a strong case that tales of antiwar activists spitting at returning vets are myth. Lembcke, a Nam vet who was active in Vietnam Veterans Against the War, opens with Persian Gulf War politicians' use of "the spitting image" and then traces Nixon and Agnew's agitated response to antiwar activism by GIs and veterans. He notes that contemporary media, government, and polling data show no evidence of antiwar spitting incidents; the few events reported had supporters of the war targeting opponents. But later studies reported hostility toward veterans; "the spitting image" epitomized that narrative. Similar images were common in post-World War I Germany and France after Indochina; Lembcke suggests the Nixon administration cultivated this notion of betrayal because it stigmatized both the antiwar movement and veterans against the war. With development of a new psychiatric diagnosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, a good vet/bad vet split was complete, and Hollywood films shifted attention from the war itself to its GI victims.&lt;ref name="Amazon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lembcke builds a compelling case against collective memory by demonstrating that remembrances of Vietnam were almost at direct odds with circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref name="NYU Press"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contemporary [[literary studies]], a '''theme''' is the central topic a text treats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/200321?rskey=8toWeL&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid
| title = Oxford English Dictionary

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes  can be divided into two categories: a work's ''thematic concept'' is what readers "think the work is about" and its ''thematic statement'' being "what the work says about the subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Griffith| first = Kelley| title = Writing Essays about Literature| place = | publisher = Cengage Learning| year = 2010| edition = 8| page =40| language =| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a05Efo1hOa4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=| isbn =1428290419| accessdate=  February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common contemporary understanding of theme is an idea or point that is central to a story, which can often be summed in a single word (e.g. love, death, betrayal). Typical examples of themes of this type are conflict between the individual and society; coming of age; humans in conflict with technology; [[nostalgia]]; and the dangers of unchecked ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Kirszner| first = Laura G. | last2 =Mandell| first2 =Stephen R.| title = Fiction: Reading, Reacting, Writing| publisher =Paulinas| year =1994| pages =3–4| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VzojstMHtY0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=| isbn =015501014X | accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{examples needed |date=March 2013}} A theme may be exemplified by the actions, utterances, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An example of this would be the thematic idea of loneliness in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', wherein many of the characters seem to be lonely. It may differ from the thesis—the text's or author's implied worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Weitz| first = Morris| title = Shakespeare Survey| publisher =Cambridge University Press| volume = 28| year = 2002| chapter = Literature Without Philosophy: "Antony and Cleopatra"| page =30| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-CdmtQURHc8C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=| isbn =0521523656| accessdate= February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{example needed | march 2013}}

A story may have several themes. Themes often explore historically common or cross-culturally recognizable ideas, such as ethical questions, and are usually implied rather than stated explicitly. An example of this would be whether one should live a seemingly better life, at the price of giving up parts of one's humanity, which is a theme in [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley’s]] ''Brave New World''. Along with [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Character (arts)|character]], [[Setting (fiction)|setting]], and [[Style (fiction)|style]], theme is considered one of the [[literary element|components]] of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Obstfeld|2002|pp=1,65,115,171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Various [[Literary technique|techniques]] may be used to express many more themes.

===Leitwortstil===
''Leitwortstil'' is the repetition of a wording, often with a theme, in a narrative to make sure it catches the reader's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last= Pinault| first= David| title= Story Telling Techniques in the "Arabian Nights"| publisher= Brill| series= Studies in Arabic Literature| volume= 15| year= 1992| page= 18| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=guHmLGJMbg4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq= | isbn= 9004095306 | accessdate= February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a leitwortstil is the recurring phrase, "So it goes", in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''. Its seeming message is that the world is [[deterministic]]: that things only could have happened in one way, and that the future already is predetermined. But given the anti-war tone of the story, the message perhaps is on the contrary, that ''things could have been different''. A non-fictional example of leitwortstil is in the book ''Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now'' written by Gordon Livingston, which is an anthology of personal anecdotes multiple times interjected by the phrases "Don't do the same thing and expect different results", "It is a bad idea to lie to yourself", and "No one likes to be told what to do".

===Thematic patterning===
''Thematic patterning'' means the insertion of a recurring motif in a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault, David. 1992. ''Story-telling techniques in the Arabian nights''. Leiden: Brill. p. 22. {{ISBN|9004095306}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, various scenes in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' are about loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Scalia| first = Joseph E.| last2 =Shamblin| first2 =Lena T. &amp; Research and Education Association | title =  John Steinbeck's Of mice and men| place =Piscataway, N.J | publisher =Research &amp; Education Association | year =2001| page =13| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=96WfEbkKIKAC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=| isbn =087891997X | accessdate= February 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic patterning is evident in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'',&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s) ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–360 [359–60]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example being the story of "The City of Brass". According to David Pinault, the overarching theme of that tale, in which a group of travelers roam the desert in search of ancient brass artifacts, is that "riches and pomp tempt one away from God".&lt;ref name="Pinault_23"&gt;Pinault, David. 1992. ''Story-telling techniques in the Arabian nights''. Leiden: Brill. p. 23. {{ISBN|9004095306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative is interrupted several times by stories within the story. These include a tale recorded in an inscription found in the palace of Kush ibh Shaddad; a story told by a prisoner about Solomon; and an episode involving Queen Tadmur's corpse. According to Pinault, "each of these minor narratives introduces a character who confesses that he once proudly enjoyed worldly prosperity: subsequently, we learn, the given character has been brought low by God ... These minor tales ultimately reinforce the theme of the major narrative".&lt;ref name="Pinault_23"/&gt;

== Examples ==
Some common themes in literature are "love," "war," "revenge," "betrayal,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; "patriotism," "grace," "isolation," "motherhood," "forgiveness," "wartime loss,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; "treachery," "rich versus poor," "appearance versus reality," and "help from other-worldly powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brown|Rosenberg|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Africa, Europe, and Asia [[Flint tool|flint arrowheads and axes]] turned up by farmer's plows were considered to have fallen from the sky. They were often thought to be [[thunderbolt]]s and are called '''"thunderstones"'''. It was not until travelers returned from far-away places where these implements were in [[Primitive culture|actual use]] that the origins of these objects became known. Even then, these travelers' tales received little popular credence.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;Leach, Maria. ""Flint"." Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legend. 3rd ed. New York, New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1972. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thunderstone folklore==
[[File:HMB Steinaxtmanufaktur Vinelz Jungsteinzeit 2700 BC.jpg|thumb|Axe heads found at a 2700 BC Neolithic manufacture site in Switzerland, arranged in the various stages of production from left to right.]]
In [[Scandinavian mythology|Scandinavia]] thunderstones were frequently worshiped as [[Household deity|family gods]] who kept off spells and witchcraft. [[Beer]] was poured over them as an offering and they were sometimes anointed with butter. In [[Switzerland]] the owner of a thunderstone whirls it, on the end of a thong, three times round his head, and throws it at the door of his dwelling at the approach of a storm to prevent [[Lightning strike|lightning from striking the house]]. In Italy they are hung around children's necks to protect them from illness and to ward off the [[Evil eye]]. In Roman times they were sewn inside dog-collars along with a little piece of [[coral]] to keep the dogs from going mad. In Sweden they offer protection from [[Elf|elves]]. In the [[French Alps]] they protect sheep, while elsewhere in France they are thought to ease [[childbirth]]. In Burma they are used as a cure and preventative for [[appendicitis]]. In Japan they cure boils and ulcers. In Malay and Sumatra they are used to sharpen the [[kris]], are considered very lucky objects, and are credited with being [[Touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstones]] for gold. Among the Slavs they cure warts on man and beast, and during [[Passion Week]] they have the property to reveal hidden [[treasure]].&lt;ref name="Leach"/&gt;

===Further examples of thunderstone folklore===
[[Image:Bifaz de Atapuerca (TG10).jpg|thumb|left|Picture of two [[Lower Paleolithic]] [[biface]]s]]
In the [[British Isles]] some idea of their original use is retained, and they are often referred to variously as elf arrows, elf bolts, elf darts, or fairy arrows, and are said to have been shot by elves or [[fairies]] at a person or animal to bewitch them. On the other hand, they are thought, for the most part, to protect the possessor from these little people. The presence of flint instruments found in British [[cinerary urn]]s of the [[Roman Britain|Roman Era]] is explained by two theories: 1) they were used by the [[mourner]]s to lacerate themselves; 2) flints (like all fire-producing stones) are potent magic for preventing the [[Haunted house|return of the dead.]] In Ireland flint stones are soaked in water to make a medicine which is good for man or beast. Mounted in silver they are worn as protection against [[elf-shot]], i.e. elf- or fairy-inflicted disease.
In North Carolina and Alabama there is a belief that flint stones placed in the fire will keep hawks from molesting the chickens, a belief which probably stems from the European idea that elf arrows protect domestic animals. In Brazil, flint is used as a divining stone for gold, treasure and water.&lt;ref name="Leach"/&gt; 

During the [[Middle Ages]] many of these well-wrought stones were venerated as weapons, which during the "war in heaven" had been used in driving forth Satan and his hosts; hence, in the 11th century the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] sent to the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman emperor]] a "heaven axe"; and in the 12th century a [[Bishop of Rennes]] asserted the value of thunderstones as a divinely appointed means of securing success in battle, safety on the sea, security against thunder, and immunity from unpleasant dreams. 
Even as late as the 17th century, a French ambassador brought a stone hatchet, which still exists in the museum at [[Musée de l'École de Nancy|Nancy]], as a present to the Prince-Bishop of Verdun, and claimed that it had healing properties.&lt;ref name="McNamara"/&gt;

===Native American thunderstone folklore===
The flint was an object of veneration by most American Indian tribes. According to the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] [[Origin myth]], stone weapons and implements were given to man by the [[Pawnee mythology|Morning Star]]. Among the [[K'iche' people]] of Guatemala, there is a myth that a flint fell from the sky and broke into 1600 pieces, each of which became a god. [[Tohil]], the God who gave them fire, is still represented as flint. This myth provides a parallel to the almost universal belief in the thunderstone, and reminds us that [[Jupiter (mythology)]] was once worshipped in the form of a flint stone. The [[Cherokee]] [[shaman]] invokes a flint when he is about to [[scarify]] a patient prior to applying his medicine. Among the [[Pueblos]] we have the Flint Societies which, in most tribes, were primarily concerned with weather and witchcraft, but sometimes had to do with war and medicine.&lt;ref name="Leach"/&gt;

===Fossil echinoids as thunderstones===
In many parts of southern England until the middle of the nineteenth century, another name commonly used for fossil [[Echinoid]]s was 'thunderstone'. This was a name that in all likelihood formed part of another folk tradition that was almost certainly brought to Britain by [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[Anglo-Saxon]] invaders more than 1500 years ago. In 1677 [[Robert Plot|Dr. Robert Plot]], the first keeper of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford University|Oxford]], published his classic book ''The Natural History of Oxfordshire''. Plot recorded that in [[Oxfordshire]] what we now call fossil echinoids were called thunderstones, as they were thought to have descended from the heavens during a thunderstorm. 
The St. Peter's Church in [[Linkenholt]], England, was built in 1871 near the location of the old St. Peter's, which had stood for nearly 700 years. The 1871 version of the church included fossil echinoids built into the walls surrounding the windows, a style adopted from the original. This implies that Thunderstone folklore was retained for at least 700 years in England, and had its roots in [[pagan]] folklore.&lt;ref name="McNamara"&gt;McNanamara, Kenneth. (2007). Shepards' crowns, fairy loaves and thunderstones: the mythology of fossil echinoids in England. Myth and Geology, (273), 289-293.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of thunderstone mythology==
[[File:Boucher de Perthes.jpg|thumb|right|Boucher de Perthes]]
[[Andrew Dickson White]] described the discovery of the true origin of thunderstones as a "line of observation and thought ... fatal to the theological view". In the last years of the sixteenth century [[Michael Mercati]] tried to prove that the "thunder-stones" were weapons or implements of early races of men; but for some reason his book was not published until the following century, when other thinkers had begun to take up the same idea. In 1723 [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]] addressed the French Academy on "The Origin and Uses of Thunder-stones". He showed that recent travellers from various parts of the world had brought a number of weapons and other implements of stone to France, and that they were essentially similar to what in Europe had been known as "thunderstones". A year later this fact was firmly embedded in the minds of French scientists by the Jesuit [[Lafitau, Joseph-Francois|Joseph-Francois Lafitau]], who published a work showing the similarity between the customs of aborigines then existing in other lands and those of the early inhabitants of Europe. So began, in these works of Jussieu and Lafitau, the science of [[ethnology]]. It was more than 100 years later, after the [[French Revolution of 1830]], that the political climate in Europe was free enough of religious sentiment for archaeological discoveries to be dispassionately investigated and the conclusion reached that human existence spanned a much greater period of time than any Christian theologian had dreamt of.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Andrew D. [[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]. New York: George Braziller, 1955. 266-283&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boucher de Perthes===
In 1847, a man previously unknown to the world at large, [[Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes|Boucher de Perthes]], published in Paris the first volume of work on ''Celtic and Antediluvian Antiquities'', and in this he showed engravings of typical flint implements and weapons, of which he had discovered thousands upon thousands in the high drift beds near Abbeville, in northern France. So far as France was concerned, he was met at first by what he calls "a conspiracy of silence", and then by a contemptuous opposition among orthodox scientists, led by [[Jean-Baptiste Élie de Beaumont|Elie de Beaumont]]. 

In 1863 the thunderstone myth was further discredited by [[Charles Lyell]] in his book ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]''. Lyell had previously opposed the new ideas about [[human antiquity]], and his changing sides gave further force to the scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4996">'''Tile art''' is a small arrangement of tiles, or in some cases a single tile, with a painted pattern or image on top. It is often used as an umbrella term that includes other forms of tile-based art, such as [[mosaic]]s, [[micromosaic]]s, and [[stained glass]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Unlike mosaics, tile art can include larger pieces of tiles that are pre-decorated. While mosaics use pieces of [[tessera]]e or another material to construct a pattern from small components, other methods, such as [[engraving]], [[carving]], and [[Molding (decorative)|molding]] may be used in tile art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthsongtiles.com/making_tiles.html|title=Making Tiles|last=Gresham|first=Shannon|website=earthsongtiles.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GE"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mosaics (art)|journal=Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art|date=2008|pages=674}}&lt;/ref&gt; While mosaics are considered a type of tile art, there are many other forms that are also considered tile art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195313918.001.0001/acref-9780195313918|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195373417|location=|pages=Art 674|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195313918.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of tile art ==
Many types of art can be considered tile art. Different types of tile art have different features and can be created in different mediums, such as ceramic, porcelain, glass tiles, and other tiled mediums.

Listed below are some of the different types of artwork considered tile art:
* Mosaics
* Ceramic tiles
* Stained glass
* Carved tiles
* Photo tiles
* Tile [[mural]]s
* Engraving on a tile

== Modern tile art ==

=== Design ===
Many modern tile art designs are based on abstract and pattern-based designs. These are non-representational, unlike than older tile art formats, such as mosaics, which were often portraits or other representational forms of artwork.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.mozaico.com/mosaic-vs-tile-art-everything-you-need-to-know/|title=Mosaic vs. Tile Art: Everything You Need to Know|website=Mozaico Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design on a piece of tile art may be used as decoration, but may also represent an idea, philosophy or pose a historical, religious or social significance.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casey|first1=M.F|date=June 2008|title=The Fourteenth-Century Tring Tiles: A Fresh Look at Their Origin and the Hebraic Aspects of the Child Jesus' Actions|url=https://digital.kenyon.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1176&amp;context=perejournal|journal=Peregrinations|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such non-representational art is a set of tiles integrated into an interior or exterior design. The design of the tile art is often based on the theme of the surrounding design. As tiles are built into the surrounding, they can be installed seamlessly integrated into the surrounding area.

=== Usage ===
Modern tile art serves many purposes. The general definition of tile art includes many mediums and many different designs achieved by various techniques and media. For example, tile art may be used to decorate one's home, but must also be practical as a wall or flooring element, as the tiles in an interior design could be replaced by tile art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voegenstift.nl/|title=Voegen schoonmaken? Koop Voegenstift|last=David hanks|first=|date=|website=Voegenstift.nl|language=nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tile art can also be used in the garden to compliment the colors in the plants and foliage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthsongtiles.com/plant_and_flower_tiles.html|title=plant and flower tiles|website=earthsongtiles.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using modern printing technology, images can be digitally printed onto a set of tiles or a tile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crunchybetty.com/diy-picture-tiles-you-will-never-buy-a-photo-frame-again|title=DIY Picture Tiles - You Will Never Buy a Photo Frame Again  {{!}}|website=www.crunchybetty.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be used in lieu of hanging paintings or using wallpaper.

== Creation technique ==
The many different types of tile artwork mean that there are many different methods of creating a piece of tile artwork. 
* Engraving
* Carving
* [[Painting]]
* Molding
* [[Printing]]
* Trimming
* Tile staining

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3440">The '''''vagina loquens''''', or "talking vagina", is a significant tradition in literature and art, dating back to the ancient [[folklore]] [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] of the "talking cunt".&lt;ref name=ozark&gt;{{cite book|title=Unprintable Ozark Folksongs and Folklore: Blow the candle out|publisher=[[University of Arkansas Press]]|author=Vance Randolph, Gershon Legman |year=1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S93LdPw2KP0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=1557282374|pages=819–820}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zizek&gt;{{cite book|title=Organs without bodies: Deleuze and consequences|publisher=[[Routledge]]|author=Slavoj Zizek |year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pp6-1yQbgmgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0415969212|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tales usually involve [[vaginas]] talking due to the effect of magic or charms, and often admitting to their unchastity.&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt; Another tradition is a vagina that acquires the power of speech to play the role of [[informant]] and reveal a history of  previous lovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=vagina loquens|url=http://www.definition-of.com/vagina%20loquens|publisher=Definition Of|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking vaginas are an early theme in [[French literature]], most notably in  the 13th century [[fabliau]] ''Le Chevalier qui faisoit parler les cons et les culs''&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt; and in ''[[Les bijoux indiscrets]]'', the first novel by [[Denis Diderot]]. Published anonymously in 1748, ''Les bijoux indiscrets'' (''The Indiscreet Jewels'') is an allegory that portrays [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] as the sultan Mangogul of the Congo who owns a magic ring that makes women's genitals ("jewels") talk. A comparable ''trope'' that Diderot must have known is found in the ribald ''[[fabliau]]''.&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt;

In American literature, a talking vagina is featured in the [[Ozark]] folktale ''The Magic Walking Stick'',&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt; in which vaginas are made to act as informants. The talking vagina theme is the central trope of ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.&lt;ref name=Zizek/&gt;

In [[modern art]] the talking vagina theme is featured prominently in the works of [[Stephanie Sarley]] in a subset of her "Crotch Monster" series. The talking vagina characters are depicted as [[anthropomorphized]] [[vulvae]] reacting emotionally and engaging in various activities.&lt;ref name="huffPostSSarley"&gt;{{Cite web

In film, the [[pornographic movies]] ''[[Le Sexe qui parle]]'' (1975) and its sequel (1978), and its non-pornographic remake, ''[[Chatterbox (1977 film)|Chatterbox]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shumate|first=Nathan|title=Chatterbox (1977)|url=http://www.coldfusionvideo.com/archives/chatterbox-1977/|publisher=Cold Fusion Reviews|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  feature talking vaginas.

On television, [[Joan Rivers]] portrayed [[List_of_Drawn_Together_characters#Princess_Clara|Princess Clara]]'s talking vagina on ''[[Drawn Together]]''.

This is a sub-project of the [[Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project]] where the artists are growing a [[leather]] jacket without killing any animals. Growing the victimless leather problematizes the concept of [[garment]] by making it semi-living. This artistic grown garment is intended to confront people with the moral implications of wearing parts of dead animals for protective and aesthetic reasons and confronts notions of relationships with manipulated living systems.

__TOC__

==Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project==

The [[SymbioticA]] website explains what it is, "an artistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning, critique and hands-on engagement with the life sciences.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symbiotica.uwa.edu.au/ Official SymbioticA website] Retrieved 03.20.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The artists work with tissue, constructing and growing complex organisms that can live outside the body, making the new objects semi-living. Their projects are meant to question life, identity and the relationship between humans and other living beings and environments. They are also interested in the ethics around partial life and the possibilities around this type of technology in the future.&lt;ref name="tca"&gt;[http://tcaproject.org/ TC&amp;A website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===

These are some of the sub-projects that are also part of the TC&amp;A project, in addition to Victimless Leather:

'''NoArk''' – NoArk is a collection of cells and tissue from many different organisms, growing together inside a "vessel", a reference to [[Noah's Ark]]. The project website states that NoArk is "a tangible as well as symbolic ‘craft’ for observing and understanding a biology that combines the familiar with the other".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/noark.html TC&amp;A – NoArk] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Worry Dolls''' – Seven modern versions of the Guatemalan [[Worry doll]] were hand-crafted of degradable [[polymers]] and surgical sutures and seeded with skin, muscle and bone tissue. The tissue was then allowed to grow inside a bioreactor, replacing the polymers as it degrades, thus creating seven semi-living dolls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/ars/main_frames.html TC&amp;A – Worry Dolls] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''Disembodied Cuisine''' – Along with Victimless Leather, this is part of the "Victimless Utopia". The idea for this project was to take cells from a frog and grow them into something possible to eat, displaying it next to the still living frog the food came from. This problemetizes the whole meat industry – how we kill animals to eat them. Growing tissue outside of the body of the animal is a way to "make" meat while the animal stays healthy and living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/disembodied/dis.html TC&amp;A – Disembodied Cuisine] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Extra Ear – ¼ Scale''' – Using human tissue, a quarter-scale replica of artist [[Stelarc]]'s ear was grown. The project wanted to confront the cultural perceptions of life now that we are able to manipulate living systems, and also discuss the notions of the wholeness of the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/extra/extra_ear.html TC&amp;A – Extra Ear – ¼ Scale] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''The Pig Wings Project''' – This project bases its ideas on [[xenotransplantation]] and genetically modifying pigs so their organs can be transplanted to humans. The artists used tissue engineering and stem cell technologies to grow pig bone tissue, forming three different sets of wings. One set shaped as bat wings ("evil"), one as bird wings ("good") and one as pterosaurs wings ("neutral").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/pig/pig_main.html TC&amp;A – The Pig Wings Project] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Idea==
An aim for the "Victimless Leather" project is to explore and provoke scientific truths, using conceptual art projects to encourage better understanding of cultural ideas around scientific knowledge. The project website point out how clothing has always been used to protect the fragile skin of humans, but lately have evolved into a fabricated object used as a tool to show one's identity. Based on this, clothing can be explored as a tangible example of the relationship between humans and others, and how humans treat others. As the artists put it: "This particular project will deconstruct our cultural meaning of clothes as a second skin by materialising it and displaying it as an art object."&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

The intention to grow artificial leather without killing an animal is meant as a contribution to a cultural discussion between art, science and society. Making this jacket presents a possibility of wearing leather that is not part of a dead animal. The projects are presented in Workshops and exhibitions throughout the world to address ethical questions related to [[bioscience]] and [[technology]]. The artists want the project to be seen in this cultural context, not a commercial one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Genetologic Research] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Their intention is not to create a consumer product, but to offer a starting point for the cultural discussion points mentioned above. As with most of the TC&amp;A projects the artists are concerned with the relationship between humans and other living systems, both natural and scientific made or manipulated.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

== The Victimless Leather project ==

[[File:Victimless leather.jpg|thumb|left|x450px|Victimless leather, photo from TC&amp;A webpage [http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/vl/images.html]]]

===Growing the jacket===
The artists wanted to make a leather-like material using living tissue, and ended up making it in the shape of a stitchless jacket. The artists based the jacket on a biodegradable polymer, coated it with [[3T3 cells|3T3]] mouse cells to form connective tissue and topped it up with human [[bone cells]] in order to create a stronger skin layer.

To create the victimless leather, the team needed an artificial environment where semi-living entities are grown, so it is grown inside a bioreactor that acts as a surrogate body. The bioreactor used in this project was custom made, based on an organ perfusion pump designed by [[Alexis Carrel]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]]. It has an automatic dripping system which feeds the cells.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt; The artists assumed that when the polymer degraded, an integrated jacket would appear. The resulting jacket was tiny, about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high and 1,4&amp;nbsp;inches wide and would just fit a mouse.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 Wired – Jacket Grows From Living Tissue] Retrieved 10.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

To idealize the "victimless" of the jacket, immortalized cell lines or cells that divide and multiply forever once they are removed from an animal or human host forming a renewable resource, have been used in the project. The 3T3 mouse cells all come from a mouse who lived in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 The technoscientific body] Retrieved 03.31.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
The research and development of “Victimless Leather” has been conducted in SymbioticA: the Art and Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of Western Australia and in consultation with Professor Arunasalam Dharmarajan from the School of Anatomy and Human Biology as well as Verigen, a Perth-based company that specializes in tissue engineered cartilage for clinical applications. Western Australia state made the investment in the project through ArtsWa in Association with the Lotteries Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Victimless Leather Jacket] Retrieved 05.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Killing the Jacket====
The victimless leather was featured in the exhibition “Design and the Elastic Mind” at [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], United States. [http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2008/elasticmind/index.html] [http://www.moma.org/] February 24 – May 12, 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/news.html TC&amp;A News] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The project was scheduled to grow continuously until May 12 when the exhibition ended. There were some problems though, when the leather started expanding too quickly, clogging tubes inside the bioreactor. The exhibition leader therefore decided to unplug the project before the end of the exhibition – in a way, killing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/54636/ TheScientist – Victimless Jacket, R.I.P.] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===

Because the artificial leather is made semi-living, the project might be seen as speculative and provocative to some people – questioning whether it is better to kill semi-living beings rather than living beings. "One of the most common and somewhat surprising comments we heard was that people were disturbed by our ethics of using living cells to grow living fabric, while the use of leather obtained from animals seems to be accepted without any concern for the well-being of the animals from which the skin has been removed." artist Ionat Zurr uttered after showing the jacket to the public on "The Space Between" exhibition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacebetween.org.au/ The Space Between] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

The project also focuses on human consumption, highlighting that there are victims on every level of it, and that the boundaries between harm and benefit often are blurred. The French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] strongly opposed hunting of animals for vanity and the commercial purpose of the skin. From an indigenous point of view, the context must be{{according to whom|date=June 2012}} seen different. An [[Inuit]] hunts the [[Pinniped|seal]] and uses the whole body of the animal as a basic resource for his survival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bambusspiele.de/spiele/nanuuk/e_nunavut.htm – Arctic hunters], Retrieved 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to ethics like this, is the interest for artificial meat production due to reactions against the livestock sector because of health and environmental problems. A 2006 UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO report pointed out the livestock sector as one of the most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems like soil degradation and water pollution. And because of methane, it spews out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200908170494.html – All Africa] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Though '''women artists''' have been involved in the making of art throughout history, their work, when compared to that of their male counterparts, is often both overlooked and undervalued. Prevailing stereotypes about the sexes have caused certain media, such as [[Textile arts|textile]] or [[fiber art]]s, to be primarily associated with women, despite having once been categories both men and women participated in. Additionally, art forms that have gained this distinction are, as in the case of both textile and fabric arts, demoted to categories like "[[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]]", rather than [[fine art]].&lt;ref name="moca"&gt;Aktins, Robert. [http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=14 "Feminist art."] ''Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.'' 1997 (retrieved 23 Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in art have been faced with challenges due to gender biases in the mainstream fine art world.&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; They have often encountered difficulties in training, travelling and trading their work, as well as gaining recognition. Beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s, [[feminist]] artists and art historians created a [[Feminist art movement]] that overtly addresses the role of women in the art world and explores the role of women in [[art history]]&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; and in society.

==Prehistoric era==
There are no records of who the artists of the prehistoric eras were, but studies of many early ethnographers and cultural anthropologists indicate that women often were the principal artisans in [[Neolithic]] cultures, in which they created pottery, textiles, baskets, painted surfaces and jewelry. Collaboration on large projects was typical. Extrapolation to the artwork and skills of the [[Paleolithic]] era suggests that these cultures followed similar patterns. [[Cave painting]]s of this era often have human hand prints, 75% of which are identifiable as women's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131008-women-handprints-oldest-neolithic-cave-art/ "Were the First Artists Mostly Women?"]  "National Geographic", October 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient historical era==
{{Women in society sidebar}}

===India===
"For about three thousand years, the women – and only the women – of [[History of Mithila|Mithila]] have been making devotional paintings of the gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon. It is no exaggeration, then, to say that this art is the expression of the most genuine aspect of Indian civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Vequaud, Ives, ''Women Painters of Mithila'', Thames and Hudson, Ltd., London, 1977 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Europe and the Middle East===
The earliest records of western cultures rarely mention specific individuals, although women are depicted in all of the art and some are shown laboring as artists. Ancient references by [[Homer]], [[Cicero]], and [[Virgil]] mention the prominent roles of women in textiles, poetry, music, and other cultural activities, without discussion of individual artists. Among the earliest European historical records concerning individual artists is that of [[Pliny the Elder]], who wrote about a number of Greek women who were painters, including [[Helena of Egypt]], daughter of Timon of Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/elliott/art/67.html Women in Art] retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html The Ancient Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026153755/http://ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html |date=2010-10-26 }} Retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern critics posit that ''[[Alexander Mosaic]]'' might not have been the work of [[Philoxenus of Cythera|Philoxenus]], but of Helena of Egypt. One of the few named women painters who might have worked in Ancient Greece,&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad; Oppenheimer; Addiss, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; she was reputed to have produced a painting of the battle of Issus which hung in the [[Temple of Peace, Rome|Temple of Peace]] during the time of [[Vespasian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemy Chennus|Ptolemy Hephaestion]] ''New History'' (codex 190) [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|''Bibliotheca'' Photius]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other women include [[Timarete]], [[Eirene (artist)|Eirene]], Kalypso, Aristarete, [[Iaia]], and Olympias. While only some of their work survives, in [[Red-figure pottery|Ancient Greek pottery]] there is a ''caputi hydria'' in the Torno Collection in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/628077 The Caputi Hydria] Retrieved June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is attribute to [[List of Greek vase painters|the Leningrad painter]] from {{circa|460–450}} [[common era|BCE]] and shows women working alongside men in a workshop where both painted vases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1jWo_YaOW4UC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=caputi+hydria+in+The+Torno+Collection+in+Milan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jtkVLNQ0hw&amp;sig=1UhqdRBJtJuM2LmKGQgOQX321vA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=j9EYTOSzB8GB8gaTnt24DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=caputi%20hydria%20in%20The%20Torno%20Collection%20in%20Milan&amp;f=false Fig. 37] Retrieved June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists from the [[Medieval]] period include [[Claricia]], [[Diemudus]], [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], [[Guda]], [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. In the early Medieval period, women often worked alongside men. Manuscript illuminations, embroideries, and carved capitals from the period clearly demonstrate examples of women at work in these arts. Documents show that they also were brewers, butchers, wool merchants, and iron mongers. Artists of the time period, including women, were from a small subset of society whose status allowed them freedom from these more strenuous types of work. Women artists often were of two literate classes, either wealthy aristocratic women or nuns. Women in the former category often created embroideries and textiles; those in the later category often produced illuminations.

There were a number of embroidery workshops in England at the time, particularly at Canterbury and Winchester; ''[[Opus Anglicanum]]'' or English embroidery was already famous across Europe – a 13th-century papal inventory counted over two hundred pieces. It is presumed that women were almost entirely responsible for this production. One of the most famous embroideries of the Medieval period is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which was embroidered with [[wool]] and is 230 feet long. Its images narrate the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. The Bayeux Tapestry may have been created in either a commercial workshop by a royal or an aristocratic lady and her retinue, or in a workshop in a nunnery. In the 14th century, a royal workshop is documented, based at the [[Tower of London]], and there may have been other earlier arrangements. Manuscript illumination affords us many of the named artists of the Medieval Period including [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], a 10th-century Spanish nun; [[Guda]], a 12th-century German nun; and [[Claricia]], a 12th-century laywoman in a Bavarian scriptorium. These women, and many more unnamed illuminators, benefited from the nature of convents as the major loci of learning for women in the period and the most tenable option for intellectuals among them.

In many parts of Europe, with the [[Gregorian Reforms]] of the 11th century and the rise in feudalism, women faced many strictures that they did not face in the Early Medieval period. With these societal changes, the status of the convent changed. In the British Isles, the Norman Conquest marked the beginning of the gradual decline of the convent as a seat of learning and a place where women could gain power. Convents were made subsidiary to male abbots, rather than being headed by an abbess, as they had been previously. In Pagan [[Scandinavia]] (in Sweden) the only historically confirmed female [[runemaster]], [[Gunnborga]], worked in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Upplands runinskrifter 1, s. 307 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, however, under the [[Ottonian Dynasty]], convents retained their position as institutions of learning. This might be partially because convents were often headed and populated by unmarried women from royal and aristocratic families. Therefore, the greatest late Medieval period work by women originates in Germany, as exemplified by that of [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098–1179) is a particularly fine example of a German Medieval intellectual and artist. She wrote ''The Divine Works of a Simple Man'', ''The Meritorious Life'', sixty-five hymns, a miracle play, and a long treatise of nine books on the different natures of trees, plants, animals, birds, fish, minerals, and metals. From an early age, she claimed to have visions. When the Papacy supported these claims by the headmistress, her position as an important intellectual was galvanized. The visions became part of one of her seminal works in 1142, ''[[Scivias]]'' ''(Know the Ways of the Lord)'', which consists of thirty-five visions relating and illustrating the history of salvation. The illustrations in the ''[[Scivias]]'', as exemplified in the first illustration, depict Hildegarde experiencing visions while seated in the monastery at [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]. They differ greatly from others created in Germany during the same period, as they are characterized by bright colors, emphasis on line, and simplified forms. While Hildegard likely did not pen the images, their idiosyncratic nature leads one to believe they were created under her close supervision.

The 12th century saw the rise of the city in Europe, along with the rise in trade, travel, and universities. These changes in society also engendered changes in the lives of women. Women were allowed to head their husbands' businesses if they were widowed. The [[Wife of Bath]] in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is one such case. During this time, women also were allowed to be part of some artisan [[guild]]s. Guild records show that women were particularly active in the textile industries in Flanders and Northern France. Medieval manuscripts have many marginalia depicting women with spindles. In England, women were responsible for creating ''Opus Anglicanum'', or rich embroideries for ecclesiastical or secular use on clothes and various types of hangings. Women also became more active in illumination. A number of women likely worked alongside their husbands or fathers, including the daughter of [[Maître Honoré]] and the daughter of [[Jean le Noir (illuminator)|Jean le Noir]]. By the 13th century most [[illuminated manuscript]]s were being produced by commercial workshops, and by the end of the Middle Ages, when production of manuscripts had become an important industry in certain centres, women seem to have represented a majority of the artists and scribes employed, especially in Paris. The movement to [[printing]], and of book illustration to the [[printmaking]] techniques of [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]], where women seem to have been little involved, represented a setback to the progress of women artists.

This is the first period in Western history in which a number of secular female artists gained international reputations. The rise in women artists during this period may be attributed to major cultural shifts. One such shift was a move toward [[humanism]], a philosophy affirming the dignity of all people, that became central to Renaissance thinking and helped raise the status of women. In addition, the identity of the individual artist in general was regarded as more important; significant artists from this period whose identities are unknown virtually cease to exist. Two important texts, ''On Famous Women'' and ''The City of Women'', illustrate this cultural change. [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], a 14th-century humanist, wrote ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' (Latin for ''[[On Famous Women]]'') (1335–59), a collection of biographies of women. Among the 104 biographies he included was that of [[Thamar]] (or Thmyris), an ancient Greek vase painter. Curiously, among the 15th-century manuscript illuminations of ''On Famous Women'', Thamar was depicted painting a self-portrait or perhaps painting a small image of the Virgin and Child. [[Christine de Pizan]], a remarkable late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote ''[[Book of the City of Ladies]]'' in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as [[Anastasia (artist)|Anastasia]], who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.

The most notable of these was ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' or ''[[The Courtier]]'' by 16th-century Italian humanist [[Baldassare Castiglione]]. This enormously popular work stated that men and women should be educated in the social arts. His influence made it acceptable for women to engage in the visual, musical, and literary arts. Thanks to Castiglione, this was the first period of renaissance history in which noblewomen were able to study painting. [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] was the most successful of these minor aristocrats who first benefited from humanist education and then went on to recognition as painters.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt; Artists who were not noblewomen were affected by the rise in humanism as well. In addition to conventional subject matter, artists such as [[Lavinia Fontana]] and [[Caterina van Hemessen]] began to depict themselves in self-portraits, not just as painters but also as musicians and scholars, thereby highlighting their well-rounded education. Along with the rise in humanism, there was a shift from craftsmen to artists. Artists, unlike earlier craftsmen, were now expected to have knowledge of perspective, mathematics, ancient art, and study of the human body. In the late Renaissance the training of artists began to move from the master's workshop to the [[Academic art|Academy]], and women began a long struggle, not resolved until the late 19th century, to gain full access to this training. Study of the human body required working from male nudes and corpses. This was considered essential background for creating realistic group scenes. Women were generally barred from training from male nudes, and therefore they were precluded from creating such scenes. Such depictions of nudes were required for the large-scale religious compositions, which received the most prestigious commissions.

Although many aristocratic women had access to some training in art, though without the benefit of figure drawing from nude male models, most of those women chose marriage over a career in art. This was true, for example, of two of Sofonisba Anguissola's sisters. The women recognized as artists in this period were either nuns or children of painters. Of the few who emerged as Italian artists in the 15th century, those known today are associated with convents. These artists who were nuns include [[Caterina dei Virgi]], [[Antonia Uccello]], and [[Suor Barbara Ragnoni]]. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the vast majority of women who gained any modicum of success as artists were the children of painters. This is likely because they were able to gain training in their fathers' workshops. Examples of women artists who were trained by their fathers include the painter [[Lavinia Fontana]], the miniature portraitist [[Levina Teerlinc]], and the portrait painter [[Caterina van Hemessen]]. Italian women artists during this period, even those trained by their family, seem somewhat unusual. However, in certain parts of Europe, particularly northern France and Flanders, it was more common for children of both genders to enter into their father's profession. In fact, in the Low Countries where women had more freedom, there were a number of artists in the Renaissance who were women. For example, the records of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in [[Bruges]] show not only that they admit women as practicing members, but also that by the 1480s twenty-five percent of its members were women (many probably working as manuscript illuminators).

Artists from the [[Baroque]] era include: [[Mary Beale]], [[Élisabeth Sophie Chéron]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Katharina Pepijn]], [[Catharina Peeters]], [[Johanna Vergouwen]], [[Isabel de Cisneros]], [[Giovanna Garzoni]]&lt;ref name="3 women artists in Italy"&gt;[http://www.lifeinitaly.com/art/women-artist-3.asp 3 women artists in Italy] Retrieved June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], [[Louise Moillon]], [[Josefa de Óbidos|Josefa de Ayala]] better known as Josefa de Óbidos, [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], [[Van de Passe family|Magdalena de Passe]], [[Clara Peeters]], Maria Virginia Borghese (daughter of art collector [[Olimpia Aldobrandini]]),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Sheila, [http://www.medici.org/highlights/canvas-commoners Canvas is for Commoners], Highlights from the Mediceo del Principato, medici.org, 2008-3-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luisa Roldán]] known as La Roldana, [[Rachel Ruysch]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Anna Maria van Thielen]], [[Francisca-Catherina van Thielen]] and [[Elisabetta Sirani]]. As in the Renaissance Period, many women among the Baroque artists came from artist families. [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] is an excellent example of this. She was trained by her father, [[Orazio Gentileschi]], and she worked alongside him on many of his commissions. [[Luisa Roldán]] was trained in her father's ([[Pedro Roldán]]) sculpture workshop.

Women artists in this period began to change the way women were depicted in art. Many of the women working as artists in the Baroque era were not able to train from nude models, who were always male, but they were very familiar with the female body. Women such as [[Elisabetta Sirani]] created images of women as conscious beings rather than detached muses.  One of the best examples of this novel expression is in Artemesia Gentileschi's ''Judith beheading Holofernes'', in which Judith is depicted as a strong woman determining her own destiny. While other artists, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and the more traditional woman, [[Fede Galizia]], depicted the same scene with a passive Judith, in her novel treatment, Gentileschi's Judith appears to be an able actor in the task at hand. Action is the essence of it and another painting by her of Judith leaving the scene. [[Still life]] emerged as an important genre around 1600, particularly in the Netherlands. Women were at the forefront of this painting trend. This genre was particularly suited to women, as they could access the materials for still life readily. In the North, these practitioners included [[Clara Peeters]], a painter of ''banketje'' or breakfast pieces, and scenes of arranged luxury goods; [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], the internationally renowned flower painter; and [[Rachel Ruysch]], a painter of visually charged flower arrangements. In other regions, still life was less common, but there were important women artists in the genre including [[Giovanna Garzoni]], who created realistic vegetable arrangements on parchment, and [[Louise Moillon]], whose fruit still life paintings were noted for their brilliant colors.

In many countries of Europe, the Academies were the arbiters of style.  The Academies also were responsible for training artists, exhibiting artwork, and, inadvertently or not, promoting the sale of art. Most Academies were not open to women. In France, for example, the powerful Academy in Paris had 450 members between the 17th century and the French Revolution, and only fifteen were women. Of those, most were daughters or wives of members. In the late 18th century, the French Academy resolved not to admit any women at all. The pinnacle of painting during the period was [[history painting]], especially large scale compositions with groups of figures depicting historical or mythical situations. In preparation to create such paintings, artists studied casts of antique sculptures and drew from male nudes. Women had limited, or no access to this Academic learning, and as such there are no extant large-scale history paintings by women from this period. Some women made their name in other genres such as portraiture. [[Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun]] used her experience in portraiture to create an allegorical scene, ''Peace Bringing Back Plenty'', which she classified as a history painting and used as her grounds for admittance into the Academy. After the display of her work, it was demanded that she attend formal classes, or lose her license to paint.  She became a court favourite, and a celebrity, who painted over forty self-portraits, which she was able to sell.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;Heller, Nancy G., ''Women Artists: An Illustrated History'', Abbeville Press, Publishers, New York 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-89659-748-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, two women, [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Mary Moser]], were founding members of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London in 1768.  Kauffmann helped [[Maria Cosway]] enter the Academy. Although Cosway went on to gain success as a painter of mythological scenes, both women remained in a somewhat ambivalent position at the Royal Academy, as evidenced by the group portrait of ''The Academicians of the Royal Academy'' by Johan Zoffany now in The [[Royal Collection]]. In it, only the men of the Academy are assembled in a large artist studio, together with nude male models. For reasons of decorum given the nude models, the two women are not shown as present, but as portraits on the wall instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?object=400747| title = The Royal Academicians| last = Zoffany| first = Johan| authorlink = Johann Zoffany| year = 1771–1772| work = | publisher = [[Royal Collection|The Royal Collection]]|accessdate = March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis in [[Academic art]] on studies of the nude during training remained a considerable barrier for women studying art until the 20th century, both in terms of actual access to the classes and in terms of family and social attitudes to middle-class women becoming artists.  After these three, no woman became a full member of the Academy until [[Laura Knight]] in 1936, and women were not admitted to the Academy's schools until 1861. By the late 18th century, there were important steps forward for artists who were women. In Paris, the Salon, the exhibition of work founded by the Academy, became open to non-Academic painters in 1791, allowing women to showcase their work in the prestigious annual exhibition. Additionally, women were more frequently being accepted as students by famous artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]].

==19th century==

=== Painters === 

Women artists of the early part of the 19th century include [[Marie-Denise Villers]], who specialized in portraiture; [[Constance Mayer]], who painted portraits and allegories; [[Marie Ellenrieder]], who was noted mainly for her religious paintings in the [[Nazarenes (artists)|Nazarene]] style.

In the second half of the century, [[Emma Sandys]], [[Marie Spartali Stillman]], [[Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale]], and [[Maria Zambaco]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~androom/biography/p012261.htm Maria Zambaco] Retrieved June 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; were women artists of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement. Also influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites were [[Evelyn De Morgan]] and the activist and painter [[Barbara Bodichon]].

Impressionist painters [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Marie Bracquemond]], and the [[United States|Americans]], [[Mary Cassatt]] and [[Lucy Bacon]], became involved in the French [[Impressionist]] movement of the 1860s and 1870s. American Impressionist [[Lilla Cabot Perry]] was influenced by her studies with [[Monet]] and by [[Japanese art]] in the late 19th century. [[Cecilia Beaux]] was an American portrait painter who also studied in France. [[Olga Boznańska]] is considered the best-known of all Polish women artists, and was stylistically associated with Impressionism.  

[[Rosa Bonheur]] was the best-known female artist of her time, internationally renowned for her paintings of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Elizabeth Weed (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTb9d7vZhA0C&amp;pg=PA50 The Question of Gender: Joan W. Scott's Critical Feminism]''. Indiana University Press. p. 50. {{ISBN|0253223245}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Thompson]] (Lady Butler), perhaps inspired by her life-classes of armoured figures at the [[Royal College of Art|Government School]], was one of the first women to become famous for large history paintings, specializing in scenes of military action, usually with many horses, most famously ''[[Scotland Forever!]]'', showing a cavalry charge at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].

[[Kitty Lange Kielland]] was a Norwegian landscape painter.

[[Elizabeth Jane Gardner]] was an American academic painter who was the first American woman to exhibit at the [[Paris Salon]]. In 1872 she became the first woman to ever win a gold medal at the Salon. 

In 1894, [[Suzanne Valadon]] was the first woman admitted to the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in France. [[Anna Boch]] was a [[post-impressionist]] painter, as was [[Laura Muntz Lyall]], who exhibited at the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and then in 1894 as part of the [[Société des artistes français]] in Paris. 

===Photography===

[[Julia Margaret Cameron]] and [[Gertrude Kasebier]] became well known in the new medium of [[photography]], where there were no traditional restrictions, and no established training, to hold them back.

[[Camille Claudel]], [[Edmonia Lewis]] and [[Enid Yandell]].

In the late 19th century, [[Edmonia Lewis]], an [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]-[[Ojibwe]]-[[Haitian Americans|Haitian American]] artist from New York began her art studies at [[Oberlin College]]. Her sculpting career began in 1863. She established a studio in [[Rome, Italy]] and exhibited her marble sculptures through Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonialewis.com/chronology.htm "Biography – Chronology of Mary Edmonia Lewis."] ''Edmonia Lewis.''

===Female education in the 19th century===

During the century, access to academies and formal art training expanded more for women in Europe and North America. The British Government School of Design, which later became the [[Royal College of Art]], admitted women from its founding in 1837, but only into a "Female School" which was treated somewhat differently, with "life"- classes consisting for several years of drawing a man wearing a suit of armour. 

The Royal Academy Schools finally admitted women beginning in 1861, but students drew initially only draped models. However, other schools in London, including the [[Slade School of Art]] from the 1870s, were more liberal.  By the end of the century women were able to study the naked, or very nearly naked, figure in many Western European and North American cities. The Society of Female Artists (now called ''The [[Society of Women Artists]]'') was established in 1855 in London and has staged annual exhibitions since 1857, when 358 works were shown by 149 women, some using a pseudonym.&lt;ref name=society&gt;[http://www.society-women-artists.org.uk/History.html "History"], ''The Society of Women Artists''.

[[Hilma af Klint]] (1862–1944) was a pioneer abstract painter, working long before her abstract expressionist male counterparts. She was Swedish and regularly exhibited her paintings dealing with realism, but the abstract works were not shown until 20 years after her death, at her request. She considered herself to be a spiritualist and mystic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuchman|first1=Maurice|title=The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting, 1890–1985|publisher=Abbeville Pr|isbn=0896596699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]] (1865–1933) was a Scottish artist whose works helped define the "Glasgow Style" of the 1890s and early 20th century. She often collaborated with her husband, the architect and designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], in works that had influence in Europe. She exhibited with Mackintosh at the 1900 [[Vienna Secession]], where her work is thought to have had an influence on the Secessionists such as [[Gustav Klimt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/features/item/margaret-macdonald|title=Margaret Macdonald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] (1878–1962) was an early American modernist in New York City. She made significant contributions to modern American art through her work at the Art Students League and the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Studio Club]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm'' by Clint B.

Among the other women artists prominent in the [[Russian avant-garde]] were [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Varvara Stepanova]] and [[Nadezhda Udaltsova]]. [[Sonia Delaunay]] and her husband were the founders of [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

In the [[Art Deco]] era, [[Hildreth Meiere]] made large-scale mosaics and was the first woman honored with the Fine Arts Medal of the American Institute of Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Architects Directory|year=1962|publisher=R.R.

[[Sr. Maria Stanisia]] became a notable portraitist, mainly of clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmargaretofscotland.com/stations.htm|title=stmargaretofscotland.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] was born in the late 19th century. She became known for her paintings, featuring flowers, bones, and landscapes of [[New Mexico]]. In 1927, [[Dod Procter]]'s painting ''Morning'' was voted Picture of the Year in the [[Royal Academy]] Summer Exhibition, and bought by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for the [[Tate]] gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography|year=2003|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0618252107|page=1241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity resulted in its showing in New York and a two-year tour of Britain.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=12241&amp;searchid=10053 "Dod Procter"], [[Tate]]. Retrieved on 16 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Surrealism]], an important artistic style in the 1920s and 1930s, had a number of prominent women artists, including [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Remedios Varo]].&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;
=== Women photographers ===
[[Lee Miller]] rediscovered [[solarization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haworth-Booth|first=Mark|title=The Art of Lee Miller|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=978-0-300-12375-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rmpSPbBWLngC&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=%22lee%20miller%22%20solarization&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a high fashion photographer. [[Dorothea Lange]] documented the Depression. [[Margaret Bourke-White]] created the industrial photographs that were featured on the cover and in the lead article of the first ''Life Magazine''. [[Diane Arbus]] based her photography on outsiders to mainstream society. [[Graciela Iturbide]]'s works dealt with Mexican life and feminism, while [[Tina Modotti]] produced "revolutionary icons" from [[Mexico]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sarah M., ''Tina Modootti: Photographs'', Harry N. Abrams Inc., Publishers, 1995 p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annie Leibovitz]]'s photographic work was of [[rock and roll]] and other celebrity figures. 

Mary Carroll Nelson founded the [[Society of Layerists in MultiMedia|Society of Layerists in Multi-Media]] (SLMM), whose artist members follow in the tradition of [[Emil Bisttram]] and the Transcendental Painting Group, as well as [[Morris Graves]] of the Pacific Northwest Visionary Art School. In the 1970s, [[Judy Chicago]] created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', a very important work of [[feminist art]]. [[Helen Frankenthaler]] was an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] painter and she was influenced by [[Jackson Pollock]]. [[Lee Krasner]] was also an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] artist and married to Pollock and a student of [[Hans Hofmann]]. [[Elaine de Kooning]] was a student and later the wife of [[Willem de Kooning]], she was an [[New York Figurative Expressionism|abstract figurative painter]]. [[Anne Ryan]] was a collagist. [[Jane Frank]], also a student of [[Hans Hofmann]], worked with [[mixed media]] on canvas. In Canada, [[Marcelle Ferron]] was an exponent of [[Les Automatistes|automatism]].

From the 1960s on, [[feminism]] led to a great increase in interest in women artists and their academic study. Notable contributions have been made by the [[art historian]]s [[Germaine Greer]], [[Linda Nochlin]], [[Griselda Pollock]] and others. Some [[art historian]]s such as [[Daphne Haldin]] have attempted to redress the balance of male-focused histories by compiling lists of women artists, though many of these efforts remain unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Drummond Charig | first= Frankie | date= 4 April 2016 | title= Daphne Haldin’s Archive and the 'Dictionary of Women Artists' | url=  http://www.britishartstudies.ac.uk/issues/issue-index/issue-2/still-invisible#018 | journal= British Art Studies | publisher= [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] and [[Yale Center for British Art]] | issue= 2 | doi=10.17658/issn.2058-5462/issue-02/still-invisible/018 | access-date=  28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures like Artemesia Gentileschi and Frida Kahlo emerged from relative obscurity to become feminist [[cultural icon|icons]]. The [[Guerilla Girls]], an anonymous group of females formed in 1985, were "the conscience of the art world." They spoke out about indifference and inequalities for gender and race, particularly in the art world. The Guerilla Girls have made many posters as a way of bringing attention, typically in a humorous way, to the community to raise awareness and create change. In 1996, [[Catherine de Zegher]] curated an exhibition of 37 great women artists from the twentieth century. The exhibition, ''Inside the Visible'', that travelled from the ICA in Boston to the National Museum for Women in the Arts in Washington, the Whitechapel in London and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, included artists' works from the 1930s through the 1990s featuring [[Claude Cahun]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Charlotte Salomon]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Nancy Spero]], [[Francesca Woodman]], [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Mona Hatoum]] among others.

In 1993, [[Rachel Whiteread]] was the first woman to win the [[Tate]] Gallery's [[Turner Prize]]. [[Gillian Wearing]] won the prize in 1997, when there was an all-woman shortlist, the other nominees being [[Christine Borland]], [[Angela Bulloch]] and [[Cornelia Parker]]. In 1999, [[Tracey Emin]] gained considerable media coverage for her entry ''[[My Bed]]'', but did not win. In 2006 the prize was awarded to abstract painter, [[Tomma Abts]]. In 2001, a conference called "Women Artists at the Millennium" was organized at [[Princeton University]]. A book by that name was published in 2006, featuring major art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]] analysing prominent women artists such as [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Sally Mann]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Rachel Whiteread]] and [[Rosemarie Trockel]]. Internationally prominent [[contemporary artists]] who are women also include [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Jaroslava Brychtova]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Lee Bul]], [[Sophie Calle]], [[Janet Cardiff]], [[Li Chevalier]], [[Marlene Dumas]], [[Marisol Escobar]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Runa Islam]], [[Chantal Joffe]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Karen Kilimnik]], [[Sarah Lucas]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Shazia Sikander]], [[Lorna Simpson]], [[Lisa Steele]], [[Stella Vine]], [[Kara Walker]], [[Rebecca Warren]], [[Bettina Werner]] and [[Susan Dorothea White]]. &lt;!--DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST--&gt;

[[Japan]]ese artist [[Yayoi Kusama]]'s paintings, collages, soft sculptures, performance art and environmental installations all share an obsession with repetition, pattern, and accumulation. Her work shows some attributes of [[feminism]], [[minimalism]], [[surrealism]], [[Outsider Art|Art Brut]], [[pop art]], and [[abstract expressionism]], and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She describes herself as an "obsessive artist". In November 2008, Christie's auction house New York sold her 1959 painting ''No. 2'' for $5,100,000, the record price in 2008 for a work by a living female artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/15/artmarkets | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=New York art sales: 'I knew it was too good to last' | date=2008-11-15 | first=Anthony | last=Haden-Guest}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010–2011, [[Pompidou Centre]] in Paris presented its curators' choice of contemporary women artists in a three-volume's exhibition named ''elles@Centrepompidou''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212114941/http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-12-12|title=Communiqué présentation 3e rotation de l’exposition "elles" |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum showed works of major women artists from its own collection. 2010 saw [[Eileen Cooper]] elected as the first ever woman 'Keeper of the Royal Academy'. 1995 saw Dame [[Elizabeth Blackadder]] in the 300-year history made 'Her Majesty's painter and limber in Scotland, she was awarded the OBE in 1982.

An interesting genre of women's art is women's environmental art. As of December 2013, the [[Women Environmental Artists Directory]] listed 307 women environmental artists, such as [[Marina DeBris]], [[Vernita Nemec]] and [[Betty Beaumont]]. DeBris uses beach trash to raise awareness of beach and ocean pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=staff|title=Our Town, Central|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/-145278-ocprint--.html|publisher=Orange County Register|accessdate= December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to educate children about beach trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OC... and Sculpture by the Sea!|url=http://www.sutherland-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/news/oc-by-the-sea|publisher=Sutherland Public School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nemec recently used junk mail to demonstrate the complexity of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vernita Nemec Segments of Endless Junkmail|url=http://artdaily.com/news/19141/Vernita-Nemec-Segments-of-Endless-Junkmail|publisher=Artdaily.org, The First Art Newspaper on the Net|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaumont has been described as a pioneer of environmental art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguished Alumni Awards|url=http://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/alumni-friends/distinguished-alumni-award/alumni-2006/|publisher=UC Berkeley|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses art to challenge our beliefs and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Camouflaged Cells Betty Beaumont|journal=Newfound Journal|date=Winter 2011|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://www.newfoundjournal.org/archives/volume-2/issue-1/photography-beaumont/|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misrepresentation in art history==
[[Image:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Judith Leyster]], ''Self-portrait'', 1630, [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.]]
[[Image:Villers Young Woman Drawing.jpg|thumb|[[Marie-Denise Villers]], ''Young Woman Drawing'' 1801, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
Women artists have often been mis-characterized in historical accounts, both intentionally and unintentionally; such misrepresentations have often been dictated by the socio-political mores of the given era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/19wa/hd_19wa.htm|title=Women Artists in Nineteenth-Century France – Essay – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |first= Nicole|last=Myers|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of issues that lie behind this, including:
* Scarcity of biographical information
* Anonymity – Women artists were often most active in artistic expressions that were not typically signed. During the Early Medieval period, manuscript illumination was a pursuit of monks and nuns alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC Nuns as Artists: The Visual Culture of a Medieval Convent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035602/http://books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC |date=2014-10-19 }}, Jeffrey F. Hamburger, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Painters' Guild]]s – In the Medieval and Renaissance periods, many women worked in the workshop system. These women worked under the auspices of a male workshop head, very often the artist's father. Until the twelfth century there is no record of a workshop headed by a woman, when a widow would be allowed to assume her husband's former position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prak|first1=Maarten R.|title=Craft Guilds in Early Modern Low Countries: Work, Power and Representation|date=2006|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=0754653390|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[guild]] rules forbade women from attaining the various ranks leading to master,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting: Its Stylistic and Thematic Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035605/http://books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ |date=2014-10-19 }}, Wayne Franits, Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-10237-2}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC Dutch Painting 1600–1800] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035608/http://books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC |date=2014-10-19 }} Pelican history of art, {{ISSN|0553-4755}}, Yale University Press, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; so they remained "unofficial" in their status.
* Naming Conventions – the [[Family name|convention whereby women take their husbands' last names]] impedes research on female articles, especially in cases in which a work of unknown origin was signed only with a first initial and last name. Even the simplest biographical statements may be misleading. For example, one might say that [[Jane Frank]] was born in 1918, but in reality she was [[Jane Schenthal]] at birth – Jane "Frank" didn't exist until over twenty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Phoebe B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=izcwMwEACAAJ "The Sculptural Landscape of Jane Frank"]  [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/ow/3569fb46ba6eb6ea.html World Cat] ([[A.S. Barnes]]: [[South Brunswick, New Jersey]], and [[New York City|New York]], 1968) {{ISBN|1-125-32317-5}} [A second edition of this book was published in July 1969 (Yoseloff: [[London]], {{ISBN|0-498-06974-5}}; also {{ISBN|978-0-498-06974-1}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples like this create a discontinuity of identity for women artists.
* Mistaken identity and incorrect attribution – In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, work by women was often reassigned. Some unscrupulous dealers even went so far as to alter signatures, as in the case of some paintings by [[Judith Leyster]] (1630) that were reassigned to [[Frans Hals]].&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede de Groot, Cornelis. "Judith Leyster," ''Jahrbuch der Königlich Preussischen Kunstsammlungen'' vol. 14 (1893), pp. 190–198; 232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofrichter, Frima Fox.

Accessed Feb. 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie-Denise Villers]] (1774–1821) was a French painter who specialized in [[portrait]]s. Villers was a student of the French painter [[Girodet]]. Villers' most famous painting, Young Woman Drawing, (1801) is displayed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. The painting was attributed to [[Jacques-Louis David]] at one time, but was later realized to be Villers' work.
