Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at [[Research stations in Antarctica|research stations]] scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[plant]]s, [[protist]]a, and certain [[animal]]s, such as [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[penguin]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[tardigrade]]s. Vegetation, where it occurs, is [[tundra]].

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered, unseen until 1820 when the [[List of Russian explorers|Russian expedition]] of [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]] on ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'' and ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]'' sighted the [[Fimbul ice shelf]]. The continent, however, remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of easily accessible resources, and isolation. In 1895, the first confirmed landing was conducted by a team of Norwegians.

Antarctica is a ''de facto'' [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]], governed by parties to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] that have consulting status. Twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]]. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.

==Etymology==
[[File:Adelie Penguins on iceberg.jpg|thumb|[[Adelie penguins]] in Antarctica]]
The name ''Antarctica'' is the [[Romanization of Greek|romanised]] version of the [[Greek language|Greek]] compound word ἀνταρκτική (''antarktiké''), feminine of [[wikt:ἀνταρκτικός|ἀνταρκτικός]] (''antarktikós''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liddell |first1=Henry George |last2=Scott |first2=Robert |editor-last=Crane |editor-first=Gregory R. |contribution=Antarktikos |title=A Greek–English Lexicon |series=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Tufts University |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%239514 |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "opposite to the [[Arctic]]", "opposite to the north".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hince |first=Bernadette |date=2000 |title=The Antarctic Dictionary |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |isbn=978-0-9577471-1-1 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lJd8_owUxFEC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=antarctica+opposite+of+north+greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his book ''Meteorology'' about an ''Antarctic region'' in c.&amp;nbsp;350 BC&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.2.ii.html Meteorologica.] Book II, Part 5. 350 BCE. Translated by E. Webster. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1923. 140 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marinus of Tyre]] reportedly used the name in his unpreserved world map from the 2nd century CE.  The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] and [[Apuleius]] (1–2 centuries CE) used for the South Pole the romanised Greek name ''polus antarcticus,''&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlWM1eMefB8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage De astronomia.] Ed. G. Viré. Stuttgart: Teubner, 1992. 176 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apuleii. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ8MAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage Opera omnia.] Volumen tertium. London: Valpy, 1825. 544 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; from which derived the [[Old French]] ''pole antartike'' (modern ''pôle antarctique'') attested in 1270, and from there the [[Middle English]] ''pol antartik'' in a 1391 technical treatise by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (modern ''Antarctic Pole'').&lt;ref&gt;G. Chaucer. [http://art-bin.com/art/oastro.html A Treatise on the Astrolabe.] Approx. 1391. Ed. W. Skeat. London: N. Trübner, 1872. 188 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before acquiring its present geographical connotations, the term was used for other locations that could be defined as "opposite to the north". For example, the short-lived French colony established in [[Brazil]] in the 16th century was called "[[France Antarctique]]".

The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[John George Bartholomew]].&lt;ref&gt;John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica, CAIRT Issue 13, National Library of Scotland, July 2008, ISSN 1477-4186, and also {{cite web |title=The Bartholomew Archive |url=http://digital.nls.uk/bartholomew/highlights/antarctica.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of name==
The long-imagined (but undiscovered) south polar continent was originally called ''[[Terra Australis]]'', sometimes shortened to 'Australia' as seen in a woodcut illustration titled ''Sphere of the winds'', contained in an astrological textbook published in Frankfurt in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barth |first1=Cyriaco Jacob zum |title=Astronomia: Teutsch Astronomei |date=1545 |location=Frankfurt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the longer Latin phrase was better known, the shortened name ''Australia'' was used in Europe's scholarly circles.

Then in the nineteenth century, the colonial authorities in [[Sydney]] removed the Dutch name from [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. Instead of inventing a new name to replace it, they took the name ''Australia'' from the south polar continent, leaving it nameless for some eighty years. During that period, geographers had to make do with clumsy phrases such as "the Antarctic Continent". They searched for a more poetic replacement, suggesting various names such as Ultima and Antipodea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually ''Antarctica'' was adopted in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woodburn |first1=Susan |title=John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica |journal=Cairt |date=July 2008 |issue=13 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no indigenous population, and there is no evidence that it was seen by humans until the 19th century. However, in February 1775, during his [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]], [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] called the existence of such a polar continent "probable" and in another copy of his journal he wrote:"[I] '''firmly believe''' it and its '''more than''' probable that we have seen a part of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beaglehole |first1=J.C. |title=Cook, Journals, vol.2 |date=1968 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781472453242 |page=643, n.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, belief in the existence of a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]]—had prevailed since the times of [[Ptolemy]] in the 1st century AD. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of the fabled "Antarctica", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.
[[File:James Weddell Expedition.jpg|thumb|Painting of [[James Weddell]]'s second expedition in 1823, depicting the brig ''Jane'' and the cutter ''Beaufroy'']]

Integral to the story of the origin of Antarctica's name is that it was not named ''Terra Australis''—this name was [[Australia#Etymology|given to Australia instead]], because of the misconception that no significant landmass could exist further south. Explorer [[Matthew Flinders]], in particular, has been credited with popularising the transfer of the name ''Terra Australis'' to Australia. He justified the titling of his book ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'' (1814) by writing in the introduction:

{{quote|There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.&lt;ref&gt;Flinders, Matthew.

European maps continued to show this hypothesised land until Captain [[James Cook]]'s ships, {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}} and {{HMS|Adventure|1771|2}}, crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773, in December 1773 and again in January 1774.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Age of Exploration: John Cook |publisher=The Mariners' Museum |url=http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php |accessdate=12 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207175624/http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=7 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook came within about {{convert|75|mi|km|order=flip|-1|abbr=on}} of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773.&lt;ref&gt;James Cook, ''The Journals'', edited by Philip Edwards.

On 22 January 1840, two days after the discovery of the coast west of the [[Balleny Islands]], some members of the crew of the 1837–40 expedition of [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] disembarked on the highest islet&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM29/wp/ATCM29_wp019_f.doc "''Proposition de classement du rocher du débarquement dans le cadre des sites et monuments historiques''"] {{fr icon}}.

In December 1839, as part of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] of 1838–42 conducted by the [[United States Navy]] (sometimes called the "Ex. Ex.", or "the Wilkes Expedition"), an expedition sailed from [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], into the Antarctic Ocean, as it was then known, and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was named "[[Wilkes Land]]", a name it retains to this day.

Explorer [[James Clark Ross]] passed through what is now known as the [[Ross Sea]] and discovered [[Ross Island]] (both of which were named after him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]. [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] are named after two ships from his expedition: {{HMS|Erebus|1826|6}} and {{HMS|Terror|1813|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South-Pole – Exploring Antarctica |work=South-Pole.com |url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000081.htm |accessdate=12 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214042438/http://www.south-pole.com/p0000081.htm |archivedate=14 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercator Cooper]] landed in [[East Antarctica]] on 26 January 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=9 February 2005 |title=Antarctic Circle – Antarctic First |url=http://www.antarctic-circle.org/firsts.htm |accessdate=12 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208102813/http://www.antarctic-circle.org/firsts.htm |archivedate=8 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Nimrod Expedition]] led by [[Ernest Shackleton]] in 1907, parties led by [[Edgeworth David]] became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the [[South Magnetic Pole]].

Positioned asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the Antarctic Circle, Antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]; alternatively, it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s, or by the southern waters of the [[World Ocean]]. There are a number of rivers and lakes in Antarctica, the longest river being the [[Onyx River|Onyx]]. The largest lake, [[Lake Vostok|Vostok]], is one of the largest sub-glacial lakes in the world. Antarctica covers more than {{convert|14|e6km2|sqmi|abbr=unit}},&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt; making it the fifth-largest continent, about 1.3 times as large as Europe. The coastline measures {{convert|17968|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt; and is mostly characterised by ice formations, as the following table shows:

Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica, because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]].

[[File:Antarctica surface.jpg|thumb|left|Elevation coloured by relief height]]

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], a [[ice sheet|sheet of ice]] averaging at least {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} thick. The continent has about 90% of the world's ice (and thereby about 70% of the world's [[fresh water]]). If all of this ice were melted, sea levels would rise about {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|title=How Stuff Works: polar ice caps|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=12 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204205054/http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|archivedate=4 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the interior of the continent, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is very low, down to {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year; in a few "[[Blue ice (glacial)|blue ice]]" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], and so the local mass balance is negative. In the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys|dry valleys]], the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.

[[West Antarctica]] is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the small possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, [[Sea level change|ocean levels]] would rise by several metres in a relatively [[geologic time scale|geologically short]] period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic [[ice stream]]s, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, flow to one of the many [[Ice shelf#Antarctic ice shelves|Antarctic ice shelves]]: see [[ice-sheet dynamics]].

East Antarctica lies on the Indian Ocean side of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] and comprises [[Coats Land]], [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Enderby Land]], [[Mac. Robertson Land|&lt;abbr title="Macpherson"&gt;Mac&lt;/abbr&gt;. Robertson Land]], [[Wilkes Land]], and [[Victoria Land]]. All but a small portion of this region lies within the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. East Antarctica is largely covered by the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]].

[[File:Mount Erebus Aerial 2.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Erebus]], an active volcano on [[Ross Island]]]]

[[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at {{convert|4892|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. Antarctica contains [[List of mountains in Antarctica|many other mountains]], on both the main continent and the surrounding islands. Mount Erebus on [[Ross Island]] is the world's southernmost active volcano. Another well-known volcano is found on [[Deception Island]], which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent, and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|title=Volcanoes|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=13 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081129/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|archivedate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a potentially active underwater volcano was found in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] by American and Canadian researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100385|title=Scientists Discover Undersea Volcano Off Antarctica|publisher=United States National Science Foundation|accessdate=13 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica is home to more than 70 lakes that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath Russia's [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years, but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.&lt;ref name="Briggs2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=19 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4908292.stm|title=Secret rivers found in Antarctic|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence, in the form of [[ice core]]s drilled to about {{convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} above the water line, that Lake Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]].

===Geological history and palaeontology===
More than 170&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart, and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.

====Palaeozoic era (540–250 Ma)====
During the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period]], Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] (416&amp;nbsp;[[annum|Ma]]), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360&amp;nbsp;Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though [[Antarctic flora|flora]] remained. During the [[Permian]] period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.&lt;ref name="Stonehouse"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Stonehouse|editor-first=B.|title=Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans|date=June 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-98665-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mesozoic era (250–66 Ma)====
As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, [[seed fern]]s or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. [[Synapsid]]s, commonly known as "mammal-like reptiles", were common in Antarctica during the [[Early Triassic]] and included forms such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the [[Jurassic]] period (206–146&amp;nbsp;Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. [[Ginkgo]] trees, conifers, bennettites, horsetails, ferns and [[cycad]]s were plentiful during this period. In West Antarctica, [[conifer]]ous [[forest]]s dominated through the entire [[Cretaceous]] period (146–66&amp;nbsp;Ma), though [[Nothofagus|southern beech]] became more prominent towards the end of this period. [[Ammonite]]s were common in the seas around Antarctica, and dinosaurs were also present, though only three Antarctic dinosaur [[genera]] (''[[Cryolophosaurus]]'' and ''[[Glacialisaurus]]'', from the [[Hanson Formation]],&lt;ref name="SmithPol2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Nathan D.|last2=Pol|first2=Diego|date=2007|title=Anatomy of a basal sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Early Jurassic Hanson Formation of Antarctica|journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica|volume=52|issue=4|pages=657–674|url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app52/app52-657.pdf|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Antarctopelta]]'') have been described to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leslie, Mitch |title=The Strange Lives of Polar Dinosaurs |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/polar-dinosaurs-200712.html |publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]] |date=December 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080130062646/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/polar-dinosaurs-200712.html |archivedate=30 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this era that Gondwana began to break up.

However, there is some evidence of antarctic marine glaciation during the [[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Bornemann, Norris RD, Friedrich O, Beckmann B, Schouten S, Damsté JS, Vogel J, Hofmann P, Wagner T., Isotopic evidence for glaciation during the Cretaceous supergreenhouse.

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gondwana breakup (160–23 Ma)====
The cooling of Antarctica occurred stepwise, as the continental spread changed the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalising currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.

Africa separated from Antarctica in the Jurassic, around 160&amp;nbsp;Ma, followed by the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125&amp;nbsp;Ma). By the end of the Cretaceous, about 66&amp;nbsp;Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a subtropical climate and flora, complete with a [[marsupial]] [[fauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reinhold, Robert|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/us/antarctica-yields-first-land-mammal-fossil.html|title=Antarctica yields first land mammal fossil|journal=New York Times|date=21 March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eocene]] epoch, about 40&amp;nbsp;Ma Australia-[[New Guinea]] separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear.  During the [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event]] about 34&amp;nbsp;million years ago, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels have been found to be about 760 ppm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html|title=New CO2 data helps unlock the secrets of Antarctic formation|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=26 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715082838/http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html|archivedate=15 July 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm.

Around 23 Ma, the [[Drake Passage]] opened between Antarctica and South America, resulting in the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] that completely isolated the continent. Models of the changes suggest that declining CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels became more important.&lt;ref name="DeContoPollard2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeConto|first1=Robert M.|last2=Pollard|first2=David|title=Rapid Cenozoic glaciation of Antarctica induced by declining atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Nature|volume=421|pages=245–9|date=16 January 2003|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6920/abs/nature01290.html|doi=10.1038/nature01290|accessdate=19 October 2009|issue=6920|pmid=12529638 |bibcode = 2003Natur.421..245D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ice began to spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent.

====Neogene Period (23–0.05 Ma)====
Since about 15 Ma, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.&lt;ref name="Trewby2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Trewby|editor-first=Mary|date=September 2002|title=Antarctica: An Encyclopedia from Abbott Ice Shelf to Zooplankton|publisher=Firefly Books|isbn=1-55297-590-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meyer Desert Formation biota====
{{main|Meyer Desert Formation biota}}
Fossil ''[[Nothofagus]]'' leaves in the Meyer Desert Formation of the [[Sirius Group]] show that intermittent warm periods allowed ''Nothofagus'' shrubs to cling to the [[Dominion Range]] as late as 3–4 Ma (mid-late [[Pliocene]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=New grounds for reassessing palaeoclimate of the Sirius Group |date=2001 |journal=Journal of the Geological Society, London |volume=158|pages=925–35 | doi=10.1144/0016-764901-030 | last1=Retallack | first1=G.J. | last2=Krull | first2=E.S. | last3=Bockheim | first3=J.G. | issue=6|bibcode=2001JGSoc.158..925R }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the [[Pleistocene]] ice age covered the whole continent and destroyed all major plant life on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4164401.html |author= Stefi Weisburd |title=A forest grows in Antarctica.

The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by nearly all of the continent being permanently covered with a thick layer of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_1_3.html|title=Antarctica's geology|publisher=Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) in partnership with the British Antarctic Survey and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office|accessdate=31 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122142909/http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_1_3.html|archivedate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new techniques such as [[remote sensing]], [[ground-penetrating radar]] and [[satellite imagery]] have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.

Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the [[Andes]] mountain range of South America.&lt;ref name="Stonehouse" /&gt; The [[Antarctic Peninsula]] was formed by uplift and [[metamorphism]] of sea bed sediments during the late [[Paleozoic]] and the early [[Mesozoic]] eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by [[igneous]] intrusions and [[volcanism]]. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in [[Marie Byrd Land]] and [[Alexander Island]]. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to East Antarctica.

East Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]]. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. In coastal areas such as [[Shackleton Range]] and [[Victoria Land]] some [[fault (geology)|faulting]] has occurred.

The main mineral resource known on the continent is coal.&lt;ref name="Trewby2002" /&gt; It was first recorded near the [[Beardmore Glacier]] by [[Frank Wild]] on the [[Nimrod Expedition]], and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The [[Prince Charles Mountains]] contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the [[oil field|oil]] and [[natural gas field]]s found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is [[Ban (law)|banned]] until 2048 by the [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]].

Antarctica is the coldest of [[Earth]]'s continents. It used to be ice-free until about 34 million years ago, when it became covered with ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/03/09/science.aad6284|title=How Antarctica got its ice|first1=Caroline H.|last1=Lear|first2=Dan J.|last2=Lunt|date=10 March 2016|publisher=|journal=Science|pages=aad6284|via=science.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.aad6284|pmid=26966192|bibcode=2016Sci...352...34L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coldest natural air temperature ever recorded on Earth was {{convert|−89.2|C|F|1|abbr=on}} at the Soviet (now [[Russia]]n) [[Vostok Station]] in Antarctica on 21 July 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecolocalizer.com/2008/12/14/the-coldest-inhabited-places-on-earth/|title=The Coldest Inhabited Places on Earth|work=Eco Localizer|date=14 December 2008|author=Hudson, Gavin|accessdate=8 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327115134/http://ecolocalizer.com/2008/12/14/the-coldest-inhabited-places-on-earth/ |archivedate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, this is 10.7&amp;nbsp;°C (20&amp;nbsp;°F) colder than [[sublimation (chemistry)|subliming]] [[dry ice]] at one atmosphere of partial pressure, but since CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only makes up 0.039% of air, temperatures of less than {{convert|−140|C|F|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="AgeeOrton2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agee|first1=Ernest|last2=Orton|first2=Andrea|last3=Rogers|first3=John|title=CO2Snow Deposition in Antarctica to Curtail Anthropogenic Global Warming|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology|volume=52|issue=2|year=2013|pages=281–288|issn=1558-8424|doi=10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0110.1|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0110.1|accessdate=8 January 2018|bibcode=2013JApMC..52..281A}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be needed to produce dry ice snow in Antarctica.

Temperatures reach a minimum of between {{convert|−80|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|−89.2|C|F|abbr=on}} in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|C|F|0|abbr=on}} near the coast in summer. [[Sunburn]] is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it.  Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="BAS-weather"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm|title=Weather in the Antarctic|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg|thumb|left|The snow surface at [[Dome C]] [[Concordia Station|Station]] is typical of most of the continent's surface.]]
East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to {{convert|1.22|m|in|0}} in 48 hours have been recorded.

At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the [[polar plateau]] often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate. During clear days in summer, more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than at the [[equator]] because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt;

Antarctica is colder than the [[Arctic]] for three reasons. First, much of the continent is more than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the [[troposphere]]. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at [[aphelion]] in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at [[perihelion]] in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/orbitsun.htm The Earth's Elliptical Orbit Around the Sun&amp;nbsp;– Aphelion and Perihelion]. Geography.about.com. Retrieved on 21 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma-full [[solar wind]]s that pass by the Earth. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]], a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sun dog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright "spot" beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name="BAS-weather" /&gt;

Several governments maintain permanent manned [[research station]]s on the continent. The number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer, giving it a [[population density]] between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres (180 and 900 per million square miles) at these times. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox church]]—[[Trinity Church (Antarctica)|Trinity Church]], opened in 2004 at the Russian [[Bellingshausen Station]]—is manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.rs/eng/flock_antarcticas_orthodox_temple_celebrates_holy_trinity_day|title=Flock of Antarctica's Orthodox temple celebrates Holy Trinity Day|publisher=Serbian Orthodox Church|date=24 May 2004|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoslavye.org.ua/index.php?action=fullinfo&amp;r_type=&amp;id=22495|script-title=ru:Владимир Петраков: 'Антарктика – это особая атмосфера, где живут очень интересные люди'|language=ru}} (Vladimir Petrakov: "Antarctic is a special world, full of very interesting people").

The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]) were British and American [[Seal hunting|sealers]] who used to spend a year or more on [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], from 1786 onward. During the [[whaling]] era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included [[Grytviken]], [[Leith Harbour]], [[King Edward Point]], [[Stromness, South Georgia|Stromness]], [[Husvik]], [[Prince Olav Harbour]], [[Ocean Harbour]] and [[Godthul]]. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]], a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.

The first child born in the [[Antarctic Convergence|southern polar region]] was Norwegian girl [[Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen]], born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913, and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 and became the manager of Grytviken, serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were born on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Headland, Robert K.|title=The Island of South Georgia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1984|isbn=978-0-521-25274-4|oclc=473919719|pages=12, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whale]]s, [[orca]]s, [[colossal squid]]s and [[fur seal]]s. The [[emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the [[Adélie penguin]] breeds farther south than any other penguin. The [[southern rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s, [[chinstrap penguin]]s, and [[gentoo penguin]]s also breed in the Antarctic.

The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Weddell seal]], a "[[true seal]]", is named after [[James Weddell|Sir James Weddell]], commander of British sealing expeditions in the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Antarctic krill]], which congregate in large [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]], is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[Notothenioidei|icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|title=Creatures of Antarctica|accessdate=6 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214015049/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A census of sea life carried out during the [[International Polar Year]] and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global [[Census of Marine Life]] and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of {{convert|12000|km|0|abbr=on}}. Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as [[sea cucumbers]] and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution&amp;nbsp;– fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5&amp;nbsp;°C, and the major current systems or marine [[Thermohaline circulation|conveyor belt]] which transport eggs and larval stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kinver|first=Mark|date=15 February 2009|title=Ice oceans 'are not poles apart'|newspaper=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7888558.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
[[File:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|About 400 species of [[lichen]]-forming fungi are known to exist in Antarctica.]]
About 1,150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming.&lt;ref name="basplants"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bridge, Paul D.|author2=Spooner, Brian M.|author3=Roberts, Peter J.|date=2008|title=Non-lichenized fungi from the Antarctic region|journal=Mycotaxon|volume=106|pages=485–490|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0106/0485.htm|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these species are [[endolith|cryptoendoliths]] as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanised cells make them resistant to [[UV light]]. Those features can also be observed in algae and [[cyanobacteria]], suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as ''[[Cryomyces antarcticus]]'', and ''[[Cryomyces minteri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackyeast2010.bf.uni-lj.si/fileadmin/userfiles/Lectures/Onofri.pdf|title=Survival of Black Fungi in Space, Preliminary Results|author=Onofri, S.|author2=Selbmann, L.|author3=Zucconi, L.|author4=Scalzi, G.|author5=Venkateswaran, K.J.|author6=de la Torre, R.|author7=de Vera, J.-P.|author8=Ott, S.|author9=Rabbow, E.|author10=Horneck, G.|last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=de Hoog, G.S.|date=2005|title=Fungi of the Antarctic: evolution under extreme conditions|journal=Studies in Mycology|volume=51|pages=1–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
About 298 million years ago [[Permian]] forests started to cover the continent, and [[tundra]] vegetation survived as late as 15 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://telanganatoday.news/antarctica-green-scientists|title=Antarctica was once green: Scientists|date=15 April 2017|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423062932/https://telanganatoday.news/antarctica-green-scientists|archivedate=23 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[bryophyte]]s. There are about 100 species of [[moss]]es and 25 species of [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], but only three species of [[flowering plant]]s, all of which are found in the Antarctic Peninsula: ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]'' (Antarctic hair grass), ''[[Colobanthus quitensis]]'' (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native ''[[Poa annua]]'' (annual bluegrass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0032247414000916|title=''Poa annua'' L. in the maritime Antarctic: an overview|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katarzyna_Chwedorzewska/publication/270217066_Poa_annua_L._in_the_maritime_Antarctic_an_overview/links/54a30c080cf267bdb9042e47.pdf|journal=Polar Record |volume =51|issue =6 |date=2015|pages=637–643|author=Chwedorzewska, K.J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.&lt;ref name="basplants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/index.php|title=Plants of Antarctica|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=12 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607115623/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/index.php|archivedate=7 June 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aadplants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/plants|title=Antarctic Wildlife|author=Australian Antarctic Division|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=27 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828190048/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/plants|archivedate=28 August 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other organisms===

===Conservation===
[[File:Antarctica, pollution, environment, Russia, Bellingshausen 1.JPG|thumb|left|Dumping of waste, including old vehicles, such as here at the Russian Bellingshausen Station in 1992, is prohibited since the entry into force of the Protocol on Environmental Protection in 1998.]]
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also known as the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main instrument concerned with conservation and management of [[biodiversity]] in Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues in Antarctica by the Committee for Environmental Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.&lt;ref name="BridgeHughes73"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridge|first1=Paul D.|first2=Kevin. A.|last2=Hughes|date=2010|title=Conservation issues for Antarctic fungi|journal=Mycologia Balcanica|volume=7|issue=1|pages=73–76|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59687/0007/001/0073.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passing of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] (1978) in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of [[introduced species|alien]] plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The [[overfishing]] of [[krill]], which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]] (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s (35,300&amp;nbsp;short tons) in 2000.&lt;ref name="KirbyBBC-2001"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=Alex|date=15 August 2001|title=Toothfish at risk from illegal catches|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1492380.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AUgovAntartica-toothfish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toothfish|publisher=Australian Antarctic Division|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/animals/fish/toothfish|accessdate=22 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of 60° S for the purposes of the Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the [[Soviet Union]] (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.aq/devAS/ats_parties.aspx?lang=e|title=Antarctic Treaty System – Parties|publisher=Antarctic Treaty and the Secretariat|accessdate=20 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on Antarctica.

The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap, and have caused friction. On 18 December 2012, the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] named a previously unnamed area [[Queen Elizabeth Land]] in tribute to [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]].&lt;ref name="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Foreign Secretary has announced that the southern part of British Antarctic Territory has been named Queen Elizabeth Land|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/queen-elizabeth-land|work=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, [[John Freeman (diplomat)|John Freeman]], was summoned to the Argentine government as protest against the claim.&lt;ref name="BBC News: Argentine Protest Against Queen Elizabeth Land"&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentina angry after Antarctic territory named after Queen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20822582|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine–UK relations had previously been damaged throughout 2012 due to disputes over the sovereignty of the nearby [[Falkland Islands]], and the 30th anniversary of the [[Falklands War]].

The areas shown as [[Australian Antarctic Territory|Australia's]] and [[Ross Dependency|New Zealand's]] claims were British territory until they were handed over following the countries' independence. Australia currently claims the largest area. The claims of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France and Norway are all recognised by each other.

Other countries participating as members of the Antarctic Treaty have a territorial interest in Antarctica, but the provisions of the Treaty do not allow them to make their claims while it is in force.&lt;ref name="peecug1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.jid.org/en/mono38/nieto.htm |title=La Antartica |publisher=Library.jid.org |accessdate=4 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007084832/http://library.jid.org/en/mono38/nieto.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peecug2"&gt;[http://www.afese.com/img/revistas/revista40/laantartida.pdf Afese.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707092226/http://www.afese.com/img/revistas/revista40/laantartida.pdf |date=7 July 2011 }}.

==Economy==

There is no economic activity in Antarctica at present, except for fishing off the coast and small-scale [[Tourism in Antarctica|tourism]], both based outside Antarctica.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt;

Although coal, [[hydrocarbon]]s, iron ore, [[platinum]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], gold and other minerals have been found, they have not been in large enough quantities to exploit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Natural Resources|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/print_2111.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934&amp;nbsp;tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fisheries News|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2003/11/30/fisheries-news|publisher=mecropress|date=30 November 2003|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale "expedition tourism" has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol provisions, but in effect self-regulated by the [[International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators]] (IAATO). Not all vessels associated with Antarctic tourism are members of IAATO, but IAATO members account for 95% of the tourist activity. Travel is largely by small or medium ship, focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife. A total of 37,506 tourists visited during the 2006–07 [[Southern Hemisphere|Austral summer]] with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships; 38,478 were recorded in 2015–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc |title=Final Report, 30th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting |publisher=[[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] |accessdate=2 August 2007 |format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808034540/http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc |archivedate=8 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm|title=Politics of Antarctica|accessdate=5 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214014631/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iaato.org/documents/10157/1444539/2015-2016+Tourists+by+Nationality+(Total)/9a4fe29b-1c44-45cc-96b2-246e93137b2f|title=2015–2016 Tourists by Nationality Total|publisher=IAATO|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors. Some environmentalists and scientists have made a call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/734551/Tourism-%27threatens-Antarctic%27.html|title=''Tourism threatens Antarctic''|publisher=Telegraph UK|accessdate=5 February 2006|location=London|first=Mark|last=Rowe|date=11 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary response by Antarctic Treaty Parties has been to develop, through their Committee for Environmental Protection and in partnership with IAATO, "site use guidelines" setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites. Antarctic sightseeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] in 1979 on Mount Erebus, which killed all 257 aboard. [[Qantas]] resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid-1990s.

Antarctic fisheries in 1998–99 (1 July&amp;nbsp;– 30 June) reported landing 119,898 tonnes legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Antarctica-Year-In-Review-1999|title=Antarctica in 1999|work=Britannica Book of the Year|author=Guthridge, Guy|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About thirty countries maintain about seventy [[Research stations in Antarctica|research stations]] (40 year-round or permanent, and 30 summer-only) in Antarctica, with an approximate population of 4000 in summer and 1000 in winter.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt;

The station can be seen at far left, the [[power plant]] in the centre and the mechanic's garage in the lower right. The green light in the background is the [[Aurora Australis|aurora.]]]]

Each year, scientists from 28 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to just over 1,000 in the winter.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt; [[McMurdo Station]], which is the largest research station in Antarctica, is capable of housing more than 1,000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.

Researchers include [[biologist]]s, [[geologist]]s, [[Oceanography|oceanographers]], [[physicist]]s, [[astronomer]]s, [[Glaciology|glaciologists]], and [[Meteorology|meteorologists]]. Geologists tend to study [[plate tectonics]], meteorites from [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and [[Ice-sheet dynamics|dynamics]] of floating ice, [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere; low temperature, which minimises the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere; and absence of [[light pollution]], thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory|neutrino telescope]] in the world, built {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} below Amundsen–Scott station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml |title=Science in Antarctica |publisher=Antarctic Connection |accessdate=4 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207003148/http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml |archivedate=7 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at [[Halley Station]] on the [[Brunt Ice Shelf]] discovered the existence of a hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989, climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.&lt;ref name=adelie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://birdsnews.com/2014/adelie-penguins-thriving-amid-antarcticas-melting-ice/|title=Adelie Penguins thriving amid Antarctica's melting ice|author=Graham, Rex|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=24 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053724/https://birdsnews.com/2014/adelie-penguins-thriving-amid-antarcticas-melting-ice/|archivedate=5 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006 [[NASA]] satellite data revealed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was larger than at any other time on record, at {{convert|2750000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ozone record"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/ozone_record.html|title=NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker|publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA|date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=6 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013021957/http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/ozone_record.html |archivedate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impacts of the depleted ozone layer on climate changes occurring in Antarctica are not well understood.&lt;ref name=adelie/&gt;

In 2007 [[The Polar Geospatial Center]] was founded.  The Polar Geospatial Center uses [[Geospatial technology|geospatial]] and [[remote sensing]] technology to provide mapping services to American federally funded research teams.  Currently, the Polar Geospatial Center can image all of Antarctica at 50&amp;nbsp;cm resolution every 45 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/polar-geospatial-center-releases-new-application-with-high-res-satelli/370342|title=Polar Geospatial Center Releases New Application with High-Res Satellite Imagery|author=Rejcek, Peter|publisher=The Antarctic Sun|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2007 Belgian-based International Polar Foundation unveiled the [[Princess Elisabeth Antarctica|Princess Elisabeth station]], the world's first zero-emissions polar science station in Antarctica to [[research]] [[climate change]]. Costing $16.3&amp;nbsp;million, the [[prefabricated]] station, which is part of the [[International Polar Year]], was shipped to the South Pole from [[Belgium]] by the end of 2008 to monitor the [[health]] of the [[polar region]]s.

===Meteorites===
[[File:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|left|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]]]]
[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the [[Adelie Land meteorite]]. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.&lt;ref name="meteorite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|title=Meteorites from Antarctica|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306122117/http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|archivedate=6 March 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name="meteorite"/&gt;

[[File:Flow of Ice Across Antarctica.ogv|thumb|upright=1.35|The motion of ice in Antarctica]]

Due to its location at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation except along the southern summer. This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. [[Precipitation]] is low (most of Antarctica is a [[desert]]) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as [[ice stream]]s, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from [[seawater]] through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.

Sea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent]] of [[sea ice]] around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the thickness changes are unclear.&lt;ref name="United Nations Environment Programme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |url=https://www.grida.no/resources/5268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Snow and Ice Data Center"&gt;{{cite web|title=All About Sea Ice: Characteristics: Arctic vs. Antarctic|publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center|url=http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317034609/http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archivedate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However, it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.&lt;ref name="RignotCasassa2004"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2004GL020697| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Casassa | first2 = G.| last3 = Gogineni | first3 = P.| last4 = Krabill | first4 = W.| last5 = Rivera | first5 = A.| last6 = Thomas | first6 = R.| date = 2004| title = Accelerated ice discharge from the Antarctic Peninsula following the collapse of Larsen B ice shelf| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 31| issue = 18| pages = L18401| url = http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| accessdate = 22 October 2011| bibcode = 2004GeoRL..3118401R| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123070917/http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| archivedate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea.

Sheperd et al. 2012, found that different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change were in good agreement and combining methods leads to more certainty with East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula changing in mass by +14 ± 43, –65 ± 26, and –20 ± 14 [[gigatonnes]] (Gt) per year.&lt;ref name="IMBIE2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 338 | issue=6111 | pages = 1183–1189 | date = 2012-11-30 | doi = 10.1126/science.1228102| bibcode = 2012Sci...338.1183S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same group's 2018 [[systematic review]] study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatonnes per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002 but has accelerated to an average of 220 gigatonnes per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017.&lt;ref name="IMBIE2018"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = Mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2017 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 558 | pages = 219–222 | date = 2018-06-13 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0179-y | lay-url = https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/latest-estimate-shows-how-much-antarctic-ice-has-fallen-into-the-sea/ | lay-source = [[Ars Technica]] | lay-date = 2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's Climate Change website indicates a compatible overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.&lt;ref name="landice"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/ |title=Land Ice |publisher=NASA Global Climate Change |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single 2015 study by H. Jay Zwally et al. found instead that the net change in ice mass is slightly positive at approximately 82 gigatonnes per year (with significant regional variation) which would result in Antarctic activity reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm per year.&lt;ref name="ZwallyEtAl2015"&gt;{{cite journal |first=H.

Eric Rignot, who has worked on similar Antarctic studies, has been fielding a lot of questions about this one and shared his comments with Ars. “I am afraid I have some rather harsh words about it,” he wrote. Rignot said the data just aren’t precise enough to support the paper's conclusions.¶ “Zwally's group is the only one pushing its interpretation beyond the realm of the inherent uncertainty of the data. Accumulation of snow in East Antarctica is 10 centimeters water equivalent per year. To detect changes in accumulation of 136 gigatons (with no error bar), or 10 percent, Zwally et al. needs to detect changes of the order of 1 centimeter. Current technology such as ICESat cannot detect any change smaller than 20 centimeters. Radar altimetry (used for the earlier period) is closer to 40-50 centimeter noise, but nobody really knows. There is no way to detect changes in East Antarctic accumulation at the 10 percent level, not even 50 percent level, with those kinds of error bars,” Rignot wrote.¶ He continued, “The Zwally group’s findings are at odds with all other independent methods: re-analysis, gravity measurements, mass budget method, and other groups using the same data.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Antarctica is a cold region with a ground base [[Height above mean sea level|above sea level]] and occupies most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]] as a whole is thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance.&lt;ref name="ShepherdWingham2007"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1136776| last1 = Shepherd | first1 = A.| last2 = Wingham | first2 = D.| title = Recent Sea-Level Contributions of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets| journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]| volume = 315| issue = 5818| pages = 1529–1532| date = 2007| pmid = 17363663|bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1529S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1038/ngeo102| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Bamber | first2 = J.L.| last3 = Van Den Broeke | first3 = M R.| last4 = Davis | first4 = C.| last5 = Li | first5 = Y.| last6 = Van De Berg | first6 = W.J.| last7 = Van Meijgaard | first7 = E.| date = 2008| title = Recent Antarctic ice mass loss from radar interferometry and regional climate modelling| journal = [[Nature Geoscience]]| volume = 1| issue = 2| pages = 106| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232802727_Recent_Antarctic_ice_mass_loss_from_radar_interferometry_and_regional_climate_modelling|bibcode = 2008NatGe...1..106R | pmc = 4032514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepherdetal2012"&gt;Sheperd et al. 2012 [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6111/1183 A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance]&lt;/ref&gt; However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenWilson2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2007.10.057| last1 = Chen | first1 = J.L.| last2 = Wilson | first2 = C.R.| last3 = Tapley | first3 = B.D.| last4 = Blankenship | first4 = D.| last5 = Young | first5 = D.| date = 2008| title = Antarctic regional ice loss rates from GRACE| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 266| issue = 1–2| pages = 140–148|bibcode = 2008E&amp;PSL.266..140C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at &gt;0.05&amp;nbsp;°C (0.09&amp;nbsp;°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C (0.2&amp;nbsp;°F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring.

{{Main|Ozone depletion}}

There is a large area of low ozone concentration or "[[ozone hole]]" over Antarctica. This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antarctic Ozone|authors=British Antarctic Survey, Meteorology and Ozone Monitoring Unit |publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/ozone/index.html|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hole was detected by scientists in 1985&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Atmospheric science: Fixing the sky|author=Schiermeier, Quirin|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090812/full/460792a.html|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|doi=10.1038/460792a|date=12 August 2009|volume=460|pages=792–795|accessdate=7 October 2009|issue=7257|pmid=19675624}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the [[Atmospheric emissions|emission]] of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the [[ozone]] into other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html |title=The Antarctic Ozone hole |authors=National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Advanced Supercomputing Division (NAS) |publisher=Government of the United States |date=26 June 2001 |accessdate=7 February 2009 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090403024238/http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html |archivedate= 3 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere).&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"/&gt; Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the [[stratosphere]]. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6&amp;nbsp;°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the [[polar vortex]]) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting.&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"/&gt; Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Turner J.|author2=Comiso J.C.|author3=Marshall G.J.|author4=Lachlan-Cope T.A.|author5=Bracegirdle T.|author6=Maksym T.|author7=Meredith M.P., Wang Z.|author8= Orr A.|title=Non-annular atmospheric circulation change induced by stratospheric ozone depletion and its role in the recent increase of Antarctic sea ice extent|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|volume=36|pages=L08502|date=2009|doi=10.1029/2009GL037524|bibcode=2009GeoRL..36.8502T|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continent of '''Australia''', sometimes known in technical contexts by the names '''Sahul''', '''Australinea''' or '''Meganesia''' to distinguish it from the [[Australia|country of Australia]], consists of the land masses which sit on Australia's continental shelf. This includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, and the island of New Guinea (comprising Papua New Guinea and two Indonesian provinces).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://countrydigest.org/is-australia-a-country-or-a-continent/|title=Is Australia a Country or a Continent? - Country Digest|date=2016-09-07|work=Country Digest|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated in the geographical region of [[Oceania]], it is the smallest of the seven traditional continents in the English conception.

The continent lies on a [[continental shelf]] overlain by shallow seas which divide it into several landmasses—the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Torres Strait]] between mainland Australia and New Guinea, and [[Bass Strait]] between mainland Australia and Tasmania. When [[sea level]]s were lower during the [[quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]], including the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] about 18,000 BC, they were connected by dry land. During the past 10,000 years, rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands and separated the continent into today's low-lying [[arid]] to [[semi-arid]] mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea and Tasmania.&lt;ref name="JohnsonPage12"&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = David Peter | year = 2004 | title = The Geology of Australia | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Port Melbourne, Victoria | id = | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Australia New Guinea continent.jpg|thumb|[[Mainland Australia]] showing the continental [[Sahul Shelf]] (light blue) extending to the islands of New Guinea in the north, the island of Timor in the northwest, and Tasmania in the south]]

Archaeological terminology for this region has changed repeatedly. Before the 1970s, the single Pleistocene landmass was called ''Australasia'', derived from the [[Latin]] ''australis'', meaning "southern", although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands like New Zealand that are not on the same continental shelf. In the early 1970s, the term ''Greater Australia'' was introduced for the Pleistocene continent.&lt;ref name=ballard&gt;{{cite conference |first=Chris |last=Ballard |title=Stimulating minds to fantasy? A critical etymology for Sahul |booktitle=Sahul in review: Pleistocene archaeology in Australia, New Guinea and island Melanesia |pages=19–20 |publisher=Australian National University | location= Canberra |year=1993 |isbn=0-7315-1540-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then at a 1975 conference and consequent publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=J. |author2=J. Golson and R. Jones (eds) |others= |title=Sunda and Sahul: Prehistorical studies in Southeast Asia, Melanesia and Australia |year=1977 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |isbn=0-12-051250-5 |pages= |chapter= |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the name ''Sahul'' was extended from its previous use for just the [[Sahul Shelf]] to cover the continent.&lt;ref name=ballard/&gt;

In 1984 W. Filewood suggested the name ''Meganesia'', meaning "great island" or "great island-group", for both the Pleistocene continent and the present-day lands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=W. |last=Filewood |title=The Torres connection: Zoogeography of New Guinea |booktitle=Vertebrate zoogeography in Australasia |pages=1124–1125 |publisher=Hesperian Press | location=Carlisle, W.A. |year=1984 |isbn=0-85905-036-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this name has been widely accepted by biologists.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book |last=Flannery |first=Timothy Fridtjof |authorlink=Tim Flannery |title=The future eaters: An ecological history of the Australasian lands and people |year=1994 |publisher=Reed |location=Chatswood, NSW |isbn=0-7301-0422-2 |pages=42, 67 |chapter= |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have used ''Meganesia'' with different meanings: travel writer [[Paul Theroux]] included New Zealand in his definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Theroux |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Theroux |title=The happy isles of Oceania: Paddling the Pacific |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0-14-015976-2 |pages= |chapter= |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have used it for Australia, New Zealand and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Wareham |first=Evelyn |date=September 2002 |title=From Explorers to Evangelists: Archivists, Recordkeeping, and Remembering in the Pacific Islands |journal=Archival Science |volume=2 |issue=3–4 |pages=187–207 |doi=10.1007/BF02435621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another biologist, [[Richard Dawkins]], coined the name ''Australinea'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The ancestor's tale: A pilgrimage to the dawn of evolution |year=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0-618-00583-8 |page=224 |chapter= |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Australia-New Guinea'' has also been used.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Cite book

As the country of Australia is mostly on a single landmass, and comprises most of the continent, it is sometimes informally referred to as an island continent, surrounded by oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Löffler |first=Ernst |author2=A.J.

Geological forces such as [[tectonic uplift]] of mountain ranges or clashes between tectonic plates occurred mainly in Australia's early history, when it was still a part of [[Gondwana]]. Australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate, and therefore currently has no active volcanism.&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/land-of-earthquakes-and-volcanoes.htm |title=Land of earthquakes and volcanoes? |author=Kevin Mccue |accessdate=25 April 2010 |date=26 February 2010 |publisher=[[Australian Geographic]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306150520/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/land-of-earthquakes-and-volcanoes.htm |archivedate=6 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continent primarily sits on the Indo-Australian Plate. Because of its central location on its tectonic plate Australia doesn't have any active volcanic regions, the only continent with this distinction.&lt;ref name="aeppp"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australian Environments: Place, Pattern and Process |last=Barrett |author2=Dent |year=1996 |publisher=Macmillan Education AU |isbn=0732931207 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AUcU_35C9sC |accessdate=13 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529100215/https://books.google.com/books?id=9AUcU_35C9sC |archivedate=29 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lands were joined with [[Antarctica]] as part of the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] until the plate began to drift north about 96 million years ago. For most of the time since then, Australia–New Guinea remained a continuous landmass. When the [[last glacial period]] ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed [[Bass Strait]], separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the [[Aru Islands]], and the Australian mainland.

A northern arc consisting of the [[New Guinea Highlands]], the [[Raja Ampat Islands]], and [[Halmahera]] was uplifted by the northward migration of Australia and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]]. The [[Outer Banda Arc]] was accreted along the northwestern edge the continent; it includes the islands of [[Timor]], [[Tanimbar]], and [[Seram Island|Seram]]. Papua New Guinea has [[List of volcanoes in Papua New Guinea|several volcanoes]], as it is situated along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. Volcanic eruptions are not rare, and the area is prone to [[earthquakes]] and [[tsunamis]] because of this.&lt;ref&gt;MG Audley-Charles, 1986, "Timor–Tanimbar Trough: the foreland basin of the evolving Banda orogen", ''Spec.

===Flora===

Among the fungi, the remarkable association between ''[[Cyttaria]]'' ''gunnii'' (one of the "golf-ball" fungi) and its associated trees in the genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'' is evidence of that drift: the only other places where this association is known are New Zealand and southern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;Korf, R.P. ''Cyttaria'' (Cyttariales): coevolution with ''Nothofagus'', and evolutionary relationship to the Boedijnpezizeae (Pezizales, Sarcoscyphaceae). pp. 77–87 in K.A. Pirozynski &amp; J. Walker [eds] Pacific Mycogeography: a Preliminary Approach. ''Australian Journal of Botany'' Supplementary Series No. 10, 172 pp. (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to [[aridity]] and fire which include [[sclerophyll|scleromorphy]] and [[serotiny]]. These adaptations are common in species from the large and well-known families [[Proteaceae]] (''[[Banksia]]''), [[Myrtaceae]] (''[[Eucalyptus]]'' – gum trees), and [[Fabaceae]] (''[[Acacia]]'' – wattle). 

For about 40 million years Australia–New Guinea was almost completely isolated. During this time, the continent experienced numerous changes in climate, but the overall trend was towards greater aridity. When [[South America]] eventually separated from Antarctica, the development of the cold [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] changed weather patterns across the world. For Australia–New Guinea, it brought a marked intensification of the drying trend. The great inland seas and lakes dried out. Much of the long-established broad-leaf [[deciduous]] forest began to give way to the distinctive hard-leaved [[sclerophyllous]] plants that characterise the modern Australian landscape. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many [[tropical rainforest]] species with origins in Asia, together with typically Australasian flora. Typical Southern Hemisphere flora include the [[conifer]]s ''[[Podocarpus]]'' and the rainforest emergents ''[[Araucaria]]'' and ''[[Agathis]]'', as well as [[tree fern]]s and several species of ''Eucalyptus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/samples/australiaburningsample.pdf |title=Australia Burning: Fire Ecology, Policy and Management Issues |publisher=CSIRO Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many species, the primary refuge was the relatively cool and well-watered [[Great Dividing Range]]. Even today, pockets of remnant vegetation remain in the cool uplands, some species not much changed from the Gondwanan forms of 60 or 90 million years ago. Eventually, the Australia–New Guinea tectonic plate collided with the [[Eurasian plate]] to the north. The collision caused the northern part of the continent to buckle upwards, forming the high and rugged mountains of New Guinea and, by reverse (downwards) buckling, the [[Torres Strait]] that now separates the two main landmasses. The collision also pushed up the islands of [[Wallacea]], which served as island 'stepping-stones' that allowed plants from [[Southeast Asia]]'s rainforests to colonise New Guinea, and some plants from Australia–New Guinea to move into Southeast Asia. The ocean straits between the islands were narrow enough to allow plant dispersal, but served as an effective barrier to exchange of land mammals between Australia–New Guinea and Asia.

As the continent drifted north from Antarctica, a unique [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]], [[Flora (plants)|flora]] and [[Fungi|mycobiota]] developed. [[Marsupial]]s and [[monotreme]]s also existed on other continents, but only in Australia–New Guinea did they out-compete the [[Placentalia|placental]] [[mammals]] and come to dominate. New Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: monotremes, three orders of marsupials, [[rodent]]s and [[bat]]s; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has a rich diversity of [[coral]] life and 1,200 species of [[fish]] have been found. Also about 600 species of reef-building coral—the latter equal to 75 percent of the world’s known total. New Guinea has 578 species of breeding birds, of which 324 species are endemic.[[Aves|Bird]] life also flourished — in particular, the [[songbird]]s (order [[Passerine|Passeriformes]], suborder Passeri) are thought to have evolved 50 million years ago in the part of [[Gondwana]] that later became [[Australia]], New Zealand, [[New Guinea]], and [[Antarctica]], before radiating into a great number of different forms and then spreading around the globe.&lt;ref name=Low&gt;{{Citation

Animal groups such as [[Macropodidae|macropods]], [[monotremes]], and [[Cassowary|cassowaries]] are endemic to Australia. There were three main reasons for the enormous diversity that developed in animal, fungal and plant life.

* While much of the rest of the world underwent significant cooling and thus loss of species diversity, Australia–New Guinea was drifting north at such a pace that the overall global cooling effect was roughly equalled by its gradual movement toward the [[equator]]. [[Temperature]]s in Australia–New Guinea, in other words, remained reasonably constant for a very long time, and a vast number of different animal, fungal and plant species were able to evolve to fit particular [[ecological niche]]s.
* Because the continent was more isolated than any other, very few outside species arrived to colonise, and unique native forms developed unimpeded.
* Finally, despite the fact that the continent was already very old and thus relatively infertile, there are dispersed areas of high fertility. Where other continents had [[Volcanism|volcanic]] activity and/or massive [[Glacier|glaciation]] events to turn over fresh, unleached [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s rich in [[mineral]]s, the rocks and [[soil]]s of Australia–New Guinea were left largely untouched except by gradual [[erosion]] and deep [[weathering]]. In general, fertile soils produce a profusion of life, and a relatively large number of species/level of biodiversity. This is because where [[nutrient]]s are plentiful, competition is largely a matter of outcompeting rival species, leaving great scope for innovative [[co-evolution]] as is witnessed in tropical, fertile ecosystems. In contrast, infertile soils tend to induce competition on an abiotic basis meaning individuals all face constant environmental pressures, leaving less scope for divergent evolution, a process instrumental in creating new species.

Although New Guinea is the most northerly part of the continent, and could be expected to be the most [[tropical climate|tropical]] in climate, the altitude of the New Guinea highlands is such that a great many animals and plants that were once common across Australia–New Guinea now survive only in the tropical highlands where they are severely threatened by [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Australia}}
In New Guinea, the climate is mostly [[monsoonal]] (December to March), southeast monsoon (May to October), and [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]] with slight seasonal temperature variation. In lower altitudes, the temperature is around 80 °F (27 °C) year round. But the higher altitudes, such as [[Mendi]], are constantly around 70 °F (21 °C) with cool lows nearing 52 °F (11 °C), with abundant rainfall and high humidity. The [[New Guinea Highlands]] are one of the few regions close to the [[equator]] that experience [[snowfall]], which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland. Some areas in the island experience an extraordinary amount of precipitation, averaging roughly {{convert|4500|mm}} of rainfall annually.

The Australian landmass's climate is mostly [[desert]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], with the southern coastal corners having a [[Temperateness|temperate]] climate, such as [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] and [[humid subtropical]] climate in the east coast and [[Mediterranean climate]] in the west. The northern parts of the country have a [[tropical climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclim.html|title=BOM - Climate of Australia|first=National Climate|last=Centre|website=pandora.nla.gov.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclim.html|archivedate=2009-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Snow]] falls frequently on the [[Great Dividing Range|highlands]] near the east coast, in the states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]] and in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Temperatures in Australia have ranged from above {{convert|50|C}} to well below {{convert|0|C}}. Nonetheless, minimum temperatures are moderated. The [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] is associated with seasonal abnormality in many areas in the world. Australia is one of the continents most affected and experiences [[Drought in Australia|extensive drought]]s alongside considerable wet periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uwQ7FulHCCsC&amp;pg=PA376&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;dq=As+a+whole,+Australia+has+an+annual+average+rainfall+of+419+mm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SosQR1-8E8&amp;sig=KK7BIXo9B5NfI1xIwy6gmuQFb34&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a8CmT63jN_GViAet3fjYAw&amp;ved=0COYDEOgBMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=As%20a%20whole%2C%20Australia%20has%20an%20annual%20average%20rainfall%20of%20419%20mm&amp;f=false| title = Precipitation in Australia | work = Climates and Weather of Australia | publisher = Routledge | accessdate = 2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] came into being when the [[Constitution of Australia|Federal Constitution]] was proclaimed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Hopetoun]], on 1 January 1901. From that point a system of [[federalism in Australia]] came into operation, entailing the establishment of an entirely new national government (the Commonwealth government) and an ongoing division of powers between that government and the States. With the encouragement of Queensland, in 1884, a [[British protectorate]] had been proclaimed over the southern coast of New Guinea and its adjacent islands. [[British New Guinea]], was annexed outright in 1888. The possession was placed under the authority of the newly federated Commonwealth of Australia in 1902 and with passage of the Papua Act of 1905, British New Guinea became the Australian [[Territory of Papua]], with formal Australian administration beginning in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2797.htm |title=Papua New Guinea |publisher=State.gov |date=8 October 2010 |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Battle of Buna–Gona]], between November 1942 and January 1943, set the tone for the bitter final stages of the [[New Guinea campaign]], which persisted into 1945.

Migration brought large numbers of southern and central Europeans to Australia for the first time. A 1958 government leaflet assured readers that unskilled non-British migrants were needed for "labour on rugged projects ...work which is not generally acceptable to Australians or British workers".&lt;ref&gt;cited in Michael Dugan and Josef Swarc (1984) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papua New Guinea is rich in natural resources, which account for two thirds of their export earnings.

Papua New Guinea is a [[Commonwealth realm]]. As such, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] is its sovereign and head of state. The constitutional convention, which prepared the draft constitution, and Australia, the outgoing metropolitan power, had thought that Papua New Guinea would not remain a monarchy. The founders, however, considered that imperial honours had a cachet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Sarah |title=Elizabeth: A Biography of Britain's Queen |year=1997 |publisher=Riverhead Books |isbn=1-57322-600-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarch is represented by the [[Governor-General of Papua New Guinea]], currently [[Bob Dadae]]. Papua New Guinea (and the [[Solomon Islands]]) are unusual among Commonwealth realms in that governors-general are elected by the legislature, rather than chosen by the executive branch.

It is estimated that more than 7000 different cultural groups exist in Papua New Guinea, and most groups have their own language. Because of this diversity, in which they take pride, many different styles of cultural expression have emerged; each group has created its own expressive forms in [[art]], [[performance art]], [[weapon]]ry, [[costume]]s and [[architecture]]. Papua New Guinea is one of the few cultures in Oceania to practice the tradition of [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Papua New Guinea – culture |work=Datec Pty Ltd |url=http://www.datec.com.au/png/culture.htm |accessdate=16 December 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990210114159/http://www.datec.com.au/png/culture.htm |archivedate=10 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Papua New Guinea is world-famous for carved wooden [[sculpture]]: masks, canoes, story-boards.

Australia has a tradition of Aboriginal art which is thousands of years old, the best known forms being rock art and [[bark painting]].

'''Cristina Possas de Albuquerque''' (born 5 June 1948) is a [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] and [[emerging infectious disease]]s from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, N., "Epidemiology and the web of causation: has anyone seen the spider?" Social Science and Medicine 1994; 39:887–903&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KriegerNancy"&gt;Krieger, Nancy (2011). Epidemiology and the People's Health : Theory and Context. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199750351}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, her approach to social ecosystem complexity is quite different from the four-fold eco-social approach of Harvard's Nancy Krieger in that she has proposed in a 2001 English-language article in the ''Brazilian Journal of Public Health Reports'' the concept of "social ecosystem health" where ecosystems are increasingly changed by social human activity, favoring the emergence of diseases, so the term "social" should precede the prefix "eco".&lt;ref&gt;Possas, C. 2001. Social ecosystem health: confronting the complexity and emergence of infectious diseases. Cadernos de Saúde Pública (Brazilian Journal pf Public Health Reports) 17.1: 30-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Possas, C. 2001 Debate on the paper by David Waltner-Toews. Cadernos de Saúde Pública (''Brazilian Journal pf Public Health Reports''), 17, S27-S28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Levins, R. and Lopez C. "Toward an ecosocial view of health", ''International Journal of Health Services'' 29(2):261-293, 1999.  Her mentor and former colleague, Dr. [[Richard Levins]], had used the phrase "ecosocial view of health."&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, she is known for (a) developing her new conceptual approach to [[social epidemiology]], incorporating the economic concept of structural heterogeneity into an epidemiological model to identify the epidemiological profiles of heterogeneous populations in different social and economic strata and the conditions for emergence of diseases; (b) contributions of health policy and health reform in Brazil; and research on health transition, ecological change, complex systems, and emergence of new diseases.

She is a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University in Boston,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/fellowships/takemi-fellowship-program/ Takemi Program], [[Harvard T.H.

As a Brazilian Brazilian [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cristina Possas de Albuquerque (Cristina Possas) has as a policymaker long worked closely with public health and environmental scientists and with human rights and social justice civil organizations.

She also is a full professor at [[FIOCRUZ]] in Brazil, where in 1998 she had earned a PhD in [[public health]], and where she now does research on infectious diseases and teaches a course named "Scientific Methodology" in the Masters and Doctoral Programs.

She has been also a Professor of Health Policy at the National School of Public Health at the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]], Brazil.  She was nominated in 1987 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health/Fiocruz to be the National Technical Coordinator of seven Groups supporting the Health Reform in Brazil, whose contributions were later incorporated into the new Brazilian 1988 Constitution.

For a decade, she also has been a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University, a Visiting Scientist and [[Fulbright Fellowship|Fulbright Fellow]], and a member of the Harvard New Diseases Group, coordinated by the late [[Richard Levins]] and by [[Tamara Awerbuch-Friedlander]], collaborating with them and other outstanding members of the group in the organizing committee of the Woods Hole Conference on New Diseases, with articles with the group later published in a special supplement of the ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' on this conference and in other journals. She had held for 10 years a national position as the Head of the Research and Development Unit of the Brazilian National AIDS Program.

She has worked for more than five decades in several national and international positions with the scientific community and civil society organizations.  For ten years, she had been National Director of the Research and Technological Development Unit at the Brazilian [[AIDS]] Program in the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which has been recognized globally as an outstanding public health initiative with innovative approaches to the pandemics, always centering on free and universal access to prevention and treatment.  She was invited by the Director of the National AIDS Program to conceive and create a new and innovative Research and Technological Development Unit in the Program’s structure.

She has given interviews on [[AIDS]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqG-W1Xyoac Entrevista, Dr. Cristina Possas discusses AIDS, Dec 16, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[dengue fever|dengue]], and [[zika fever|zika]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Deglobalization''' or '''Deglobalisation''' is the process of diminishing interdependence and integration between certain units around the world, typically nation-states. It is widely used to describe the periods of history when economic trade and investment between countries decline. It stands in contrast to [[globalization]], in which units become increasingly integrated over time, and generally spans the time between periods of globalization. While globalization and deglobalisation are antitheses, they are no mirror images

The term of deglobalization has derived from some of the very profound change in many developed nations, where trade as a proportion of total economic activity until the 1970s was below previous peak levels in the early 1910s. This decline reflects that their economies become less integrated with the rest of the world economies in spite of the deepening scope of [[economic globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=New York University Department of Sociology|title=The Sociology Project|year=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-205-09382-3 |page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the  global level only two longer periods of deglobalization occurred, namely in the 1930s during the Great Depression and 2010s, when following the [[Great Trade Collapse]] the period of the World Trade Slowdown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoekman|first1=Bernhard|title=The Global Trade Slowdown: A New Normal?|date=2015|publisher=CEPR VOXEU|location=Florence ; European University Institute, 2015|url=https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/file/Global%20Trade%20Slowdown_nocover.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; set in. 
 
[[File:Openness of the world economy 1880-2020 (index numbers 2008=100).jpg|thumb|The graph shows two periods of deglobalization (1930s and 2010s) alongs side the trend increase inglobalization since 1880]]

The occurrence of deglobalization has strong proponents who have claimed the death of globalisation, but is also contested by leading academics such as Michael Bordo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bordo |first1=Michael |title=The Second Era of Globalization is Not Yet Over: An Historical Perspective |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23786 |date=September 2017 |doi=10.3386/w23786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that it is too soon to give a good diagnosis and Mervyn Martin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Mervyn|title=Keeping it Real: Debunking the Deglobalization Myth, Brexit, and Trump:-"Lessons" on Integration' ;|journal=Journal of International Trade Law and Policy|volume=17|pages=62–68|date=2018|doi=10.1108/JITLP-06-2017-0020|url=https://tees.openrepository.com/tees/handle/10149/621562|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that US and UK policies are rational answers to essential temporary problems of even strong nations

While as with globalization, deglobalization can refer to economic, trade, social, technological, cultural and political dimensions, much of the work that has been conducted in the study of deglobalization refers to the field of [[international economics]].

== 1930s versus 2010s ==

Periods of deglobalization have mainly been seen as interesting comparators to other periods, such as 1850–1914 and 1950–2007, in which globalization had been the norm, given that globalization is the norm for most people and because the interpretation of the global economy has mainly been framed as inevitably increasing integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livesey|first1=Finbarr.|title=Unpacking the possibilities of deglobalisation|journal=Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society|date=2018|volume=11|issue=1|pages=177–187|doi=10.1093/cjres/rsx030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even periods of stagnant international interaction are often wrongly seen as periods of deglobalization. Recently scientists, have started to also compare the major periods of deglobalization in order to better understand drivers and consequences of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O’Rourke|first1=Kevin Hjortshøj|title=Two Great Trade Collapses: The Interwar Period and Great Recession Compared.|journal=IMF Economic Review|volume=66|issue=3|pages=418–439|date=2018|doi=10.1057/s41308-017-0046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Bergeijk|first1=Peter A.G.|title=On the brink of Deglobalisation ... again|journal=Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society|date=2018|volume=11|issue=2|pages=59–72|doi=10.1093/cjres/rsx023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major phases of deglobalisation are not identical twins.The two phases of deglobalisation were equally triggered by a demand shock in the wake of a financial crisis. Both in the 1930s and in the 2000s the composition of trade was a second key determinant: manufacturing trade bore the brunt of the contraction. One important finding is that country experiences both during the Great Depression and Great Recession are very heterogeneous so that one-size-fits-all policies to counter negative impacts of deglobalization are inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bergeijk, Peter AG|author2=Steven Brakman|author3=Charles Marrewijk|title=Heterogeneous economic resilience and the great recession's world trade collapse.|journal=Papers in Regional Science|date=2017|volume=96|issue=1|pages=3–12|doi=10.1111/pirs.12279}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, democracies supported free trade, and deglobalisation was driven by autocratic decisions to strengthen self-sufficiency. In the 2010s, political institutions are just as significant, but now democratic decisions such as the election of President Trump with an America First agenda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Simon J. Evenett|author2=Johannes Fritz|title=Will Awe Trump Rules?|url=http://www.globaltradealert.org/reports/42|publisher=global trade alert|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brexit drive the deglobalisation process worldwide. Indeed, while the industrialised countries in the 2010s avoided the pitfalls of protectionism and deflation, they have experienced different political dynamics.

== Measures of deglobalization ==

As with globalization, economic deglobalization can be measured in different ways. These centre around the four main economic flows:
* Goods and services, e.g. exports plus imports as a proportion of [[national income]] or per head of population.
* Labour/people, e.g. net [[Human migration|migration rate]]s; inward or outward migration flows, weighted by population (and resultant remittances in per cent of GDP)
* Capital, e.g. inward or outward direct investment as a proportion of national income or per head of population
It is generally not thought possible to measure deglobalization through lack of flows of technology, the fourth main flow. 
Those areas that are measurable do suggest other possible measures, including:
* Average tariffs
* Border restrictions on labour
* [[Capital controls]], including restrictions on foreign direct investment or outward direct investment

The multi-dimensional globalization index of KOF Swiss Economic Institute shows a clear break for economic globalization in 2009 in 2015 KOF observed for its overall index: "The level of globalisation worldwide increased rapidly between 1990 and 2007 and has risen only slightly since the Great Recession. In 2015, globalisation decreased for the first time since 1975. The fall was due to the decline in economic globalisation, with social globalisation stagnating and political globalisation increasing slightly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=KOF|title=press-release/2018/01/kof-globalisation-index-globalisation-down-worldwide-in-2015|url=https://www.kof.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/media/press-releases/2018/01/kof-globalisation-index-globalisation-down-worldwide-in-2015.html|website=www.kof.ethz.ch|publisher=KOF|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other indicators of deglobalization include the development of Foreign Direct Investment, that according to UNCTAD slipped further in 2017 and in stark contrast with production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNCTAD|title=Global Investment Trends Monitor|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/diaeia2018d1_en.pdf|website=unctad.org|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks of deglobalization==
Typically a reduction of the level of international integration of economies (and the world economy at large) are expected to exert second round effects related to four feedback mechanisms:&lt;ref name="brink"&gt;Peter A.G. van Bergeijk, [http://deglobalization.blogspot.nl/ ''On the brink of Deglobalization'',] (Edward Elgar, 2010), {{ISBN|9781849804110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a reduction of (the rate of growth) of international trade will feed negatively into long-run growth
*a loss of interaction, the co-movement of economies,
*[[trade policy]] feedbacks in the sense that reduced international interaction and lower growth will stimulate [[protectionism]] and non-economic issue areas where reduced cooperation among countries and even an increasing risk of international conflict can be expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murshed|first1=s. mansoob|title=Challenges to the liberal peace|url=https://issblog.nl/2018/04/03/deglobalisation-series-challenges-to-the-liberal-peace-by-syed-mansoob-murshed/|website=BLISS|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== (International) political economy of deglobalization ==
Deglobalization has also been used as a political agenda item or a term in framing the debate on a new [[World economic order]], for example by [[Walden Bello]] in his 2005 book ''Deglobalization''.&lt;ref name="bello"&gt;Walden Bello, [http://us.macmillan.com/BookCustomPage.aspx?isbn=1842775456&amp;m_type=7 ''Deglobalization: Ideas for a New World Economy'',] (Zed books, 2005). {{ISBN|9781842775455}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the prominent examples of deglobalization movement could be found in the United States of America, where the Bush and Obama administration instituted [[Buy American Act]] clause as party of massive stimulus package, which was designed to favor American-made goods over traded goods. Likewise, the EU has imposed new subsidies to protect their agricultural sectors for their own protection. These movements of deglobalization can be seen as the example of how developed nations react to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]] through deglobalization movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Office of the Law Revision Counsel |url=http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t41t42+22+1++(41)%20%20AND%2 |publisher=US House of Representatives |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806135758/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t41t42+22+1++%2841%29%20%20AND%252 |archivedate=August 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently a change in the pattern of anti-globalism has been observed: anti-globalism now has a strong foothold in the Global North and among right-wing (conservative) politicians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rory Horner|author2=Daniel Haberly|author3=Seth Schindler|author4=Yuko Aoyama|title=How anti-globalisation switched from a left to a right-wing issue – and where it will go next|url=https://theconversation.com/how-anti-globalisation-switched-from-a-left-to-a-right-wing-issue-and-where-it-will-go-next-90587|website=The conversation|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with much different attitudes in the Global South, particular among the BRICS countries.

The '''Director of National Intelligence Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies''' was a review group formed by the [[Director of National Intelligence|Director of National Intelligence of the United States]] in light of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures of 2013]].  In December 2013, the five-member group produced a public report.  

==Formation==
On August 12, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] issued a Presidential Memorandum instructing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, to form a "Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies".  Obama instructed that "The Review Group will assess whether, in light of advancements in communications technologies, the United States employs its technical collection capabilities in a manner that optimally protects our national security and advances our foreign policy while appropriately accounting for other policy considerations, such as the risk of unauthorized disclosure and our need to maintain the public trust."

The memorandum called for an interim report within 60 days of establishment and a final report by December 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/909-dni-clapper-announces-review-group-on-intelligence-and-communications-technologies |title=DNI Clapper Announces Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies |publisher=Dni.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The group included former counter-terrorism czar [[Richard A. Clarke]], former Acting [[Central Intelligence Agency]] director [[Michael Morell]], [[University of Chicago]] Law professor [[Geoffrey Stone]], former administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs [[Cass Sunstein]] and former Chief Counselor for Privacy in the Office of Management and Budget [[Peter Swire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/intelligence-community/review-group |title=Review Group |publisher=Dni.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harding288"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|authorlink=Luke Harding|title=[[The Snowden Files|The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World's Most Wanted Man]]|date=2014|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=9780804173520|oclc=870337274|page=288|quote=The panel's chair was Michael Morrell, Obama's former deputy CIA director; two other members included Richard Clarke, a former counter-terrorism co-ordinator under Clinton and George W Bush, and Peter Swire, Clinton's privacy director. The panel enjoyed the lugubrious name, 'Director of National Intelligence Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Report==
{{expand section|date=February 2014}}
The 300-page report, entitled "Liberty and Security in a Changing World", was  released on December 12, 2013. It contained over 40 recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone |first=Geoffrey R. |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/116269/barack-obamas-nsa-speech-heres-how-i-grade-his-reforms |title=Barack Obama's NSA Speech: Here's How I Grade His Reforms |publisher=New Republic |date=2014-01-18 |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] released a statement criticizing the report, saying "we’re disappointed that the recommendations suggest a path to continue untargeted spying. Mass surveillance is still heinous, even if private company servers are holding the data instead of government data centers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/eff-statement-presidents-review-groups-nsa-report |title=EFF Statement on President's Review Group's NSA Report &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2013-12-18 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/NSA_report.pdf |title=A Critique of the Recoommendations by the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communication Technologies |publisher=Centerforsecuritypolicy.org |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duga''' ({{lang-rus|Дуга}}) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon]] (OTH) radar system used as part of the Soviet [[missile defense]] [[early-warning radar]] network. The system operated from July 1976 to December 1989. Two operational Duga radars were deployed, one near [[Chernobyl]] and [[Chernihiv]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]), the other in eastern [[Siberia]].

The Duga systems were extremely powerful, over 10&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] in some cases, and broadcast in the [[shortwave radio]] bands. They appeared without warning, sounding like a sharp, repetitive tapping noise at 10&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The "Russian" (sic) Woodpecker... A Closer Look | author = David L. Wilson | journal= Monitoring Times | date = Summer 1985 | url = http://www.brogers.dsl.pipex.com/Wpecker5.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to it being nicknamed by shortwave listeners the '''Russian Woodpecker'''. The random frequency hops disrupted legitimate broadcasts, [[amateur radio]] operations, oceanic commercial aviation communications, utility transmissions, and resulted in thousands of complaints by many countries worldwide. The signal became such a nuisance that some receivers such as amateur radios and televisions actually began including 'Woodpecker Blankers' in their circuit designs in an effort to filter out the interference.

The unclaimed signal was a source for much speculation, giving rise to theories such as Soviet [[mind control]] and [[weather control]] experiments. However, because of its distinctive transmission pattern, many experts and amateur radio hobbyists quickly realized it to be an over-the-horizon radar system.  [[NATO]] [[military intelligence]] had already given it the [[NATO reporting name|reporting name]] ''STEEL WORK'' or ''STEEL YARD''. While the amateur radio community was well aware of the system, this theory was not publicly confirmed until after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].

== History ==

===Genesis===
The Soviets had been working on [[early warning radar]] for their [[anti-ballistic missile]] systems through the 1960s, but most of these had been line-of-sight systems that were useful for raid analysis and interception only. None of these systems had the capability to provide early warning of a launch, within seconds or minutes of a launch, which would give the defences time to study the attack and plan a response. At the time, the Soviet early-warning [[satellite]] network was not well developed, and there were questions about their ability to operate in a hostile environment including anti-satellite efforts. An over-the-horizon radar sited in the USSR would not have any of these problems, and work on such a system for this associated role started in the late 1960s.

The first experimental system, Duga, was built outside [[Mykolaiv]] in [[Ukraine]], successfully detecting rocket launches from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] at 2,500 kilometers. This was followed by the prototype Duga, built on the same site, which was able to track launches from the far east and submarines in the Pacific Ocean as the missiles flew towards [[Novaya Zemlya]]. Both of these radar systems were aimed east and were fairly low power, but with the concept proven, work began on an operational system. The new Duga-1 systems used a transmitter and receiver separated by about 60&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="PodvigBook"&gt;{{Cite book

==="Russian Woodpecker"===
At some point in 1976, a new and powerful radio signal was detected simultaneously worldwide, and quickly dubbed 'the Woodpecker' by [[amateur radio]] operators. Transmission power on some Woodpecker transmitters was estimated to be as high as 10&amp;nbsp;MW [[equivalent isotropically radiated power]].&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;&lt;ref name=week/&gt; Even prior to 1976, a similar 'woodpecker' interference is remembered by radio amateurs occurring in the [[High frequency|high frequencies]]. As early as 1963, or before, radio amateurs were calling this "the Russian Woodpecker". Little is apparently known about the power levels or Russian designation but is probably a forerunner of the Duga radar systems. It was also speculated at that time, at least among radio amateurs, that this was an over-the-horizon radar.

[[Triangulation]] by both amateur radio hobbyists and NATO quickly revealed the signals came from a location in present day [[Ukraine]], at the time called [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (part of [[USSR]]). Confusion due to small differences in the reports being made from various sources led to the site being alternately located near [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]], [[Chernobyl]], [[Gomel]] or [[Chernihiv]]. All of these reports were describing the same deployment, with the transmitter only a few kilometers southwest of Chernobyl (south of Minsk, northwest of Kyiv) and the receiver about 50&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of Chernihiv, south of Gomel). At one time there was speculation that several transmitters were in use.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;

The radar system was given the code 5Н32-West by the Soviets, and was set up in two closed towns, Liubech-1 held the two transmitters and Chernobyl-2 the receivers.&lt;ref name=week&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newsweek.com/hunt-russian-woodpecker-246670 |title= The Massive Russian Radar Site in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone |first=Alexander |last=Nazaryan |date=18 April 2014 |journal=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to civilian observers at the time, [[NATO]] was aware of the new installation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} A second installation was built near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]], in Bolshya Kartel and Lian, but did not become active for some time.

===NATO Reporting Name===
The NATO Reporting Name for the Duga-1 is often quoted as STEEL YARD.  Many online and several print references use this name.  However some sources also use the term STEEL WORK (or STEEL WORKS).  As any "official" sources using NATO Reporting Names are likely to be classified, deconflicting this will be difficult.  The earliest found open source mention of a NATO Reporting Name for this system, a reference publication in print while the system was still active, unambiguously uses the term STEEL WORK.&lt;ref name="The International Countermeasures Handbook, 14th Edition"&gt;{{Cite book

===Civilian identification===
Even from the earliest reports it was suspected that the signals were tests of an [[over-the-horizon radar]],&lt;ref name=mystery&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Mystery Soviet over-the-horizon tests
 | journal= Wireless World

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this remained the most popular hypothesis during the [[Cold War]]. Several other theories were floated as well, including everything from jamming western broadcasts to [[Communication with submarines|submarine communications]]. The broadcast jamming theory was discarded early on when a monitoring survey showed that [[Radio Moscow]] and other pro-Soviet stations were just as badly affected by woodpecker interference as Western stations.

As more information about the signal became available, its purpose as a radar signal became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random binary sequence, with a bit-width of 100 μs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sequence is usable for a 100&amp;nbsp;μs chirped pulse amplification system, giving a resolution of 15&amp;nbsp;km (10&amp;nbsp;mi) (the distance light travels in 50&amp;nbsp;μs). When a second Woodpecker appeared, this one located in eastern Russia but also pointed toward the US and covering blank spots in the first system's pattern, this conclusion became inescapable.

In 1988, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) conducted a study on the Woodpecker signal. Data analysis showed an [[pulse repetition frequency|inter-pulse period]] of about 90&amp;nbsp;ms, a frequency range of 7 to 19&amp;nbsp;MHz, a bandwidth of 0.02 to 0.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, and typical transmission time of 7 minutes.
* The signal was observed using three repetition rates: 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, 16&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20&amp;nbsp;Hz.
* The most common rate was 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, while the 16&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20&amp;nbsp;Hz modes were rather rare.
* The pulses transmitted by the woodpecker had a wide bandwidth, typically 40&amp;nbsp;kHz.

===Jamming the Woodpecker===
[[File:Duga radar station within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine (09).JPG|thumb|upright|Steel structure of Duga-1 from the bottom]]

To combat this interference, amateur radio operators attempted to [[radio jamming|jam]] the signal by transmitting synchronized unmodulated continuous wave signals at the same pulse rate as the offending signal. They formed a club called The Russian Woodpecker Hunting Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Radio hams do battle with 'Russian Woodpecker' | author = Dave Finley | journal= The Miami Herald | date = 7 July 1982 | url = http://www.qsl.net/n1irz/woodpeck.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Core group members would frame the "Official Practice Target" in their radio shacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = RUSSIAN WOODPECKER HUNTING CLUB OFFICIAL PRACTICE TARGET | author = Brian Rogers | url = http://www.brogers.dsl.pipex.com/Wpecker3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
Starting in the late 1980s, even as the FCC was publishing studies, the signals became less frequent, and in 1989, they disappeared altogether. Although the reasons for the eventual shutdown of the Duga systems have not been made public, the changing strategic balance with the end of the [[Cold War]] in the late 1980s likely had a major part to play. Another factor was the success of the [[US-KS (satellite)|US-KS]] early-warning satellites, which began entering service in the early 1980s, and by this time had grown into a complete network. The satellite system provides immediate, direct and highly secure warnings, whereas any radar-based system is subject to jamming, and the effectiveness of OTH systems is also subject to atmospheric conditions.

According to some reports, the [[Komsomolsk-na-Amure]] installation in the [[Russian Far East]] was taken off combat alert duty in November 1989, and some of its equipment was subsequently scrapped. The original Duga-1 site lies within the 30 kilometer [[Zone of alienation|Zone of Alienation]] around the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl power plant]]. It appears to have been permanently deactivated, since their continued maintenance did not figure in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine over the active [[Dnepr radar|Dnepr]] early warning radar systems at Mukachevo and Sevastopol. The antenna still stands, however, and has been used by amateurs as a transmission tower (using their own antennas) and has been extensively photographed.

The original Duga was the first experimental system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/steel-yard.htm|title=Steel Yard OTH|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|author=John Pike|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ABM AND SPACE DEFENSE|author=A. Karpenko Nevsky Bastion|volume=No. 4|year=1999|pages=2–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was built outside the Black Sea port of [[Mykolaiv]] in the southern [[Ukraine]], and successfully detected rocket launches from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] about 2,500 kilometers away. Duga is able to track launches from the Far East and from submarines in the [[Pacific Ocean]], as the missiles fly towards [[Novaya Zemlya]] in the Arctic Ocean. This huge radar complex was restored in 2002 after a fire which seriously damaged it. The transmitter is located at {{coord|46|48|26|N|32|13|12|E}} and the receiver at {{Coord|47|02|28.33|N|32|11|57.29|E|}}.

The original Duga was supplanted by a pair of installations: western, Duga-1, and eastern, Duga-2. Duga-1 was built in northern Ukraine, between [[Liubech]] and [[Chernobyl]]-2, with the receiver at {{Coord|51|18|19.06|N|30|03|57.35|E|}} located a few kilometers west-north-west of Chernobyl; the transmitter is located at {{Coord|51|38|15.98|N|30|42|10.41|E|}} about 50&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of [[Chernihiv]], south of [[Gomel]]). The site is open for pre-arranged visits, for which a permit must be obtained in advance; it has been open since approximately 28 October 2013. Operators who provide tours of Chernobyl and the surrounding areas are able to obtain the relevant paperwork. 

Duga-2, the eastern system, is located near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] in [[Khabarovsk Krai]], with the receiver at {{Coord|50|23|07.98|N|137|19|41.87|E|}}, some 30&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the city, and the transmitter at {{Coord|50|53|34.66|N|136|50|12.38|E|}}, around 43&amp;nbsp;km north of the city.

== Appearances in media ==
The Ukrainian-developed computer game ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.]]'' has a plot focused on the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster|nuclear accident]] there. The game heavily features actual locations in the area, including the Duga-1 array. The array itself appears in ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky]]'' in the fictional city of Limansk-13. While the 'Brain Scorcher' from ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl]]'' was inspired by theories that Duga-1 was used for mind control, it does not take the form of the real array.

[[Markiyan Kamysh]]'s novel about [[Disaster tourism|illegal trips]] to the Duga, ''A Stroll to the Zone'', was praised by reviewers as the most interesting literature debut of 2015 in [[Ukraine]]. The novel has been translated into French (with the title ''La Zone''), and was published by French publishing house [[Groupe Flammarion|Arthaud (Groupe Flammarion)]].

In ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', the map "Grid" is placed in Pripyat near the DUGA-1 array.

In the movie ''[[Divergent (film)|Divergent]]'', the fence around Chicago is derived from photographs of the Duga-1 array.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.qrz.com/showthread.php?430504-The-quot-Woodpecker-quot-moves-to-fururistic-Chicago!

The 'Russian woodpecker' appears in Justin Scott's novel ''The Shipkiller''.

The Duga at Chernobyl was the focus of the 2015 documentary film, ''[[The Russian Woodpecker]]'', by Chad Gracia. The film includes interviews with the commander of the Duga, Vladimir Musiets, as well as the Vice-Commander, the Head of the Data Center, and others involved in building and operating the radar. The documentary, which won numerous awards, also includes drone video footage of the array and handheld video footage of the surroundings as well as a climb to the top by the cinematographer, Artem Ryzhykov. The film also proposes a [[conspiracy theory]] that the [[Chernobyl disaster]] was engineered to cover up failures in the radar's design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianwoodpecker.com/ The Russian Woodpecker documentary (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;  

A Duga radar is featured in the 2017 game ''[[Player Unknown's Battlegrounds]]'' in a map which portrays a fictional Russian Military base.

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|280px|Figure 1. A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA).]]

'''Ecosystem ecology''' is the integrated study of living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[Abiotic component|abiotic]]) components of [[ecosystem]]s and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This [[science]] examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as [[chemical]]s, [[bedrock]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s.

Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structures and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact with each other. Ultimately, this helps us understand how to maintain high quality water and economically viable commodity production. A major focus of ecosystem ecology is on functional processes, ecological mechanisms that maintain the structure and services produced by ecosystems. These include [[primary productivity]] (production of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]), [[decomposition]], and [[trophic level|trophic]] interactions.

Studies of ecosystem function have greatly improved human understanding of sustainable production of [[Fodder|forage]], [[fiber]], [[fuel]], and provision of [[water]]. Functional processes are mediated by regional-to-local level [[climate]], [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], and management. Thus ecosystem ecology provides a powerful framework for identifying ecological mechanisms that interact with global environmental problems, especially [[global warming]] and degradation of surface water.

This example demonstrates several important aspects of ecosystems:
# Ecosystem boundaries are often nebulous and may fluctuate in time
# Organisms within ecosystems are dependent on ecosystem level biological and physical processes
# Adjacent ecosystems closely interact and often are interdependent for maintenance of community structure and functional processes that maintain productivity and [[biodiversity]]

These characteristics also introduce practical problems into natural resource management. Who will manage which ecosystem? Will timber cutting in the forest degrade recreational fishing in the stream? These questions are difficult for land managers to address while the boundary between ecosystems remains unclear; even though decisions in one ecosystem will affect the other. We need better understanding of the interactions and interdependencies of these ecosystems and the processes that maintain them before we can begin to address these questions.

Ecosystem ecology is an inherently interdisciplinary field of study. An individual ecosystem is composed of [[populations]] of [[organisms]], interacting within communities, and contributing to the cycling of [[nutrients]] and the flow of [[energy]]. The ecosystem is the principal unit of study in ecosystem ecology.

Population, community, and physiological ecology provide many of the underlying biological mechanisms influencing ecosystems and the processes they maintain. Flowing of energy and cycling of matter at the ecosystem level are often examined in ecosystem ecology, but, as a whole, this science is defined more by subject matter than by scale. Ecosystem ecology approaches organisms and abiotic pools of energy and nutrients as an integrated system which distinguishes it from associated sciences such as [[biogeochemistry]].&lt;ref name= "CH 03"&gt;Chapman, S.K., Hart, S.C., Cobb, N.S., Whitham, T.G., and Koch, G.W.  (2003).  "Insect herbivory increases litter quality and decomposition: an extension of the acceleration hypothesis". in: ''Ecology'' 84:2867-2876.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogeochemistry and [[hydrology]] focus on several fundamental ecosystem processes such as biologically mediated chemical cycling of nutrients and physical-biological cycling of water. Ecosystem ecology forms the mechanistic basis for regional or global processes encompassed by landscape-to-regional hydrology, global biogeochemistry, and earth system science.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;

== History ==
Ecosystem ecology is philosophically and historically rooted in terrestrial ecology. The ecosystem concept has evolved rapidly during the last 100 years with important ideas developed by [[Frederic Clements]], a botanist who argued for specific definitions of ecosystems and that physiological processes were responsible for their development and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, J.B. (1992). ''An Entangled Bank: The origins of ecosystem ecology''. Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of Clements ecosystem definitions have been greatly revised, initially by [[Henry Gleason]] and [[Arthur Tansley]], and later by contemporary ecologists, the idea that physiological processes are fundamental to ecosystem structure and function remains central to ecology.

[[Image:Silver Spring Model.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 3. Energy and matter flows through an ecosystem, adapted from the Silver Springs model.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, H.T. (1971). ''Environment, Power, and Society''. Wiley-Interscience New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; H are herbivores, C are carnivores, TC are top carnivores, and D are decomposers. Squares represent biotic pools and ovals are fluxes or energy or nutrients from the system.]] Later work by [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Howard T. Odum]] quantified flows of energy and matter at the ecosystem level, thus documenting the general ideas proposed by Clements and his contemporary [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]]. See Figure 3.

In this model, energy flows through the whole system were dependent on biotic and abiotic interactions of each individual component ([[species]], inorganic pools of nutrients, etc.). Later work demonstrated that these interactions and flows applied to nutrient cycles, changed over the course of [[ecological succession|succession]], and held powerful controls over ecosystem productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, E.P 1969. "The strategy of ecosystem development". in: ''Science'' 164:262-270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="L70"&gt;Likens, G. E., F. H. Bormann, N. M. Johnson, D. W. Fisher and R. S. Pierce. (1970). "Effects of forest cutting and herbicide treatment on nutrient budgets in the Hubbard Brook watershed-ecosystem". in: ''Ecological Monographs'' 40:23-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Transfers of energy and nutrients are innate to ecological systems regardless of whether they are aquatic or terrestrial. Thus, ecosystem ecology has emerged from important biological studies of plants, animals, [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]], and [[marine (ocean)|marine]] ecosystems.

==Ecosystem services==
Ecosystem services are ecologically mediated functional processes essential to sustaining healthy [[human]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F.S. III, B.H., Walker, R.J., Hobbs, D.U., Hooper, J.H., Lawton, O.E., Sala, and D., Tilman. (1997). "Biotic control over the functioning of ecosystems". in: ''Science'' 277:500-504.&lt;/ref&gt; Water provision and filtration, production of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fisheries]], and removal of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the [[atmosphere]] are examples of ecosystem services essential to [[public health]] and economic opportunity. Nutrient cycling is a process fundamental to agricultural and forest production.

However, like most ecosystem processes, nutrient cycling is not an ecosystem characteristic which can be “dialed” to the most desirable level. Maximizing production in degraded systems is an overly simplistic solution to the complex problems of hunger and economic security. For instance, intensive [[fertilizer]] use in the midwestern United States has resulted in degraded fisheries in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Defries, R.S., J.A. Foley, and G.P. Asner. (2004). "Land-use choices: balancing human needs and ecosystem function". in: ''Frontiers in ecology and environmental science''. 2:249-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Regrettably, a “[[Green Revolution]]” of intensive chemical fertilization has been recommended for agriculture in [[developed countries|developed]] and [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Chrispeels, M.J. and Sadava, D. (1977). ''Plants, food, and people''. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quinones, M.A., N.E. Borlaug, C.R. Dowswell. (1997). "A fertilizer-based green revolution for Africa". In: ''Replenishing soil fertility in Africa''. Soil Science Society of America special publication number 51. Soil Science Society of America, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies risk alteration of ecosystem processes that may be difficult to restore, especially when applied at broad scales without adequate assessment of impacts. Ecosystem processes may take many years to recover from significant disturbance.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt;

For instance, large-scale forest clearance in the northeastern United States during the 18th and 19th centuries has altered soil texture, dominant vegetation, and nutrient cycling in ways that impact forest productivity in the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, D. R. (1992). "Land-use history (1730-1990) and vegetation dynamics in central New England, USA". In: ''Journal of Ecology'' 80: 753-772.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motzkin, G., D. R. Foster, A. Allen, J. Harrod, and R. D. Boone. (1996). "Controlling site to evaluate history: vegetation patterns of a New England sand plain". In: ''Ecological Monographs'' 66: 345-365.&lt;/ref&gt; An appreciation of the importance of ecosystem function in maintenance of productivity, whether in agriculture or forestry, is needed in conjunction with plans for restoration of essential processes. Improved knowledge of ecosystem function will help to achieve long-term sustainability and stability in the poorest parts of the world.

==Operation==
Biomass productivity is one of the most apparent and economically important ecosystem functions. Biomass accumulation begins at the cellular level via photosynthesis. Photosynthesis requires water and consequently global patterns of annual biomass production are correlated with annual precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;Huxman TE, ea.(2004). "Convergence across biomes to a common rain-use efficiency". ''Nature''. 429: 651-654&lt;/ref&gt; Amounts of productivity are also dependent on the overall capacity of plants to capture sunlight which is directly correlated with plant leaf area and N content.

[[Primary production|Net primary productivity]] (NPP) is the primary measure of biomass accumulation within an ecosystem. Net primary productivity can be calculated by a simple formula where the total amount of productivity is adjusted for total productivity losses through maintenance of biological processes:

:NPP = GPP – R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure4.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 4. Seasonal and annual changes in ambient carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration at Mauna Loa Hawaii (Atmosphere) and above the canopy of a deciduous forest in Massachusetts (Forest). Data show clear seasonal trends associated with periods of high and low NPP and an overall annual increase of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Data approximates of those reported by Keeling and Whorf&lt;ref&gt;Keeling, C.D. and T.P. Whorf. (2005). "Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; records from sites in the SIO air sampling network". In: ''Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change''. Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn., U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barford.&lt;ref name = "B01"/&gt;]] Where GPP is gross primary productivity and R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt; is photosynthate ([[Carbon]]) lost via [[cellular respiration]].

NPP is difficult to measure but a new technique known as eddy co-variance has shed light on how natural ecosystems influence the atmosphere. Figure 4 shows seasonal and annual changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration measured at [[Mauna Loa]], [[Hawaii]] from 1987 to 1990. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration steadily increased, but within-year variation has been greater than the annual increase since measurements began in 1957.

These variations were thought to be due to seasonal uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during summer months.  A newly developed technique for assessing ecosystem NPP has confirmed seasonal variation are driven by seasonal changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake by vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Goulden, M. L., J. W. Munger, S.-M. Fan, B. C. Daube, and S. C. Wofsy, (1996). "Effects of interannual climate variability on the carbon dioxide exchange of a temperate deciduous forest". In: ''Science'' 271:1576-1578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "B01"&gt;Barford, C. C., ea. (2001). "Factors controlling long and short term sequestration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a mid-latitude forest". In: ''Science'' 294: 1688-1691&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led many scientists and policy makers to speculate that ecosystems can be managed to ameliorate problems with [[global warming]]. This type of management may include reforesting or altering forest harvest schedules for many parts of the world.

===Decomposition and nutrient cycling===
[[Decomposition]] and nutrient cycling are fundamental to ecosystem biomass production. Most natural ecosystems are [[nitrogen]] (N) limited and biomass production is closely correlated with N turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Vitousek, P.M. and Howarth, R.W. (1991). "Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: how can it occur?" In: ''Biogeochemistry'' 13:87-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reich, P.B., Grigal, D.F., Aber, J.D., Gower, S.T. (1997). "Nitrogen mineralization and productivity in 50 hardwood and conifer stands on diverse soils". In: ''Ecology'' 78:335-347.&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically external input of nutrients is very low and efficient recycling of nutrients maintains productivity.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt; Decomposition of plant litter accounts for the majority of nutrients recycled through ecosystems (Figure 3). Rates of plant litter decomposition are highly dependent on litter quality; high concentration of phenolic compounds, especially [[lignin]], in plant litter has a retarding effect on litter decomposition.&lt;ref name= "M 82"&gt;Melillo, J.M., Aber, J.D., and Muratore, J.F. (1982).  "Nitrogen and lignin control of hardwood leaf litter decomposition dynamics". In: ''Ecology'' 63:621-626.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hättenschwiler S. and P.M. Vitousek (2000). "The role of polyphenols in terrestrial ecosystem nutrient cycling". In: ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 15: 238-243&lt;/ref&gt; More complex C compounds are decomposed more slowly and may take many years to completely breakdown. Decomposition is typically described with [[exponential decay]] and has been related to the mineral concentrations, especially manganese, in the leaf litter.&lt;ref&gt;Davey MP, B Berg, P Rowland, BA Emmett. 2007. Decomposition of oak leaf litter is related to initial litter Mn concentrations. Canadian Journal of Botany. 85(1). 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg B, Davey MP, Emmett B, Faituri M, Hobbie S, Johansson MB, Liu C, De Marco A, McClaugherty C, Norell L, Rutigliano F, De Santo AV. 2010. Factors influencing limit values for pine needle litter decomposition - a synthesis for boreal and temperate pine forest systems. Biogeochemistry. 100: 57-73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure5.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 5. Dynamics of decomposing plant litter (A) described with an exponential model (B) and a combined exponential-linear model (C).]]  
Globally, rates of decomposition are mediated by litter quality and climate.&lt;ref&gt;Meentemeyer, V.  1978  "Macroclimate and lignin control of litter decomposition rates". in: ''Ecology'' 59:465-472.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems dominated by plants with low-lignin concentration often have rapid rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling (Chapin et al. 1982). Simple carbon (C) containing compounds are preferentially metabolized by [[decomposer]] microorganisms which results in rapid initial rates of decomposition, see Figure 5A,&lt;ref&gt;Aber, J.D., and J.M., Melillo  (1982). "Nitrogen immobilization in decaying hardwood leaf litter as a function of initial nitrogen and lignin content". In: ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 60:2263-2269.&lt;/ref&gt; models that depend on constant rates of decay; so called “k” values, see Figure 5B.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J.S. (1963). "Energy storage and the balance of producers and decomposers in ecological systems". In: ''Ecology'' 44:322-331.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to litter quality and climate, the activity of soil fauna is very important &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Castro-Huerta, R. |author2=Falco, L. |author3=Sandler, R. |author4=Coviella, C. |year=2015 |title=Differential contribution of soil biota groups to plant litter decomposition as mediated by soil use |journal=[[PeerJ]] |volume=3 |pages=e826 |doi=10.7717/peerj.826 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/826/?td=wk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these models do not reflect simultaneous linear and non-linear decay processes which likely occur during decomposition. For instance, [[proteins]], [[sugars]] and [[lipids]] decompose exponentially, but lignin decays at a more linear rate&lt;ref name= "M 82"/&gt; Thus, litter decay is inaccurately predicted by simplistic models.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.A. (1981). "Decay of heterogeneous detritus: a general model". In: ''Journal of theoretical biology''  89:539-547.&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple alternative model presented in Figure 5C shows significantly more rapid decomposition that the standard model of figure 4B. Better understanding of decomposition models is an important research area of ecosystem ecology because this process is closely tied to nutrient supply and the overall capacity of ecosystems to sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere.

===Trophic dynamics===
Trophic dynamics refers to process of energy and [[nutrient]] transfer between organisms. Trophic dynamics is an important part of the structure and function of ecosystems. Figure 3 shows energy transferred for an ecosystem at Silver Springs, Florida. Energy gained by primary producers (plants, P) is consumed by herbivores (H), which are consumed by carnivores (C), which are themselves consumed by “top- carnivores”(TC).

One of the most obvious patterns in Figure 3 is that as one moves up to higher [[trophic level]]s (i.e. from plants to top-carnivores) the total amount of energy decreases. Plants exert a “bottom-up” control on the energy structure of ecosystems by determining the total amount of energy that enters the system.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin F.S. III, Matson, P.A., and Mooney, H.A. (2003). ''Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology''. Springer-Verlag, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, predators can also influence the structure of lower trophic levels from the top-down. These influences can dramatically shift dominant species in terrestrial and marine systems&lt;ref&gt;Belovsky, G.E. and J.B. Slade. (2000). "Insect herbivory accelerates nutrient cycling and increases plant production". In: ''Proceedings of the national academy of sciences'' (USA). 97:14412-14417.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"&gt;Frank et al. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay and relative strength of top-down vs. bottom-up controls on ecosystem structure and function is an important area of research in the greater field of ecology.

Trophic dynamics can strongly influence rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling in time and in space. For example, herbivory can increase litter decomposition and nutrient cycling via direct changes in litter quality and altered dominant vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.D. (2001). "Insect population dynamics meets ecosystem ecology: effects of herbivory on soil nutrient dynamics". In: ''Agricultural and Forest Entomology'' 3:77-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Insect herbivory has been shown to increase rates of decomposition and nutrient turnover due to changes in litter quality and increased [[frass]] inputs.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swank, W.T., Waide, J.B., Crossley, D.A., and Todd R.L. (1981). "Insect defoliation enhances nitrate export from forest ecosystems". In: ''Oecologia'' 51:297-299.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
However, insect outbreak does not always increase nutrient cycling. Stadler&lt;ref&gt;Stadler, B., Solinger, St., and Michalzik, B. (2001). "Insect herbivores and the nutrient flow from the canopy to the soil in coniferous and deciduous forests". In: ''[[Oecologia]]'' 126:104-113&lt;/ref&gt; showed that C rich honeydew produced during aphid outbreak can result in increased N immobilization by soil microbes thus slowing down nutrient cycling and potentially limiting biomass production. North atlantic marine ecosystems have been greatly altered by overfishing of cod. Cod stocks crashed in the 1990s which resulted in increases in their prey such as shrimp and snow crab&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"/&gt; Human intervention in ecosystems has resulted in dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function. These changes are occurring rapidly and have unknown consequences for economic security and human well-being.

==Applications and importance==

===Lessons from two Central American cities===
The biosphere has been greatly altered by the demands of human societies. Ecosystem ecology plays an important role in understanding and adapting to the most pressing current environmental problems. Restoration ecology and ecosystem management are closely associated with ecosystem ecology. Restoring highly degraded resources depends on integration of functional mechanisms of ecosystems.&lt;ref name= "E&amp;T97"&gt;Ehrenfeld, J.G. and Toth, L.A. (1997). "Restoration ecology and the ecosystem perspective". in: ''Restoration Ecology''  5:307-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without these functions intact, economic value of ecosystems is greatly reduced and potentially dangerous conditions may develop in the field. For example, areas within the mountainous western highlands of [[Guatemala]] are more susceptible to catastrophic landslides and crippling seasonal water shortages due to loss of forest resources. In contrast, cities such as [[Totonicapán]] that have preserved forests through strong social institutions have greater local economic stability and overall greater human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Conz, B.W. 2004. Continuity and Contestation: Conservation Landscapes in Totonicapán, Guatemala. University of Massachusetts Masters of Science thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is striking considering that these areas are close to each other, the majority of inhabitants are of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] descent, and the topography and overall resources are similar. This is a case of two groups of people managing resources in fundamentally different ways. Ecosystem ecology provides the basic science needed to avoid degradation and to restore ecosystem processes that provide for basic human needs.

The '''English Wikipedia''' is the [[English language|English-language]] edition of the free online encyclopedia [[Wikipedia]]. Founded on 15 January 2001, it is the first edition of Wikipedia and, {{As of|2017|11|lc=y}}, has [[list of Wikipedias|the most articles of any of the editions]].&lt;ref&gt;about 50 percent more than the next in rank, the [[Swedish Wikipedia]]. See [[:m:List of Wikipedias]].&lt;/ref&gt; As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, {{Percentage|{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|en}}|{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|total}}}} of articles in all Wikipedias belong to the English-language edition. This share has gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003, due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Wikipedias&amp;oldid=520778 |title=List of Wikipedias |author=Wikimedia Meta-Wiki |date=21 September 2008 |accessdate=21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there are [[Special:Statistics|{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}]] articles on the site.&lt;ref&gt;The number of articles on the English Wikipedia is shown by the [[MediaWiki]] variable &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with all Wikipedias as total &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|total}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{formatnum:{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|total}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the combined text of the English Wikipedia's articles totalled 11.5 [[gigabyte]]s when compressed.&lt;ref&gt;See size of downloads at [[Wikipedia:Database download]] and a list of historical sizes [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedia_article_size_in_gigabytes.png#Summary here]&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 November 2015, the English Wikipedia announced it had reached 5,000,000 articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia:Five million articles|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_million_articles|website=Wikipedia|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran a special logo to reflect the milestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=File:Wikipedia-logo-v2-en 5m articles.png|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedia-logo-v2-en_5m_articles.png|website=Wikimedia Commons|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Simple English Wikipedia]] is a variation in which most of the articles use only basic English vocabulary. There is also the [[Old English|Old English (Ænglisc/Anglo-Saxon)]] Wikipedia ([[:ang:Hēafodtramet|angwiki]]). Community-produced news publications include ''[[The Signpost]]''.&lt;ref name=AyersMatthews2008/&gt;

== Pioneering edition ==

{{See also|Wikipedia:Milestones}}

The English Wikipedia was the first Wikipedia edition and has remained the largest. It has pioneered many ideas as conventions, policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas include "featured articles",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_articles&amp;oldid=104207677 | title=Featured articles | author=English Wikipedia | date=30 January 2007 | accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the neutral-point-of-view policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view&amp;oldid=103033132 | title=Neutral point of view | author=English Wikipedia | date=25 January 2007 | accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; navigation templates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Help:Template&amp;oldid=520481 | title=Help:Template | author=Wikimedia Meta-Wiki | date=29 January 2007 | accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting&amp;oldid=101829026 | title=WikiProject Stub sorting | author=English Wikipedia | date=19 January 2007 | accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dispute resolution]] mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Resolving_disputes&amp;oldid=103577785 | title=Resolving disputes | author=English Wikipedia | date=27 January 2007 | accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and weekly collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Article_Creation_and_Improvement_Drive&amp;oldid=104243512|title=Article Creation and Improvement Drive|author=English Wikipedia|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Wikipedia has adopted features from Wikipedias in other languages. These features include verified revisions from the German Wikipedia ([[:de:Wikipedia:Hauptseite|dewiki]]) and town population-lookup templates from the [[Dutch Wikipedia]] ([[:nl:Hoofdpagina|nlwiki]]).

Although the English Wikipedia stores images and audio files, as well as text files, many of the images have been moved to [[Wikimedia Commons]] with the same name, as passed-through files. However, the English Wikipedia also has [[fair-use]] images and audio/video files (with copyright restrictions), most of which are not allowed on Commons.

Many of the most active participants in the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], and the developers of the [[MediaWiki]] software that powers Wikipedia, are English users.

The English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007,&lt;ref name="4,564,000"&gt;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2007-04-02/News and notes]]. Retrieved 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; just a little over a year since it had crossed a threshold of 1,000,000 registered user accounts in late February 2006.&lt;ref name="1,000,000"&gt;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2006-02-27/News and notes]]. Retrieved 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 800,000 editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm#wikipedians |title=Wikipedia Statistics – Tables – English |publisher=Stats.wikimedia.org |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 300,000 editors edit Wikipedia every month;{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} of these, over 30,000 perform more than 5 edits per month, and a little over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm#activitylevels |title=Wikipedia Statistics – Tables – English |publisher=Stats.wikimedia.org |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 24 November 2011, a total of 500 million edits had been performed on the English Wikipedia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

As the largest Wikipedia edition, and because English is such a widely used language, the English Wikipedia draws many users and editors whose [[native language]] is not English. Such users may seek information from the English Wikipedia rather than the Wikipedia of their native language because the English Wikipedia tends to contain more information about general subjects. Successful collaborations have been developed between non-native English speakers who successfully add content to the English Wikipedia and native English speakers who act as copyeditors for them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Arbitration committee ===
{{Main|Arbitration Committee}}
The English Wikipedia has an arbitration committee (also known as ArbCom) that consists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disputes between other editors of the online encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="AU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/democracy-for-knowalls/2006/11/30/1164777721624.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=Know-alls |accessdate= 15 June 2009 |last=Schiff |first=Stacy | authorlink=Stacy Schiff |date=2 December 2006 |work=[[The Age]] |location=Australia |publisher=Fairfax Digital Network }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was created by [[Jimmy Wales]] on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making power he had formerly held as owner of the site.&lt;ref name="Wales1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markmail.org/message/komcldyapats43xj#query:+page:1+mid:komcldyapats43xj+state:results |title= WikiEN-l Wikiquette committee appointments |accessdate=9 June 2009 |last=Wales |first=Jimmy |date=4 December 2003 |work=Wikipedia |publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRN"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wikitruth Through Wikiorder |journal=[[Emory Law Journal]]|year=2010|first=David A.|last=Hoffman|author2=Salil Mehra |volume=59|issue=2010|ssrn=1354424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When initially founded, the committee consisted of 12 [[arbitrators]] divided into three groups of four members each.&lt;ref name="Wales1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/31/magazines/fortune/mysql_greatteams_fortune/index.htm |title=Secrets of Greatness: Great Teams |accessdate= 15 June 2009 |last=Hyatt |first=Josh |date=1 June 2006 |work=Fortune |publisher=[[Time Warner]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the committee has gradually expanded its membership to 18 arbitrators.&lt;ref name="Wales2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;oldid=259248025 |title=ArbCom Appointments |accessdate=14 June 2009 |last=Wales |first=Jimmy |date= 20 December 2008 |work=Wikipedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=One of the 18 had retired|date=September 2014}}

As with other aspects of the English Wikipedia, some of Wikipedia's sister projects have emulated the arbitration committee with their own similar versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q3999572&amp;oldid=163359767#sitelinks-wikipedia|title=Wikipedia sitelinks for Arbitration Committee|author=Wikidata|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in 2007, an arbitration committee was founded on the [[German Wikipedia]] called the {{Interlanguage link multi|Schiedsgericht|de}}.&lt;ref name="dewiki-2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/Wikipedia-sucht-Schiedsrichter--/meldung/89083 |title=Wikipedia sucht Schiedsrichter |accessdate= 9 June 2009 |last=Kleinz |first=Torsten |date= 30 April 2007 |publisher=heise online |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
{{Main|Criticism of Wikipedia}}
{{See also|Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident|Essjay controversy}}

=== Threats against high schools ===
Several incidents of threats of violence against high schools on Wikipedia have been reported in the mainstream press.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/29/local/me-wikipedia29 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Molly | last=Hennessy-Fiske | title=Wikipedia threats went unchecked – Los Angeles Times | date=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCLocal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6087243 |title=Hacienda Heights school receives possible threat | website=abc7.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=18 April 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Student arrested for violent threats on Wikipedia |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/04/wiki.html?cid=6a00d8341c630a53ef011571abd811970b |work=Los Angeles Times |date=29 April 2008 |accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Glen A. Wilson High School]] was the subject of such a threat in 2008,&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCLocal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes2" /&gt; and a 14-year-old was arrested for making a threat against [[Niles West High School]] on Wikipedia in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/news/article_baef01f3-e56f-52e1-b9af-e90eb83e811b.html|title=Teen charged after threat to school on Wikipedia|date=31 October 2006|agency=Associated Press  |publisher=Pantagraph.com|accessdate=26 January 2011|location=Bloomington, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disputed articles ===
A 2013 study from [[Oxford University]] concluded that the most disputed articles on the English Wikipedia tended to be broader issues, while on other language Wikipedias the most disputed articles tended to be regional issues; this is due to the English language's status as a global ''[[lingua franca]]'', which means that many who edit the English Wikipedia [[English as a second language|do not speak English as a native language]].{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}  The study stated that the most disputed entries on the English Wikipedia were: [[George W. Bush]], [[anarchism]], [[Muhammad]], [[list of WWE personnel]], [[global warming]], [[circumcision]], [[United States]], [[Jesus]], [[race and intelligence]], and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;Gross, Doug. "[http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/24/tech/web/controversial-wikipedia-pages/index.html?hpt=hp_t5 Wiki wars: The 10 most controversial Wikipedia pages]." ''[[CNN]]''. 24 July 2013. Retrieved on 26 July 2013. {{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/24/tech/web/controversial-wikipedia-pages/index.html?hpt=hp_t5 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412001130/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/24/tech/web/controversial-wikipedia-pages/index.html?hpt=hp_t5 |archivedate=12 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Varieties of English ===
One controversy in the English Wikipedia concerns which [[List of dialects of the English language|national variety]] of the English language is to be preferred, with the most commonly advocated candidates being [[American English]] and [[British English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28spelling%29|title=Wikipedia:Manual of Style (spelling)|author=English Wikipedia|accessdate=25 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perennial suggestions range from standardizing upon a single form of English to [[fork (software)|forking]] the English Wikipedia project. A style guideline states, "the English Wikipedia has no general preference for a major national variety of the language" and "an article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate variety of English for that nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English|title=Wikipedia:Manual of Style|author=English Wikipedia|accessdate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article should use spelling and grammar variants consistently; for example, ''color'' and ''colour'' are not to be used in the same article, since they represent American and British English, respectively. The guide also states that an article must remain in its original national variant.

There has been a [[Chinese Wikipedia#Automatic conversion between traditional and simplified Chinese characters|similar issue in the Chinese-language Wikipedia]] concerning regional differences in writing. Efforts toward a language fork for [[Portuguese Wikipedia]] have failed, but those regarding [[Norwegian Wikipedia]] succeeded.

[[Andrew Lih]] wrote that the English Wikipedia "didn't have the chance to go through a debate over whether there should be a British English Wikipedia or an American English Wikipedia" because the English Wikipedia was the original edition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lih|Lih]], p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=How does being the original edition prevent debate?|date=February 2015}} Editors agreed to use U.S. spellings for primarily American topics and British spellings for primarily British topics. In 2009 Lih wrote, "No doubt, American spellings tend to dominate by default just because of sheer numbers."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lih|Lih]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wikiprojects, and assessments of articles' importance and quality ==
&lt;!-- This section is transcluded into [[Wikipedia]]; please do not change this section's heading without also changing the selective transclusion markup in that article --&gt;
{{Main|WikiProject}}

A "[[WikiProject]]" is a [[social group|group]] of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus on a specific topic area (for example, [[women's history]]), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages). The English Wikipedia currently has over [[Wikipedia:Database reports/WikiProjects by changes|2,000 WikiProjects]] and activity varies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject | title=Wikipedia: Wikiprojects | accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles.&lt;ref name="WP 1.0 editorial team 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Assessment|title=Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment|accessdate=28 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles are rated by WikiProjects. The range of quality classes begins with "Stub" (very short pages), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" (in increasing order of quality). Community peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality classes: either "[[WP:Good articles|good article]]", "A" or the highest, "[[WP:Featured articles|featured article]]". Of the about 4.4 million articles and lists assessed as of March 2015, a little more than 5,000 (0.12%) are featured articles, and fewer than 2,000 (0.04%) are featured lists. One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the [[main page]] of Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="FMonday feat article patterns 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2365/2182|title=Comparing featured article groups and revision patterns correlations in Wikipedia|publisher=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBM feat articles hidden pattern 1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/papers/hidden_order_wikipedia.pdf|author1=Fernanda B. Viégas |author2=Martin Wattenberg |author3=Matthew M. McKeon |title=The Hidden Order of Wikipedia|publisher=Visual Communication Lab, IBM Research|date=22 July 2007|format=PDF|accessdate=30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles can also be rated as per "importance" as judged by a WikiProject. Currently, there are 5 importance categories: "low", "mid", "high", "top", and "???" for unclassified/uncertain level. For a particular article, different WikiProjects may assign different importance levels.

The [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team|Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team]] has developed a table (shown below) that displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the English Wikipedia. ''If an article or list receives different ratings by two or more WikiProjects, then the highest rating is used in the table, pie-charts, and bar-chart''. The software regularly auto-updates the data.

Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of a few editors.&lt;ref name="Poderi Giacomo feat articles 1"&gt;Poderi, Giacomo, ''Wikipedia and the Featured Articles: How a Technological System Can Produce Best Quality Articles'', Master thesis, [[University of Maastricht]], October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study found unevenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles.&lt;ref name="FMonday WP quality control 1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/2721/2482|title=Evaluating quality control of Wikipedia's featured articles|first=David|last=Lindsey|journal=First Monday|volume=15|issue=4|date=5 April 2010|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic quality assessment of Wikipedia articles is a known and wide scientific problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikipediaquality.com/wiki/Wikipedia_Quality Wikipedia Quality]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as measures for assessing quality, it can be taken into the account number of the references, text length, number of images, sections, articles popularity and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=Włodzimierz |last2=Węcel |first2=Krzysztof |last3=Abramowicz |first3=Witold |date=2017-12-08 |title=Relative Quality and Popularity Evaluation of Multilingual Wikipedia Articles |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9709/4/4/43 |journal=Informatics |volume=4|issue=4 |pages= |doi=10.3390/informatics4040043 |access-date=2018-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Europe''' is a [[continent]] located entirely in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and mostly in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. It is bordered by the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south. It comprises the westernmost part of [[Eurasia]].

Since around 1850, Europe is most commonly considered to be [[Borders of the continents#Europe and Asia|separated from Asia]] by the [[drainage divide|watershed divides]] of the [[Ural Mountains|Ural]] and [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Ural River]], the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] Seas and the waterways of the [[Turkish Straits]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeoAtlas"&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=7th|year=1999|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} "Europe" (pp. 68–69); "Asia" (pp. 90–91): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe&amp;nbsp;... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "continent" implies [[physical geography]], the land border is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]]. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The border does not follow political boundaries, with [[Turkey]], [[Russia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] being [[list of transcontinental countries|transcontinental countries]].

Europe covers about {{convert|10,180,000|km2|sqmi}}, or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|fifty sovereign states]] of which the [[Russian Federation]] is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a [[Demographics of Europe|total population]] of about 741 million (about 11% of the [[world population]]) {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} The [[European climate]] is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at [[latitudes]] along which the climate in Asia and [[North America]] is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.

Europe, in particular [[ancient Greece]], was the birthplace of [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Covert|title=Ancient Greece: Birthplace of Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVMYJNvUiYkC&amp;pg=PP5|year=2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-6831-6|page=5|quote=Ancient Greece is often called the cradle of western civilization. ...

Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers [[European colonialism|controlled]] at various times the [[Americas]], almost all of [[Africa]] and [[Oceania]] and the majority of Asia.

The [[Age of Enlightenment]], the subsequent [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in [[Western Europe]] and eventually the wider world. Both [[world war]]s took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] took prominence.&lt;ref name="natgeo 534"&gt;National Geographic, 534.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], Europe was divided along the [[Iron Curtain]] between [[NATO]] in the West and the [[Warsaw Pact]] in the East, until the [[revolutions of 1989]] and [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]].

In 1949 the [[Council of Europe]] was founded, following a speech by Sir [[Winston Churchill]], with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. It includes all European states except for [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Vatican City]]. Further [[European integration]] by some states led to the formation of the [[European Union]] (EU), a separate political entity that lies between a [[confederation]] and a [[federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ies.ee/iesp/No11/articles/03_Gabriel_Hazak.pdf|title=The European union—a federation or a confederation?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU originated in Western Europe but has been [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding eastward]] since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the [[euro]], is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's [[Schengen Area]] abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states. The [[European Anthem]] is "[[Ode to Joy (Beethoven)|Ode to Joy]]", and states celebrate peace and unity on [[Europe Day]].

In classical [[Greek mythology]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] ({{lang-grc|Εὐρώπη}}, ''Eurṓpē'') is the name of either a [[Phoenicia]]n princess or of a queen of Crete. The name contains the elements εὐρύς (''eurús''), "wide, broad"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Deu%29ru%2Fs εὐρύς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; and ὤψ (''ōps'', gen. ὠπός, ''ōpós'') "eye, face, countenance",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dw%29%2Fy ὤψ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; hence their composite ''Eurṓpē'' would mean "wide-gazing" or "broad of aspect". ''Broad'' has been an [[epithet]] of Earth herself in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and the poetry devoted to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M.L. West |title=Indo-European poetry and myth |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2007 |pages=178–179 |isbn=978-0-19-928075-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second part compare also the divine attributes of [[Athena#Cult and attributes|"grey-eyed" Athena]] (γλαυκῶπις, ''glaukōpis'') or [[Hera|ox-eyed Hera]] (βοῶπις, ''boōpis'').

There have been attempts to connect ''Eurṓpē'' to a Semitic term for "west", this being either [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''erebu'' meaning "to go down, set" (said of the sun) or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] '' 'ereb'' "evening, west",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Europe "Europe"] in the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which is at the origin of Arabic [[Maghreb]] and Hebrew ''ma'arav''. [[Michael A. Barry]], professor in [[Princeton University]]'s Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word ''Ereb'' on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of "night, [the country of] sunset", in opposition to ''Asu'' "[the country of] sunrise", i.e. Asia. The same naming motive according to "cartographic convention" appears in Greek Ἀνατολή (''Anatolḗ'' "[sun] rise", "east", hence [[Anatolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Barry: "L’Europe et son mythe : à la poursuite du couchant". In: ''Revue des deux Mondes'' (November/December 1999) p. 110. {{ISBN|978-2-7103-0937-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Litchfield West]] stated that "phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M.L.

Most major world languages use words derived from ''Eurṓpē'' or ''Europa'' to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word ''Ōuzhōu'' (歐洲/欧洲); a similar Chinese-derived term {{nihongo||欧州|Ōshū}} is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, {{nihongo||欧州連合|Ōshū Rengō}}, despite the [[katakana]] {{nihongo||ヨーロッパ|Yōroppa}} being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages the originally Persian name ''[[Frangistan]]'' ("land of the [[Franks]]") is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as ''Avrupa'' or ''Evropa''.&lt;ref name="davison"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Davidson, Roderic H. |title=Where is the Middle East?|jstor=20029452 |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=38|issue=4 |pages=665–675 |year=1960|doi=10.2307/20029452 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalent definition of Europe as a geographical term has been in use since the mid-19th century.
Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the [[Ural River]], and the [[Caspian Sea]]; to the southeast, including the [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Black Sea]] and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopaedia 2007 |title=Europe |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopaedia_761570768/Europe.html |accessdate=27 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbxqnne?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570768/Europe.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence [[Iceland]] is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of [[Greenland]] is usually assigned to [[North America]]. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. [[Cyprus]] is closest to [[Anatolia|Anatolia (or Asia Minor)]], but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and is a member state of the EU. [[Malta]] was considered an island of [[Northwest Africa]] for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Falconer, William; Falconer, Thomas.

===History of the concept===

====Early history====
[[File:T and O map Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|A medieval [[T and O map]] from 1472 showing the three continents as domains of the sons of [[Noah]] — Asia to Sem ([[Shem]]), Europe to Iafeth ([[Japheth]]), and Africa to Cham ([[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]])]]
The first recorded usage of ''Eurṓpē'' as a geographic term is in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Delian Apollo]], in reference to the western shore of the [[Aegean Sea]]. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]]. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern [[Rioni River]]) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.38. C.f. James Rennell, ''The geographical system of Herodotus examined and explained'', Volume 1, Rivington 1830, [https://books.google.com/books?id=enQ-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA244 p. 244]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the [[Nile]] and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the [[Don River (Russia)|River Don]], rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 4:45&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer [[Strabo]] at the River Don.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo ''Geography 11.1''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Jubilees|Book of Jubilees]]'' described the continents as the lands given by [[Noah]] to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the [[Pillars of Hercules]] at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], separating it from [[Northwest Africa]], to the Don, separating it from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genesis and the Jewish antiquities of Flavius Josephus|first= Thomas W.|last= Franxman|publisher=Pontificium Institutum Biblicum|year= 1979|isbn=978-88-7653-335-8|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention received by the [[Middle Ages]] and surviving into modern usage is that of the [[Roman era]] used by Roman era authors such as [[Posidonius]],&lt;ref&gt;W. Theiler, ''Posidonios. Die Fragmente'', vol. 1. Berlin: De Gruyter, 1982, fragm. 47a.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;I. G. Kidd (ed.), ''Posidonius: The commentary'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-521-60443-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_iXs1aCr1ckC&amp;pg=PA738 p. 738].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ptolemy]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' 7.5.6 (ed. Nobbe 1845, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHMCAAAAQAAJ vol. 2], p. 178) {{lang|grc|Καὶ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ δὲ συνάπτει διὰ τοῦ μεταξὺ αὐχένος τῆς τε Μαιώτιδος λίμνης καὶ τοῦ Σαρματικοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς διαβάσεως τοῦ Τανάϊδος ποταμοῦ. }}
"And [Asia] is connected to Europe by the land-strait between Lake Maiotis and the Sarmatian Ocean where the river Tanais crosses through."&lt;/ref&gt;
who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.

The term "Europe" is first used for a cultural sphere in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the [[Western Church]], as opposed to both the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches and to the [[Islamic world]].

A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of [[Christendom|Latin Christendom]] coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with [[Byzantium]] and [[Islam]], and limited to northern [[Iberia]], the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman F. Cantor]], ''The Civilization of the Middle Ages'', 1993, ""Culture and Society in the First Europe", pp185ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: ''Europa'' often{{dubious|date=October 2016}}&lt;!--inflated from "once or twice"--&gt; figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, [[Alcuin]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Cantor, 1993:181.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Europa Prima Pars Terrae in Forma Virginis.jpg|thumb|Depiction of ''[[Europa regina]]'' ('Queen Europe') in 1582.]]
The question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of [[Muscovy]] began to include Northern Asia.

Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [[Eurasia]] into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]], the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (ancient [[Tanais]]). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [[Kalach-na-Donu]] (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [[Volga–Don Canal]]), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.

[[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the [[Volga River|Volga]], following the Volga north until the [[Samara Bend]], along [[Obshchy Syrt]] (the [[drainage divide]] between Volga and [[Ural River|Ural]]) and then north along [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=German|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was adopted by the Russian Empire, and introduced the convention that would eventually become adopted as standard, but not without criticism by many modern analytical geographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA8 |title=Europe: A History |page=8 |publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2010|isbn=978-0-19-820171-7|date=1996|author1=Davies|first1=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The [[:commons:Category:Atlas of Russian Empire. 1745 year|1745 atlas]] published by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as [[Serafimovich (town)|Serafimovich]] before cutting north towards [[Arkhangelsk]], while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as [[John Cary]] followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, [[Peter Simon Pallas]], as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |title=Boundary of Europe and Asia along Urals |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108153922/http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |archivedate=8 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simon Pallas, ''Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire'', vol. 3 (1773)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the [[Volga–Don Canal]] and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the [[Greater Caucasus watershed]] to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a "controversy" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with [[Douglas Freshfield]] advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the "best possible", citing support from various "modern geographers".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Freshfield, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ips8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71 Journey in the Caucasus]", ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'', Volumes 13-14, 1869.
Cited as de facto convention by Baron von Haxthausen, ''Transcaucasia'' (1854); review [https://books.google.com/books?id=SN0EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA140 Dublin University Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.rsl.ru/view.php?path=/rsl01004000000/rsl01004103000/rsl01004103489/rsl01004103489.pdf#?page=163 "Europe"]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from [[Baydaratskaya Bay]], on the [[Kara Sea]], along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the [[Ural River]] until the [[Mugodzhar Hills]], and then the [[Emba River]]; and Kuma–Manych Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velikijporog.narod.ru/st_evraz_gran.htm|title=Do we live in Europe or in Asia?|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |title=Physical Geography |year=1998 |author=Orlenok V. |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016212930/http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest&lt;ref&gt;E.M.

The [[European Neolithic]] period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BC in [[Greece]] and the [[Balkans]], probably influenced by earlier farming practices in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name="Borza"&gt;{{Citation | last = Borza | first = E.N. | title = In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon | page = 58 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=614pd07OtfQC&amp;pg=PA58 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992| isbn = 978-0691008806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the [[Danube]] and the [[Rhine]] ([[Linear Pottery culture]]) and along the [[Mediterranean coast]] ([[Cardial Ware|Cardial culture]]).

The empire continued to expand under emperors such as [[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Picts|Pictish]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] tribes.&lt;ref name="natgeo 123"&gt;National Geographic, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Sally M., ''Picts, Gaels, and Scots: Early Historic Scotland.''

During the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the "[[Age of Migrations]]". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Huns]], [[Franks]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Slavs]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and, later on, the [[Vikings]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Magyars]].&lt;ref name="mieawl"/&gt; [[Renaissance]] thinkers such as [[Petrarch]] would later refer to this as the "Dark Ages".&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1. (Jan. 1943), pp. 69–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cantor|Norman F. Cantor]], ''The Medieval World 300 to 1300''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking [[Eastern Roman Empire]], also known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Emperor [[Justinian I]] presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a [[Code of Justinian|legal code]] that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]], and brought the Christian church under state control.&lt;ref name="natgeo 135"&gt;National Geographic, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring [[Sasanids|Sasanid Persians]] were severely weakened due the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars]], the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into [[Asia Minor]]. In the mid 7th century AD, following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], Islam penetrated into the [[Caucasus]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote="(..) It is difficult to establish exactly when Islam first appeared in Russia because the lands that Islam penetrated early in its expansion were not part of Russia at the time, but were later incorporated into the expanding Russian Empire. Islam reached the Caucasus region in the middle of the seventh century as part of the Arab [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquest]] of the Iranian Sassanian Empire.

Cambridge University Press. 052136292X.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 711 and 720, most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was brought under [[Muslim]] rule&amp;nbsp;— save for small areas in the northwest ([[Asturias]]) and largely [[Basque people|Basque]] regions in the [[Pyrenees]]. This territory, under the Arabic name [[Al-Andalus]], became part of the expanding [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The unsuccessful [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|second siege of Constantinople]] (717) weakened the [[Umayyad|Umayyad dynasty]] and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, which ended their northward advance.

During the Dark Ages, the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.&lt;ref name="natgeo 143"&gt;National Geographic, 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under [[Clovis&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 162"&gt;National Geographic, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlemagne]], a Frankish king of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed "[[Holy Roman Emperor]]" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 166"&gt;National Geographic, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[East Central Europe]] saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of [[Christianity]] (circa 1000 AD). The powerful [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] state of [[Great Moravia]] spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk I]] and causing a series of armed conflicts with [[East Francia]]. Further south, the first [[South Slavs|South Slavic states]] emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted [[Christianity]]: the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Principality]] (later [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom]] and [[Serbian Empire|Empire]]), and the [[Duchy of Croatia]] (later [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]]). To the East, the [[Kievan Rus]] expanded from its capital in [[Kiev]] to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, [[Vladimir the Great]] adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] as the religion of state.{{sfn|Bulliet|Crossley|Headrick|Hirsch|2011|page=250}}{{sfn|Brown|Anatolios|Palmer|2009|page=66}} Further East, [[Volga Bulgaria]] became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Mako, "The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered", Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 18, 2011, 199–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===
{{Main|High Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages|Middle Ages}}
{{See also|Medieval demography}}
The period between the year 1000 and 1300 is known as the [[High Middle Ages]], during which the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Baltic Sea]]s. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the [[Maritime Republics]] a leading role in the European scene.

[[File:Philip II and Tancred meeting in Messina - British Library Royal MS 16 G vi f350r (detail).jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|[[Tancred of Sicily]] and [[Philip II of France]], during the [[Third Crusade]] (1189–1192)]]

The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. [[Feudalism]] developed in [[France]] in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 158"&gt;National Geographic, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A struggle for influence between the [[nobility]] and the [[monarchy]] in England led to the writing of the [[Magna Carta]] and the establishment of a [[parliament]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 186"&gt;National Geographic, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary source of culture in this period came from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 158"/&gt;

The [[Papacy]] reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An [[East-West Schism]] in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 [[Pope Urban II]] called for a [[Crusades|crusade]] against [[Muslims]] occupying [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 192"&gt;National Geographic, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe itself, the Church organised the [[Inquisition]] against heretics. In [[Spain]], the [[Reconquista]] concluded with the fall of [[Granada]] in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 199"&gt;National Geographic, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the east a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laiou|Morisson|2007|pp=130–131}}; {{harvnb|Pounds|1979|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Empire was weakened following the defeat at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]] and was weakened considerably by the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople in 1204]], during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref name="DuikerSpielvogel2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William J.

The plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in ''[[The Decameron]]'' (1353).

[[File:Château de Montsoreau(Maine-et-Loire).jpg|thumb|The end of [[Hundred Years' War|hundred years' wars]] marked the beginning of the [[French Renaissance]] in [[France]], [[Château de Montsoreau]] (1453).]]

The Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in [[Florence]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a [[Renaissance humanism|new humanism]] was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] and Arabic knowledge from [[Monasticism|monastic]] libraries, often translated from Arabic into [[Latin language|Latin]].&lt;ref name="Barrett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Weiss|Weiss, Roberto]] (1969) ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'', {{ISBN|1-59740-150-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Jacob Burckhardt]]|origyear=1878|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2074 |title=The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy|edition=translation by S.G.C Middlemore|year=1990|isbn=978-0-14-044534-3|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of [[Renaissance art|art]], [[philosophy]], [[music]], and the [[History of science in the Renaissance|sciences]], under the joint patronage of [[Royal family|royalty]], the nobility, the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and an emerging merchant class.&lt;ref name="natgeo 254"&gt;National Geographic, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, De Lamar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe'', {{ISBN|0-395-88947-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levey|first=Michael|title=Early Renaissance|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrons in Italy, including the [[Medici]] family of Florentine bankers and the [[Pope]]s in [[Rome]], funded prolific [[quattrocento]] and [[cinquecento]] artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 292"&gt;National Geographic, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levey|first=Michael|title=High Renaissance|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the [[Western Schism]]. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in [[Avignon]] and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.&lt;ref name="natgeo 193"&gt;National Geographic, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Martin Luther, 1528 (Veste Coburg).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]

In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Spain and Portugal, the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=John Morris Roberts|title=Penguin History of Europe|year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-026561-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 296"&gt;National Geographic, 296.&lt;/ref&gt; A Spanish expedition led by [[Christopher Columbus]] reached the [[New World]] in 1492, the Portuguese sailor [[Vasco da Gama]] opened the ocean route to the [[Orient|East]] in 1498 and the Spanish explorer [[Sebastian Elcano]] made the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1519–1522, and soon after the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing huge global empires in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania.&lt;ref name="natgeo 338"&gt;National Geographic, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, [[the Americas]], and Asia.

The Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation (1517–1648), initially sparked by [[The Ninety-Five Theses|the works]] of German theologian [[Martin Luther]], an attempt to start a reform within the Church. The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between [[Protestant]] and Roman Catholic faiths.&lt;ref name="natgeo 256"&gt;National Geographic, 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led to the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics History of Europe – Demographics]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the [[Peace of Westphalia]], France rose to predominance within Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 269"&gt;National Geographic, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in the south, the Ottomans had conquered the Balkans by the 15th century, [[Siege of Vienna|laying siege to Vienna in 1529]]. In the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]] checked Ottoman power in the Mediterranean. The Ottomans again laid siege to Vienna in 1683, but the [[Battle of Vienna]] permanently ended their advance into Europe, and marked the political hegemony of the [[Habsburg dynasty]] in central Europe.

The Renaissance and the [[New Monarchs]] marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention, and scientific development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In parallel, the [[Eastern Question]] grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]]. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the [[Great Power]]s struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The [[Russian Empire]] stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the [[Habsburg Empire]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the [[Serbian revolution]] (1804) and [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the [[Balkans]], which ended with the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912-1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=3044&amp;HistoryID=ac79], ''Ottoman Empire – 19th century'', Historyworld&lt;/ref&gt; Formal recognition of the ''de facto'' independent principalities of [[Montenegro]], [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Romania]] ensued at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878.

Russia was plunged into the [[Russian Revolution]], which threw down the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist monarchy]] and replaced it with the [[communist]] [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 480"&gt;National Geographic, 480.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austria-Hungary]] and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn.

The [[social revolution]]s sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following [[The Great War]]: in 1919, with the [[Weimar Republic]] in Germany, and the [[First Austrian Republic]]; in 1922, with [[Mussolini]]'s one party [[Fascism|fascist]] government in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and in [[Ataturk]]'s [[Turkish Republic]], adopting the Western alphabet, and state [[secularism]].
Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] brought about the worldwide [[Great Depression]]. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, [[Fascism|fascist movements]] developed throughout Europe placing [[Adolf Hitler]] in power of what became [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="hobsbawn"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric|publisher=Vintage|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-73005-7|title=The Age of Extremes: A history of the world, 1914–1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 438"&gt;''National Geographic'', 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the [[Saarland]] and [[Rhineland]] in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, [[Austria]] became a part of Germany following the [[Anschluss]]. Later that year, following the [[Munich Agreement]] signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the [[Sudetenland]], which was a part of [[Czechoslovakia]] inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], controlled by Germany, and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]]. At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of [[appeasement]].

With tensions mounting between Germany and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] over the future of [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], the Germans turned to the Soviets, and signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the [[European Theatre of World War II]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 465"&gt;National Geographic, 465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=A.

P.|title= The Origins of the Second World War|year=1996|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| isbn=978-0-684-82947-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Baltic countries]] and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at [[Battles of Narvik|Narvik]] and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The [[Phoney War]] continued.

In May 1940, Germany [[Battle of France|attacked France]] through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August Germany began a [[Battle of Britain|bombing offensive on Britain]], but failed to convince the Britons to give up.&lt;ref name="natgeo 510"&gt;''National Geographic'', 510.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 532"&gt;''National Geographic'', 532.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December 1941 [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the [[British Empire]] and other [[Allies of World War II|allied]] forces.&lt;ref name="natgeo 511"&gt;''National Geographic'', 511.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 519"&gt;''National Geographic'', 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the staggering [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The [[Battle of Kursk]], which involved the largest [[Battle of Prokhorovka|tank battle]] in history, was the last major German offensive on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. In June 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]], opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally [[Battle of Berlin|fell in 1945]], ending World War II in Europe.

World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the [[Yalta Conference]] and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by [[Winston Churchill]] an "[[Iron Curtain]]". The United States and Western Europe
established the [[NATO]] alliance and later the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the [[Warsaw Pact]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 530"&gt;National Geographic, 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schuman Declaration.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Schuman Declaration]] led to the creation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. It began the [[European integration|integration process]] of the [[European Union]] ([[Europe Day|9 May]] 1950, at the [[French Foreign Ministry]]).]]

The two new [[superpower]]s, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on [[nuclear proliferation]]. At the same time [[decolonisation]], which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name="natgeo 534"/&gt; In the 1980s the [[glasnost|reforms]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.&lt;ref name="hobsbawn"/&gt;

[[European integration]] also grew after World War II. The [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957 established the [[European Economic Community]] between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.&lt;ref name="natgeo 536"&gt;National Geographic, 536.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the EEC, [[European Coal and Steel Community]] and [[Euratom]] formed the [[European Community]], which in 1993 became the [[European Union]]. The EU established a [[European Parliament|parliament]], [[European Court of Justice|court]] and [[European Central Bank|central bank]] and introduced the [[euro]] as a unified currency.&lt;ref name="natgeo 537"&gt;National Geographic, 537.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2004 and 2013, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding the EU]] to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.&lt;ref name="natgeo 535"&gt;National Geographic, 535.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2016 the people of the United Kingdom, in a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|non-binding referendum]] on EU membership voted to [[Brexit|leave the European Union]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Europe}}
[[File:Europe topography map en.png|thumb|Relief map of Europe and surrounding regions]]

Europe makes up the western fifth of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass.&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt; It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Cuper |first = Simon |date = 23 May 2014 |title = Why Europe works |url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/51dd9432-db03-11e3-8273-00144feabdc0.html |publisher = [[Financial Times|ft.com]] |accessdate = 28 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195686/Europe Europe]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;
Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]], and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the [[Great European Plain]], and at its heart lies the [[North German Plain]]. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Italian Peninsula]] contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like [[Iceland]], Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Europe}}
[[File:Vegetation Europe.png|thumb|[[Biome]]s of Europe and surrounding regions:

]]

Europe lies mainly in the [[temperate]] climate zones, being subjected to [[prevailing westerlies]]. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref name="climate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight/climates/european_climate |title=European Climate |website=World Book |accessdate=16 June 2008 |publisher=World Book, Inc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109230709/http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight%2Fclimates%2Feuropean_climate |archivedate=9 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.

Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is {{convert|16|°C}}, while it is only {{convert|12|°C}} in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around {{convert|8|C-change}} higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost {{convert|22|C-change}} higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.&lt;ref name="climate"/&gt; Similarly, northern parts of Scotland have a temperate marine climate. The yearly average temperature in city of Inverness is {{convert|9.05|C|F}}. However, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of {{convert|-6.5|C|F}}, giving it a nearly subarctic climate.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of Europe|Geological history of Europe}}
[[File:Mount Elbrus May 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Elbrus]] in [[Russia]] is the highest mountain in Europe.]]

The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the [[Baltic Shield]] (Fennoscandia) and the [[Sarmatian craton]], both around 2.25&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, followed by the [[Volgo–Uralia]] shield, the three together leading to the [[East European craton]] (≈ [[Baltica]]) which became a part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]]. Around 1.1&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [[Laurentia]] block) became joined to [[Rodinia]], later resplitting around 550&amp;nbsp;million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440&amp;nbsp;million years ago [[Euramerica]] was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [[Gondwana]] then leading to the formation of [[Pangea]]. Around 190&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via [[Greenland]], leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late [[Tertiary period]] about five million years ago.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |title=Europe |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year=2007 |accessdate=10 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204015044/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |archivedate=4 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gibraltar-Europa-Point-LH-from-the-sea.jpg|thumb|Europa Point as seen from the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].]]
The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [[Scottish Highlands]] to the rolling [[plain]]s of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/eurogy.jpg|title=Geology map of Europe|year=1967|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous [[Southern Europe]] and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] complex and [[Barents Sea]].

The northern plain contains the old geological continent of [[Baltica]], and so may be regarded geologically as the "main continent", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient [[microcontinent]] [[Avalonia]].

===Flora===

Having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of [[Fennoscandia]] and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various [[national park]]s.

[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|left|Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green), and tundra or bogs in the north (dark yellow)]]

The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [[forest]]. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.

[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch]]

Probably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&amp;geography.htm|title=History and geography|publisher=Save America's Forest Funds|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]], Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|broadleaf and mixed]] forests, [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, in European Russia 5–10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is [[Iceland]] (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |title=State of Europe's Forests 2007: The MCPFE report on sustainable forest management in Europe |publisher=EFI Euroforest Portal |page=182 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624190612/http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |archivedate=24 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]]. In the north, the taiga is a mixed [[spruce]]–[[pine]]–[[birch]] forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]]) extends eastwards from [[Ukraine]] and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.

===Fauna===
{{main|Fauna of Europe}}
[[File:Europe biogeography countries.svg|right|thumb|[[Biogeography|Biogeographic regions]] of Europe and bordering regions]]

Glaciation during the [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of [[Fauna of Europe|European fauna]]. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction. The [[woolly mammoth]] was extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period. Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bear]]s ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]] the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the [[European brown bear|brown bear]] lives primarily in the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]], Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s may be found on [[Svalbard]], a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]], the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [[Western Europe]] (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).

European wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).

Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds, and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars, and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the [[small tortoiseshell]] butterfly, add to the biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, S., Thomas, C. and Bale, J.

The extinction of the [[Cretan Dwarf Hippopotamus|dwarf hippos]] and [[dwarf elephant]]s has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html|title=Paleolithic Man and his Environment in Malta|last1=Savona-Ventura|first1=C.|last2=Mifsud|first2=A.|date=9 April 1997|accessdate=19 July 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:39:06|archivedate=25 October 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly [[phytoplankton]]. Important animals that live in European seas are [[zooplankton]], [[mollusc]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, different [[crustacean]]s, [[squid]]s and [[octopuses]], fish, [[dolphin]]s, and [[whales]].

Biodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Bern Convention]], which has also been signed by the [[European Community]] as well as non-European states.

The political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is [[parliamentary democracy]], in most cases in the form of [[Republic]]; in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the [[Monarchies in Europe|Monarchy]]. Europe's remaining eleven monarchies&lt;ref&gt;not counting the microstate of [[Vatican City]]&lt;/ref&gt; are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]].

[[European integration]] is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the [[Council of Europe]] since the end of [[World War II]]
The [[European Union]] has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.

28 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free [[Schengen Area]] and 19 of the monetary union [[Eurozone]]. Among the smaller European organizations are the [[Nordic Council]], the [[Benelux]], the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Visegrád Group]].

Several dependencies and similar territories with broad autonomy are also found within or in close proximity to Europe. This includes Åland (a [[region of Finland]]), two constituent countries of the Kingdom of Denmark (other than Denmark itself), three [[Crown dependencies]], and two [[British Overseas Territories]]. Svalbard is also included due to its unique status within Norway, although it is not autonomous. Not included are the three [[countries of the United Kingdom]] with devolved powers and the two [[Autonomous Regions of Portugal]], which despite having a unique degree of autonomy, are not largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. Areas with little more than a unique tax status, such as [[Heligoland]] and the [[Canary Islands]], are also not included for this reason.

As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7&amp;nbsp;trillion compared to North America's $27.1&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fineman |first=Josh |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/world |title=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128110049/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/world |archivedate=28 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |title=Global Wealth Stages a Strong Comeback |publisher=Pr-inside.com |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520174617/http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |archivedate=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the [[Western Europe|West]]; some of the [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an economies are still emerging from the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].

The European Union, a political entity composed of 28 European states, comprises the [[List of countries by GDP|largest single economic area]] in the world. 19 EU [[Eurozone|countries]] share the [[euro]] as a common currency.
Five European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|national economies in GDP (PPP)]]. This includes (ranks according to the [[The CIA World Factbook|CIA]]): Germany (5), the UK (6), Russia (7), France (8), and Italy (10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html|title=The CIA World Factbook – GDP (PPP)|date=15 July 2008|accessdate=19 July 2008|publisher=[[CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is huge disparity between many European countries in terms of their income. The richest in terms of GDP per capita is Monaco with its US$172,676 per capita (2009) and the poorest is [[Moldova]] with its GDP per capita of US$1,631 (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do?Step=12&amp;id=4&amp;CNO=2|title=The World Bank DataBank |website=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monaco]] is the richest country in terms of GDP per capita in the world according to the World Bank report.

As a whole, Europe's GDP per capita is US$21,767 according to a 2016 International Monetary Fund assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Some data refers to IMF staff estimates but some are actual figures for the year 2017, made in 12 April 2017.

===Economic history===
;Industrial growth (1760–1945)
Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com-archive-online.eu/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism Capitalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517172857/http://www.britannica.com-archive-online.eu/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism |date=17 May 2014 }}. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt; From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialism: A Dictionary of Sociology|author=Scott, John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|publisher=The History Guide|author=Steven Kreis|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by World War I but by the beginning of World War II they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. World War II, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.

;Cold War (1945–1991)
[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|Fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989.]]
After World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking International Organisation: Deregulation and Global Governance|last=Emadi-Coffin|first=Barbara|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-19540-9|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany [[Wirtschaftswunder|recovered quickly]] and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], also recovered, and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the [[Spanish miracle]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrop, Martin. ''Power and Policy in Liberal Democracies'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states came under the control of the [[Soviet Union]] and thus were members of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (COMECON).&lt;ref name="loc-cs"&gt;"Germany (East)", Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]&lt;/ref&gt;

The states which retained a [[free-market]] system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/marshall-plan|title=Marshall Plan|publisher=US Department of State Office of the historian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the [[Cold War]]. Until 1990, the [[European Community]] was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.

;Reunification (1991–present)
[[File:Carte zone euro.svg|thumb| [[Eurozone]] (blue colour)]]
With the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states began free market reforms: Poland, Hungary, and [[Slovenia]] adopted them reasonably quickly, while [[Ukraine]] and Russia are still in the process of doing so.

After [[East Germany|East]] and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.

By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the [[Eurozone]] replacing their former national currencies by the common euro. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden. The European Union is now the largest economy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepropheticyears.com/reasons/The%20rise%20of%20the...oman%20empire.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}{{Better source|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the population of Europe was estimated to be 742 million according to {{UN_Population|source}}, which is slightly more than one-ninth of the world's population. This number includes Asian Russia (Siberia, about 36 million people) but excludes the European part of Turkey, Cyprus and the Transcaucasian countries.
A century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the [[world population|world's population]].&lt;ref name="World Population Growth, 1950–2050"&gt;[http://www.prb.org/Educators/TeachersGuides/HumanPopulation/PopulationGrowth.aspx?p=1 World Population Growth, 1950–2050].

Most of Europe is in a mode of [[Sub-replacement fertility]], which means that each new(-born) generation is being less populous than the older.
The most densely populated country in Europe (and in the world) is the [[microstate]] of [[Monaco]].

===Ethnic groups===

According to UN population projection, Europe's population may fall to about 7% of world population by 2050, or 653&amp;nbsp;million people (medium variant, 556 to 777&amp;nbsp;million in low and high variants, respectively).&lt;ref name="UNPP 2006" /&gt; Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to [[Human overpopulation|fertility rates]].

Today, [[European diaspora|large populations of European descent]] are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America, and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]], while most of the other [[Latin America]]n countries also have a considerable [[White Latin American|population of European origins]]). [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] have large European derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of [[Cape Verde]] and probably [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the [[White South African]]s. In Asia, European-derived populations predominate in [[Northern Asia]] (specifically [[Russians]]) and some parts of Northern [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenall, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], [[BBC News]], 23 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Europe}}

Europe has about 225 indigenous languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edl.ecml.at/LanguageFun/LanguageFacts/tabid/1859/Default.aspx Language facts – European day of languages], Council of Europe. Retrieved 30 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; mostly falling within three [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language groups: the [[Romance languages]], derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire]]; the [[Germanic languages]], whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; Slavic languages are most spoken by the number of native speakers in Europe, they are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western Europe as well as in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Northern Europe, the British Isles and some parts of [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] group (that is, [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] group (that is, [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;), [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].

A distinct non-Indo-European family of [[Uralic languages]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Erzya language|Erzya]], [[Komi language|Komi]], [[Mari language|Mari]], [[Moksha language|Moksha]], and [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]]) is spoken mainly in [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], and parts of Russia. [[Turkic languages]] include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe ([[Balkan Gagauz Turkish]], [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]], [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]], [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]], [[Nogai language|Nogai]], and [[Tatar language|Tatar]]). [[Kartvelian languages]] ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]], and [[Svan language|Svan]]) are spoken primarily in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]], most notably including [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Avar language|Avar]], and [[Lezgian language|Lezgin]]; and [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]], most notably including [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]]). [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is the only [[Semitic language]] that is official within the EU, while [[Basque language|Basque]] is the only European [[language isolate]].

Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The [[Council of Europe]] [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the Council of Europe's [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.

==Culture==
[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette|Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette]]'', 1876, by Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]
{{Main|Culture of Europe}}
{{further|European folklore|European art}}
"Europe" as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|its culture]].
The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of [[Christendom]] (or more specifically [[Latin Christendom]]), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially [[Islamic conquests|against Islam]], as in the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilarie Belloc]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8442 Europe and the Faith], Chapter I&lt;/ref&gt;

This shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into [[Slavic Europe|Slavic]], [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin (Romance)]] and [[Germanic Europe|Germanic]], but with several components not part of either of these group (notably [[Greek culture|Greek]] and [[Celtic Europe|Celtic]]).
Cultural contact and mixtures characterise much of European regional cultures; Kaplan (2014) describes Europe as "embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances".{{clarify|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Andreas M.

{{Main|Religion in Europe}}
[[history of religion|Historically]], religion in Europe has been a major influence on [[Western art history|European art]], [[culture of Europe|culture]], [[Western philosophy|philosophy]] and [[European Union law|law]].

The largest religion in Europe is [[Christianity]], with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves [[Christian]]s,&lt;ref name="Christianity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/global-christianity-regions/#europe|title=Regional Distribution of Christians: Christianity in Europe|date=18 December 2011|website=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and various [[Protestant]] denominations. Among Protestants, the most popular are historically state-supported European denominations such as [[Lutheranism]], [[Anglicanism]] and the [[Reformed faith]]. Other Protestant denominations such as historically significant ones like [[Anabaptists]] were never supported by any state and thus are not so widespread, as well as these newly arriving from the [[United States]] such as [[Pentecostalism]], [[Adventism]], [[Methodism]], [[Baptists]] and various [[Evangelical Protestants]]; although Methodism and Baptists both have European origins. The notion of "Europe" and the "[[Western World]]" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]"; many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified [[European identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=978-0813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second most popular religion is [[Islam]] (6%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-muslim/ |title=The Global Religious Landscape: Muslims |accessdate=18 December 2012 |website=pewforum|date=2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concentrated mainly in the Balkans and eastern Europe ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[TRNC|North Cyprus]], [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[North Caucasus]], and the [[Idel-Ural|Volga-Ural region]]). Other religions, including Judaism, [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's [[Republic of Kalmykia]]). The 20th century saw the revival of [[Neopaganism]] through movements such as [[Wicca]] and [[Druidry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">'''Experimental epidemiology''' is a type of [[epidemiological]] investigation that uses an experimental model to confirm a causal relationship suggested by observational studies. It studies the relationships of various factors determining the frequency and distribution of diseases in a community.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology and Public Health"&gt;{{cite web|title=Epidemiology and Public Health|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/epidemiology-and-public-health/|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=experimental epidemiology|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/experimental+epidemiology|website=medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case types ==

There are three case types in experimental epidemiology: randomized controlled trial, typically used for new medicine or drug testing; field trial, which is conducted on those at high risk of contracting a disease; and community trial, in which research is conducted on an entire community or neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology and Public Health"/&gt;  Randomized controlled trial determines the efficacy of a particular treatment, while other trials may be preventive intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m39gomigh5YC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Handbook of Epidemiology|isbn= 9783540265771|author1= Ahrens|first1= Wolfgang|last2= Pigeot|first2= Iris|date= 2007-07-26 |page=7|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

Experimental epidemiology employs prospective population experiments designed to test epidemiological hypotheses, and usually attempts to relate the postulated cause to the observed effect. Trials of new [[anthelmintics]] are an example.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology and Public Health"/&gt; Intervention or experimentation involves attempting to change a variable in one or more groups of people. This could mean eliminating a dietary factor thought to cause allergy, or testing a new treatment on a selected group of patients. The effects of an intervention are measured by comparing the result in the experimental group with that in a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bonita|first1=R.|last2=Beaglehole|first2=R.|last3=Kjellström|first3=Tord|title=Basic Epidemiology|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=AAZGobMNTXgC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22Experimental+Epidemiology%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sxBdw8GZnZ&amp;sig=iYhVEXLBJdWRqfWXM0gA58VIt40&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc0Ibmu4HaAhXJWpAKHUDpDLY4ChDoAQhZMA0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Experimental%20Epidemiology%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIH World Ranking''' is a ranking system for men's and women's national teams in [[field hockey]]. The teams of the member nations of [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH), field hockey's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results. The rankings were introduced in October 2003.&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;{{cite news|title=FIH to introduce world rankings|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/09/03/stories/2003090300141900.htm|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=2 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the rankings ==
The rankings were introduced to overcome the criticism of fixing when drawing the pools for each tournament. It also determines the quotas for tournaments such as the [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and also the [[Hockey World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref name=system&gt;{{cite web|title=FIH World Ranking System|url=http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/World%20Ranking/World%20Ranking%20Explanatory%20note.pdf|work=International Hockey Federation|publisher=FIH.ch|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation method ==
=== Overview ===
All of the FIH-recognised, including qualifying and continental tournaments for last four years are included in ranking points calculation. However, the past results will be deducted by the percentage set by the FIH as shown by the tabulated below.

{| class=wikitable

=== Continental championships ===
FIH had set the total allocated points for continental tournament. However, a different percentage was set to differ the standard of regional field hockey. Currently, only Europe had full 100% points allocation for all classification while the others had only several finishers with full points allocation. Africa is the sole continent with neither men's or women's tournament had full points allocation.

[[Image:Four continents.png|thumb|The classical four continents]]

Europeans in the 16th century divided the world into '''four continents''': [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Nothing was known of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], first sighted in the early seventeenth century, or  [[Antarctica]], first sighted in the nineteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the four [[continents]] was seen to represent its quadrant of the world&amp;mdash;Europe in the north, Asia in the east, Africa in the south, and America in the west. This division fit the [[Renaissance]] sensibilities of the time, which also divided the world into four [[season]]s, four [[classical element]]s, four [[cardinal directions]], four classical [[virtues]], etc.

The '''four parts of the world'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ciappara|first=Frans|date=1998|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/4672/1/4672_2141.PDF?UkUDh:CyT|title=Society and inquisition in Malta 1743-1798|publisher=Durhem E-Theses|location=[[Durham University]]|page=38|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''four corners of the world''' refers to the [[Americas]] (the "west"), [[Europe]] (the "north"), [[Asia]] (the "east"), and [[Africa]] (the "south"). 

==A three-cornered world==
[[File:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|The ancient tripartite view of the world]]
Before the discovery of the [[New World]] a commonplace of classical and medieval geography had been the "three parts" in which, from Mediterranean and European perspectives, the world was divided: Europe, Asia and Africa. As [[Laurent de Premierfait]], the pre-eminent French translator of Latin literature in the early fifteenth century, informed his readers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Asia is one of the three parts of the world, which the authors divide in Asia, Africa and Europe. Asia extends towards the [[Orient]] as far as the rising sun (''"devers le [[Levant|souleil levant]]"''&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt;), towards the south ("midi") it ends at the great sea, towards the occident it ends at [[Mare Nostrum|our sea]], and towards the north ("[[septentrional|septentrion]]") it ends in the [[Maeotian marshes]] and the river named ''[[Tanais|Thanaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Asie est l'une des trois parties du monde que les auteurs divisent en Asie, Afrique et Europe. Asie se extend devers orient jusques a souleil&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt; [[levant]], devers midi elle fine a la grant mer devers occident elle fine a notre mer, et devers septentrion elle fine aux paluz Meotides et au fleuve appellé Thanaus''; Laurent de Premierfait's expanded translation of [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' (1409), quoted in Patricia M. Gathercole, "Laurent de Premierfait: The Translator of Boccaccio's De casibus virorum illustrium" ''The French Review'' '''27'''.4 (February 1954:245-252) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:EuropaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''Europa:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

==A fourth corner: the enlarged world==
For Laurent's French readers, Asia ended at "our sea", the [[Mediterranean]]; Europeans were only dimly aware of the [[Ural Mountains]], which divide Europe from Asia in the eyes of the modern geographer, and which represent the geological suture between two fragmentary continents, or [[craton]]s. Instead, the division between these continents in the European-centered picture was the [[Hellespont]], which neatly separated Europe from Asia. From the European perspective, into the [[Age of Discovery]], Asia began beyond the Hellespont with [[Asia Minor]], where the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] had lain, and stretched away to unimaginably exotic and distant places&amp;mdash; "the [[Orient]]".

In the sixteenth century [[Americas|America]] too was full of exotic promise: the "[[New World]]".&lt;ref&gt;This theme is extensively explored in Hugh Honour, ''The New Golden Land: European Images of America from the Discoveries to the Present'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, [[Cesare Ripa]] published a book of emblems for the use of artists and artisans who might be called upon to depict allegorical figures. He covered an astonishingly wide variety of fields, and his work was reprinted many times. It was still being brought up-to-date in the 18th century. The illustrations reveal fixed Eurocentric perceptions of the nature of the "four corners of the world." Ripa's ''Europe'' (''illustration, left'') is the land of abundance (cornucopia) of kings and the pope, whose crowns and the papal tiara lie at her feet, and of cities.
[[Image:AsiaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Asia:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia,'' 1603]]
''Africa'', by contrast (''illustration, below right'') wears the elephant headdress (worn by rulers depicted on Hellenistic [[Bactria]]n coins) and is accompanied by a lion, the scorpion of the desert sands and [[Cleopatra]]'s [[asp (reptile)|asps]]. ''Asia'' (''illustration, right''), the seat of Religion, carries a smoking [[censer]] as a camel takes its ease.

And the iconic image of ''America'' (''illustration, below left'') shows a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] maiden in a feathered headdress, with [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrow. Perhaps she represents a fabled [[Amazons|Amazon]] from the river that already carried the name.

The American millionaire philanthropist [[James Hazen Hyde]], who inherited a majority share in [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States|Equitable Life Assurance Society]], formed a collection of allegorical prints illustrating the Four Continents that are now at the [[New-York Historical Society]]; Hyde's drawings and a supporting collection of sets of porcelain table ornaments and other decorative arts illustrating the Four Continents were shared by various [[New York City]] museums.

The Renaissance associated one major river to each of the continents.
The Four Rivers theme appears for example in the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]] in the [[Piazza Navona]] in Rome.

With the confirmed discovery that [[Australia]] was an island continent, the theme of the "Four Continents" lost much of its drive, long before a sixth continent, [[Antarctica]], was discovered. The iconography survived as the '''Four Corners of the World''', however, generally in self-consciously classicizing contexts: for instance, in New York, in front of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] (1907), four sculptural groups by [[Daniel Chester French]] symbolize the "Four Corners of the World."

'''Glenn Hauser''' (born April 12, 1945 in [[Berkeley, California]]) is an internationally known American [[DXing|DX]]er&lt;ref name="Berg2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Jerome S.|title=Listening on the short waves, 1945 to today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjP978PYo0MC&amp;pg=PA222|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=October 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3996-6|pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BennettHardy1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Hank|last2=Hardy|first2=David T.|last3=Yoder|first3=Andrew R.|title=The complete shortwave listener's handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_tmz9JIRHsC|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=September 1993|publisher=TAB Books|isbn=978-0-8306-4347-9|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[radio]] host from [[Enid, Oklahoma]]. He produces and presents a weekly 30-minute program, ''World Of Radio'',&lt;ref name="League1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=American Radio Relay League|title=ARRL Operating Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICivfre46-QC|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=August 1997|publisher=American Radio Relay League|isbn=978-0-87259-614-6|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; heard on a number of [[Public broadcasting|non-commercial]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations throughout the [[United States|U.S.]] and worldwide on [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]].

Hauser began his broadcasting career on [[Radio Canada International]] during the late 1970s, providing DX tips on Sunday nights, and his tips also appeared on [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|Radio Nederland's]] ''DX Juke Box'' program. He wrote for ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' and ''[[Modern Electronics]]'', and published ''Review of International Broadcasting''.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, Sheldon, "[http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php Glenn Hauser interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172348/http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php |date=2011-07-06 }}", ''CIDX Special Feature #5'', Summer 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==''World of Radio''==
''World Of Radio'' debuted in 1980 on [[WUOT]]-FM in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], moving to shortwave two years later. The half-hour program consists of Hauser reading news about radio around the world in a characteristic monotone. Although ''World of Radio'' focuses on shortwave news, it covers all aspects of broadcasting. Most items are contributed by listeners to the program or DX publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofradio.com/dxlatest.txt|title=DX Listening Digest|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mundo Radial''===
Hauser also produced ''Mundo Radial'', a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] edition of ''World of Radio'', from January 2002 to November 2007.&lt;ref name=Mundo&gt;[http://www.worldofradio.com/espanol.html Mundo Radial]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Review of International Broadcasting''==
Hauser introduced ''Review of International Broadcasting'' in February 1977.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; The magazine published 154 issues, with columns such as "Listener Insights on Programming," "Radio Equipment Forum," "DX Listening Digest," "The Media Mind" and "Satellite Watch."&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; Contributors included David Newkirk, Loren Cox and Juan Carlos Codina,&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;Berg, Jerome S., "Review of International Broadcasting (1977–1997)", 'Listening on the short waves, 1945 to today'', pg 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; and ''RIB'' also featured columns from the BBC, John Norfolk and Alan Roe.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; It was published monthly during the 1970s and 1980s, later decreasing to quarterly and semiannually before ceasing publication in October 1997.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; ''RIB''{{'}}s successor, ''DX Listening Digest'', went online in 1999.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt;

=={{anchor|Religious views}}Political and religious views==
Hauser is a political [[Liberalism|liberal]] and an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],&lt;!-- Think he identifies as atheist. --&gt; which occasionally puts him at odds with the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist-dominated]] [[Shortwave broadcasting in the United States|American shortwave scene]] which carries ''World of Radio''.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The '''Global Alliance to Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth (GAPPS)''' was founded in 2007 as an initiative of [[Seattle Children’s]]. GAPPS’ mission is to lead a collaborative, global effort to increase awareness and accelerate innovative research and interventions that will improve [[maternal health|maternal]], newborn and child health outcomes around the world, with a focus on [[preterm birth]] and [[stillbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/10/S1/S7 |title=Global report on preterm birth and stillbirth  |first= |last= |work=BMC Pregnancy &amp; Childbirth|date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gapps.org/index.php/about/mission_vision/ |title=Mission and Vision |work=GAPPS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GAPPS Repository==
The GAPPS Repository is a [[biobank]] of [[pregnancy]] specimens matched with data from patient questionnaires. It supports research on normal and abnormal pregnancies, including how pregnancy affects maternal and child health after [[childbirth|delivery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2012/03/14/seattle-childrens-sets-up-rare-biobank-of-pregnancy-specimens/ |title=Seattle Children's Sets Up Rare Biobank to Study Premature Birth |work=Xconomy|date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2012/20120410_gapps_biorepository/en/index.html |title=New biorepository to help uncover mysteries of pregnancy and childbirth |work=World Health Organization |date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Repository is also available to researchers to study the [[fetal]] origins of persistent health problems like [[diabetes]], [[obesity]], and [[hypertension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680302/a-library-of-samples-from-pregnant-women-to-help-disease-research |title=A Library of Samples From Pregnant Women To Help Disease Research |work=Fast Company |date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preventing Preterm Birth initiative==
In November 2011 the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] provided $20 million to GAPPS for the Preventing Preterm Birth initiative, part of the foundation's [[Grand Challenges in Global Health]]. The Preventing Preterm Birth initiative focuses on finding new interventions to prevent premature birth and stillbirth by limiting infection and improving nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2011/11/gates-foundation-awards-20m-for.html |title=Gates Foundation awards $20M for premature birth research |work=Puget Sound Business Journal |date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35984">'''Global commons''' is a term typically used to describe international, supranational, and global [[natural resources|resource]] domains in which [[common-pool resource]]s are found. Global [[commons]] include the earth's shared natural resources, such as the high [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and [[outer space]] and the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/delc/GlobalCommons/tabid/54404/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyberspace]] may also meet the definition of a global commons.

==Definition and usage==
"Global commons" is a term typically used to describe [[international]], [[supranational]], and global resource domains in which common-pool resources are found. In [[economics]], [[Common good (economics)|common goods]] are [[Rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]] and [[Excludability|non-excludable]], constituting one of the four main types of [[Good (economics)|goods]].&lt;ref&gt;For current definitions of public goods see any mainstream microeconomics textbook, e.g.: Hal R. Varian, ''Microeconomic Analysis'' {{ISBN|0-393-95735-7}}; [[Andreu Mas-Colell|Mas-Colell]], Whinston &amp; Green,  ''Microeconomic Theory'' {{ISBN|0-19-507340-1}}; or Gravelle &amp; Rees, ''Microeconomics'' {{ISBN|0-582-40487-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[common-pool resource]], also called a common property resource, is a special case of a common good (or [[public good]]) whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential users.  Examples include both natural or human-made resource domains (e.g., a "fishing hole" or an irrigation system). Unlike [[global public good]]s, global common-pool resources face problems of congestion, overuse, or degradation because they are subtractable (which makes them [[rivalrous]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0 521 40599 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "commons" originates from the term [[common land]] in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=neeson |first=Jeanette M. |last=Neeson |title=Commoners: Common Right, Enclosure and Social Change in England, 1700–1820 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1996 |ISBN=978-0521567749}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Commoners rights" referred to traditional rights held by commoners, such as [[mowing]] [[meadow]]s for [[hay]] or [[grazing]] [[livestock]] on common land held in the [[open field system]] of old [[English common law]].  [[Enclosure]] was the process that ended those traditional rights, converting open fields to [[private property]].  Today, many commons still exist in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and the [[United States]], although their extent is much reduced from the millions of acres that existed until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |last=Callander |first=Robin Fraser |year=1987 |title=A pattern of Landownership in Scotland: With Particular Reference to Aberdeenshire |place=Finzean |publisher=Haughend |oclc=60041593}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are still over 7,000 registered commons in England alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls DEFRA Database of registered common land in England] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129020728/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls |date=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "global commons" is typically used to indicate the earth's shared natural resources, such as the deep [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[outer space]] and the Northern and Southern [[polar region]]s, the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Global Environmental Politics (2nd edition) |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location=Cheltenham, UK |author=Dauvergne, Peter (ed.) |year=2012 |isbn=978-1849809405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''World Conservation Strategy'', a report on conservation published by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) in collaboration with [[UNESCO]] and with the support of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF):
{{quote|"A commons is  a tract of land or water owned or used jointly by the members of a community. The global commons includes those parts of the Earth's surface beyond [[Jurisdiction#National|national jurisdictions]]&amp;nbsp;— notably the open ocean and the living resources found there&amp;nbsp;— or held in common&amp;nbsp;— notably the atmosphere. The only landmass that may be regarded as part of the global commons is Antarctica ..."&lt;ref name="WCS"&gt;[http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/WCS-004.pdf " Chapter 18, The global commons." ''World Conservation Strategy'', International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, accessed 22 May 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Today, the [[Internet]], [[World Wide Web]] and resulting [[cyberspace]] are often referred to as global commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cigionline.org/publications/2012/10/internet-global-commons Raymond, Mark (2012). "The Internet as a Global Commons?" ''Governing the Internet: Chaos, Control or Consensus?'' The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other usages sometimes include references to open access information of all kinds, including arts and culture, language and science, though these are more formally referred to as the [[common heritage of mankind]].&lt;ref&gt;Baslar, Kemal (1998).

==Management of the global commons==
The key challenge of the global commons is the design of governance structures and management systems capable of addressing the complexity of multiple public and private interests, subject to often unpredictable changes, ranging from the local to the global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Global Environmental Commons: Analytical and Political Challenges in Building Governance Mechanisms |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Brousseau, Eric |year=2012 |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0199656202 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with global public goods, management of the global commons requires pluralistic legal entities, usually international and supranational, public and private, structured to match the diversity of interests and the type of resource to be managed, and stringent enough with adequate incentives to ensure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=International Law and Global Public Goods in a Legal Pluralist World |author=Shaffer, Gregory |journal=European Journal of International Law |date=August 2012 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=669–693 |doi=10.1093/ejil/chs036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such management systems are necessary to avoid, at the global level, the classic [[tragedy of the commons]], in which common resources become [[overexploited]].&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |year=1968 |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–1248 |pmid=5699198 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H}} Also available here [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several key differences in management of resources in the global commons from those of the commons, in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc/article/view/305/229 |title=Design principles for global commons: natural resources and emerging technologies |author=Stern, Paul C |journal=International Journal of the Commons |volume=5 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level.  Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools are less likely to be relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of [[unintended consequences]] that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the [[carbon dioxide emissions]] that drive [[climate change]] continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Irreversible Climate Change Due to Carbon Dioxide Emissions. |author=Solomon, S. |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2009 |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1704–1709 |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.1704S |doi=10.1073/pnas.0812721106 |pmid=19179281 |pmc=2632717 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and species extinctions last forever.  Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at the global level, there are significant differences in [[externalities]] between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.

Several [[environmental protocol]]s have been established (see [[List of international environmental agreements]]) as a type of [[international law]], "an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources."&lt;ref&gt;Kanie, Norichike (2007). "Governance with Multi-lateral Environmental Agreements: A healthy or ill-equipped fragmentation?" ''Global Environmental Governance: Perspectives on the Current Debate'', Walter Hoffmann and Lydia Swart (eds.): 67-86. New York: Center for UN Reform Education.&lt;/ref&gt; International environmental protocols came to feature in [[environmental governance]] after trans-boundary [[pollution|environmental problems]] became widely perceived in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;Haas, Keohane and Levy (1993). ''Institutions for the Earth: Sources of effective international environmental protection.'' Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference]] in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated.&lt;ref name="zurn"&gt;Zürn, Michael (1998). "The Rise of International Environmental Politics: A Review of Current Research."  ''World Politics'', 50(4):617-649.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are not a panacea for global commons issues.  Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the [[lowest common denominator]], and lack monitoring and enforcement. They also take an incremental approach to solutions where [[sustainable development]] principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.

===The global ocean===
{{Main article|World ocean|Water cycle}}

The global or [[world ocean]], as the interconnected system of the [[Earth]]'s [[ocean]]ic (or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]]) [[water]]s that comprise the bulk of the [[hydrosphere]], is a classic global commons.  It is divided into a number of principal oceanic areas that are delimited by the [[continent]]s and various oceanographic features.  In turn, oceanic waters are interspersed by many smaller seas, gulfs, and bays.  Further, most freshwater bodies ultimately empty into the ocean and are derived through the Earth's [[water cycle]] from ocean waters.  The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]] is a body of [[public international law]] governing relationships between nations in respect to navigational rights, [[mineral rights]], and jurisdiction over coastal waters.  Maritime law, also called [[Admiralty law]], is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities and [[Conflict of laws|private international law]] governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans. It deals with matters including marine commerce, [[marine navigation]], [[shipping]], [[sailor]]s, and the transportation of passengers and goods by sea. However, these bodies of law do little to nothing to protect deep oceans from human threats.

In addition to providing significant means of transportation, a large proportion of all [[life]] on Earth exists in its ocean, which contains about 300 times the habitable volume of terrestrial habitats.  Specific marine habitats include [[coral reef]]s, [[kelp forest]]s, [[seagrass meadow]]s, [[tidepool]]s, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean ([[pelagic]]) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] to huge [[cetaceans]] (whales) 30 [[meters]] (98 [[foot (length)|feet]]) in length.

At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine life resources provide food (especially [[fishery|food fish]]), medicines, and raw materials. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the [[carbon cycle]]) and of air (such as [[Global climate model|Earth's respiration]], and movement of energy through [[ecosystem]]s including the ocean). Marine organisms contribute significantly to the [[oxygen cycle]], and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's [[climate]].&lt;ref name="DMS"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm3h1q666x206h46 |title=Planktonic dimethylsulfide and cloud albedo: An estimate of the feedback response |author=Foley, Jonathan A., Karl E.

The United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]) has identified several areas of need in managing the global ocean: strengthen national capacities for action, especially in developing countries; improve fisheries management;     reinforce cooperation in semi-enclosed and regional seas; strengthen controls over ocean disposal of hazardous and nuclear wastes; and advance the Law of the Sea. Specific problems identified as in need of attention include [[Current sea level rise|rising sea levels]]; [[Marine pollution|contamination]] by hazardours chemicals (including oil spills); microbiological contamination; ocean acidification; [[Algal bloom#Harmful algal blooms|harmful algal blooms]]; and [[over-fishing]] and other [[overexploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4/report/10_Placing_Environment_at_the_Core.pdf |title=Global environment outlook: environment for development (GEO4) |publisher=World Commission on Environment and Development, The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). |authorlink=Section F,  Chapter 10: From the Periphery to the Core of Decision Making – Options for Action |year=2007 |isbn=978-9280728361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] Environmental Initiative program has identified a need for a worldwide system of very large, highly protected marine reserves where fishing and other extractive activities are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewenvironment.org/campaigns/global-ocean-legacy/id/8589941025 |title=Global Ocean Legacy |publisher=Environmental Initiative, Pew Charitable Trusts |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmosphere===
{{Main article|Air pollution|Climate change|Global warming}}

The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. A primary concern for management of the global atmosphere is [[air pollution]], the introduction into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] of [[chemical]]s, [[particulates]], or [[biomolecule|biological materials]] that cause discomfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as food crops, or damage the [[natural environment]] or [[built environment]]. [[Stratosphere|Stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's [[ecosystems]].

Pollution of breathable [[Air pollution|air]] is a central problem in the management of the global commons. Pollutants can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and may be natural or man-made.  Although controversial and limited in scope by methods of enforcement, in several parts of the world the [[polluter pays principle]], which makes the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]], is accepted. It has strong support in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Community]] (EC) countries. It is also known as extended producer responsibility (EPR). EPR seeks to shift the responsibility dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it attempts to internalise the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically resulting in producers improving the [[Waste management|waste profile]] of their products, decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for [[reuse]] and [[recycling]].

The 1979 [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]], or CLRTAP, is an early international effort to protect and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. It is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), directed by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE).  The [[Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]], or Montreal Protocol (a protocol to the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]]), is an international [[treaty]] designed to protect the [[ozone layer]] by phasing out the production of numerous substances believed to be responsible for [[ozone depletion]]. The treaty was opened for signature on 16 September 1987, and entered into force on 1 January 1989.

[[Global dimming]] is the gradual reduction in the amount of global direct [[irradiance]] at the [[Earth]]'s surface, which has been observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. Global dimming is thought to have been caused by an increase in [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[sulfate aerosol]]s in the atmosphere due to human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter7.pdf |title=Couplings between changes in Climate System and the Biogeochemistry, 7.5.3 |author1=Keneth L. Denman |author2=Guy Brasseur |publisher=IPCC |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-04-09 |format=PDF |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has interfered with the  [[hydrological cycle]] by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a [[global cooling|cooling]] effect that may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gas]]es on [[global warming]].

Along with global warming, generalized [[climate change]] is an ongoing global commons concern.  Although global warming is now a generally accepted scientific observation, the precise causes of global warming are still a matter of research and debate. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) is an international environmental treaty that sets binding obligations on industrialised countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and prevent potentially harmful anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) interference in the climate system.&lt;ref name="unfccc2005"&gt;{{cite web |title=Article 2 |work=The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. |quote=Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner |url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |accessdate=15 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028023600/http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |archivedate=28 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 192 parties to the convention, including 191 states and the [[European Union]], but not all have ratified and implemented the protocol.&lt;ref name=UNamend&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=21 January 2013 |work=United Nations |url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |title=7.c Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114190559/http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar regions===
{{Main article|Polar regions|Climate change in the Arctic|Antarctic cooling controversy}}

The eight Arctic nations  [[Canada]],  [[Denmark]] ( [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]),  [[Norway]], the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Sweden]], [[Finland]],  [[Iceland]], and [[Russia]], are all members of the treaty organization, the [[Arctic Council]], as are organizations representing six [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]]. The Council operates on consensus basis, mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |title=Chronological lists of ratifications of, accessions and successions to the Convention and the related Agreements |publisher=United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414043900/http://www.un.org/depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |archivedate=14 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the [[Antarctic Treaty]] and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System or ATS, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to [[Antarctica]], Earth's only continent without a native human population. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and currently having 50 signatory nations, sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans [[Military activity in the Antarctic|military activity on that continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |title=Information about the Antarctic Treaty and how Antarctica is governed. |accessdate=February 6, 2011 |date=December 28, 2005 |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308064504/http://www.polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |archivedate=March 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outer space===
{{Main article|Outer space|Space law}}

Management of [[outer space]] global commons has been contentious since the successful launch of the [[Sputnik]] satellite by the former [[Soviet Union]] on 4 October 1957.  There is no clear boundary between [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, although there are several standard boundary designations: one that deals with [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]] (the [[Kármán line]]), one that depends on the velocity of charged particles in space, and some that are determined by human factors such as the height at which human blood begins to boil without a pressurized environment (the [[Armstrong line]]).

[[Space policy]] regarding a country's [[List of space agencies|civilian space program]], as well as its policy on both [[Militarisation of space|military use]] and [[Commercialization of space|commercial use]] of outer space, intersects with [[science policy]], since national space programs often perform or [[Funding of science|fund research]] in [[space science]], and also with [[defense policy]], for applications such as [[spy satellite]]s and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s.  It also encompasses government regulation of third-party activities such as commercial [[communications satellite]]s and [[private spaceflight]]&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Nathan C. |title=Space Policy:An Introduction |year=1992 |publisher=Iowa State University Press |location=Ames, IA |isbn=0-8138-1024-8 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the creation and application of [[space law]] and [[space advocacy]] organizations that exist to support the cause of space exploration.

The [[Outer Space Treaty]] provides a basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national [[sovereignty]]. It also prohibits the deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s in outer space. The treaty was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of mid-year, 2013 the treaty has been ratified by 102 states and signed by an additional 27 states.

Beginning in 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have concerned the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional [[space law]] treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. Still, there remain no legal prohibitions against deploying conventional weapons in space and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 [[Moon Treaty]] turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.

In 1976 eight equatorial states ([[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Republic of Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Zaire]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Indonesia]]) met in [[Bogotá]], Colombia to make the "Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries," also known as "the Bogotá Declaration", a claim to control the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country. These claims are not internationally accepted.

The [[International Space Station program]]me is a joint project among five participating space agencies: [[NASA]], the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (RSA), [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA). National budget constraints led to the merger of three space station projects into the [[International Space Station]]. In 1993 the partially built components for a Soviet/Russian space station [[Mir-2]], the proposed American [[Space Station Freedom|Freedom]], and the proposed European [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] merged into this multinational programme.&lt;ref name="ISSBook"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0387781440 |date=17 June 2008 |publisher=Springer-Praxis |author=John E. Catchpole |title=The International Space Station: Building for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The ISS is arguably the most expensive single item ever constructed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical.whatitcosts.com/facts-space-station.htm|title=How Much the International Space Station (ISS) Cost to Build|author=|date=14 April 2016|website=whatitcosts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be one of the most significant instances of international cooperation in modern history.

According to the original Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the RSA, the International Space Station was intended to be a laboratory, observatory and factory in space. It was also planned to provide transportation, maintenance, and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars and asteroids. In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, it was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Payette |first=Julie |title=Research and Diplomacy 350 Kilometers above the Earth: Lessons from the International Space Station |journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy |date=10 December 2012 |volume=1 |issue=4 |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2012/research-and-diplomacy-350-kilometers-above-earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and educational purposes.&lt;ref name=USNSP&gt;{{cite web |title=National Space Policy of the United States of America |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |publisher=White House; USA Federal government |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711205103/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
{{Main article|Digital commons (economics)}}

As a global system of [[computer]]s interconnected by [[telecommunication]] technologies consisting of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government resources, it is difficult to argue that the [[Internet]] is a global commons.  These computing resources are largely privately owned and subject to [[private property]] law, although many are government owned and subject to [[public law]]. The [[World Wide Web]], as a system of interlinked [[hypertext]] documents, either [[public domain]] (like Wikipedia itself) or subject to [[copyright law]], is, at best, a mixed [[good (economics)|good]].

The resultant [[Virtuality|virtual]] space or [[cyberspace]], however, is often viewed as an electronic global commons that allows for as much or more [[freedom of expression]] as any [[public space]]. Access to those [[Digital commons (economics)|digital commons]] and the actual freedom of expression allowed does vary widely by geographical area.  Management of the electronic global commons presents as many issues as do other commons.  In addition to issues related to [[digital divide|inequity in access]], issues such as [[net neutrality]], [[Internet censorship]], [[Internet privacy]], and electronic [[surveillance]] arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Governance of Cyberspace: Politics, Technology and Global Restructuring |publisher=Routledge |author=Loader, Brian D |year=2004 |isbn=978-0415147248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Governance}}
{{basic forms of government}}

'''Global governance''' or '''world governance''' is a movement towards political cooperation among [[transnationality|transnational]] actors, aimed at negotiating responses to problems that affect more than one state or region. Institutions of global [[governance]]—the [[United Nations]], the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[World Bank]], etc.—tend to have limited or demarcated [[Power in international relations|power]] to enforce compliance.  The modern question of world governance exists in the context of [[globalization]] and globalizing regimes of power: politically, economically and culturally.  In response to the acceleration of worldwide [[interdependence]], both between human societies and between humankind and the [[biosphere]], the term "global governance" may name the process of designating laws, rules, or regulations intended for a global scale.

Global governance is not a singular system. There is no "[[world government]]" but the many different regimes of global ''governance'' do have commonalities:
{{quote| While the contemporary system of global political relations is not integrated, the relation between the various regimes of global governance is not insignificant, and the system does have a common dominant organizational form. The dominant mode of organization today is bureaucratic rational—regularized, codified and rational. It is common to all modern regimes of political power and frames the transition from classical sovereignty to what David Held describes as the second regime of sovereignty—liberal international sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= Jmes | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition==

The term world governance is broadly used to designate all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. The Forum for a new World Governance defines world governance simply as "collective management of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001610/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique6&amp;lang=en Forum for a New World Governance ; ''Reasons for this Forum for a new World Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, ''[[government]]'' has been associated with "governing," or with political authority, institutions, and, ultimately, control. ''[[Governance]]'' denotes a process through which institutions coordinate and control independent social relations, and that have the ability to enforce, by force, their decisions. However, authors like [[James Rosenau]] have also used "governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority, such as in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;James Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance," ''in'' Martin Hewson and Timothy J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'' (Albany, NY: [[State University of New York]], 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some now speak of the development of "global public policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Diane |last=Stone |title=Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=19–38 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2007.00251.x |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1800/1/WRAP_Stone_Global_Agora__Transnational_Public_Policy_JPS.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adil Najam]], a scholar on the subject at the [[Pardee School of Global Studies]], [[Boston University]] has defined global governance simply as "the management of global processes in the absence of global government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailybruin.com/article/2006/10/a-closer-look-professor-seeks- | title=A Closer Look: Professor Seeks Stronger U.N. | publisher=[[The Daily Bruin]] | date=October 18, 2006 | accessdate=October 17, 2012 | author=Riazati, Saba}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas G. Weiss]], director of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at the Graduate Center ([[CUNY]]) and editor (2000–05) of the journal ''[[Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations]]'', "'Global governance'—which can be good, bad, or indifferent—refers to concrete cooperative problem-solving arrangements, many of which increasingly involve not only the United Nations of states but also 'other UNs,' namely international secretariats and other non-state actors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html The UN and Global Governance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821094009/http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html |date=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, global governance refers to the way in which global affairs are managed.

The definition is flexible in scope, applying to general subjects such as global security and order or to specific documents and agreements such as the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes|Code on the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes]]. The definition applies whether the participation is bilateral (e.g. an agreement to regulate usage of a river flowing in two countries), function-specific (e.g. a commodity agreement), regional (e.g. the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]]), or global (e.g. the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://maihold.org/mediapool/113/1132142/data/Finkelstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These "cooperative problem-solving arrangements" may be formal, taking the shape of laws or formally constituted institutions for a variety of actors (such as state authorities, [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), [[private sector]] entities, other [[civil society]] actors, and individuals) to manage collective affairs.&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be informal (as in the case of practices or guidelines) or ad hoc entities (as in the case of coalitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=International Organizations: The Politics and Processes of Global Governance, 2nd ed | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | author=Margaret P. Karns and Karen A. Mingst | year=2009 | location=[[Boulder, CO]] | page=633 | isbn=978-1-58826-698-9 | url=https://www.rienner.com/title/International_Organizations_The_Politics_and_Processes_of_Global_Governance_2nd_edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a single organization may take the nominal lead on an issue, for example the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in world trade affairs. Therefore, global governance is thought to be an international process of consensus-forming which generates guidelines and agreements that affect national governments and international corporations. Examples of such consensus would include WHO policies on health issues.

In short, global governance may be defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, Duties, obligations and privileges are established, and differences are mediated through educated professionals."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Ramesh Thakur, ''The UN and Global Governance: An Idea and Its Prospects'', [[Indiana University Press]], forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus Alexander, author of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid, an Overview of World Politics'', has described the current institutions of global governance as a system of [[global apartheid]], with numerous parallels with minority rule in the formal and informal structures of South Africa before 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics | publisher=Polity Press | author=Alexander, Titus | year= 1996 | pages=320 | url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745613536 | isbn=978-0-7456-1353-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 marked the end of [[Westphalian sovereignty|a long period of international history]] based on a policy of [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]s. Since this historic event, the planet has entered a phase of geostrategic breakdown. The national-security model, for example, while still in place for most governments, is gradually giving way to an emerging collective conscience that extends beyond the restricted framework it represents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 Blin, Arnaud ; Marin, Gustavo ; "Rethinking Global Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530202243/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 |date=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War world of the 1990s saw a new paradigm emerge based on a number of issues:

* The growing idea of globalization as a significant theme and the subsequent weakening of nation-states, points to a prospect of transferring to a global level of regulatory instruments. Upon the model that regulation was no longer working effectively at the national or regional levels.
* An intensification of environmental concerns, which received multilateral endorsement at the [[Earth Summit]]. The Summit issues, relating to the climate and [[biodiversity]], symbolized a new approach that was soon to be expressed conceptually by the term [[Global Commons]].
* The emergence of conflicts over standards: trade and the environment, trade and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]], trade and [[public health]]. These conflicts continued the traditional debate over the social effects of macroeconomic stabilization policies, and raised the question of arbitration among equally legitimate objectives in a compartmentalized governance system where the major areas of interdependence are each entrusted to a specialized international institution. Although often limited in scope, these conflicts are nevertheless symbolically powerful, as they raise the question of the principles and institutions of arbitration.
* An increased questioning of international standards and institutions by developing countries, which, having entered the global economy, find it hard to accept that industrialized countries hold onto power and give preference to their own interests. The challenge also comes from civil society, which considers that the international governance system has become the real seat of power and which rejects both its principles and procedures. Although these two lines of criticism often have conflicting beliefs and goals, they have been known to join in order to oppose the dominance of developed countries and major institutions, as demonstrated symbolically by the failure of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;For greater discussion, see: Andreani, Gilles; "Governance global : origines d'une idée"; ''Politique étrangère'', Nº 3, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;549–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

Global governance can be roughly divided into four stages:&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Agenda building|agenda-setting]]; 
# [[policy]]making, 
# [[implementation]] and [[enforcement]], and 
# [[evaluation]], [[wikt:monitoring|monitoring]], and [[adjudication]].

World authorities including international organizations and corporations achieve [[deference]] to their agenda through different means. Authority can derive from [[institution]]al status, [[expertise]], [[moral authority]], [[capacity building|capacity]], or perceived competence.&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 9–14. "If organizations like the United Nations (UN), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and Exxon are all (potentially) global governors, why are they in charge? Why does anyone pay attention to them? [...] We define authority as the ability to induce deference in others. [...] Deference to authority might take a variety of forms. Authority might cause actors to subordinate their own conscious preferences to the directives of the authority and thus, in Robert Dahl's (1957 and 1968) sense, get one actor to do what she would not otherwise do, but it might also have subtler effects. Authority might create new preferences in actors who were previously indifferent or at odds. It might change preferences in others who become persuaded to share the authority's views based on its moral standing or expertise."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James N. Rosenau]], "Global governance as disaggregated complexity"; in Ba &amp; Hoffmann (2005), pp. 140–41. "In other words, not only has the advent of network forms of organization undermined the authority of states, but in the context of our concern with GG, it has also had even more important consequences. Most notably, networks have contributed to the disaggregation of authority as well as the formation of new collectivities not founded on hierarchical principles. &lt;br&gt; If the notion that new rule systems can be founded on horizontal as well as vertical structures of authority seems awkward, it warrants reiterating that the core of effective authority lies in the compliance of those toward whom it is directed."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In its initial phase, world governance was able to draw on themes inherited from [[geopolitics]] and the theory of [[international relations]], such as peace, defense, [[geostrategy]], [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations, and [[International trade|trade relations]]. But as [[globalization]] progresses and the number of interdependences increases, the global level is also highly relevant to a far wider range of subjects. Following are a number of examples.

===Environmental governance and managing the planet===
"The crisis brought about by the accelerated pace and the probably irreversible character of the [[effect of human activity on the environment|effect of human activities on nature]] requires collective answers from governments and citizens. Nature ignores political and [[social barrier]]s, and the global dimension of the crisis cancels the effects of any action initiated unilaterally by state governments or sectoral institutions, however powerful they may be. [[Climate change]], [[ocean pollution|ocean]] and [[air pollution]], [[nuclear risk]]s and those related to [[genetic manipulation]], the reduction and [[extinction]] of resources and [[biodiversity]], and above all a development model that remains largely unquestioned globally are all among the various manifestations of this accelerated and probably irreversible effect.

This effect is the factor, in the framework of globalization, that most challenges a system of states competing with each other to the exclusion of all others: among the different fields of global governance, [[environmental management]] is the most wanting in urgent answers to the crisis in the form of collective actions by the whole of the human community. At the same time, these actions should help to model and strengthen the progressive building of this community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 Pelayo, G. (ed.) (2008, "Environmental Governance and Managing the Earth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143745/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals in this area have discussed the issue of how collective environmental action is possible. Many multilateral, environment-related agreements have been forged in the past 30 years, but their implementation remains difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Sustainable Development in a Global Context: A Success or a Nuisance?" New Global Studies 9.1 (2015): 27–56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some discussion on the possibility of setting up an international organization that would centralize all the issues related to international environmental protection, such as the proposed World Environment Organization (WEO). The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) could play this role, but it is a small-scale organization with a limited mandate. The question has given rise to two opposite views: the European Union, especially France and Germany, along with a number of NGOs, is in favor of creating a WEO; the United Kingdom, the USA, and most developing countries prefer opting for voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B. (2005), "International Environmental Governance: The next steps", in ''Synthèses'' N°02/2005. Iddri, 2005. 4 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes a "reform agenda" for global environmental governance. The main argument is that there seems to exist an unspoken but powerful consensus on the essential objectives of a system of global [[environmental governance]]. These goals would require top-quality leadership, a strong environmental policy based on knowledge, effective cohesion and coordination, good management of the institutions constituting the environmental governance system, and spreading environmental concerns and actions to other areas of international policy and action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Global_Environmental_Governance:_Elements_of_a_Reform_Agenda Najam, A., M. Papa and N. Taiyab (2007), "Global Environmental Governance: Elements of a Reform Agenda"], in Cleveland, C.J. (eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Earth'', Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A World Environment Organisation ====

The focus of environmental issues shifted to [[climate change]] from 1992 onwards.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Due to the transboundary nature of climate change, various calls have been made for a World Environment Organisation (WEO) (sometimes referred to as a Global Environment Organisation)&lt;ref&gt;Biermann, F., and Simonis, U.E., 1998.

===== Current global environmental governance =====

International environmental organisations do exist. The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), created in 1972, coordinates the environmental activity of countries in the UN.  UNEP and similar international environmental organisations are seen as not up to the task. They are criticised as being institutionally weak, fragmented, lacking in standing and providing non-optimal environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, G., 1992.

Reforming international environmental governance: an institutionalist critique of the proposal for a World Environmental Organisation. Politics, Law and Economics 4 pp. 359–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====A World Environment Organisation and the World Trade Organisation=====

Many proposals for the creation of a WEO have emerged from the trade and environment debate.&lt;ref name="Biermann"&gt;Biermann, F., 2001. The emerging debate on the need for a [[World Environmental Organization]]: a commentary. Global Environmental Politics, 1 pp. 45–55.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that instead of creating a WEO to safeguard the environment, environmental issues should be directly incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;von Moltke, K., 2001. The Organization of the Impossible. Global Environmental Politics 1 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO has “had success in integrating [[trade agreement]]s and opening up markets because it is able to apply legal pressure to nation states and resolve disputes”.&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; Greece and Germany are currently in discussion about the possibility of [[solar energy]] being used to repay some of Greece’s debt after their economy crashed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, H., 2011. Germany may buy Greeks’ sunshine. The Guardian, [online]6 October. Available at &lt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt; [Accessed 2 November 2011],&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange of resources, if it is accepted, is an example of increased international cooperation and an instance where the WTO could embrace energy trade agreements. If the future holds similar trade agreements, then an environmental branch of the WTO would surely be necessary. However critics of a WTO/WEO arrangement say that this would neither concentrate on more directly addressing underlying market failures, nor greatly improve rule-making.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"/&gt;

The creation of a new agency, whether it be linked to the WTO or not, has now been endorsed by [[Renato Ruggiero]], the former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as by the new WTO director-designate, [[Supachai Panitchpakdi]].&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; The debate over a global institutional framework for environmental issues will undoubtedly rumble on but at present there is little support for any one proposal.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

===Governance of the economy and of globalisation===
The [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]] may have undermined faith that [[laissez-faire capitalism]] will correct all serious financial malfunctioning on its own, as well as belief in the presumed independence of the economy from politics. It has been stated that, lacking in transparency and far from democratic, international financial institutions may be incapable of handling financial collapses. There are many who believe free-market capitalism may be incapable of forming the economic policy of a stable society, as it has been theorised that it can exacerbate inequalities.

Nonetheless, the debate on the potential failings of the system has led the academic world to seek solutions. According to Tubiana and Severino, "refocusing the doctrine of international cooperation on the concept of public goods offers the possibility . . . of breaking the deadlock in international negotiations on development, with the perception of shared interests breathing new life into an international solidarity that is running out of steam."&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L. and J.-M. Severino (2002), "Biens publics globaux, gouvernance mondiale et aide publique au développement", ''in'' Jacquet P., J. Pisani Ferry and L. Tubiana, ''Gouvernance mondiale'', La Documentation française, Les Rapports du CAE, N°37, pp. 349–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that a number of global public goods should be produced and supplied to the populations, but are not, and that a number of global [[externality|externalities]] should be taken into consideration, but are not. On the other hand, he contends, the international stage is often used to find solutions to completely unrelated problems under the protection of opacity and secrecy, which would be impossible in a national democratic framework.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?" ''in'' Touffut, J.-Ph. (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Cournot Centre for Economic Studies, Paris, pp. 149/164.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of international trade, Susan George states that ". . . in a rational world, it would be possible to construct a trading system serving the needs of people in both North and South. . . . Under such a system, crushing third world debt and the devastating structural adjustment policies applied by the World Bank and the IMF would have been unthinkable, although the system would not have abolished capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 George, S. (2007), "Alternative finances", ''Le Monde Diplomatique'', January.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143817/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and institutional governance===
Building a responsible world governance that would make it possible to adapt the political organization of society to globalization implies establishing a democratic political legitimacy at every level: local, national, regional and global.

Obtaining this legitimacy requires rethinking and reforming, all at the same time:
* the fuzzy maze of various international organizations, instituted mostly in the wake of World War II; what is needed is a system of international organizations with greater resources and a greater intervention capacity, more transparent, fairer, and more democratic;
* the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian system]], the very nature of states along with the role they play with regard to the other institutions, and their relations to each other; states will have to share part of their sovereignty with institutions and bodies at other territorial levels, and all with have to begin a major process to deepen democracy and make their organization more responsible;
* the meaning of citizen sovereignty in the different government systems and the role of citizens as political protagonists; there is a need to rethink the meaning of political representation and participation and to sow the seeds of a radical change of consciousness that will make it possible to move in the direction of a situation in which citizens, in practice, will play the leading role at every scale.

The political aspect of world governance is discussed in greater detail in the section [[Global governance#Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance|Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance]]

===Governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution===
Armed conflicts have changed in form and intensity since the Berlin wall came down in 1989. The events of [[9/11]], the wars [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], and repeated terrorist attacks all show that conflicts can repercuss well beyond the belligerents directly involved. The major powers and especially the United States, have used war as a means of resolving conflicts and may well continue to do so. If many in the United States believe that fundamentalist Muslim networks are likely to continue to launch attacks, in Europe nationalist movements have proved to be the most persistent terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Girard|first=Quentin|title=En Europe les actes terroristes islamiques sont rares|journal=Libération|date=July 27, 2011|url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/01012351351-en-europe-les-actes-terroristes-islamistes-sont-rares}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global War on Terrorism]] arguably presents a form of emerging global governance in the sphere of security with the United States leading cooperation among the Western states, non-Western nations and international institutions. Beyer argues that participation in this form of 'hegemonic governance' is caused both by a shared identity and ideology with the US, as well as cost-benefit considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Anna Cornelia (2010), "Counterterrorism and International Power Relations", IB Tauris, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesawar school attack 2014 is a big challenge to us. Militants from the Pakistani Taliban have attacked an army-run school in Peshawar, killing 141 people, 132 of them children, the military say.

At the same time, civil wars continue to break out across the world, particularly in areas where civil and human rights are not respected, such as Central and Eastern Africa and the Middle East. These and other regions remain deeply entrenched in permanent crises, hampered by authoritarian regimes, many of them being supported by the United States, reducing entire swathes of the population to wretched living conditions. The wars and conflicts we are faced with have a variety of causes: economic inequality, social conflict, religious sectarianism, Western imperialism, colonial legacies, disputes over territory and over control of basic resources such as water or land. They are all illustrations a deep-rooted crisis of world governance.

The resulting bellicose climate imbues international relations with competitive nationalism and contributes, in rich and poor countries alike, to increasing military budgets, siphoning off huge sums of public money to the benefit of the arms industry and military-oriented scientific innovation, hence fueling global insecurity. Of these enormous sums, a fraction would be enough to provide a permanent solution for the basic needs of the planet's population hence practically eliminating the causes of war and terrorism.

Andrée Michel argues that the arms race is not only proceeding with greater vigor, it is the surest means for Western countries to maintain their hegemony over countries of the South. Following the break-up of the Eastern bloc countries, she maintains, a strategy for the manipulation of the masses was set up with a permanent invention of an enemy (currently incarnated by Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea) and by kindling fear and hate of others to justify perpetuating the [[Military–industrial complex]] and arms sales. The author also recalls that the "Big Five" at the UN who have the veto right are responsible for 85% of arms sales around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Andrée (1999), ''Surarmement, pouvoirs, démocratie''; L'Harmattan, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals for the governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution begin by addressing [[positive peace|prevention of the causes of conflicts]], whether economic, social, religious, political, or territorial. This requires assigning more resources to improving people's living conditions—health, accommodation, food, and work—and to education, including education in the values of [[peace]], [[social justice]], and unity and diversity as two sides of the same coin representing the global village.

Resources for peace could be obtained by regulating, or even reducing military budgets, which have done nothing but rise in the past recent years. This process could go hand in hand with plans for global disarmament and the conversion of arms industries, applied proportionally to all countries, including the major powers. Unfortunately, the warlike climate of the last decade has served to relegate all plans for global disarmament, even in civil-society debates, and to pigeonhole them as a long-term goal or even a Utopian vision. This is definitely a setback for the cause of peace and for humankind, but it is far from being a permanent obstacle.

International institutions also have a role to play in resolving armed conflicts. Small international rapid deployment units could intervene in these with an exclusive mandate granted by a reformed and democratic United Nations system or by relevant regional authorities such as the European Union. These units could be formed specifically for each conflict, using armies from several countries as was the case when the [[UNIFIL]] was reinforced during the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. On the other hand, no national army would be authorized to intervene unilaterally outside its territory without a UN or regional mandate.

Another issue that is worth addressing concerns the legitimate conditions for the use of force and conduct during war. Jean-Réné Bachelet offers an answer with the conceptualization of a military ethics corresponding to the need for a "principle of humanity." The author defines this principle as follows: "All human beings, whatever their race, nationality, gender, age, opinion, or religion, belong to one same humanity, and every individual has an inalienable right to respect for his life, integrity, and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 Bachelet, Jean-René; ''Military Ethics for a Better World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143947/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance of science, education, information, and communications===
The World Trade Organization's (WTO) agenda of liberalizing public goods and services are related to culture, science, education, health, living organisms, information, and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine HACKER, “ Cultiver la créativité, corollaire de la diversité culturelle européenne ”, Revue Géoéconomie : Cinéma: le déclin de l'empire américain?, numéro 58 – été 2011 : http://www.choiseul-editions.com/documents/BC-G58.pdf?PHPSESSID=cab73ffbe617a07900584f09d655e3d0&lt;/ref&gt; This plan has been only partially offset by the [[alter-globalization movement]], starting with [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the events]] that took place at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999|1999 Seattle meeting]], and on a totally different and probably far more influential scale in the medium and long term, by the astounding explosion of collaborative practices on the [[Internet]]. However, lacking political and widespread citizen support as well as sufficient resources, [[civil society]] has not so far been able to develop and disseminate alternative plans for society as a whole on a global scale, even though plenty of proposals and initiatives have been developed, some more successful than others, to build a fairer, more responsible, and more solidarity-based world in all of these areas.

Above all, each country tries to impose their values and collective preferences within international institutions such like WTO or UNESCO, particularly in the Medias sector. This is an excellent opportunity to promote their soft power, for instance with the promotion of the cinema&lt;ref&gt;Economic warfare on the silver screen- Interview of Violaine Hacker, {{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Economic warfare on the silver screen |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= |date=1970-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as science is concerned, "[r]esearch increasingly bows to the needs of financial markets, turning competence and knowledge into commodities, making employment flexible and informal, and establishing contracts based on goals and profits for the benefit of private interests in compliance with the competition principle. The directions that research has taken in the past two decades and the changes it has undergone have drastically removed it from its initial mission (producing competence and knowledge, maintaining independence) with no questioning of its current and future missions. Despite the progress, or perhaps even as its consequence, humankind continues to face critical problems: poverty and hunger are yet to be vanquished, nuclear arms are proliferating, environmental disasters are on the rise, social injustice is growing, and so on.

Neoliberal commercialization of the commons favors the interests of pharmaceutical companies instead of the patients', of food-processing companies instead of the farmers' and consumers'. Public research policies have done nothing but support this process of economic profitability, where research results are increasingly judged by the financial markets. The system of systematically patenting knowledge and living organisms is thus being imposed throughout the planet through the 1994 WTO agreements on intellectual property. Research in many areas is now being directed by private companies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 "Atelier de la Fondation Sciences citoyennes au Forum social mondial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714091819/http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 |date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the global level, "[i]nstitutions dominating a specific sector also, at every level, present the risk of reliance on technical bodies that use their own references and deliberate in an isolated environment. This process can be observed with the 'community of patents' that promotes the patenting of living organisms, as well as with authorities controlling nuclear energy. This inward-looking approach is all the more dangerous that communities of experts are, in all complex technical and legal spheres, increasingly dominated by the major economic organizations that finance research and development."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

On the other hand, several innovative experiments have emerged in the sphere of science, such as: [[conscience clauses]] and citizens' panels as a tool for democratizing the production system: [[science shop]]s and [[Citizen science|community-based research]]. Politically committed scientists are also increasingly organizing at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/ocbr/assets/pdfs/Global%20Alliance.pdf Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research; ''Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research'']{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as education is concerned, the effect of commoditization can be seen in the serious tightening of education budgets, which affects the quality of general education as a public service. The Global Future Online report reminds us that ". . . at the half-way point towards 2015 ''(author's note: the deadline for the [[Millennium Goals]])'', the gaps are daunting: 80 million children (44 million of them girls) are out of school, with marginalized groups (26 million disabled and 30 million conflict-affected children) continuing to be excluded. And while universal access is critical, it must be coupled with improved learning outcomes—in particular, children achieving the basic literacy, numeracy and life skills essential for poverty reduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfutureonline.org/PolicyAdvocacy/GlblFutr.nsf/issues/92F9DA0279CC03A28825738B0019CDEC?OpenDocument|title=globalfutureonline.org - This website is for sale! - Global Future world vision human development child rights poverty aids peace conflict global Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.globalfutureonline.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to making the current educational system available universally, there is also a call to improve the system and adapt it to the speed of changes in a complex and unpredictable world. On this point, Edgar Morin asserts that we must "[r]ethink our way of organizing knowledge. This means breaking down the traditional barriers between disciplines and designing new ways to reconnect that which has been torn apart." The UNESCO report drawn up by Morin contains "seven principles for education of the future": detecting the error and illusion that have always parasitized the human spirit and human behavior; making knowledge relevant, i.e. a way of thinking that makes distinctions and connections; teaching the human condition; teaching terrestrial identity; facing human and scientific uncertainties and teaching strategies to deal with them; teaching understanding of the self and of others, and an ethics for humankind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 Morin, Edgar; ''Seven Complex Lessons in Education for the Future''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144020/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exponential growth of new technologies, the Internet in particular, has gone hand in hand with the development over the last decade of a global community producing and exchanging goods. This development is permanently altering the shape of the entertainment, publishing, and music and media industries, among others. It is also influencing the social behavior of increasing numbers of people, along with the way in which institutions, businesses, and civil society are organized. [[Peer-to-peer]] communities and collective knowledge-building projects such as [[Wikipedia]] have involved millions of users around the world. There are even more innovative initiatives, such as alternatives to private copyright such as [[Creative Commons]], cyber democracy practices, and a real possibility of developing them on the sectoral, regional, and global levels.

==Regional views==
Regional players, whether regional conglomerates such as [[Mercosur]] and the European Union, or major countries seen as key regional players such as China, the United States, and India, are taking a growing interest in world governance.&lt;ref name="ORF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Governance|url=http://www.orfonline.org/programme/global-governance/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of discussion of this issue can be found in the works of: Martina Timmermann ''et al.'', ''Institutionalizing Northeast Asia: Regional Steps toward Global Governance'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/institutionalizing_Northeast_Asia_web.pdf Timmermann, M. and J.

Interdependence among countries and regions hardly being refutable today, regional integration is increasingly seen not only as a process in itself, but also in its relation to the rest of the world, sometimes turning questions like "What can the world bring to my country or region?" into "What can my country or region bring to the rest of the world?" Following are a few examples of how regional players are dealing with these questions.

===Africa===
Often seen as a problem to be solved rather than a people or region with an opinion to express on international policy, Africans and Africa draw on a philosophical tradition of community and social solidarity that can serve as inspiration to the rest of the world and contribute to building world governance. One example is given by Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni when he reminds us of the relevance of the Ubuntu concept, which stresses the interdependence of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni; ''Giving Africa Voice within Global Governance: Oral History, Human Rights and the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144623/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

African civil society has thus begun to draw up proposals for governance of the continent, which factor in all of the dimensions: local, African, and global. Examples include proposals by the network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique" for "the construction of a local legitimate governance," state reform "capable of meeting the continent's development challenges," and "effective regional governance to put an end to Africa's marginalization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-gouvernance.net/fiches/bipint/fiche-bipint-63.html Network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique"; ''Changeons l’Afrique, 15 propositions pour commencer...'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Foreign-policy proposals announced by President [[Barack Obama]] include restoring the [[Global Poverty Act]], which aims to contribute to meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the world population living on less than a dollar a day by 2015. Foreign aid is expected to double to 50 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24757.html "Record $49B foreign aid budget clears House" in ''Politico'', July 9, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The money will be used to help build educated and healthy communities, reduce poverty and improve the population's health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 "In Defense of Aid" in ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', July 17, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723092252/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 |date=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of international institutions, The White House Web site advocates reform of the World Bank and the IMF, without going into any detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point/|title="A Turning Point" April 2, 2009|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613174551/https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are further points in the Obama-Biden plan for foreign policy directly related to world governance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php "Foreign Policy" in ''Organizing for America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707091922/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php |date=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty;
* global de-nuclearization in several stages including stepping up cooperation with Russia to significantly reduce stocks of nuclear arms in both countries;
* revision of the culture of secrecy: institution of a National Declassification Center to make declassification secure but routine, efficient, and cost-effective;
* increase in global funds for AIDS, TB and malaria. Eradication of malaria-related deaths by 2015 by making medicines and mosquito nets far more widely available;
* increase in aid for children and maternal health as well as access to reproductive health-care programs;
* creation of a 2-billion-dollar global fund for education. Increased funds for providing access to drinking water and sanitation;
* other similarly large-scale measures covering agriculture, small- and medium-sized enterprises and support for a model of international trade that fosters job creation and improves the quality of life in poor countries;
* in terms of energy and global warming, Obama advocates a) an 80% reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 b) investing 150 billion dollars in alternative energies over the next 10 years and c) creating a Global Energy Forum capable of initiating a new generation of climate protocols.

===Latin America===
The 21st century has seen the arrival of a new and diverse generation of left-wing governments in Latin America. This has opened the door to initiatives to launch political and governance renewal. A number of these initiatives are significant for the way they redefine the role of the state by drawing on citizen participation, and can thus serve as a model for a future world governance built first and foremost on the voice of the people. The constituent assemblies in Ecuador and Bolivia are fundamental examples of this phenomenon.

In Ecuador, social and indigenous movements were behind the discussions that began in 1990 on setting up a constituent assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml Servicio Informativo "Alai-amlatina"; Asamblea Constituyente (Ecuador)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305040740/http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml |date=2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Rafael Correa's arrival at the head of the country in November 2006, widespread popular action with the slogan "''que se vayan todos''" (let them all go away) succeeded in getting all the political parties of congress to accept a convocation for a referendum on setting up the assembly.

In April 2007, Rafael Correa's government organized a consultation with the people to approve setting up a constituent assembly. Once it was approved, 130 members of the assembly were elected in September, including 100 provincial members, 24 national members and 6 for migrants in Europe, Latin America and the USA. The assembly was officially established in November. Assembly members belonged to traditional political parties as well as the [[new social movements]]. In July 2008, the assembly completed the text for the new constitution and in September 2008 there was a referendum to approve it. Approval for the new text won out, with 63.9% of votes for compared to 28.1% of votes against and a 24.3% abstention rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleaecuador.org Asamblea Constituyente Ecuador 2008; ''Nueva Constitución del Ecuador'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution establishes the rule of law on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights (ESCER). It transforms the legal model of the social state subject to the rule of law into a "constitution of guaranteed well-being" (''Constitución del bienestar garantizado'') inspired by the ancestral community ideology of "good living" propounded by the Quechuas of the past, as well as by 21st century socialist ideology. The constitution promotes the concept of food sovereignty by establishing a protectionist system that favors domestic production and trade. It also develops a model of public aid for education, health, infrastructures and other services.

In addition, it adds to the three traditional powers, a fourth power called the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, made up of former constitutional control bodies and social movements, and mandated to assess whether public policies are constitutional or not.

The new Bolivian constitution was approved on 25 January 2009 by referendum, with 61.4% votes in favor, 38.6% against and a 90.2% turnout. The proposed constitution was prepared by a constituent assembly that did not only reflect the interests of political parties and the elite, but also represented the indigenous peoples and social movements. As in Ecuador, the proclamation of a constituent assembly was demanded by the people, starting in 1990 at a gathering of indigenous peoples from the entire country, continuing with the indigenous marches in the early 2000s and then with the Program Unity Pact (''Pacto de Unidad Programático'') established by family farmers and indigenous people in September 2004 in Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedib.org/dac ''Hacia una Asamblea Constituyente soberana y participativa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125005025/http://www.cedib.org/dac/ |date=2005-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution recognizes the autonomy of indigenous peoples, the existence of a specific indigenous legal system, exclusive ownership of forest resources by each community and a quota of indigenous members of parliament. It grants autonomy to counties, which have the right to manage their natural resources and elect their representatives directly. The ''latifundio'' system has been outlawed, with maximum ownership of 5,000 hectares allowed per person. Access to water and sanitation are covered by the constitution as human rights that the state has to guarantee, as well as other basic services such as electricity, gas, postal services, and telecommunications that can be provided by either the state or contracting companies. The new constitution also establishes a social and community economic model made up of public, private, and social organizations, and cooperatives. It guarantees private initiative and freedom of enterprise, and assigns public organizations the task of managing natural resources and related processes as well as developing public services covered by the constitution. National and cooperative investment is favored over private and international investment.
The "unitary plurinational" state of Bolivia has 36 official indigenous languages along with Spanish. Natural resources belong to the people and are administered by the state. The form of democracy in place is no longer considered as exclusively representative and/or based on parties. Thus, "the people deliberate and exercise government via their representatives and the constituent assembly, the citizen legislative initiative and the referendum . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 4. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "popular representation is exercised via the political parties, citizen groups, and indigenous peoples."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 222&lt;/ref&gt; This way, "political parties, and/or citizen groups and/or indigenous peoples can present candidates directly for the offices of president, vice-president, senator, house representative, constituent-assembly member, councilor, mayor, and municipal agent. The same conditions apply legally to all. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Latin America: "[[Amazon basin|Amazonia]] . . . is an enormous biodiversity reservoir and a major climate-regulation agent for the planet but is being ravaged and deteriorated at an accelerated pace; it is a territory almost entirely devoid of governance, but also a breeding place of grassroots organization initiatives.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; ''What Amazonia Does the World Need?'', Rio de Janeiro, 2008, p. 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Amazonia can be the fertile field of a true school of 'good' governance if it is looked after as a common and valuable good, first by Brazilians (65% of Amazonia is within Brazilian borders) and the people of the South American countries surrounding it, but also by all the Earth's inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. p. 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, "[f]rom a world-governance perspective, [Amazonia] is in a way an enormous laboratory. Among other things, Amazonia enables a detailed examination of the negative effects of productivism and of the different forms of environmental packaging it can hide behind, including 'sustainable development.' Galloping urbanization, Human Rights violations, the many different types of conflicts (14 different types of conflicts have been identified within the hundreds of cases observed in Amazonia), protection of indigenous populations and their active participation in local governance: these are among the many Amazonian challenges also affecting the planet as a whole, not to mention the environment. The hosts of local initiatives, including among the indigenous populations, are however what may be most interesting in Amazonia in that they testify to the real, concrete possibility of a different form of organization that combines a healthy local economy, good social cohesion, and a true model of sustainable development—this time not disguised as something else. All of this makes Amazonia 'a territory of solutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. pp. 34–41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arnaud Blin, the Amazonian problem helps to define certain fundamental questions on the future of humankind. First, there is the question of social justice: "[H]ow do we build a new model of civilization that promotes social justice? How do we set up a new social architecture that allows us to live together?" The author goes on to refer to concepts such as the concept of "people's territory " or even "life territory" rooted in the indigenous tradition and serving to challenge private property and social injustice. He then suggests that the emerging concept of the "responsibility to protect," following up on the "right of humanitarian intervention" and until now used to try to protect populations endangered by civil wars, could also be applied to populations threatened by economic predation and to environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The growing interest in world governance in Asia represents an alternative approach to official messages, dominated by states' nationalist visions. An initiative to develop proposals for world governance took place in Shanghai in 2006, attended by young people from every continent. The initiative produced ideas and projects that can be classified as two types: the first and more traditional type, covering the creation of a number of new institutions such as an International Emissions Organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 Expanding and Reinforcing the Objectives of the Kyoto Protocol: Inciting International Stakeholders to Engage in Greenhouse-gas Transparency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second more innovative type based on organizing network-based systems. For example, a system of cooperative control on a worldwide level among states&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Conference for Climate Change''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810043211/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-organization of civil society into networks using new technologies, a process that should serve to set up a ''Global Calling-for-Help Center'' or a new model based on citizens who communicate freely, share information, hold discussions, and seek consensus-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 Global Calling-for-Help Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144601/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would use the Internet and the media, working within several types of organizations: universities, NGOs, local volunteers and civil-society groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 World Team E. Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Greenhouse-gas Emissions and Global Mitigation Efforts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144206/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the demographic importance of the continent, the development of discussion on governance and practices in Asia at the regional level, as well as global-level proposals, will be decisive in the years ahead in the strengthening of global dialog among all sorts of stakeholders, a dialog that should produce a fairer world order.(See [[Kishore Mahbubani]]).

===Europe===
According to [[Michel Rocard]], Europe does not have a shared vision, but a collective history that allows Europeans to opt for projects for gradual political construction such as the European Union. Drawing on this observation, Rocard conceives of a European perspective that supports the development of three strategies for constructing world governance: reforming the UN, drawing up international treaties to serve as the main source of global regulations, and "the progressive penetration of the international scene by justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel ; ''World Governance. A Personal European View''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocard considers that there are a number of "great questions of the present days" including recognition by all nations of the [[International Criminal Court]], the option of an international police force authorized to arrest international criminals, and the institution of judicial procedures to deal with tax havens, massively polluting activities, and states supporting terrorist activities. He also outlines "new problems" that should foster debate in the years to come on questions such as a project for a Declaration of Interdependence, how to re-equilibrate world trade and WTO activities, and how to create world regulations for managing collective goods (air, drinking water, oil, etc.) and services (education, health, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel; ''Ibid.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ortega similarly suggests that the European Union should make a more substantial contribution to global governance, particularly through concerted action in international bodies. European states, for instance, should reach an agreement on the reform of the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ortega, Building the future: the EU's contribution to global governance, ISS, Paris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[European Strategy and Policy Analysis System]] (ESPAS), an inter-institutional pilot project of the European Union which aims to assist EU policy formulation through the identification and critical analysis of long-term global trends, highlighted the importance of expanding global governance over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System"&gt;{{cite web|last=ESPAS|title=The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System|url=http://www.espas.europa.eu/home/|publisher=EUISS|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders' views==
It is too soon to give a general account of the view of world-governance stakeholders, although interest in world governance is on the rise on the regional level, and we will certainly see different types of stakeholders and social sectors working to varying degrees at the international level and taking a stand on the issue in the years to come.

===Institutional and state stakeholders===

===Members of parliament===
The World Parliamentary Forum, open to members of parliament from all nations and held every year at the same time as the [[World Social Forum]], drew up a declaration at the sixth forum in Caracas in 2006. The declaration contains a series of proposals that express participants' opinion on the changes referred to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 World Parliamentary Forum, "Final Declaration of the Sixth World Parliamentary Forum - Caracas 2006"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144303/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional organizations===
The European Commission referred to global governance in its White Paper on European Governance. It contends that the search for better global governance draws on the same set of shared challenges humanity is currently facing. These challenges can be summed up by a series of goals: [[sustainable development]], [[security]], [[peace]] and equity (in the sense of "fairness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225182328/http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }} "Global governance: contribution of the European Union"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-state stakeholders===
The freedom of thought enjoyed by non-state stakeholders enables them to formulate truly alternative ideas on world-governance issues, but they have taken little or no advantage of this opportunity.

Pierre Calame believes that "[n]on-state actors have always played an essential role in global regulation, but their role will grow considerably in this, the beginning of the twenty-first Century . . . Non-state actors play a key role in world governance in different domains . . . To better understand and develop the non-state actors' role, it should be studied in conjunction with the general principles of governance." "Non-state actors, due to their vocation, size, flexibility, methods of organization and action, interact with states in an equal manner; however this does not mean that their action is better adapted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en Calame, Pierre ; "Non-state Actors and World Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144347/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative idea encapsulated by many not-for-profit organisations relates to ideas in the '[[Human Potential Movement]]' and might be summarised as a mission statement along these lines: 'To create an accepted framework for all humankind, that is self-regulating and which enables every person to achieve their fullest potential in harmony with the world and its place in existence.'

Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, references to the universal collective of humanity have begun using the term 'humankind' rather than 'mankind', given the gender neutral quality of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2682&amp;context=facpub Weiss, E.B. 2012. "The Coming Water Crisis: A Common Concern of Humankind"]. Transnational Environmental Law 1(1) 153-168, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Self-regulation' is meant to invoke the concept of [[regulation]] which includes [[rule-making]] such as laws, and related ideas e.g. [[legal doctrine]] as well as other frameworks. However its scope is wider than this and intended to encompass [[cybernetics]] which allows for the study of regulation in as many varied contexts as possible from the [[regulation of gene expression]] to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] for example.

===World Religious Leaders===
Since 2005, religious leaders from a diverse array of faith traditions have engaged in dialogue with G8 leaders around issues of global governance and world risk. Drawing on the cultural capital of diverse religious traditions, they seek to strengthen democratic norms by influencing political leaders to include the interests of the most vulnerable when they make their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/3/4/2158244013511830.full|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Sage Open|volume=3|issue=4|pages=215824401351183|doi=10.1177/2158244013511830|year=2013|last1=Steiner|first1=Sherrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that religion is a key to transforming or fixing global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Page, J. 2015. [http://e-publications.une.edu.au/1959.11/18560 ''Fixing global governance''], Online Opinion, 29 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals==
Several stakeholders have produced lists of proposals for a new world governance that is fairer, more responsible, solidarity-based, interconnected and respectful of the planet's diversity. Some examples are given below.

Joseph E. Stiglitz proposes a list of reforms related to the internal organization of international institutions and their external role in the framework of global-governance architecture. He also deals with global taxation, the management of global resources and the environment, the production and protection of global knowledge, and the need for a global legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2004), "The Future of Global Governance", in ''Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD)'', IPD Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other proposals are contained in the World Governance Proposal Paper: giving concrete expression to the principle of responsibility; granting civil society greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; granting national parliaments greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; re-equilibrating trade mechanisms and adopting regulations to benefit the southern hemisphere; speeding up the institution of regional bodies; extending and specifying the concept of the commons; redefining proposal and decision-making powers in order to reform the United Nations; developing independent observation, early-warning, and assessment systems; diversifying and stabilizing the basis for financing international collective action; and engaging in a wide-reaching process of consultation, a new Bretton Woods for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article455.html|title=Redefining Global Governance to Meet the Challenges of (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list provides more examples of proposals:
* the security of societies and its correlation with the need for global reforms——a controlled legally-based economy focused on stability, growth, full employment, and North-South convergence;
* equal rights for all, implying the institution of a global redistribution process;
* eradication of poverty in all countries;
* sustainable development on a global scale as an absolute imperative in political action at all levels;
* fight against the roots of terrorism and crime;
* consistent, effective, and fully democratic international institutions;
* Europe sharing its experience in meeting the challenges of globalization and adopting genuine partnership strategies to build a new form of multilateralism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 Groupe de réflexion "Europe-Mondialisation"; ''For Global Reform, a Social Democratic Approach to Globalization''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144357/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Rajesh Tandon, president of the FIM (Montreal International Forum) and of PRIA (Participatory Research in Asia), prepared a framework document entitled "Democratization of Global Governance for Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) conference." He used the document to present five principles that could provide a basis for civil society actions: "Global institutions and agenda should be subjected to democratic political accountability."
* Democratic policy at the global level requires legitimacy of popular control through representative and direct mechanisms.
* Citizen participation in decision making at global levels requires equality of opportunity to all citizens of the world.
* Multiple spheres of governance, from local to provincial to national to regional and global, should mutually support democratization of decision making at all levels.
* Global democracy must guarantee that global public goods are equitably accessible to all citizens of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 Montréal International Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144412/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 |date=2011-10-04 }} ''Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) Conference Report''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Blockchain]] and decentralized platforms can be considered as hyper-political and Global governance tools, capable to manage social interactions on large scale and dismiss traditional central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=083008085091002109121009065100004023014014073092023027101003105086026068106093094125028029021119038017111106028120127023006025122075014092018092000116116089077006022040064023094030088126123026089120094115011009112098106023016006031019067125067008114064&amp;EXT=pdf] ''Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance: Is the State Still Necessary?
 [[SSRN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Vijaya Ramachandran, Enrique Rueda-Sabater and Robin Kraft also define principles for representation of nations and populations in the system of global governance.  They propose a "Two Percent Club" that would provide for direct representation of nations with at least two percent of global population or global GDP; other nations would be represented within international fora through regional blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122466878/abstract|title=Rethinking Fundamental Principles of Global Governance: How to Represent States and Populations in Multilateral Institutions|first1=VIJAYA|last1=RAMACHANDRAN|first2=ENRIQUE J.|last2=RUEDA-SABATER|first3=ROBIN|last3=KRAFT|date=1 July 2009|journal=Governance|volume=22|issue=3|pages=341–351|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01442.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic tool or discipline==
In the light of the unclear meaning of the term "global governance" as a concept in international politics,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2014), "Rethinking Global Governance? Complexity, Authority, Power and Change", International Studies Quarterly, 58: 1, pp. 207-215&lt;/ref&gt; some authors have proposed defining it not in substantive, but in disciplinary and methodological terms. For these authors, global governance is better understood as an analytical concept or optic that provides a specific perspective on world politics different from that of conventional [[international relations]]&lt;ref&gt;K.Dingwerth and P.Pattberg, "Global Governance as a Perspective on World Politics", (2006) Global Governance vol. 12:198.&lt;/ref&gt; theory. [[Thomas G. Weiss]] and [[Rorden Wilkinson]] have even argued that global governance has the capacity to overcome some of the fragmentation of [[international relations]] as a discipline&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson 920140, "Global Governance to the Rescue: Saving International Relations?", Global Governance, 20: 1, pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when understood as a set of questions about the governance of world orders.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2019), Rethinking Global Governance, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|9781509527243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities, including those offering courses in [[international relations]], have begun to establish degree programmes in global governance.

==Context==
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}
There are those who believe that world architecture depends on establishing a system of world governance. However, the equation is currently becoming far more complicated: Whereas the process used to be about regulating and limiting the individual power of states to avoid disturbing or overturning the status quo, the issue for today's world governance is to have a collective influence on the world's destiny by establishing a system for regulating the many interactions that lie beyond the province of state action. The political homogenization of the planet that has followed the advent of what is known as liberal democracy in its many forms should make it easier to establish a world governance system that goes beyond market laissez-faire and the democratic peace originally formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]], which constitutes a sort of geopolitical laissez-faire.

Another view regarding the establishment of global governance is based on the difficulties to achieve equitable development at the world scale. "To secure for all human beings in all parts of the world the conditions allowing a decent and meaningful life requires enormous human energies and far-reaching changes in policies. The task is all the more demanding as the world faces numerous other problems, each related to or even part of the development challenge, each similarly pressing, and each calling for the same urgent attention. But, as [[Arnold Toynbee]] has said, 'Our age is the first generation since the dawn of history in which mankind dares to believe it practical to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001055/105586e.pdf UNESCO (1996), ''Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development'', Summary Version, UNESCO, Paris.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need===
Because of the heterogeneity of preferences, which are enduring despite globalization, are often perceived as an implacable homogenization process. Americans and Europeans provide a good example of this point: on some issues they have differing common grounds in which the division between the public and private spheres still exist. Tolerance for inequalities and the growing demand for redistribution, attitudes toward risk, and over property rights vs human rights, set the stage. In certain cases, globalization even serves to accentuate differences rather than as a force for homogenization. Responsibility must play its part with respect to regional and International governments, when balancing the needs of its citizenry.

With the growing emergence of a global civic awareness, comes opposition to globalization and its effects. A rapidly growing number of movements and organizations have taken the debate to the international level. Although it may have limitations, this trend is one response to the increasing importance of world issues, that effect the planet.

=== Crisis of purpose ===
Pierre Jacquet, Jean Pisani-Ferry, and [[Laurence Tubiana]] argue that "[t]o ensure that decisions taken for international integration are sustainable, it is important that populations see the benefits, that states agree on their goals and that the institutions governing the process are seen as legitimate. These three conditions are only partially being met. Taklya"

The authors refer to a "crisis of purpose" and international institutions suffering from "imbalance" and inadequacy. They believe that for these institutions, "a gap has been created between the nature of the problems that need tackling and an institutional architecture which does not reflect the hierarchy of today's problems. For example, the environment has become a subject of major concern and central negotiation, but it does not have the institutional support that is compatible with its importance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf Pierre Jacquet; Jean Pisani-Ferry; Laurence Tubiana; ''À la recherche de la gouvernance mondiale''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905000313/http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World government===
Global governance is not [[world government]], and even less [[democratic globalization]]. In fact, global governance would not be necessary, were there a world government. Domestic governments have monopolies on the use of force—the power of enforcement. Global governance refers to the political interaction that is required to solve problems that affect more than one state or region when there is no power to enforce compliance.  Problems arise, and networks of actors are constructed to deal with them in the absence of an international analogue to a domestic [[government]]. This system has been termed [[disaggregated sovereignty]].

===Consensus example===
Improved global problem solving need not involve the establishment of additional powerful formal global institutions. It does involve building consensus on norms and practices. One such area, currently under construction, is the development and improvement of accountability mechanisms. For example, the [[UN Global Compact]] brings together companies, UN agencies, labor organizations, and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles. Participation is entirely voluntary, and there is no enforcement of the principles by an outside regulatory body. Companies adhere to these practices both because they make economic sense, and because [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], especially [[shareholders]], can monitor their compliance easily. Mechanisms such as the Global Compact can improve the ability of affected individuals and populations to hold companies accountable. However, corporations participating in the UN Global Compact have been criticized for their merely minimal standards, the absence of sanction-and-control measures, their lack of commitment to social and ecological standards, minimal acceptance among corporations around the world, and the high cost involved in reporting annually to small and medium-sized business&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-ethic-now.de/gen-eng/0d_weltethos-und-wirtschaft/0d-03-neue-art/0d-03-106-global-com-kritik.php A Global Ethic Now!; ''UN Global Compact Under Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bitcoin]] &amp; Beyond: [[Blockchain]]s, Globalization, and Global Governance workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to examine the implications that blockchains pose for globalization and global governance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.balsillieschool.ca/event/bitcoin-beyond-blockchains-globalization-and-global-governance. Balsillie School&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Expansion of normative mechanisms and globalization of institutions===
One effect of globalization is the increasing regulation of businesses in the global marketplace. Jan Aart Scholte asserts, however, that these changes are inadequate to meet the needs: "Along with the general intensified globalization of social relations in contemporary history has come an unprecedented expansion of regulatory apparatuses that cover planetary jurisdictions and constituencies. On the whole, however, this global governance remains weak relative to pressing current needs for global public policy. Shortfalls in moral standing, legal foundations, material delivery, democratic credentials and charismatic leadership have together generated large legitimacy deficits in existing global regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, J.A. (2007), "Civil Society and the Legitimation of Global Governance", CSGR Working Paper No. 223/07&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals and initiatives have been developed by various sources to set up networks and institutions operating on a global scale: political parties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 Sehm-Patömaki, K. and M. Ulvila (2006), "Dialogues on Party Systems and Global Democratization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143624/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 Howard, S. (2006), "Organising Globally"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; regional authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 Forum de réseaux de régions du monde (2007), "Déclaration des régions sur leur participation à la gouvernance de la mondialisation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143711/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and members of parliament in sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipietz.net/spip.php?article1431|title=A quoi sert le Forum Parlementaire Mondial ?- Alain Lipietz|author=|date=|website=lipietz.net|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation and objectives===
One of the conditions for building a world democratic governance should be the development of platforms for citizen dialogue on the legal formulation of world governance and the harmonization of objectives.

This legal formulation could take the form of a Global Constitution. According to Pierre Calame and Gustavo Marin, "[a] Global Constitution resulting from a process for the institution of a global community will act as the common reference for establishing the order of rights and duties applicable to United Nations agencies and to the other multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article.php3?id_article=670|title=Main Points for the Discussion with the United Nations (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for formulating objectives, the necessary but insufficient ambition of the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]], which aim to safeguard humankind and the planet, and the huge difficulties in implementing them, illustrates the inadequacy of institutional initiatives that do not have popular support for having failed to invite citizens to take part in the elaboration process.

Furthermore, the Global Constitution "must clearly express a limited number of overall objectives that are to be the basis of global governance and are to guide the common action of the U.N. agencies and the multilateral institutions, where the specific role of each of these is subordinated to the pursuit of these common objectives."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Calame proposes the following objectives:
# instituting the conditions for sustainable development
# reducing inequalities
# establishing lasting peace while respecting diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Calame, P. (2003), ''La démocratie en miettes. Pour une révolution de la gouvernance'', Ed. Charles Léopold Mayer, Ed. Descartes et cie. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforming international institutions===
Is the UN capable of taking on the heavy responsibility of managing the planet's serious problems? More specifically, can the UN reform itself in such a way as to be able to meet this challenge? At a time when the financial crisis of 2008 is raising the same questions posed by the climate disasters of previous years regarding the unpredictable consequences of disastrous human management, can international financial institutions be reformed in such a way as to go back to their original task, which was to provide financial help to countries in need?

Lack of political will and citizen involvement at the international level has also brought about the submission of international institutions to the "[[neoliberal]]" agenda, particularly financial institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Rorden (2014), What's Wrong with the WTO and How to Fix it, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|978-0-745-67245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Calame gives an account of this development,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 Calame, Pierre; "Pour une gouvernance mondiale légitime, efficace et démocratique"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144903/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Joseph E. Stiglitz points out that the need for international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO has never been so great, but people's trust in them has never been so low.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?", ''in'' Jean-Philippe Touffut, (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Paris, pp. 149/164&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key aspects of the United Nations reform is the problem of the representativeness of the General Assembly. The Assembly operates on the principle of "one state, one vote," so that states of hugely varying sizes have the same effect on the vote, which distorts representativeness and results in a major loss of credibility. Accordingly, "the General Assembly has lost any real capacity to influence. This means that the mechanisms for action and consultation organized by rich countries have the leading role."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Gustave Massiah advocates defining and implementing a radical reform of the UN. The author proposes building new foundations that can provide the basis for global democracy and the creation of a Global Social Contract, rooted in the respect and protection of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as in the recognition of the strategic role of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadtm.org/spip.php?article1187|title=La réforme de l'ONU et le mouvement altermondialiste|author=|date=|website=www.cadtm.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three ‘gaps’ in global governance===
There is the jurisdictional gap, between the increasing need for global governance in many areas - such as health - and the lack of an authority with the power, or jurisdiction, to take action.
Moreover, the gap of incentive between the need for international cooperation and the motivation to undertake it. The incentive gap is said to be closing as globalization provides increasing impetus for countries to cooperate. However, there are concerns that, as Africa lags further behind economically, its influence on global governance processes will diminish. At last, the participation gap, which refers to the fact that international cooperation remains primarily the affair of governments, leaving civil society groups on the fringes of policy-making. On the other hand, globalization of communication is facilitating the development of global civil society movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225190757/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2005|title=WHO - Global Governance|author=|date=25 February 2005|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1901 Eastern Telegraph cables.png|300px|thumb|[[Eastern Telegraph]] cable network in 1901]]
A '''global network''' is any [[communication network]] which spans the entire [[Earth]]. The term, as used in this article refers in a more restricted way to ''bidirectional'' communication networks, and to technology-based networks. Early networks such as [[international mail]] and unidirectional communication networks, such as [[radio network|radio]] and [[television network|television]], are described elsewhere.

The first global network was established using [[electrical telegraph]]y and global span was achieved in 1899. The [[public switched telephone network|telephony network]] was the second to achieve global status, in the 1950s. More recently, interconnected [[IP network]]s (principally the [[Internet]], with estimated 2.5 billion users worldwide in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;http://export.gov/northcarolina/build/groups/public/@eg_us_nc/documents/webcontent/komarketingpresentation065541.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[GSM]] [[mobile communication]] network (with over 6 billion worldwide users in 2014) form the largest global networks of all.

Setting up global networks requires immensely costly and lengthy efforts lasting for decades. Elaborate interconnections, [[Telephone exchange|switching]] and [[routing]] devices, laying out physical carriers of information, such as land and [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]] and [[earth station]]s must be set in operation. In addition, international [[communication protocol]]s, legislation and agreements are involved.

Global networks might also refer to networks of individuals (such as [[Scientific collaboration network|scientists]]), communities (such as [[city network|cities]]) and organizations (such as [[Civil society#Global|civil organizations]]) worldwide which, for instance, might have formed for the management, mitigation and resolval of [[global issue]]s.

==Satellite global networks==

[[Communication satellite]]s are an important part of global networks. However, there are specific [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) global [[satellite constellation]]s, such as [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]], [[Globalstar]] and [[Orbcomm]], which are comprised by dozens of similar satellites which are put in orbit at regularly spaced positions and form a [[mesh network]], sometimes sending and receiving information directly among themselves. Using [[VSAT]] technology, [[satellite internet access]] has become possible.

==Mobile wireless networks==

It is estimated that 80% of the global mobile market uses the GSM standard, present in more than 212 countries and territories. Its [[wikt:ubiquity|ubiquity]] makes international [[roaming]] very common between mobile phone operators, enabling subscribers to use their phones in many parts of the world. In order to achieve this, these networks must be interconnected by way of [[peering]] arrangements, and therefore the GSM network is a truly global one.

==Network interconnection==

The telegraph and [[telex]] communication networks have been phased out, so [[interconnection]] among existing global networks arise at several points, such as between the voice [[telephony]] and digital [[data network]]s, and between these and satellite networks. Many applications run now on several networks, such as [[VoIP]] (voice over IP). [[Mobile communication]] (voice and data) networks are also intimately intertwinned, because the majority of 21st century [[cell phone]]s have both voice and data (internet navigation and [[email]]ing) capabilities.

Digital global networks require huge carrying capacity in the main [[internet backbone|backbone]]s. This is currently achieved by [[fiber optic cable]]s.

==Social and economic impact==
The Canadian [[sociologist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] was the first to forecast the huge impact of the matrix of global networks upon [[society]], coining the term [[global village (term)|global village]]. His work, however, related to radio and television networks, which are [[broadcast]] (unidirectional) networks, thus predating the much larger impact of the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Harasim, L. (Ed.) - [https://books.google.com/books?id=9RAnJzaiqvMC Global Networks: Computers and International Networks, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

Global networks have revolutionized human communication several times. The first to do so was the electrical telegraph. Its impact was so large that it has been dubbed the [[Victorian Internet]]. It was expanded many times in its coverage with the advent of [[radiotelegraphy]], and with text messaging using [[telex]] machines.

The Internet and mobile communication networks have made possible entirely new forms of [[social interaction]], activities and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread [[usability]] and access, and instant communication from any connected point to another. Thus, its [[Internet#Social impact|social impact]] has been, and still is, enormous. Finally, the impact on governance have been significant facilitating the emergence of 'transnational policy networks' &lt;ref&gt;Stone, Diane. Knowledge actors and transnational governance: The private-public policy nexus in the global agora. Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza''' in [[bird]]s is considered a significant [[Influenza pandemic|pandemic]] threat.

While other [[H5N1]] influenza &lt;ref&gt;http://www.yangtse.com/epaper/yzwb/2007-06/28/content_9354072.htm&lt;/ref&gt; strains are known, they are significantly different from a current, highly pathogenic H5N1 strain on a genetic level, making the global spread of this new strain unprecedented. The H5N1 strain is a [[Mutation|fast-mutating]], highly [[pathogen]]ic [[avian influenza]] virus (HPAI) found in multiple bird species. It is both epizootic (an epidemic in non-humans) and panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species especially over a wide area). Unless otherwise indicated, "H5N1" in this [[timeline]] refers to the recent highly pathogenic strain of H5N1.

"Since 1997, studies of H5N1 influenza indicate that these viruses continue to evolve, with changes in antigenicity and internal [[gene]] constellations; an expanded host range in avian species and the ability to infect [[Felidae|felids]]; enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected [[mouse|mice]] and ferrets, in which they cause systemic infections; and increased environmental stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{H5N1 case graph}}
Tens of millions of birds have died of [[H5N1]] influenza and hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered and disposed of, to limit the spread of H5N1. Countries that have reported one or more major highly pathogenic H5N1 outbreaks in birds (causing at least thousands but in some cases millions of dead birds) are (in order of first outbreak occurrence): [[South Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Indonesia]], [[China]], [[Malaysia]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Croatia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Cyprus]], [[Iraq]], [[Nigeria]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[France]], [[Niger]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Albania]], [[Cameroon]], [[Myanmar]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Israel]], [[Pakistan]], [[Jordan]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Germany]], [[Sudan]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Djibouti]], [[Hungary]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Ghana]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Togo]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bhutan]].

{{H5N1}}
Highly pathogenic H5N1 has been found in birds in the wild in numerous other countries: [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], [[Iran]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and [[Switzerland]]. Surveillance of [[H5N1]] in humans, poultry, wild birds, cats and other animals remains very weak in many parts of Asia and Africa. Much remains unknown about the exact extent of its spread.

H5N1 has low pathogenic varieties [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in [[bird]]s in North America. H5N1 has a highly pathogenic variety that is endemic in dozens of species of birds throughout south [[Asia]] and parts of [[Africa]]. So far, it is very difficult for [[human]]s to become infected with H5N1. The presence of highly pathogenic (deadly) H5N1 around the world in both birds in the wild ([[swan]]s, [[magpie]]s, [[duck]]s, [[geese]], [[pigeon]]s, [[eagle]]s, etc.) and in [[chicken]]s and [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]] on farms has been demonstrated in millions of cases with the [[virus]] isolate actually [[Sequencing|sequenced]] in hundreds of cases yielding definitive proof of the [[evolution]] of this strain of this subtype of the species [[Influenzavirus A]] (bird flu virus).

According to [[Robert G. Webster]]:
{{quote|The epicenters of both the [[H2N2#Asian flu|Asian influenza pandemic]] of 1957 and the [[H3N2#Hong Kong Flu|Hong Kong influenza pandemic]] of 1968 were in Southeast Asia, and it is in this region that multiple clades of H5N1 influenza virus have already emerged. The Asian H5N1 virus was first detected in [[Guangdong Province]], China, in 1996, when it killed some geese, but it received little attention until it spread through live-poultry markets in Hong Kong to humans in May 1997, killing 6 of 18 infected people. [...] From 1997 to May 2005, H5N1 viruses were largely confined to Southeast Asia, but after they had infected wild birds in Qinghai Lake, China, they rapidly spread westward. [...] The intermittent spread to humans will continue, and the virus will continue to evolve.[http://content.nejm.org/content/vol355/issue21/images/large/03f1.jpeg Map]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As of the July 25, 2008 [[FAO]] Avian Influenza Disease Emergency Situation Update, H5N1 [[pathogenicity]] is continuing to gradually rise in endemic areas but the avian influenza disease situation in farmed birds is being held in check by vaccination. Eleven outbreaks of H5N1 were reported worldwide in June 2008 in five countries (China, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) compared to 65 outbreaks in June 2006 and 55 in June 2007. The "global HPAI situation can be said to have
improved markedly in the first half of 2008 [but] cases of HPAI are still underestimated and underreported in many countries because of limitations in country disease surveillance systems".&lt;ref name="fao.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//246457/aj097e00.pdf|title=July 25, 2008 FAO Avian Influenza Disease Emergency Situation Update|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strains were somewhat similar to the current pathogenic strain of H5N1 in two of its ten genes, the gene that causes it to be type H5 and the gene that causes it to be N1. The other genes can and have been [[reassortment|reassorted]] from other subtypes of the bird flu species (their ease at exchanging genes is part of what makes them all one species). [[Evolution]] by reassortment of H5N1 from 1999 to 2002 created the Z genotype which became the dominant strain of highly pathogenic H5N1 in 2004 and is now spreading across the entire world in both wild and domestic birds.

{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2004}}

In January 2004 a major new outbreak of [[H5N1]] surfaced in [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]]'s [[poultry]] industry, and within weeks spread to ten countries and regions in [[Asia]], including [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[China]]. In October 2004 researchers discovered [[H5N1]] is far more dangerous than previously believed because [[waterfowl]], especially [[duck]]s, were directly spreading the highly pathogenic strain of [[H5N1]] to [[chicken]]s, [[crow]]s, [[pigeon]]s, and other birds and that it was increasing its ability to infect mammals as well. From this point on, [[avian influenza]] experts increasingly refer to containment as a strategy that can delay but not prevent a future avian flu pandemic.

===2005===
[[Image:Avian influenza spread map.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The spread of avian influenza in the eastern hemisphere.]]
{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2005}}

In January 2005 an outbreak of avian influenza affected thirty three out of sixty four cities and provinces in [[Vietnam]], leading to the forced killing of nearly 1.2 million poultry. Up to 140 million birds are believed to have died or been killed because of the outbreak. In April 2005 there begins an unprecedented die-off of over 6,000 migratory birds at [[Qinghai Lake]] in central [[China]] over three months. This strain of H5N1 is the same strain as is spread west by migratory birds over at least the next ten months. In August 2005 H5N1 spread to [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Russia]]. On September 29, 2005, [[David Nabarro]], the newly appointed Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, warned the world that an outbreak of avian influenza could kill 5 to 150 million people. David Nabarro later stated that as the virus had spread to migratory birds, an outbreak could start in [[Africa]] or the [[Middle East]]. Later in 2005 H5N1 spread to [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Croatia]] and [[Kuwait]].

===2006===
{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2006}}
* In the first two months of 2006 H5N1 spread to other [[Asia]]n countries (such as [[Bird flu in India|India]]), north [[Africa]], and [[Europe]] in wild bird populations possibly signaling the beginning of [[H5N1]] being endemic in wild migratory bird populations on multiple continents for decades, permanently changing the way [[poultry]] are [[farm]]ed.
* By April 2006 scientists had concluded that containment had failed due to the role of wild [[bird]]s in transmitting the virus and were now emphasizing far more comprehensive risk mitigation and management measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* In June 2006 [[WHO]] predicted an upsurge in human deaths due to H5N1 during late 2006 or early 2007 following a summer/fall lull in most countries, as H5N1 appears to be somewhat seasonal in nature. In July and August 2006 significantly increased numbers of bird deaths due to H5N1 were recorded in [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Laos]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Thailand]] while continuing unabated a rate unparalleled in [[Indonesia]].
* In June, there was a human outbreak in Indonesia when 8 members of a family in [[Sumatra]] became infected and 7 died. The WHO reported that this may have been the first recorded instance of human-to-human transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Protecting Poultry Workers from Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) (2008-128)|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2008-128/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September, [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] joined the list of nations seeing a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1.
* In November and December, [[South Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] joined the list of nations seeing a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1.

===2007===
{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2007}}
In January, [[Japan]], [[Hungary]], [[Russia]], and the [[United Kingdom]] joined the list of nations seeing a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1. In February, [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Myanmar]] joined the list and [[Kuwait]] saw its first major outbreak of [[H5N1]] [[avian influenza]].

In March [[Bangladesh]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] each saw their first major outbreak of [[H5N1]] [[avian influenza]] and [[Ghana]] in May.

As H5N1 continued killing many birds and a few people throughout the spring in countries where it is now endemic, in June [[Malaysia]] and [[Germany]] saw a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1, while the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Togo]] experienced their first major outbreak of [[H5N1]] [[avian influenza]].

In July [[France]] and [[India]] also saw a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1.

==''Suidae'' (Pigs)==
[[Image:Sow with piglet.jpg|thumb|right|Pigs can harbor influenza viruses adapted to humans and others that are adapted to birds, allowing the viruses to exchange genes and create a pandemic strain.]]
Avian influenza virus [[H3N2]] is endemic in [[pig]]s ("[[swine flu]]") in [[China]] and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. Health experts say pigs can carry human [[influenza]] viruses, which can combine (i.e. exchange homologous genome sub-units by genetic [[reassortment]]) with [[H5N1]], passing [[gene]]s and mutating into a form which can pass easily among humans. [[H3N2]] evolved from [[H2N2]] by [[antigenic shift]] and caused the [[Hong Kong Flu]] pandemic of 1968 and 1969 that killed up to 750,000 humans. The dominant strain of annual [[flu]] in humans in January 2006 is [[H3N2]]. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]] in H3N2 in humans has increased to 91% in 2005. A combination of these two subtypes of the species known as the [[avian influenza]] virus in a country like [[China]] is a worst-case scenario. In August 2004, researchers in [[China]] found [[H5N1]] in pigs.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

In 2005, it was discovered that [[H5N1]] "could be infecting up to half of the pig population in some areas of [[Indonesia]], but without causing symptoms [...] Chairul Nidom, a virologist at [[Airlangga University]]'s tropical disease center in [[Surabaya]], Java, was conducting independent research earlier this year. He tested the blood of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in western Java where avian flu had broken out, ''Nature'' reported. Five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus. The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region, Nature reported. Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/may2705avflu.html CIDRAP] article ''Indonesian pigs have avian flu virus; bird cases double in China'' published May 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Felidae'' (cats)==
[[Image:Cat03.jpg|thumb|right|Domestic cats can get H5N1 from eating birds, and can transmit it to other cats and possibly to people.]]

"In Bangkok, [[Thailand]], all the cats in one household are known to have died of [[H5N1]] in 2004. [[Tiger]]s and [[leopard]]s in Thai [[zoo]]s also died, while in 2007 two cats near an outbreak in poultry and people in [[Iraq]] were confirmed to have died of H5N1, as were three [[Germany|German]] cats that ate wild birds. In [[Austria]], cats were infected but remained healthy". Cats in [[Indonesia]] were also found to have been infected with H5N1.&lt;ref name="Chairul Nidom"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325883.800-deadly-h5n1-may-be-brewing-in-cats.html New Scientist] article ''Deadly H5N1 may be brewing in cats'' published January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread to more and more types and populations of birds and the ability of [[felidae]] (cats) to catch [[H5N1]] from eating this natural prey means the creation of a reservoir for H5N1 in cats where the virus can adapt to mammals is one of the many possible pathways to a [[pandemic]].

===August 2006===
It was announced in the August 2006 CDC EID journal that while literature describing HPAI H5N1 infection in cats had been limited to a subset of clade I viruses; a Qinghai-like virus (they are genetically distinct from other clade II viruses) killed up to five cats and 51 chickens from February 3 to 5, 2006 in Grd Jotyar (~10&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Arbil|Erbil City]], Iraq). Two of the cats were available for examination.

:"An influenza A H5 virus was present in multiple organs in all species from the outbreak site in Grd Jotyar (Table). cDNA for sequencing was amplified directly from RNA extracts from pathologic materials without virus isolation. On the basis of sequence analysis of the full HA1 gene and 219 amino acids of the HA2 gene, the viruses from the goose and 1 cat from Grd Jotyar and from the person who died from Sarcapcarn (sequence derived from PCR amplification from first-passage egg material) are &gt;99% identical at the nucleotide and amino acid levels (GenBank nos. DQ435200–02). Thus, no indication of virus adaptation to cats was found. The viruses from Iraq are most closely related to currently circulating Qinghai-like viruses, but when compared with A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/65/2005 (H5N1) (GenBank no. DQ095622), they share only 97.4% identity at the nucleic acid level with 3 amino acid substitutions of unknown significance. On the other hand, the virus from the cat is only 93.4% identical to A/tiger/Thailand/CU-T4/2004(H5N1) (GenBank no. AY972539). These results are not surprising, given that these strains are representative of different clades (8,9). Sequencing of 1,349 bp of the N gene from cat 1 and the goose (to be submitted to GenBank) show identity at the amino acid level, and that the N genes of viruses infecting the cat and goose are &gt;99% identical to that of A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/65/2005(H5N1). These findings support the notion that cats may be broadly susceptible to circulating H5N1 viruses and thus may play a role in reassortment, antigenic drift, and transmission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

"Chairul Anwar Nidom of [[Airlangga University]] in Surabaya, [[Indonesia]], told journalists last week that he had taken blood samples from 500 stray cats near poultry markets in four areas of [[Java]], including the capital, [[Jakarta]], and one area in [[Sumatra]], all of which have recently had outbreaks of [[H5N1]] in [[poultry]] and people. Of these cats, 20% carried [[antibodies]] to H5N1. This does not mean that they were still carrying the virus, only that they had been infected - probably through eating birds that had H5N1. Many other cats that were infected are likely to have died from the resulting illness, so many more than 20% of the original cat populations may have acquired H5N1."&lt;ref name="Chairul Nidom"/&gt;

==Mammals in general==
[[Image:marten.jpg|thumb|right|[[Martens]] and an unknown number of other mammals can catch H5N1, illustrating the unprecedented ability of H5N1 to survive and spread.]]

[[H5N1]] has been transmitted in laboratories to many species including [[mouse|mice]] and [[ferret]]s to study its effects. A purposely mutated strain &lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; in ferrets&lt;ref name="cidrap.umn.edu"/&gt; has engendered a notable international policy debate regarding the openness of scientific research, the mandates of public health, and the potential for bioterrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Declan|title=UPDATED: Avian flu controversy comes to roost at WHO|url=http://www.nature.com/news/updated-avian-flu-controversy-comes-to-roost-at-who-1.10055|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2012.10055|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People living in areas where the A(H5N1) virus has infected birds are advised to keep their cats indoors. "Cats can be infected through the respiratory tract. Cats can also be infected when they ingest the virus, which is a novel route for influenza transmission in mammals. But cats excrete only one-thousandth the amount of virus that chickens do [...] The concern is that if large numbers of felines and other carnivores become infected, the virus might mutate in a series of events that could lead to an epidemic among humans. Dogs, foxes, seals, and other carnivores may be vulnerable to A(H5N1) virus infection, Dr. Osterhaus said. Tests in Thailand have shown that the virus has infected dogs without causing apparent symptoms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

H5N1 has the potential to infect [[cattle]]. Asymptomatic shedding of H5N1 by infected calves and subsequent seroconversion is possible. Bird-to-calf transmission resulting in seroconversion is probable. While the incidence of clinical infections of cattle with H5N1 in H5N1 endemic regions should be low, "serum from [[bovine]] species would be a valuable source of additional information about transmission events, especially in regions like Asia and Egypt, where HPAIV (H5N1) is endemic and probability of contact between poultry and cattle is high."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/14/7/1132.htm Emerg Infect Dis] article ''Experimental Infection of Cattle with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (H5N1)'' published  July 2008 - Suggested Citation for this Article: "Kalthoff D, Hoffmann B, Harder T, Durban M, Beer M.

'''Globalization of sports''' refers to the process of expansion of the idea of [[sport]] across the world and phenomena is how that are associated with it.The field of sports in the 20th-21st century was naturally influenced by the process of globalisation.[[Globalization]] not only impacts the way in which sports are conducted and organised but also how they are perceived and what they mean in today's world.

== Origins ==
The roots of modern sports can be found in the mid-nineteenth century in Great Britain and the United States where first professional sports were organised in mining and industrial towns and cities. Back then, sport competition was conducted mostly on local and national level. First signs of globalization in that matter appeared because of the global hegemonic position that Great Britain had in the nineteenth century. Due to the British influence, popularity of such sports as [[football]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] or [[cricket]] grew rapidly throughout the world, very often replacing traditional local games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=George|title=Sport and Globalization|url=http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1999/OREXXVI29/OREXXVI29q.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1930 world cup teams.png|thumb|right|Teams of the FIFA World Cup 1930]]

Another step in the globalization of sports was taken with the establishment of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1894 and the revival of the [[1896_Summer_Olympics|Olympics Games in 1896]]. The first modern Olympics Games were organised in its ancient birthplace of Athens and attracted athletes from fourteen nations. Despite that most of the participants were European, the Olympics Games of 1896 initiated regularly held international sport competition that soon spread on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IOC|url=https://www.olympic.org/athens-1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 in Paris, the [[FIFA|International Federation of Association Football (FIFA)]] was founded by representatives of France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Shortly after, other European associations joined and by 1909 FIFA was consisted only from nations of the “old continent”. This state of affairs did not last long and South Africa was the first country from overseas that joined the Federation followed by Argentina and Chile (1912) and the United States (1913). This allowed FIFA to start its global activities and in 1930 the first FIFA World Cup was organised. The tournament which was hosted in Uruguay was announced as a great success despite that only four European teams were able to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile other international sport federations started appearing and after the World War II, when the United States rose as a global power, “American” sports like [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] began getting more popularity around the world. [[FIVB|International Volleyball Federation (FIVB)]] organised their first World Championship in 1949 while [[FIBA|International Basketball Federation (FIBA)]] hosted theirs in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=George|title=Sport and Globalization|url=http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1999/OREXXVI29/OREXXVI29q.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, globalization of sports was fueled by the expansion of technology and the introduction of commercial aspects to sports. On one hand newspaper, radio and especially television exposed sports to the wider international audience (first FIFA World Cup was televised in 1956 and first Summer Olympics in 1960), on the other commercial advertising allowed to profit from them. 

== Contemporary world ==
Since the end of the world it was said that twentieth century the globalization of sports rapidly accelerated by bringing television and corporate sponsorship. It led to the commercialization of sport and gave birth to the sport industry. Therefore, in the context of globalization, sport in the contemporary world can be characterised by the following tendencies:
[[File:London NBA 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Jersey Nets]] during [[NBA Global Games]] in London in 2008]]

* Increased involvement of global telecommunication companies allows international sport organizations and federations such as the International Olympic Committee or International Federation of Association Football to generate enormous revenues by selling television rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=George|title=Sport and Globalization|url=http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1999/OREXXVI29/OREXXVI29q.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increased involvement of transnational companies (even those not connected to the sports industry) leads to a new trend of “naming” in which sponsor’s name or label is associated with stadium, sports arena, team or sports contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andreff|first1=Wladimir|title=Globalization of the Sports Economy|journal=Rivista di Diritto ed Economia dello Sport|volume=4|issue=3|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Involvement of those companies leads to the professionalization of sports that allows formerly amateur athletes to earn money. In the same time, at the highest level, we can observe enormous growth of income among athletes.

* Promotion of national leagues or team in markets overseas is more and more popular. During pre-season top-tier teams travel to different parts of the world no longer solely to prepare themselves for the upcoming season but rather to promote their team, league, merchandise and sponsors - European football teams organize matches and tournaments in the North America and Asia, while American basketball teams travel to Europe and Asia.

* Future expansion of regional tournaments, leagues and competitions to new geographic areas becomes a new possibility. Even though some games of the regular season of the [[NBA|National Basketball Association (NBA)]] were already organized outside of the United States and Canada, there are further plans of establishing a team based in London or even adding several European teams to the Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA eyes European expansion|url=http://m.rte.ie/amp/228197/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand the president of the [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)]] suggested that [[UEFA Champions League]] final could be played outside of Europe - for example in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uefa president open to Champions League final being held outside Europe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/20/uefa-president-champions-league-final-outside-europe|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increased diversity in athletes’ origins participating in national professional leagues around the world as well as the number of countries participating in sports events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thibault|first1=Lucie|title=Globalization of Sport: An Inconvenient Truth|journal=Journal of Sport Management|date=2009|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Globalization of sports has also a negative impact that can be visible in the following issues:

* Because of globalization and commercialization, the value of a certain sport is very often determined by the size of available audience for media, advertisers and sponsors. It undermines basic principles of sport and may eventually lead to a decrease in the diversity in sport and sporting heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thibault|first1=Lucie|title=Globalization of Sport: An Inconvenient Truth|journal=Journal of Sport Management|date=2009|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Even though migration and movement of athletes can be seen as something positive there are some controversies around it. First of all, rich countries are able to drain talent from poorer countries negatively influencing their sport system. That happened in the case of the massive exodus of Kenyan athletes who were lured by opportunities offered by Qatar and Bahrain. Secondly, globalization led to a trend of recruiting athletes from other countries in order to compete in international sport events. In that case citizenship and affiliation are easily exchanged for the right sport skills and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thibault|first1=Lucie|title=Globalization of Sport: An Inconvenient Truth|journal=Journal of Sport Management|date=2009|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Globalization of sports creates also possibilities for different kinds of criminal activity. Match fixing and referee corruption are a rising threat because of the growth of international betting and gambling on sports events. Alleged corruption of officials of the most important international sport organizations and associations (like FIFA) may lead to controversies associated with organization of sport events. In the same time, those big sport institutions may be used as tools for money laundering. Another issue that shows the dark side of globalization of sports is the use of [[Doping in sport|banned athletic performance-enhancing drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andreff|first1=Wladimir|title=Globalization of the Sports Economy|journal=Rivista di Diritto ed Economia dello Sport|volume=4|issue=3|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies''''' (also titled '''''Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years''''') is a 1997 [[transdisciplinary]] non-fiction book by [[Jared Diamond]], professor of [[geography]] and [[physiology]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). In 1998, ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction|general nonfiction]] and the [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books|Aventis Prize for Best Science Book]]. A documentary based on the book, and produced by the [[National Geographic Society]], was broadcast on PBS in July 2005.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{cite web | last = Lovgren

The book attempts to explain why [[Eurasia]]n and [[North Africa]]n civilizations have survived and conquered others, while arguing against the idea that Eurasian [[hegemony]] is due to any form of Eurasian [[Heritability of IQ|intellectual]], [[morality|moral]], or [[Heritability|inherent genetic]] [[Race and intelligence|superiority]]. Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various [[positive feedback|positive feedback loops]]. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, [[written language]] or the development among Eurasians of resistance to [[endemic disease]]s), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian [[genome]]s.

== Synopsis ==

The prologue opens with an account of Diamond's conversation with [[Yali (politician)|Yali]], a [[Papua New Guinea|New Guinean]] politician. The conversation turned to the obvious differences in power and technology between Yali's people and the [[Europeans]] who dominated the land for 200 years, differences that neither of them considered due to any genetic superiority of Europeans. Yali asked, using the local term "[[Cargo cult|cargo]]" for inventions and manufactured goods, "Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?" (p.&amp;nbsp;14)

Diamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere: "People of Eurasian origin ... dominate ... the world in wealth and power." Other peoples, after having thrown off colonial domination, still lag in wealth and power. Still others, he says, "have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists." (p.&amp;nbsp;15)

The peoples of other continents ([[sub-Saharan Africans]], [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[New Guineans]], and the original inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases – referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa's indigenous [[Khoisan]] peoples – largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]. He believes this is due to these societies' technologic and immunologic advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last [[Ice Age]].

=== Title ===

The book's title is a reference to the means by which farm-based societies conquered populations of other areas and maintained dominance, despite sometimes being vastly outnumbered – superior weapons provided immediate military superiority ([[guns]]); Eurasian diseases weakened and reduced local populations, who had no immunity, making it easier to maintain control over them ([[Microorganism|germs]]); and durable means of transport ([[Infrastructure|steel]]) enabled imperialism.

Diamond argues geographic, climatic and environmental characteristics which favored early development of stable [[Agrarian society|agricultural societies]] ultimately led to immunity to diseases endemic in agricultural animals and the development of powerful, organized [[State (polity)|states]] capable of dominating others.

=== Outline of theory ===
Diamond argues that Eurasian [[civilization]] is not so much a product of ingenuity, but of opportunity and necessity. That is, civilization is not created out of superior intelligence, but is the result of a chain of developments, each made possible by certain preconditions.

The first step towards civilization is the move from [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]] to rooted [[agrarian society]]. Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that endures storage; a [[climate]] dry enough to allow storage; and access to animals docile enough for [[domestication]] and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of [[crops]] and livestock leads to food [[Excess supply|surpluses]]. Surpluses free people to specialize in activities other than sustenance and support population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technologic innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop [[ruling class]]es and supporting [[bureaucracies]], which in turn lead to the organization of [[nation-state]]s and empires.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=978-0-393-03891-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although agriculture arose in several parts of the world, Eurasia gained an early advantage due to the greater availability of suitable plant and animal species for domestication. In particular, Eurasia has [[barley]], two varieties of wheat, and three protein-rich [[pulse (legume)|pulses]] for food; [[flax]] for textiles; and goats, sheep, and cattle. Eurasian grains were richer in protein, easier to sow, and easier to store than American maize or tropical bananas.

As early Western Asian civilizations began to trade, they found additional useful animals in adjacent territories, most notably horses and [[donkey]]s for use in transport. Diamond identifies 13 species of large animals over {{convert|100|lb}} domesticated in Eurasia, compared with just one in South America (counting the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] as breeds within the same species) and none at all in the rest of the world. Australia and North America suffered from a lack of useful animals due to [[extinction]], probably by human hunting, shortly after the end of the [[Pleistocene]], whilst the only [[Domestication of animals|domesticated animals]] in [[New Guinea]] came from the East Asian mainland during the [[Austronesian]] settlement some 4,000–5,000 years ago. Sub-Saharan biological relatives of the horse including [[zebra]]s and [[onager]]s proved untameable; and although [[African elephant]]s can be tamed, it is very difficult to breed them in captivity;&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond" /&gt; Diamond describes the small number of domesticated species (14 out of 148 "candidates") as an instance of the [[Anna Karenina principle]]: many promising species have just one of several significant difficulties that prevent domestication. He also makes the intriguing argument that all large mammals that could be domesticated, have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=978-0-393-03891-0 | pages=168–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurasians domesticated goats and sheep for hides, clothing, and cheese; cows for milk; [[ox|bullock]]s for [[tillage]] of fields and transport; and benign animals such as pigs and chickens. Large domestic animals such as horses and camels offered the considerable military and economic advantages of mobile transport.

[[File:Continental axes by Jared Diamond.png|thumb|[[Continent]]al axes according to [[Jared Diamond]] in ''Guns, Germs, and Steel''.]]

Eurasia's large landmass and long east-west distance increased these advantages. Its large area provided it with more plant and animal species suitable for domestication, and allowed its people to exchange both innovations and diseases. Its east-west orientation allowed breeds domesticated in one part of the continent to be used elsewhere through similarities in climate and the cycle of seasons. The Americas had difficulty adapting crops domesticated at one [[latitude]] for use at other latitudes (and, in North America, adapting crops from one side of the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the other). Similarly, Africa was fragmented by its extreme variations in climate from north to south: crops and animals that flourished in one area never reached other areas where they could have flourished, because they could not survive the intervening environment. Europe was the ultimate beneficiary of Eurasia's east-west orientation: in the [[first millennium BCE]], the [[Mediterranean]] areas of Europe adopted Southwestern Asia's animals, plants, and agricultural techniques; in the [[first millennium]] CE, the rest of Europe followed suit.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond" /&gt;

The plentiful supply of food and the dense populations that it supported made [[division of labor]] possible. The rise of nonfarming specialists such as craftsmen and [[scribe]]s accelerated economic growth and technological progress. These economic and technological advantages eventually enabled Europeans to conquer the peoples of the other continents in recent centuries by using the guns and steel of the book's title.

Eurasia's dense populations, high levels of trade, and living in close proximity to livestock resulted in widespread transmission of diseases, including from animals to humans. [[Smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[influenza]] were the result of close proximity between dense populations of animals and humans.  [[Natural selection]] forced Eurasians to develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to a wide range of [[pathogen]]s. When Europeans made contact with the Americas, European diseases (to which Americans had no immunity) ravaged the indigenous American population, rather than the other way around (the "trade" in diseases was a little more balanced in Africa and southern Asia: endemic malaria and [[yellow fever]] made these regions notorious as the "white man's grave";&lt;ref name="RossMacGregor1903 offightAgainstMalaria"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Fight against Malaria: An Industrial Necessity for Our African Colonies |author1=Ross, R. |author2=MacGregor, W. | journal=Journal of the Royal African Society | volume=2 | issue=6 | date=January 1903| pages=149–160 |jstor=714548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[syphilis]] may have originated in the Americas).&lt;ref name="OriginOfSyphilis"&gt;The origin of syphilis is still debated. Some researchers think it was known to [[Hippocrates]]: {{cite web |url = http://news.independent.co.uk/health/article266422.ece |title = English syphilis epidemic pre-dated European outbreaks by 150 years |author = Keys, David |accessdate = 2007-09-22 |publisher = Independent News and Media Limited |year = 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015045621/http://news.independent.co.uk/health/article266422.ece |archivedate = October 15, 2007 |df = mdy-all }} Others think it was brought from the Americas by [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and his successors: {{cite web | title=Columbus blamed for spread of syphilis | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13186-columbus-blamed-for-spread-of-syphilis-.html | date=January 2008 | publisher=NewScientist.com news service | author=MacKenzie, D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European diseases&amp;nbsp;– the [[Germ (microorganism)|germ]]s of the book's title&amp;nbsp;– decimated indigenous populations so that relatively small numbers of Europeans could maintain their dominance.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond" /&gt;

Diamond also proposes geographical explanations for why western European societies, rather than other Eurasian powers such as China, have been the dominant colonizers,&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamond1999HowToGetRich"&gt;{{cite web | title=How to get rich | url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/diamond_rich/rich_p1.html | author=Diamond, J. |date=July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming Europe's geography favored [[balkanization]] into smaller, closer, nation-states, bordered by natural barriers of mountains, rivers, and coastline. Threats posed by immediate neighbours ensured governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were outcompeted relatively quickly, whilst the region's leading powers changed over time. Other advanced cultures developed in areas whose geography was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires, without competitors that might have forced the nation to reverse mistaken policies such as China [[Haijin|banning the building of ocean-going ships]]. Western Europe also benefited from a more temperate climate than Southwestern Asia where intense agriculture ultimately damaged the environment, encouraged [[desertification]], and hurt [[soil fertility]].

=== Agriculture ===
''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' argues that [[urbanization|cities]] require an ample supply of food, and thus are dependent on agriculture. As farmers do the work of providing food, [[division of labor]] allows others freedom to pursue other functions, such as mining and literacy.

The crucial trap for the development of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the [[Fertile Crescent]] since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and [[pulse (legume)|pulse]] species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In contrast, American farmers had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, [[teosinte]].

Also important to the transition from hunter-gatherer to city-dwelling agrarian societies was the presence of 'large' [[domestication|domesticable]] animals, raised for meat, work, and long-distance communication. Diamond identifies a mere 14 domesticated large mammal species worldwide. The five most useful (cow, horse, sheep, goat, and pig) are all descendants of species [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to [[Eurasia]]. Of the remaining nine, only two (the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] both of South America) are indigenous to a land outside the temperate region of Eurasia.

Due to the [[Anna Karenina principle]], surprisingly few animals are suitable for domestication. Diamond identifies six criteria including the animal being sufficiently docile, gregarious, willing to breed in captivity and having a social dominance hierarchy. Therefore, none of the many African mammals such as the [[zebra]], [[antelope]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[African elephant]] were ever domesticated (although some can be tamed, they are not easily bred in captivity). The [[Holocene extinction event]] eliminated many of the [[megafauna]] that, had they survived, might have become candidate species, and [[Holocene extinction event#North America|Diamond argues]] that the pattern of extinction is more severe on continents where animals that had no prior experience of humans were exposed to humans who already possessed advanced hunting techniques (e.g. the Americas and Australia).

Smaller domesticable animals such as dogs, cats, chickens, and [[guinea pig]]s may be valuable in various ways to an agricultural society, but will not be adequate in themselves to sustain large-scale agrarian society. An important example is the use of larger animals such as cattle and horses in plowing land, allowing for much greater crop productivity and the ability to farm a much wider variety of land and soil types than would be possible solely by human muscle power. Large domestic animals also have an important role in the transportation of goods and people over long distances, giving the societies that possess them considerable military and economic advantages.

=== Geography ===
Diamond also argues that geography shaped [[Migration (human)|human migration]], not simply by making travel difficult (particularly by latitude), but by how climates affect where domesticable animals can easily travel and where crops can ideally grow easily due to the sun.

The dominant [[Out of Africa theory]] holds that modern humans developed east of the [[Great Rift Valley]] of the African continent at one time or another. The [[Sahara]] kept people from migrating north to the [[Fertile Crescent]], until later when the [[Nile River]] valley became accommodating.

Diamond continues to describe the story of human development up to the modern era, through the rapid development of technology, and its dire consequences on hunter-gathering cultures around the world.

Diamond touches on why the dominant powers of the last 500 years have been West European rather than East Asian (especially Chinese). The Asian areas in which big civilizations arose had geographical features conducive to the formation of large, stable, isolated empires which faced no external pressure to change which led to stagnation. Europe's many [[natural barrier]]s allowed the development of competing [[nation-state]]s. Such competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.

=== Germs ===
In the later context of the [[European colonization of the Americas]], 95% of the indigenous populations are believed to have been [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|killed off by diseases]] brought by the Europeans. Many were killed by infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. Similar circumstances were observed in the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)]] and in [[History of South Africa]]. Aboriginal Australians and the Khoikhoi population were decimated by smallpox, measles, influenza and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blainey|first1=Geoffrey|title=A short history of the world|date=2002|publisher=Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1566635073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smallpox Epidemic Strikes at the Cape|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/smallpox-epidemic-strikes-cape|website=South Africa History Online|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How was it then that diseases native to the American continents did not kill off Europeans? Diamond posits that the most of these diseases were only developed and sustained in large dense populations in villages and cities; he also states most epidemic diseases evolve from similar diseases of domestic animals. The combined effect of the increased population densities supported by agriculture, and of close human proximity to domesticated animals leading to animal diseases infecting humans, resulted in European societies acquiring a much richer collection of dangerous pathogens to which European people had acquired immunity through [[natural selection]] (see the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics) during a longer time than was the case for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[hunter-gatherers]] and farmers. 

He mentions the tropical diseases (mainly [[malaria]]) that limited European penetration into Africa as an exception. Endemic infectious diseases were also barriers to European colonisation of Southeast Asia and New Guinea.

=== Success and failure ===
''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' focuses on why some populations succeeded. His later book, ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', focuses on environmental and other factors that have caused some populations to fail.

== Intellectual background ==
In the 1930s, the [[Annales School]] in France undertook the study of [[Longue durée|long-term historical structures]] by using a synthesis of geography, history, and sociology. Scholars examined the impact of geography, climate, and land use. Although geography had been nearly eliminated as an academic discipline in the United States after the 1960s, several geography-based historical theories were published in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Cohen1998GeographyRedux"&gt;{{cite news| title= Geography Redux: Where You Live Is What You Are | publisher = The New York Times | date=March 21, 1998 | author=Cohen, P. | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D81738F932A15750C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Jared Diamond already considered the question of "why is it that the Eurasians came to dominate other cultures?" in ''[[The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal]]'' (part four).

== Reception ==
''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' won the 1997 [[Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_Infoview.aspx?t=&amp;id=57 | title=1997 Phi Beta Kappa Science Book Award | publisher=Phi Beta Kappa | accessdate=February 16, 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5DBVfgGvk?url=http://www.geeky.net/images/webbadge.gif | archivedate=January 24, 2006 | deadurl=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, it won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]], in recognition of its powerful synthesis of many disciplines, and the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books|Rhône-Poulenc Prize]] for Science Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1998 | title=The Pulitzer Prizes for 1998 | publisher=Columbia University | accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://royalsociety.org/awards/science-books/ | title=Prizes for Science Books previous winners and shortlists | publisher=The [[Royal Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Geographic Society]] produced a documentary of the same title based on the book that was broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in July 2005.&lt;ref name=natgeo/&gt;

=== Academic reviews ===
In a review of ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' that ultimately commended the book, historian Tom Tomlinson wrote, "Given the magnitude of the task he has set himself, it is inevitable that Professor Diamond uses very broad brush-strokes to fill in his argument."&lt;ref name="Tomlinson1998GGSreview"&gt;{{cite web |date=May 1998|url = http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/diamond.html|title = Review:Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|publisher = Institute of Historical Research | accessdate = 2008-03-14 | last=Tom Tomlinson |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another historian, professor [[J. R. McNeill]], was on the whole complimentary, but thought Diamond oversold geography as an explanation for history and underemphasized cultural autonomy.&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The World According to Jared Diamond |url=http://videosdigitals.uab.cat/cr-vet/www/40300/1_2_McNeil01_ht34_world%20according%20to%20Diamond.pdf |author=McNeill, J.R. |journal=The History Teacher |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=February 2001 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |volume=44 |issue=11 |date=June 26, 1997 |author=Jared Diamond; Reply by William H.

In his last book published in 2000, the anthropologist and geographer [[James Morris Blaut]] criticized ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'', among other reasons, for reviving the theory of [[environmental determinism]], and described Diamond as an example of a modern [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] historian.&lt;ref name="Blaut2000EightEurocentricHistorians"&gt;{{cite book | last = James M.

[[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] economist [[J.

John Brätland, an [[Austrian school]] economist of the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]], complained in a ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'' article that ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' entirely neglects individual action, concentrating solely on the centralized state; fails to understand how societies form (assessing that societies do not exist or form without a strong government); and ignores various economical institutions, such as monetary exchange that would allow societies to "rationally reckon scarcities and the value of actions required to replace what is depleted through human use". Instead, the author concludes that because there was no sophisticated division of labor, private property rights, and monetary exchange, societies like that on Easter Island could never progress from the nomadic stage to a complex society. Those factors, according to Brätland, are crucial, and at the same time neglected by Diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/22_1_5.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document |title=An Austrian Reexamination of Recent Thoughts on the Rise and Collapse of Societies |author=John Brätland |date= |website=mises.org |publisher= |access-date=January 9, 2017 |quote=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropologist Jason Antrosio described  ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' as a form of "academic porn," writing, "Diamond's account makes all the factors of European domination a product of a distant and accidental history" and "has almost no role for human agency–the ability people have to make decisions and influence outcomes. Europeans become inadvertent, accidental conquerors. Natives succumb passively to their fate." He added, "Jared Diamond has done a huge disservice to the telling of human history. He has tremendously distorted the role of domestication and agriculture in that history. Unfortunately his story-telling abilities are so compelling that he has seduced a generation of college-educated readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livinganthropologically.com/archaeology/guns-germs-and-steel-jared-diamond/|title=''Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond: Against History''|website=''Living Anthropologically''|first=Jason|last=Antrosio|date=July 7, 2011|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of the world''', in common parlance, is the '''history of humanity''' (or '''human history'''), as determined from  [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[genetics]], [[linguistics]], and other disciplines; and, for periods since the [[history of writing|invention of writing]], from [[recorded history]] and from [[secondary sources]] and studies.

Humanity's written history was preceded by its [[prehistory]], beginning with the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic Era]] ("Early Stone Age"), followed by the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Era]] ("New Stone Age").  The Neolithic saw the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] begin, between 8000 and 5000 [[BCE]], in the [[Near East]]'s [[Fertile Crescent]]. During this period, humans began the systematic [[Agriculture|husbandry]] of plants and animals.{{sfn|Tudge|1998|pp=30–31}} As agriculture advanced, most humans transitioned from a [[nomad]]ic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in [[civilization|permanent settlements]].  The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units, fostered by advances in [[history of transport|transportation]].

Whether in prehistoric or historic times, people always needed to be near reliable sources of [[potable water]].  Settlements developed on [[river]] [[Bank (geography)|banks]] as early as 3000 BCE in [[Mesopotamia]],{{sfn|McNeill|1999|pp=13–15}} on the banks of [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]'s [[Nile|Nile River]],{{sfn|Baines|Malek|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Bard|2000|pp=64–65}} in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus River valley]],{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2004|p=11}} and along China's rivers.{{sfn|Lee|2002|pp=15–42}}{{sfn|Teeple|2006|pp=14–20}}  As farming developed, [[Cereal|grain agriculture]] became more sophisticated and prompted a [[division of labour]] to store food between growing seasons. Labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured [[upper class]] and the development of [[City|cities]], which provided the [[Cradle of civilization|foundation]] for [[civilization]]. The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of [[accounting]] and [[writing]].

With civilizations flourishing, [[ancient history]] ("[[Late Antiquity|Antiquity]]," including the [[Classical Age]],{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|p=161}} up to about 500 CE{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=xii}}) saw the rise and fall of empires. [[Post-classical history]] (the "[[Middle Ages]]," c. 500–1500 CE {{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=xiv}}) witnessed the rise of [[Christianity]], the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (c. 750 CE – c. 1258 CE), and the early Italian [[Renaissance]] (from around 1300 CE). The mid-15th-century invention of modern [[printing]], employing [[movable type]],{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|p=63}} revolutionized [[communication]] and facilitated ever wider dissemination of [[information]], helping end the Middle Ages and ushering in the [[Scientific Revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2006|p=53}} The [[Early Modern Period]], sometimes referred to as the "European Age",{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|p=535}} from about 1500 to 1800,{{sfn|Bentley|Ziegler|2008|p=595}} included the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Age of Discovery]].  By the 18th century, the accumulation of [[knowledge]] and [[technology]] had reached a [[Critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]] that brought about the [[Industrial Revolution]]{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=712–14}} and began the [[Modern history#Late modern period|Late Modern Period]], which started around 1800 and has continued through the present.{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=xix}}

This scheme of historical [[periodization]] (dividing history into Antiquity, Post-Classical, Early Modern, and Late Modern periods) was developed for, and applies best to, the history of the [[Old World]], particularly Europe and the Mediterranean. Outside this region, including [[ancient China]] and [[History of India|ancient India]], historical timelines unfolded differently. However, by the 18th century, due to extensive [[International trade|world trade]] and [[colonization]], the histories of most civilizations had become [[Globalization|substantially intertwined]]. In the last quarter-millennium, the rates of growth of [[Population growth|population]], knowledge, technology, communications, commerce, weapons destructiveness, and environmental degradation have greatly accelerated, creating opportunities and perils that now confront the planet's human communities.{{sfn|Baten|2016|pp=1–13}}

===Rise of civilization===
The [[Neolithic Revolution]], beginning around 10,000 BCE, saw the development of agriculture, which fundamentally changed the human lifestyle. Farming developed around 10,000 BCE in the Middle East, around 7000 BCE in what is now China, about 6000 BCE in the [[Indus Valley]] and Europe, and about 4000 BCE in the Americas.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=36–37}} Cultivation of [[cereal crops]] and the [[domestication of animals]] occurred around 8500 BCE in the Middle East, where wheat and barley were the first crops and [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s were domesticated.{{sfn|McNeill|1999|p=11}} In the Indus Valley, crops were cultivated by 6000 BCE, along with domesticated cattle. The Yellow River valley in China cultivated [[millet]] and other cereal crops by about 7000 BCE, but the Yangtze River valley domesticated [[rice]] earlier, by at least 8000 BCE. In the Americas, [[sunflower]]s were cultivated by about 4000 BCE, and [[corn]] and [[bean]]s were domesticated in Central America by 3500 BCE. [[Potato]]es were first cultivated in the Andes Mountains of South America, where the [[llama]] was also domesticated.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=36–37}}  [[Metal-working]], starting with [[copper]] around 6000 BCE, was first used for tools and ornaments. [[Gold]] soon followed, with its main use being for ornaments. The need for metal ores stimulated trade, as many of the areas of early human settlement were lacking in ores. [[Bronze]], an alloy of copper and [[tin]], is first known from about 2500 BCE, but did not become widely used until much later.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=42–43}}

Though early "cities" appeared at [[Jericho]] and [[Catal Huyuk]] around 6000 BCE,{{sfn|McNeill|1999|p=13}} the first civilizations did not emerge until around 3000 BCE in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013}} and [[Mesopotamia]].{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|p=53}} These cultures gave birth to the invention of the [[wheel]],{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|p=44}} [[mathematics]],{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|p=59}} bronze-working, [[sailing]] boats, the [[pottery wheel]], woven cloth, construction of monumental buildings,{{sfn|McNeill|1999|p=16}} and [[writing]].{{sfn|McNeill|1999|p=18}} Writing developed independently and at different times in five areas of the world:{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=62–63}}  Egypt (c. 3200 BCE),{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=62–63}} India (c. 3200 BCE),{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|p=58}} Mesopotamia (c. 3000 BCE),{{sfn|McNeill|1999|pp=18–19}} China (c. 1600 BCE),{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=60–61}} and Mesoamerica (c. 600 BCE).{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=62–63}}

Farming permitted far denser populations, which in time organized into [[State (polity)|states]]. Agriculture also created food surpluses that could support people not directly engaged in food production.{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=34–35}} The development of agriculture permitted the creation of the first [[city|cities]]. These were centres of [[trade]], [[manufacturing]] and [[political power]].{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=15}} Cities established a [[symbiosis]] with their surrounding [[Rural area|countrysides]], absorbing agricultural products and providing, in return, manufactured goods and varying degrees of military control and protection.

The development of cities was synonymous with the rise of [[civilization]].{{efn|The very word "[[civilization]]" comes from the [[Latin]] ''civilis'', meaning "civil," related to ''civis'' ("citizen") and ''civitas'' ("city" or "city-state").&lt;ref&gt;Larry E.

Writing facilitated the administration of cities, the expression of ideas, and the preservation of information.{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=43–46}}

Entities such as the Sun, Moon, Earth, sky, and sea were often deified.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Shrine]]s developed, which evolved into [[temple]] establishments, complete with a complex hierarchy of [[Priest|priests and priestesses]] and other functionaries.

===Cradles of civilization===
{{Main article|Cradle of civilization|Bronze Age|Iron Age}}
[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|165px|[[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids of Giza]], [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]]]
The Bronze Age is part of the [[three-age system]] ([[Neolithic|Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]]) that for some parts of the world describes effectively the early history of [[civilization]]. During this era the most fertile areas of the world saw [[city-state]]s and the [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] develop. These were concentrated in fertile river valleys: the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Tigris and Euphrates]] in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Nile]] in [[Egypt]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the [[Indus River|Indus]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]],{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2004|pp=10–13}} and the [[Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]]s in China.

[[Sumer]], located in [[Mesopotamia]], is the first known complex civilization, developing the first [[city-state]]s in the 4th millennium BCE.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=54–55}} It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing, [[cuneiform script]], appeared around 3000 BCE.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=62–63}}{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=53–54}} Cuneiform writing began as a system of [[pictography|pictographs]]. These pictorial representations eventually became simplified and more abstract.{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=53–54}} Cuneiform texts were written on [[clay tablet]]s, on which [[symbol]]s were drawn with a blunt [[Phragmites|reed]] used as a [[stylus]].{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=62–63}} Writing made the administration of a large state far easier.

Transport was facilitated by waterways—by rivers and seas. The [[Mediterranean Sea]], at the juncture of three continents, fostered the projection of military power and the exchange of goods, ideas, and inventions. This era also saw new land technologies, such as horse-based cavalry and chariots, that allowed armies to move faster.

[[File:Knossos Bull-Leaping Fresco.jpg|thumb|left|185px|[[Bull-Leaping Fresco|Fresco]], [[Knossos]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]]]]

These developments led to the rise of territorial states and [[empire]]s. In Mesopotamia there prevailed a pattern of independent warring city-states and of a loose hegemony shifting from one city to another.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In Egypt, by contrast, first there was a dual division into [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] which was shortly followed by unification of all the valley around 3100 BCE, followed by permanent pacification.{{sfn|Bard|2000|pp=57–64}} In Crete the [[Minoan civilization]] had entered the Bronze Age by 2700 BCE and is regarded as the first civilization in Europe.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=76–77}} Over the next millennia, other river valleys saw monarchical empires rise to power.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the 25th – 21st centuries BCE, the empires of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] and [[Neo-Sumerian Empire|Sumer]] arose in [[Mesopotamia]].{{sfn|McNeill|1999|pp=36–37}}

Over the following millennia, civilizations developed across the world. [[Trade]] increasingly became a source of power as states with access to important resources or controlling important trade routes rose to dominance.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  By 1400 BCE, [[Mycenaean Greece]] began to develop.{{sfn|Price|Thonemann|2010|p=22}} In India this era was the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic period]], which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society, and ended in the 6th century BCE.{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=116–22}} From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapada]]s were established across the subcontinent.{{sfn|Singh|2008|pp=260–64}}

As complex civilizations arose in the Eastern Hemisphere, the indigenous societies in the [[Americas]] remained relatively simple and fragmented into diverse regional cultures. During the [[formative stage]] in [[Mesoamerica]] (about 1500 BCE to 500 CE), more complex and centralized civilizations began to develop, mostly in what is now Mexico, Central America, and Peru. They included civilizations such as the [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Moche culture|Moche]], and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]]. They developed agriculture, growing [[maize]], [[chili pepper]]s, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[tomato]]es, and [[potato]]es, crops unique to the Americas, and creating distinct cultures and religions. These ancient indigenous societies would be greatly affected, for good and ill, by European contact during the early modern period.

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Buddha]]]]
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Socrates]]]]

Beginning in the 8th century BCE, the "[[Axial Age]]" saw the development of a set of transformative philosophical and religious ideas, mostly independently, in many different places.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Chinese [[Confucianism]], Indian [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], and [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[monotheism]] are all claimed by some scholars to have developed in the 6th century BCE. ([[Karl Jaspers]]' Axial-Age theory also includes [[Persia]]n [[Zoroastrianism]], but other scholars dispute his timeline for Zoroastrianism.)  In the 5th century BCE, [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]] made substantial advances in the development of [[ancient Greek philosophy]].

In the East, three schools of thought would dominate Chinese thinking well into the 20th century. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would become particularly dominant, looked for [[Politics|political]] [[morality]] not to the force of law but to the power and example of [[tradition]].  Confucianism would later spread to the [[Korean Peninsula]] and toward [[Japan]].

In the West, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophical tradition, represented by [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other philosophers,{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=63}} along with accumulated science, technology, and culture, diffused throughout [[Europe]], Egypt, the [[Middle East]], and Northwest India, starting in the 4th century BCE after the conquests of Alexander III of [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedon]] ([[Alexander the Great]]).{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|pp=70–71}}

===Regional empires===
{{Main article|Civilization|Empire}}
The millennium from 500 BCE to 500 CE saw a series of empires of unprecedented size develop. Well-trained professional armies, unifying ideologies, and advanced bureaucracies created the possibility for emperors to rule over large domains whose populations could attain numbers upwards of tens of millions of subjects.
The great [[empire]]s depended on [[military]] [[annexation]] of territory and on the formation of defended settlements to become agricultural centres. The relative peace that the empires brought encouraged [[international trade]], most notably the massive trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the maritime trade web in the Indian Ocean, and the [[Silk Road]]. In southern Europe, the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] (and later the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]), in an era known as "[[classical antiquity]]," established cultures whose practices, laws, and customs are considered the foundation of contemporary [[Western culture]].

There were a number of regional empires during this period. The kingdom of the [[Medes]] helped to destroy the [[Assyrian Empire]] in tandem with the nomadic [[Scythians]] and the [[Babylonians]]. [[Nineveh]], the capital of Assyria, was sacked by the Medes in 612 BCE.{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|p=110}} The [[Median Empire]] gave way to successive [[History of Iran|Iranian]] empires, including the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (550–330 BCE) and the [[Sasanian Empire]] (224–651 CE).

Several empires began in modern-day Greece. First was the [[Delian League]] (from 477 BCE){{sfn|Martin|2000|pp=106–07}} and the succeeding [[Athenian Empire]] (454–404 BCE), centred in present-day [[Greece]]. Later, [[Alexander the Great]] (356–323 BCE), of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], founded an empire of conquest, extending from present-day Greece to present-day India.{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=25}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/alexander_the_great.shtml|title=Alexander the Great|last=|first=|date=|website=Historic Figures|publisher=BBC|access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire divided shortly after his death, but the influence of his [[Hellenization|Hellenistic]] successors made for an extended [[Hellenistic period]] (323–31 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/haht/hd_haht.htm|title=Art of the Hellenistic Age and the Hellenistic Tradition|last=Hemingway|first=Collette|last2=Hemingway|first2=Seán|date=April 2007|website=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the region.

In Asia, the [[Maurya Empire]] (322–185 BCE) existed in present-day [[History of India|India]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of India |last=Kulke |first=Hermann |last2=Rothermund |first2=Dietmar |publisher=Routledge |year=2004| isbn=978-0-415-32920-0 |edition=4th| location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 3rd century BCE, most of [[South Asia]] was united to the Maurya Empire by [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and flourished under [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]. From the 3rd century CE, the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's Golden Age. From the 4th to 6th centuries, northern India was ruled by the [[Gupta Empire]]. In southern India, three prominent [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] kingdoms emerged: the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of South India|last=Nilakanta Sastri |first=K. A. |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]]. The ensuing stability contributed to heralding in the golden age of [[Hindu]] culture in the 4th and 5th centuries.

In Europe, the [[History of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]], centered in present-day [[Italy]], began in the 7th century BCE.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=106–07}} In the 3rd century BCE the [[Roman Republic]] began expanding its territory through conquest and alliances.{{sfn|Kelly|2007|pp=4–6}} By the time of [[Augustus]] (63 BCE – 14 CE), the first Roman Emperor, Rome had already established dominion over most of the Mediterranean. The empire would continue to grow, controlling much of the land from [[England]] to [[Mesopotamia]], reaching its greatest extent under the emperor [[Trajan]] (died 117 CE). In the 3rd century CE, the empire split into western and eastern regions, with (usually) separate emperors. The Western empire would [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]], in 476 CE, to German influence under [[Odoacer]]. The eastern empire, now known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], with its capital at [[Constantinople]], would continue for another thousand years, until Constantinople was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453.

In China, the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BCE), the first imperial dynasty of China, was followed by the [[Han dynasty|Han Empire]] (206 BCE – 220 CE). The Han Dynasty was comparable in power and influence to the Roman Empire that lay at the other end of the [[Silk Road]]. Han China developed advanced cartography, shipbuilding, and navigation. The Chinese invented [[blast furnace]]s, and created finely tuned copper instruments. As with other empires during the Classical Period, Han China advanced significantly in the areas of government, education, mathematics, astronomy, technology, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Remaking China's Public Philosophy for the Twenty-First Century |last=Zhou |first=Jinghao |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-275-97882-2 |location=Westport |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chichén Itzá Mayan observatory.jpg|thumb|[[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[astronomical observatory|observatory]], [[Chichen Itza]], [[Mexico]]]]

In Africa, the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], centred in present-day Ethiopia, established itself by the 1st century CE as a major trading empire, dominating its neighbours in South [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] and controlling the [[Red Sea]] trade. It minted its own currency and carved enormous monolithic [[stele]]s such as the [[Obelisk of Axum]] to mark their emperors' graves.

Successful regional empires were also established in the [[Americas]], arising from cultures established as early as 2500 BCE.{{sfn|Fagan|2005|pp=390, 396}} In [[History of Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica]], vast pre-Columbian societies were built, the most notable being the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec Empire]] (700 BCE – 1521 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Zapotec civilization has its beginnings in 700 BCE: see {{Cite book|title=Zapotec Civilization: How Urban Society Evolved in Mexico's Oaxaca Valley|last=Flannery|first=Kent V.|last2=Marcus|first2=Joyce|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=1996|isbn=978-0-500-05078-1|location=New York|page=146|quote=|via=}} Zapotec civilization ended in 1521 according to the five archaeological stages presented in {{Cite book|title=The Zapotecs: Princes, Priests, and Peasants|last=Whitecotton|first=Joseph W.|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1977|isbn=|location=Norman|page= 26, LI.1–3|nopp=y|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Maya civilization]], which reached its highest state of development during the Mesoamerican Classic period (c. 250–900 CE),{{sfn|Coe|2011|p=91}} but continued throughout the Post-Classic period until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century CE. Maya civilization arose as the [[Olmec]] [[mother culture]] gradually declined. The great Mayan [[city-state]]s slowly rose in number and prominence, and Maya culture spread throughout the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] and surrounding areas. The later empire of the [[Aztecs]] was built on neighbouring cultures and was influenced by conquered peoples such as the [[Toltec]]s.

Some areas experienced slow but steady technological advances, with important developments such as the [[stirrup]] and [[moldboard plow|moldboard plough]] arriving every few centuries. There were, however, in some regions, periods of rapid technological progress. Most important, perhaps, was the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] area during the [[Hellenistic period]], when hundreds of technologies were invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Camp|first1=John McK.|last2=Dinsmoor|first2=William B.|title=Ancient Athenian building methods|date=1984|publisher=American School of Classical Studies at Athens|series=Excavations of the Athenian Agora|volume=21|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-87661-626-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such periods were followed by periods of technological decay, as during the [[Roman Empire]]'s decline and [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]] and the ensuing [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period.

===Declines, falls, and resurgence===
The ancient empires faced common problems associated with maintaining huge armies and supporting a central bureaucracy. These costs fell most heavily on the [[peasant]]ry, while land-owning [[magnate]]s increasingly evaded centralized control and its costs. [[Barbarian]] pressure on the frontiers hastened internal dissolution. [[China]]'s [[Han dynasty]] fell into [[civil war]] in 220 CE, beginning the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, while its [[Roman Empire|Roman]] counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the same time in what is known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The great empires of Eurasia were all located on temperate and subtropical coastal plains. From the [[Central Asia]]n steppes, horse-based nomads, mainly Mongols and Turks, dominated a large part of the continent. The development of the [[stirrup]] and the breeding of horses strong enough to carry a fully armed archer made the nomads a constant threat to the more settled civilizations.

==Post-classical history==
{{Main article|Post-classical history}}
[[File:Sankore Moske Timboektoe.JPG|thumb|[[University of Timbuktu]], [[Mali]]]]
The Post-classical Era, though deriving its name from the Eurocentric era of "[[Classical antiquity]]", refers to a broader geographic sweep. The era is commonly dated from the 5th-century [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], which fragmented into many separate kingdoms, some of which would later be confederated under the [[Holy Roman Empire]].  The Eastern Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire]] survived until late in the Post-classical, or Medieval, period.  The Post-classical period also encompasses the [[Early Muslim conquests]], the subsequent [[Islamic Golden Age]], and the commencement and expansion of the [[Arab slave trade]], followed by the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasions]] in the Middle East and Central Asia,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the founding around 1280 of the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Shaw|1976|p=13}} [[South Asia]] saw a series of [[middle kingdoms of India]], followed by the establishment of [[Islamic empires in India]].

In western Africa, the [[Mali Empire]] and the [[Songhai Empire]] developed.  On the southeast coast of Africa, Arabic ports were established where [[gold]], [[Spice trade|spices]], and other commodities were traded. This allowed Africa to join the [[Southeast Asia]] trading system, bringing it contact with Asia; this, along with Muslim culture, resulted in the [[Swahili culture]]. [[China]] experienced the successive [[Sui dynasty|Sui]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], [[Song dynasty|Song]], [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], and early [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties. Middle Eastern trade routes along the Indian Ocean, and the [[Silk Road]] through the Gobi Desert, provided limited economic and cultural contact between Asian and European civilizations. During the same period, civilizations in the [[Americas]], such as the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Aztecs]], reached their zenith; all would be compromised by, then conquered after, contact with [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] at the beginning of the [[Modern history|Modern period]].

===Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia===
{{Main article|History of the Middle East|History of North Africa|History of Central Asia|Islamic Golden Age}}
Prior to the advent of [[Islam]] in the 7th century, the [[Middle East]] was dominated by the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Persian [[Sasanian Empire]], which frequently fought each other for control of several disputed regions. This was also a cultural battle, with the Byzantine Hellenistic and Christian culture competing against the Persian Iranian traditions and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian religion]]. The formation of the [[History of Islam|Islamic religion]] created a new contender that quickly surpassed both of these empires. Islam greatly affected the [[political history|political]], [[economic history|economic]], and [[military history]] of the [[Old World]], especially the Middle East.

[[File:Grande Mosquée de Kairouan, vue d'ensemble.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great Mosque of Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]], founded 670 CE]]

From their centre on the Arabian Peninsula, Muslims began their expansion during the early Postclassical Era. By 750 CE, they came to conquer most of the Near East, North Africa, and parts of Europe, ushering in an era of learning, science, and invention known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. The knowledge and skills of the ancient Near East, Greece, and Persia were preserved in the Postclassical Era by Muslims, who also added new and important innovations from outside, such as the manufacture of paper from China and decimal positional numbering from India.

Much of this learning and development can be linked to geography. Even prior to Islam's presence, the city of [[Mecca]] had served as a centre of trade in Arabia, and the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] himself was a merchant. With the new Islamic tradition of the ''[[Hajj]]'', the pilgrimage to Mecca, the city became even more a centre for exchanging goods and ideas. The influence held by Muslim merchants over African-Arabian and Arabian-Asian trade routes was tremendous. As a result, Islamic civilization grew and expanded on the basis of its merchant economy, in contrast to the Europeans, Indians, and Chinese, who based their societies on an agricultural landholding nobility. Merchants brought goods and their Islamic faith to [[Islam in China|China]], [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|India]], [[Islam in Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]], and the kingdoms of western [[Islam in Africa|Africa]], and returned with new discoveries and inventions.
[[File:Crac des chevaliers syria.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Crusades|Crusader]] ''[[Krak des Chevaliers]]'', [[Syria]]]]

Motivated by religion and dreams of conquest, European kings launched a number of [[Crusades]] to try to roll back Muslim power and retake the [[Holy Land]]. The Crusades were ultimately unsuccessful and served more to weaken the [[Byzantine Empire]], especially with the 1204 [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople]]. The Byzantine Empire began to lose increasing amounts of territory to the Ottoman Turks. Arab domination of the region ended in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders,  the [[Mongol Empire]], swept through the region but were eventually eclipsed by the Turks{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} and the founding of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] around 1280.{{sfn|Shaw|1976|p=13}}

[[North Africa]] saw the rise of polities formed by the [[Berbers]], such as the [[Marinid dynasty]] in [[Morocco]], the [[Zayyanid dynasty]] in [[Algeria]], and the [[Hafsid dynasty]] in [[Tunisia]]. The region will later be called the [[Barbary Coast]] and will host pirates and privateers who will use several North African ports for their raids against the coastal towns of several European countries in search of slaves to be sold in North African markets as part of the [[Barbary slave trade]].

Starting with the [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618), the Chinese began expanding into eastern [[Central Asia]], and confronted [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nomads, who were becoming the most dominant ethnic group in Central Asia.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=113}}{{sfn|Xue|1992|pp=149–52, 257–64}} Originally the relationship was largely cooperative, but in 630 the [[Tang dynasty]] began an offensive against the Turks,{{sfn|Xue|1992|pp=226–27}} capturing areas of the Mongolian Ordos Desert. In the 8th century, Islam began to penetrate the region and soon became the sole faith of most of the population, though Buddhism remained strong in the east.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The desert nomads of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] could militarily match the nomads of the steppe, and the early [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] gained control over parts of Central Asia.

The [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]] were the most powerful of the nomad groups in the 6th and 7th centuries, and controlled much of the region. In the 9th through 13th centuries the region was divided among several powerful states, including the [[Samanid Empire|Samanid dynasty]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the [[Seljuq dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of the Seljuq Turks from the Jami' al-Tawarikh: An Ilkahnid Adaptation of the Saljuq-nama of Zahir al-Din Nishapuri|last=Nishapuri|first=Zahir al-Din|publisher=C.

The largest empire to rise out of Central Asia developed when [[Genghis Khan]] united the tribes of Mongolia. The [[Mongol Empire]] spread to comprise all of Central Asia and China as well as large parts of Russia and the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} After Genghis Khan died in 1227,{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=153}} most of Central Asia continued to be dominated by a successor state, [[Chagatai Khanate]]. In 1369, [[Timur]], a Turkic leader in the Mongol military tradition, conquered most of the region and founded the [[Timurid Empire]]. Timur's large empire collapsed soon after his death, however. The region then became divided into a series of smaller khanates that were created by the [[Uzbeks]]. These included the [[Khanate of Khiva]], the [[Khanate of Bukhara]], and the [[Khanate of Kokand]], all of whose capitals are located in present-day [[Uzbekistan]].

===Europe===
{{main article|History of Europe|Middle Ages}}
[[Europe]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]] was characterized by depopulation, deurbanization, and [[barbarian]] invasion, all of which had begun in [[Late Antiquity]]. The barbarian invaders formed their own new kingdoms in the remains of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. In the 7th century, North Africa and the Middle East, once part of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], became part of the [[Caliphate]] after conquest by [[Muhammad]]'s successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, most of the new kingdoms incorporated as many of the existing Roman institutions as they could. Christianity expanded in western Europe, and monasteries were founded. In the 7th and 8th centuries the [[Franks]], under the [[Carolingian dynasty]], established an empire covering much of western Europe;{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} it lasted until the 9th century, when it succumbed to pressure from new invaders—the [[Vikings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Vikings|last=Roesdahl|first=Else|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=978-0-14-025282-8|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hungarians#Entering the Carpathian Basin (c. 895)|Magyars]], and [[Saracen]]s.

[[File:Saint Peter's Basilica facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]]]]

During the [[High Middle Ages]], which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and crop yields to increase. [[Manorialism]]—the organization of peasants into villages that owed rents and labour service to nobles—and [[feudalism]]—a political structure whereby [[knight]]s and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rents from lands and [[manor]]s—were two of the ways of organizing medieval society that developed during the High Middle Ages. Kingdoms became more centralized after the decentralizing effects of the breakup of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. The [[Crusades]], first preached in 1095, were an attempt by western Christians from nations such as the [[Kingdom of England]], the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to regain control of the [[Holy Land]] from the [[Muslim]]s and succeeded for long enough to establish some Christian states in the Near East. Italian merchants imported [[Armenians]], [[Balts]], [[Circassians]], [[Georgians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Slavs]] to work as household slaves and in processing [[sugar]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} Intellectual life was marked by [[scholasticism]] and the founding of universities, while the building of [[Gothic cathedrals]] was one of the outstanding artistic achievements of the age.

The [[Late Middle Ages]] were marked by difficulties and calamities. Famine, plague, and war devastated the population of western Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The [[Black Death]] alone killed approximately 75 to 200 million people between 1347 and 1350.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/29/2149185.htm|title=Black death 'discriminated' between victims|last=Dunham|first=Will|date=January 29, 2008|work=ABC Science|access-date=November 24, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1576875.stm|title=De-coding the Black Death|last=|first=|date=October 3, 2001|work=BBC|access-date=November 24, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history.

In [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], in 1386, the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (the latter including territories of modern [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]), facing depredations by the [[Teutonic Knights]] and later also threats from [[Grand Duchy of Muscovy|Muscovy]], the [[Crimean Tatars]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]], formed a [[personal union]] through the marriage of Poland's Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] to [[Grand Duke of Lithuania|Lithuanian Grand Duke]] Jogaila, who became King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] of Poland.  For the next four centuries, until the 18th-century [[Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] by [[Prussia]], [[Russia]], and [[Austria]], the two polities conducted a federated [[condominium]], long Europe's largest state, which welcomed diverse ethnicities and religions, including most of the world's [[Jews]], furthered scientific thought (e.g., [[Copernicus]]'s [[heliocentric theory]]), and—in a last-ditch effort to preserve their [[sovereignty]]—adopted the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], the world's second modern written constitution after the [[U.S. Constitution]] that went into effect in 1789.

Medieval [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was home to many different civilizations. The [[Kingdom of Aksum]] declined in the 7th century as Islam cut it off from its Christian allies and its people moved further into the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] for protection. They eventually gave way to the [[Zagwe dynasty]] who are famed for their rock cut architecture at [[Lalibela]]. The Zagwe would then fall to the [[Solomonic dynasty]] who claimed descent from the Aksumite emperors{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} and would rule the country well into the 20th century. In the West African [[Sahel]] region, many Islamic empires rose, such as the [[Ghana Empire]], the [[Mali Empire]], the [[Songhai Empire]], and the [[Kanem–Bornu Empire]]. They controlled the [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, ivory, salt and slaves.

South of the Sahel, civilizations rose in the coastal forests where horses and camels could not survive.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} These include the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city of [[Ife]], noted for its art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blier |first=Suzanne Preston |year=2012 |title=Art in Ancient Ife, Birthplace of the Yoruba |url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/blier/files/blier.pdf |journal=African Arts |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=70–85 |doi=10.1162/afar_a_00029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oyo Empire]], the [[Benin Empire]] of the [[Edo people]] centred in [[Benin City]], the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] [[Kingdom of Nri]] which produced advanced bronze art at [[Igbo-Ukwu]], and the [[Akan people|Akan]] who are noted for their intricate architecture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[Central Africa]] saw the birth of several states, including the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]. In what is now modern [[Southern Africa]], native Africans created various kingdoms such as the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. They flourished through trade with the [[Swahili people]] on the East African coast. They built large defensive stone structures without mortar such as [[Great Zimbabwe]], capital of the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Khami]], capital of [[Kingdom of Butua]], and [[Danangombe]] (Dhlo-Dhlo), capital of the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Swahili people themselves were the inhabitants of the East African coast from Kenya to Mozambique who traded extensively with Asians and Arabs, who introduced them to Islam. They built many port cities such as [[Mombasa]], [[Zanzibar]] and [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], which were known to Chinese sailors under [[Zheng He]] and Islamic geographers.

In northern [[History of India|India]], after the fall (550 CE) of the [[Gupta Empire]], the region was divided into a complex and fluid network of smaller kingly states.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Early Muslim incursions began in the west in 712 CE, when the Arab [[Umayyad Caliphate]] annexed much of present-day [[Pakistan]]. Arab military advance was largely halted at that point, but Islam still spread in India, largely due to the influence of Arab merchants along the western coast. The [[Tripartite Struggle]] for control of northern India took place in the ninth century. The struggle was between the [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Pratihara Empire]], the [[Pala Empire]] and the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta Empire]]. Some of the important states that emerged in India at this time included the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] and the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].

The beginning of the Middle Ages in [[Southeast Asia]] saw the fall (550 CE) of the [[Funan|Kingdom of Funan]] to the [[Chenla|Chenla Empire]], which was then replaced by the [[Khmer Empire]] (802 CE). The Khmer's capital city [[Angkor]] was the largest city in the world prior to the industrial age and contained over a thousand temples, the most famous being [[Angkor Wat]]. The [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] (1238 CE) and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] (1351 CE) kingdoms were major powers of the [[Thai people]], who were influenced by the Khmer. Starting in the 9th century, the [[Pagan Kingdom]] rose to prominence in modern [[Myanmar]]. Other notable kingdoms of the period include the [[Srivijaya|Srivijayan Empire]] and the [[Lavo Kingdom]] (both coming into prominence in the 7th century), the [[Champa]] and the [[Hariphunchai]] (both about 750), the [[Dai Viet]] (968), [[Lan Na]] (13th century), [[Majapahit]] (1293), [[Lan Xang]] (1354), and the [[Kingdom of Ava]] (1364). [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] formed tribal alliances such as the [[Kingdom of Middag]]. It was also during this period that Islam spread to present-day Indonesia (beginning in the 13th century), and the [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malay states]] began to emerge including the [[Malacca Sultanate]], the [[Bruneian Empire]] and the [[Rajahnate of Maynila]].

Indigenous written records from this period are virtually non-existent, as it seems that all Pacific Islanders, with the possible exception of the enigmatic [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] and their currently undecipherable [[Rongorongo]] script, had no writing systems of any kind until after their introduction by European colonists; however, some indigenous prehistories can be estimated and academically reconstructed through careful, judicious analysis of native oral traditions, colonial ethnography, archaeology, physical anthropology and linguistics research.

==Modern history==
{{main article|Modern history}}
[[Modern history]] (the "modern period," the "modern era," "modern times") refers to the history of the period following the Middle Ages, spanning from about 1500 to the present day. In contrast, "[[Contemporary history]]" is history that covers events from around 1945 to the present day.

===Early modern period===
{{Main article|Early modern period}}
"[[Early modern period]]"{{efn|"Early Modern," historically speaking, refers to Western European history from 1501 (after the widely accepted end of the [[Late Middle Ages]]; the transition period was the 15th century) to either 1750 or c. 1790–1800, by whichever [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is favored by a school of scholars defining the period—which, in many cases of [[periodization]], differs as well within a discipline such as art, philosophy or history.}} is a term used by historians to refer to the period between the [[Middle Ages]] ([[Post-classical history]]) and the [[Industrial Revolution]]—roughly 1500 to 1800.{{sfn|Bentley|Ziegler|2008|p=595}} The Early Modern period is characterized by the rise of science, and by increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[Secularization|secularized]] civic [[politics]], and the [[nation state]]. [[capitalist economy|Capitalist economies]] began their rise, initially in northern [[Italy|Italian]] [[republic]]s such as [[Genoa]]. The Early Modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] economic theory. As such, the Early Modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of [[feudalism]], serfdom, and the power of the [[Catholic Church]]. The period includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Age of Discovery]], European [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]], the peak of European [[witch-hunt]]ing, the [[Scientific revolution]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{efn|The Age of Enlightenment has also been referred to as the [[Age of Reason]].

[[Europe]]'s [[Renaissance]], meaning "rebirth," referring to the rebirth of classical culture, beginning in the 14th century and extending into the 16th, consisted of the rediscovery of the [[classical antiquity|classical]] world's scientific contributions, and of the [[Economy|economic]] and social rise of Europe. The Renaissance also engendered a culture of [[curiosity|inquisitiveness]] which ultimately led to [[Humanism]]{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=250–53}} and the [[Scientific Revolution]].{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=683–85}} Although it saw social and political upheaval and revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, the Renaissance is perhaps known best for its [[art]]istic developments{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]."

====European expansion====

[[File:OrteliusWorldMap.jpeg|thumb|left|185px|[[Abraham Ortelius#Map publisher|1570 world map]], with Europeans' discoveries]]
During this period, European powers came to dominate most of the world. Although the most developed regions of European classical civilization were more urbanized than any other region of the world, European civilization had undergone a lengthy period of gradual decline and collapse. During the Early Modern Period, Europe was able to regain its dominance; historians still debate the causes.

Europe's success in this period stands in contrast to other regions. For example, one of the most advanced civilizations of the Middle Ages was China. It had developed an advanced [[monetary economy]] by 1000 CE. China had a free [[peasant]]ry who were no longer subsistence farmers, and could sell their produce and actively participate in the market. According to [[Adam Smith]], writing in the 18th century, China had long been one of the richest, most fertile, best cultivated, most industrious, most urbanized, and most prosperous countries in the world. It enjoyed a technological advantage and had a monopoly in [[cast iron]] production, piston bellows, [[suspension bridge]] construction, [[printing]], and the [[compass]]. However, it seemed to have long since stopped progressing. [[Marco Polo]], who visited China in the 13th century, describes its cultivation, industry, and populousness almost in the same terms as travelers would in the 18th century.
[[File:Gutenburg bible.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gutenberg Bible]], produced using [[movable type]] c. 1450]]
One theory of Europe's rise holds that Europe's [[geography]] played an important role in its success. The Middle East, India and China are all ringed by mountains and oceans but, once past these outer barriers, are nearly flat. By contrast, the [[Pyrenees]], [[Alps]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and other mountain ranges run through Europe, and the continent is also divided by several seas. This gave Europe some degree of protection from the peril of Central Asian invaders. Before the era of firearms, these nomads were militarily superior to the agricultural states on the periphery of the Eurasian continent and, as they broke out into the plains of northern India or the valleys of China, were all but unstoppable. These invasions were often devastating. The [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]] was ended by the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol]] [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]] in 1258. India and China were subject to periodic [[invasion]]s, and Russia spent a couple of centuries under the [[Tatar invasions|Mongol-Tatar]] yoke. Central and western Europe, logistically more distant from the Central Asian heartland, proved less vulnerable to these threats.

Geography contributed to important [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] differences. For most of their histories, China, India, and the Middle East were each unified under a single dominant power that expanded until it reached the surrounding mountains and deserts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 1600 the [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled almost all the Middle East,{{sfn|Imber|2002|p=66}} the [[Ming dynasty]] ruled China,{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006}}{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|pp=376–77}} and the [[Mughal Empire]] held sway over India. By contrast, Europe was almost always divided into a number of warring states. Pan-European empires, with the notable exception of the [[Roman Empire]], tended to collapse soon after they arose. Another doubtless important geographic factor in the rise of Europe was the Mediterranean Sea, which, for millennia, had functioned as a maritime superhighway fostering the exchange of goods, people, ideas and inventions.

Nearly all the agricultural civilizations have been heavily constrained by their [[Natural environment|environments]]. Productivity remained low, and [[Climate|climatic]] changes easily instigated [[boom-and-bust]] [[Business cycle|cycles]] that brought about civilizations' rise and fall. By about 1500, however, there was a qualitative change in world history. [[Technology|Technological]] advance and the [[wealth]] generated by [[trade]] gradually brought about a widening of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Miller|editor1-first=Edward|editor2-last=Postan|editor2-first=Cynthia|editor3-last=Postan|editor3-first=M. M.|title=The Cambridge economic history of Europe: Volume 2, Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-08709-4|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have also argued that Europe's institutions allowed it to expand, that [[property right]]s and [[free market|free-market]] economics were stronger than elsewhere due to an ideal of [[Political freedom|freedom]] peculiar to Europe. In recent years, however, scholars such as [[Kenneth Pomeranz]] have challenged this view. Europe's maritime expansion unsurprisingly—given the continent's geography—was largely the work of its Atlantic states: Portugal, Spain, England, France, and the Netherlands. Initially the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s were the predominant conquerors and sources of influence, and their union resulted in the [[Iberian Union]], the first [[global empire]] on which the "[[The empire on which the sun never sets|sun never set]]". Soon the more northern English, French and Dutch began to dominate the Atlantic. In a series of wars fought in the 17th and 18th centuries, culminating with the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Britain emerged as the new world power.

====Regional developments====

[[Persia]] came under the rule of the [[Safavid Empire]] in 1501, succeeded by the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid Empire]] in 1736, and the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Empire]] in 1796. Areas to the north and east were held by [[Uzbeks]] and [[Pashtuns]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]], after taking [[Constantinople]] in 1453, quickly gained control of the Middle East, the [[Balkans]], and most of North Africa.

In [[History of Africa|Africa]], this period saw a decline in many civilizations and an advancement in others. The [[Swahili Coast]] declined after coming under Portuguese (and later [[History of Oman|Omani]]) control. In west Africa, the [[Songhai Empire]] fell to the Moroccans in 1591 when they invaded with guns. The South African [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] gave way to smaller kingdoms such as [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa]], [[Kingdom of Butua|Butua]], and [[Rozwi Empire|Rozwi]]. [[Ethiopia]] suffered from the 1531 invasion from neighbouring Muslim [[Adal Sultanate]], and in 1769 entered the [[Zemene Mesafint]] (Age of Princes) during which the Emperor became a figurehead and the country was ruled by warlords, though the royal line later would recover under Emperor [[Tewodros II]]. The [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, succeeded by the [[Sultanate of the Geledi|Geledi Sultanate]]. Other civilizations in Africa advanced during this period. The [[Oyo Empire]] experienced its golden age, as did the [[Benin Empire]]. The [[Ashanti Empire]] rose to power in what is modern day [[Ghana]] in 1670. The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] also thrived during this period. European [[exploration of Africa]] reached its zenith at this time.

In the Far East, the [[History of China|Chinese]] [[Ming Dynasty]] gave way (1644) to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], the last Chinese imperial dynasty, which would rule until 1912. [[History of Japan|Japan]] experienced its [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1568–1603), followed by the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868). The [[History of Korea|Korean]] [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1910) ruled throughout this period, successfully repelling 16th- and 17th-century invasions from Japan and China. Japan and China were significantly affected during this period by expanded maritime trade with Europe, particularly the Portuguese in Japan. During the Edo period, Japan would pursue isolationist policies, to eliminate foreign influences.

The Maratha Empire would in 1818 fall under the control of the British [[East India Company]], with all former Maratha and Mughal authority devolving in 1858 to the [[British Raj]].

In 1511 the Portuguese overthrew the [[Malacca Sultanate]] in present-day Malaysia and Indonesian [[Sumatra]]. The Portuguese held this important trading territory (and the valuable associated navigational strait) until overthrown by the Dutch in 1641. The [[Johor Sultanate]], centred on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, became the dominant trading power in the region. [[Western imperialism in Asia|European colonization]] expanded with the Dutch in the [[Dutch East Indies|Netherlands East Indies]], and the Spanish in the [[History of the Philippines|Philippines]]. Into the 19th century, European expansion would affect the whole of Southeast Asia, with the British in [[History of Myanmar|Myanmar]] and [[History of Malaysia|Malaysia]], and the establishment of [[French Indochina]]. Only [[History of Thailand|Thailand]] would successfully resist colonization.

The Pacific islands of [[History of Oceania|Oceania]] would also be affected by European contact, starting with the circumnavigational voyage of [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who landed on the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] and other islands in 1521. Also notable were the voyages (1642–44) of [[Abel Tasman]] to present-day Australia, New Zealand and nearby islands, and the voyages (1768–1779) of Captain [[James Cook]], who made the first recorded European contact with [[History of Hawaii|Hawaii]]. Britain would found its first colony on Australia in 1788.

In the [[History of the Americas|Americas]], the [[European colonization of the Americas|western European powers]] vigorously colonized the newly discovered continents, largely displacing the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous populations]], and destroying the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Inca]]. Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France all made extensive territorial claims, and undertook large-scale settlement, including the importation of large numbers of African [[Slavery in the Americas|slaves]]. Portugal claimed [[History of Brazil|Brazil]]. Spain claimed the rest of [[History of South America|South America]], [[Mesoamerica]], and southern [[History of North America|North America]]. Britain colonized the east coast of North America, and France colonized the central region of North America. Russia made incursions onto the northwest coast of North America, with a first colony in present-day [[History of Alaska|Alaska]] in 1784, and the outpost of [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] in present-day [[History of California|California]] in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ohp|5|Fort Ross|2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1762, in the midst of the [[Seven Years' War]], France secretly ceded most of its North American claims to Spain in the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. Thirteen of the British colonies declared independence as the [[History of the United States|United States of America]] in 1776, ratified by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, ending the [[American Revolutionary War]]. [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] won France’s claims back from Spain in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1800, but sold them to the United States in 1803 as the [[Louisiana Purchase]].

In [[History of Russia|Russia]], [[Ivan the Terrible]] was crowned (1547) the first [[Tsar]] of Russia, and by annexing the Turkic Khanates in the east, transformed Russia into a regional power. The countries of western Europe, while expanding prodigiously through technological advancement and colonial conquest, competed with each other economically and militarily in a state of almost constant [[List of wars 1500–1799|war]]. Often the wars had a [[European wars of religion|religious dimension]], either Catholic versus Protestant, or (primarily in eastern Europe) Christian versus Muslim. Wars of particular note include the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[Seven Years' War]], and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Napoleon came to power in France in 1799, an event foreshadowing the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century.

[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Watt|Watt]]'s [[steam engine]] powered the [[Industrial Revolution]].]]
The [[Scientific Revolution]] changed humanity's understanding of the world and led to the [[Industrial Revolution]], a major transformation of the world's economies. The [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 17th century had had little immediate effect on industrial [[technology]]; only in the second half of the 18th century did scientific advances begin to be applied substantially to practical [[invention]]. The Industrial Revolution began in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] and used new modes of production—the [[factory]], [[mass production]], and [[mechanization]]—to manufacture a wide array of goods faster and using less labour than previously required. The [[Age of Enlightenment]] also led to the beginnings of modern [[democracy]] in the late-18th century [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s. [[Democracy]] and [[republicanism]] would grow to have a profound effect on world events and on [[quality of life]].
[[File:World 1898 empires colonies territory.png|thumb|260px|[[Empire]]s, 1898]]
After Europeans had achieved influence and control over the Americas, [[Imperialism|imperial]] activities turned to the lands of Asia and Oceania. In the 19th century the European states had social and technological advantage over Eastern lands.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Britain gained control of the Indian subcontinent, Egypt and the [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malay Peninsula]]; the [[Cochinchina Campaign|French took Indochina]]; while the Dutch cemented their control over the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The British also colonized Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with large numbers of British colonists emigrating to these colonies. Russia colonized large pre-agricultural areas of Siberia. In the late 19th century, the European powers [[Scramble for Africa|divided the remaining areas of Africa]]. Within Europe, economic and military challenges created a system of [[nation state]]s, and ethno-linguistic groupings began to identify themselves as distinctive nations with aspirations for cultural and political autonomy. This [[nationalism]] would become important to peoples across the world in the 20th century.

During the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], the world economy became reliant on [[coal]] as a fuel, as new methods of [[transport]], such as [[railways]] and [[steamship]]s, effectively shrank the world. Meanwhile, industrial [[pollution]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] damage, present since the discovery of fire and the beginning of civilization, accelerated drastically.

The advantages that Europe had developed by the mid-18th century were two: an [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Neal|title=John Locke and agrarian capitalism|date=1984|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-05046-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KIpqQ9QHBkC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the wealth generated by the Atlantic trade (including the [[African slave trade]]). By the late 16th century, [[silver]] from the Americas accounted for the Spanish empire's wealth.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The profits of the [[slave trade]] and of [[West Indies|West Indian]] plantations amounted to 5% of the [[Economic history of the United Kingdom|British economy]] at the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mintz |first1=S. |last2=McNeil |first2=S. |title=Was slavery the engine of economic growth? |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/topic_display.cfm?tcid=104 |website=Digital History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226000000/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some historians conclude that, in 1750, [[Workforce productivity|labour productivity]] in the most developed regions of China was still on a par with that of Europe's Atlantic economy,&lt;ref&gt;see the NBER Publications by Carol H.

The 20th century opened with Europe at an apex of wealth and power, and with much of the world under its direct [[Colonialism|colonial]] control or its indirect domination. Much of the rest of the world was influenced by heavily Europeanized nations: the United States and Japan. As the century unfolded, however, the global system dominated by rival powers was subjected to severe strains, and ultimately seemed to yield to a more fluid structure of independent nations organized on Western models.

This transformation was [[catalysis|catalysed]] by wars of unparalleled scope and devastation. [[World War I]] destroyed many of Europe's empires and monarchies, and weakened Britain and France. In its aftermath, powerful ideologies arose. The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 created the first [[communism|communist]] state, while the 1920s and 1930s saw [[militarism|militaristic]] [[fascism|fascist]] dictatorships gain control in Italy, Germany, Spain and elsewhere.

Ongoing national rivalries, exacerbated by the economic turmoil of the [[Great Depression]], helped precipitate [[World War II]]. The [[Militarism|militaristic]] [[dictatorship]]s of Europe and Japan pursued an ultimately doomed course of [[Imperialism|imperialist]] [[expansionism]], in the course of which [[Nazi Germany]] orchestrated the murder of six million [[Jews]] in [[the Holocaust]] and of millions of [[Poles]], [[Russians]], and other [[Slavs]], while [[Imperial Japan]] murdered millions of [[Chinese people|Chinese]]. An earlier, [[World War I]] model of [[genocide]] had been provided by [[Turkey]]'s mass murder of [[Armenians]].  The World War II defeat of the [[Axis Powers]] opened the way for the advance of [[communism]] into [[Central Europe]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Albania]], China, [[North Vietnam]], and [[North Korea]].

In China, [[Mao Zedong]] implemented [[industrialization]] and [[collectivization]] reforms as part of the [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958–62), leading to the [[Great Chinese Famine|starvation deaths]] (1959–61) of tens of millions of people.

The Cold War ended in 1991, when the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union disintegrated]], in part due to inability to compete economically with the United States and western Europe.  However, the United States likewise began to show signs of slippage in its geopolitical influence,{{sfn|McCormick|1995||p=155}}{{efn|"In the aftermath of the disintegration of the Soviet Union..." writes [[Graham Allison]], "Americans were... caught up in a surge of [[triumphalism]]."

The greenhouse effect is a natural mechanism that becomes dangerous if the [[atmosphere]]'s [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] concentrations exceed environmentally safe levels, as they have gradually been doing since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].  As predicted, this is already increasing the frequency and severity of [[flood]]s and [[drought]]s due to accelerated melting of [[icecap]]s, [[glacier]]s, and [[snowpack]]s; flooding of low-lying [[coast]]s; [[storm]]s; [[agricultural]] disruption and [[famine]]s; [[ecological]] displacements; [[ocean acidification]] with havoc to marine life; release, from thawing [[Arctic]] [[permafrost]], of [[methane]], a greenhouse gas more powerful than [[carbon dioxide]]; and intra- and intersocietal [[conflict (process)|conflicts]], with increased [[crime]] and [[warfare]].  The multifarious, irreversible damage from global warming will accelerate as environmental [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping points]] are reached.  The late [[Physics|physicist]]–[[cosmology|cosmologist]] [[Stephen Hawking]] on 2 July 2017, belatedly celebrating his 75th birthday, warned that [[Earth|planet Earth]] is rapidly approaching an irreversible [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] that will leave the planet with an uninhabitable environment like that of [[Venus]], with a temperature of 250 degrees and [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric-acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]], [[BBC World Service]], 2 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[U.S. military]] are already forced to factor global-warming effects into their planning for military [[infrastructure]], war, and [[disaster relief]].}} in December 2015 195 countries signed the [[Paris Climate Agreement]], though in 2017 President [[Donald Trump]] announced his withdrawal of the United States from the Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Busby, "Warming World:  Why Climate Change Matters More Than Anything Else", ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', vol. 97, no. 4 (July / August 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|On 8 October 2018 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] published a report stating that, if drastic changes in the global [[energy]] base and lifestyle are not made by about 2030—within a dozen years—civilization on planet Earth will become unsalvageable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], ''Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C'', 8 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|[[Astrophysicist]] [[John Gribbin]], writing in ''[[Scientific American]]'', contemplates the evolution of the [[cosmos|cosmic]] infrastructure that made the history of the world possible, and concludes that "we are probably the only intelligent life in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.... And if our planet is so special, it becomes all the more important to preserve this unique world for ourselves, our descendants and the many creatures that call Earth home."  He explains that the [[universe]]'s first [[star]]s after the [[Big Bang]], 13 billion years ago, could not have had planets because [[chemical elements]] heavier than [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] had not yet been cooked up inside stars.  By the time our star, the [[Sun]], came into being 4.5 billion years ago, there were sufficient amounts of heavier elements available to form [[Earth]].  The Sun resides within a fairly narrow "galactic habitable zone" that is at reduced risk from destructive [[supernova]]e and [[gamma-ray burst]]s.  An orderly arrangement of [[planet]]s in nearly circular [[orbit]]s providing long-term stability – as in our [[solar system]] – is uncommon.  "Earth-like planets" that have been discovered are generally uninhabitable, by contrast with Earth with its thin mobile crust where [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] activity brings [[ore]]s and nutrients to the surface through [[volcanism]].  Earth also has a large [[metal]]lic core that, coupled with Earth's rapid rotation, produces a strong [[magnetic field]] that shields Earth from harmful [[cosmic radiation]]; without this screen, "our atomosphere would probably erode, and any living thing on the surface would get fried."  These planetary attributes are diredtly related to our [[Moon]], which probably formed early in the solar system's history when a [[Mars]]-size object struck the nascent Earth a glancing blow, causing both [[protoplanet]]s to melt; the metallic material from the two objects settled into Earth's center, and much of Earth's original lighter rocky material splashed out to become the Moon, leaving Earth with a thinner crust.  Without that impact, Earth would lack its crucial magnetic field and plate tectonics.  The presence of such a large Moon stabilizes Earth, preventing it from toppling far from the vertical, as happened with Mars.  Once the Earth-Moon system settled down, "life emerged with almost indecent rapidity":  [[fossil]]s of single-celled [[prokaryote]]s have been found in rocks 3.4 billion years old – about a billion years younger than Earth.  But it was only about 1.5 billion years ago that more complex, [[eukaryote]] cells, the stuff of all plants and animals, arose from a single merging of two types of primordial single-celled organisms:  [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].  "It is a measure of how unlikely such a single fusion of cells was that it took two billion years of [[evolution]] to occur."  Even then, little changed for about a billion years, apart from early eukaryotes forming flat, soft-bodied multicellular organisms, until the [[Cambrian explosion]] some 550 million years ago.  [[DNA analysis]], showing extremely close similarities among the most diverse human populations, indicates that all humans are descended from a tiny population, possibly survivors of some catastrophe or catastrophes.  DNA evidence pinpoints two [[evolutionary bottleneck]]s:  150,000 years ago, the human population was reduced to no more than a few thousand breeding pairs; and about 70,000 years ago, the entire human population fell to about 1,000.  "Is life likely to exist elsewhere in the galaxy?" asks John Gribbin.  "Almost certainly, given the speed with which it appeared on Earth.  Is another [[technology|technological]] [[civilization]] likely to exist today?  Almost certainly no, given the chain of circumstances that led to our existence."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gribbin]], "Alone in the Milky Way:  Why we are probably the only intelligent life in the galaxy", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 3 (September 2018), pp. 94–99.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|Historian [[Christopher R. Browning]] concludes an article on "The Suffocation of Democracy":  "[W]ithin several decades after [[Donald Trump|Trump]]'s presidency has ended, the looming effects of [[Effects of global warming|ecological disaster]] due to human-caused [[climate change]]—which Trump not only denies but is doing so much to accelerate—will be inescapable.  [[Desertification]] of continental interiors, [[flooding]] of populous coastal areas, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, with concomitant shortages of fresh water and food, will set in motion both population flight and conflicts over scarce resources that dwarf the current fate of [[Central Africa]] and [[Syria]].

The '''International Vaccine Institute''' (IVI) is an independent, nonprofit, international organization that was founded on the belief that the health of children in developing countries can be dramatically improved by the use of new and improved [[vaccines]]. Working in collaboration with the international scientific community, public health organizations, governments, and industry, IVI is involved in all areas of the vaccine spectrum – from new vaccine design in the laboratory to vaccine development and evaluation in the field to facilitating sustainable introduction of vaccines in countries where they are most needed.

Created initially as an initiative of the [[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Programme]] (UNDP), IVI began formal operations as an independent international organization in 1997 in [[Seoul]], [[Republic of Korea]]. Currently, IVI has 35 countries and the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]] as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. The Institute has a unique mandate to work exclusively on vaccine development and introduction specifically for people in developing countries, with a focus on neglected diseases affecting these regions.

== History ==

=== Background ===
In 1992, Dr. Seung-Il Shin, then Senior Health Advisor for the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]], initiated a study to explore the feasibility of establishing an international institute devoted to vaccine research and development within the framework of the Children’s Vaccine Initiative (CVI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/seung-il-shin|title=Seung Il Shin - Founder &amp;amp; Board Director @ Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on the results of Dr. Shin’s feasibility study, in 1993 the UNDP adopted a formal proposal to establish the International Vaccine Institute (IVI). In 1994, following a call for proposals to host IVI in the Asia Pacific region, the UNDP and the Republic of Korea reached an agreement to host the center in Seoul. In 1995, UNDP opened an interim IVI office on the campus of Seoul National University and the Institute began its initial work and organizational development.

[[File:Establishment Agreement Signing.jpg|thumb|330x330px|Signing of the IVI Establishment Agreement]]

=== Foundation ===
In 1995 and 1996, the UNDP and the South Korean government jointly developed the basic framework and Constitution of IVI. In order to establish IVI as an independent international organization, the UNDP and Korean government elected to establish the institute through an intergovernmental agreement of UN member states, as sanctioned in the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties of 1969]].

On October 28, 1996, the IVI Establishment Agreement opened for signatures at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN headquarters]] in New York City. Representatives of [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Panama]], [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Romania]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Uzbekistan]], and the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] were the first to sign the agreement, followed shortly thereafter by [[Senegal]] and [[Philippines|the Philippines]].

In 1997 more countries followed, with [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Jamaica]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Peru]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Tajikistan]], and Turkey signing the Agreement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IX-3&amp;chapter=9&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 1997, The IVI Establishment Agreement entered into force following the submission of instruments of ratification by South Korea, Sweden, and Uzbekistan. The IVI Establishment Agreement entered the [[Treaty series#United Nations|United Nations Depository of Treaties]] under Chapter IX. HEALTH, section 3.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On September 24, 1998 the IVI Headquarters Agreement was signed at a formal ceremony at [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP headquarters]] by South Korea’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon. [[Hong Soon-young|Hong Soon-Young]] and IVI Board Chairman, [[Barry Bloom|Dr. Barry Bloom]]. The Headquarters Agreement established IVI as a legal entity with diplomatic immunity in South Korea,, becoming the first international organization to be headquartered in South Korea. In accordance with IVI’s independent status, the Institute formally separated from the UNDP in 1998. 
[[File:IVI Building (1).jpg|thumb|290x290px|IVI Headquarters]]

=== Headquarters building ===
The IVI headquarters building, located in [[Seoul National University]]’s Research Park in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], was designed by a consortium consisting of [[Samoo Architects &amp; Engineers|Samwoo Architects]] of South Korea and [https://www.payette.com/ Payette Associates] of Boston, USA. Construction began in 1998 and was completed in 2003. The building houses laboratories, animal facilities, offices, an auditorium, and a library. A separate 1,300m² pilot plant facility, intended for the production of test lots of vaccines for training and evaluation purposes, was constructed but never completed due to a lack of funding.

== Previous activities ==

=== Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) 2000-2006 ===

IVI’s first major initiative, Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) was a program of research and technical assistance to accelerate the introduction of new vaccines against [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]], and [[shigellosis]] into public health programs for the poor in developing countries. From 2000 to 2006, IVI’s DOMI program carried out vaccination campaigns, disease surveillance, and research studies in [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mozambique]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. &amp;nbsp;At the conclusion of the DOMI program, IVI synthesized the diverse epidemiological, clinical, economic, and behavioral findings of these studies in order to facilitate informed decision-making by policymakers at the national level on the use of vaccines against the diseases targeted by DOMI. The [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] was the primary funder of the DOMI program with a US$40 million contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2003-2004|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2005|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea.|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DOMI typhoid ====

The DOMI Typhoid program was initiated to address the barriers of access to [[Typhoid vaccine|typhoid vaccines]] in the developing world and to accelerate the introduction of modern typhoid vaccines in countries where they were needed. DOMI Typhoid utilized the Vi-[[Polysaccharide]] (Vi-PS) vaccine because it is easily and inexpensively produced by manufacturers in developing countries, it is given in a single dose, and it is relatively thermostable. DOMI Typhoid operated in five study sites: [[Hechi|Heichi]], China; [[Kolkata]], India; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Karachi]], Pakistan; and [[Huế|Hue]], Vietnam. From these sites, IVI experts conducted disease surveillance, disease burden studies, cost-of-illness studies, socio-behavioral studies, and vaccine demonstration projects. IVI presented the accumulated evidence from DOMI Typhoid in case studies to officials in each host country. As a result, policymakers in Pakistan, Indonesia, and Vietnam agreed to introduce school-based typhoid vaccination campaigns on a pilot basis. Results from China uncovered a previously unknown growing incidence rate of [[Paratyphoid fever|paratyphoid A]] infections in China’s [[Guangxi|Guangxi province]], which led to IVI launching its Paratyphoid in China project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DOMI cholera ====

The DOMI Cholera program sought to develop and accelerate the use of an affordable [[cholera vaccine]] in [[cholera]]-endemic countries. DOMI Cholera operated from five study sites: [[Matlab (Bangladesh)|Matlab]], Bangladesh; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Kolkata]], India; [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], Mozambique; and [[Huế|Hue]], Vietnam. From these sites, IVI conducted disease burden, economic, and socio-behavioral studies and cholera vaccination campaigns. The studies found a high demand for cholera vaccine and high incidence rates (3-9/1,000) in children 5 years old and younger. IVI’s vaccination campaign in Beira saw more than 44,000 children and adults receive the internationally-licensed Dukoral vaccine. In Kolkata, IVI vaccinated more than 67,000 children and adults using an oral cholera vaccine produced by Vietnam’s [http://www.vabiotech.com.vn/?lang=en VaBiotech.] At the onset of DOMI Cholera, the only internationally licensed cholera vaccine available was Dukoral, but at $90 for the two-dose series, this vaccine was too expensive for public use in many of the poorest developing countries. VaBiotech’s cholera vaccine, originally developed by Vietnam’s [http://nihe.org.vn/en/home-c10902.htm National Institute of Health and Epidemiology] following a technology transfer from the [[University of Gothenburg]] in [[Sweden]], was not licensed for international use but showed great promise as a low-cost vaccine for the developing world. As a result, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] provided IVI with additional funding to establish the Cholera Vaccine Initiative (CVI) with the goal of reformulating the VaBiotech vaccine for international use. 

==== DOMI shigellosis ====
IVI established the DOMI [[Shigellosis]] program with the ultimate goal of accelerating the development and introduction of a safe and protective shigella vaccine to control epidemic and endemic disease. Between 2000 and 2004, the DOMI Shigella program ran disease surveillance sites in 6 locations across Southeast Asia: [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh; [[Hebei]], China; [[Karachi]], Pakistan and neighboring villages; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Nha Trang]], Vietnam; and [[Saraburi Province]], Thailand. The program enhanced understanding of what an effective shigella vaccine will need and established an accurate disease burden in the countries where it operated. The program first evaluated an oral shigella vaccine (SC602) in Bangladesh, but it failed to elicit an immune response. The high disease burden, serotype diversity, and high levels AMR discovered at IVI's surveillance sites underscored the need for a vaccine that protects against all common strains of the disease. As a result, IVI’s Division of Laboratory Sciences initiated a multiyear program to sequence the Shigella genome and identify common proteins in different Shigella species that could be used to develop a vaccine against all common strains of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=22-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rotavirus Diarrhea Program 1999-2010 ===
IVI initiated the Rotavirus Diarrhea Program to provide policymakers in developing countries with the disease burden evidence and economic data needed to ensure the inclusion of [[Rotavirus vaccine|rotavirus vaccines]] in their [[Vaccination schedule|national immunization programs]]. Running from 1999 to 2010, the program conducted disease surveillance and economic studies in [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]], [[South Korea]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Vietnam]]. In 2007, in collaboration with Vietnam’s National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE), IVI conducted a Phase II trial of [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK’s]] RotaRix rotavirus vaccine in [[Khánh Hòa Province|Khanh Hoa]], Vietnam. &amp;nbsp;In 2009, in collaboration with NIHE, [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], and [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]], IVI completed a phase III trial of Merck’s RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine in [[Nha Trang]] Vietnam, where it vaccinated 900 infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2009|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2010|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=24-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; 

=== Dengue Vaccine Programs 2002-2016 ===

==== The Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI''')''' ====
The Pediatric [[Dengue fever|Dengue]] Vaccine Initiative was a product development partnership launched by IVI to accelerate the introduction of safe and effective [[dengue vaccine]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s for children in dengue-endemic countries. From 2002 to 2010, PDVI operated in [[Brazil]], [[Cambodia]], [[Colombia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]. PDVI made many contributions to dengue vaccine development, including:

* Development of a dengue vaccine partnership and global research network to develop, evaluate, and introduce dengue vaccines. Working with Brazil’s [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]], the [[National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institute of Health]], and [[Sanofi Pasteur]], PDVI provided technical advice and support for the efficacy and clinical trials of their respective dengue vaccine candidates and established a consortium of field sites in dengue-endemic countries across Asia and the Americas.
* Establishment of two regional Dengue Prevention Boards in the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas to disseminate information and make recommendations regarding the control of dengue through immunization.
* Collaboration with the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] to develop a free user-friendly software, [http://www.denguevaccine.org/resource-search/?types%5B%5D=2 DenguEcon], which can be used by policymakers to determine the economic impact of dengue.

In 2010, PDVI transitioned into the Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2010|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2011|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=22-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI) ====
The successor to PDVI, the Dengue Vaccine Initiative was an IVI-led consortium with the [[World Health Organization]], [[Sabin Vaccine Institute|the Sabin Vaccine Institute]], the Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR), and the [http://ivac.jhu.edu/ International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. DVI continued the work of PDVI and focused on laying the groundwork for dengue vaccine decision-making and vaccine introduction in endemic areas. Each consortium member was responsible for a specific component: WHO – information and guidance documents, and regulatory training activities; Johns Hopkins – dengue vaccine financing and strategic demand forecasting; and Sabin – communications and advocacy. Besides leading the consortium, IVI generated evidence for decision-making such as disease burden, country vaccine introduction cases and a global investment case. From 2010 to 2016, DVI operated in [[Brazil]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cambodia]], [[Colombia]], [[Gabon]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. From 2013-2015, with funding from [[Germany]]’s [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education &amp; Research (BMBF)]], IVI continued support for preclinical development of dengue vaccines by Brazil’s [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]] and Vietnam’s VaBiotech. After the 2016 licensure of [[Sanofi|Sanofi Pasteur’s]] Dengvaxia vaccine, the DVI project came to a close and its IVI staff transitioned to a new project, the Global Dengue &amp; [[Aedes]]-Transmitted Disease Consortium (GDAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ivi.int/wp-content/uploads/kboard_attached/11/201610/IVI%20Annual%20Report%202015.pdf|title=IVI 2015 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ivi.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6/15/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signatory Countries of the IVI ===
As of January 2011, IVI includes 40 countries and the '''World Health Organization (WHO)''' as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. To be more specific, there are 33 signatory countries, which are the states that express their consent to be bound by a treaty by signing the treaty without the need for ratification, acceptance of approval. These states may definitively sign a treaty only when the treaty so permits. In addition, there are 16 parties which involve '''Liberia, Republic of Korea, Brazil, Mongolia, China, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Sweden, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Peru, Philippines''', and the '''World Health Organization (WHO)'''. A major difference between a signatory and a party is that a party to a treaty is a state or other entity with treaty-making capacity that has expressed its consent to be bound by that treaty by an act of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession etc. where that treaty has entered into force for that particular State.

In short, in addition to the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]], 40 countries include [[Bangladesh]], [[Liberia]]**, [[Republic of Korea]]**, [[Bhutan]], [[Malta]], [[Romania]], [[Brazil]]**, [[Mongolia]]**, [[Senegal]], [[China]]**, [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]]**, [[Ecuador]]**, [[Nepal]], [[Sweden]]**, [[Egypt]], [[Netherlands]]**, [[Tajikistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Oman]]**, [[Thailand]], [[Israel]], [[Pakistan]]**, [[Turkey]], [[Jamaica]], [[Panama]], [[Uzbekistan]]**, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Vietnam]]**, [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Peru]]**, [[Lebanon]], [[Philippines]]**, [[Cote d'Ivoire]], [[India]], [[Kuwait]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], and [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivi.int/about_us/signatory_countries.html Governance. 'Signatory Countries.']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International health''', also called '''''geographic medicine''''', '''''[[international medicine]]''''', or '''''[[global health]]''''', is a field of [[health]] care, usually with a public health emphasis, dealing with health across regional or national boundaries. One subset of international medicine, [[travel medicine]], prepares travelers with immunizations, prophylactic medications, preventive techniques such as bednets and residual pesticides, in-transit care, and post-travel care for exotic illnesses. International health, however, more often refers to health personnel or organizations from one area or nation providing direct health care, or health sector development, in another area or nation. It is this sense of the term that is explained here. More recently, [[public health]] experts have become interested in global processes that impact on human health. [[Globalization and health]], for example, illustrates the complex and changing sociological environment within which the determinants of [[health]] and [[disease]] express themselves.

==International health governance==
The World Health Organization (WHO) is the international body primarily responsible for regulating and governing health-related policies and practices across nations. While the WHO uses various policies and treaties to address international health issues, many of their policies have no binding power and thus state compliance is often limited. As a result, a Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH) has recently been proposed as a global health treaty that would use stronger domestic accountability mechanisms (including incentives &amp; sanctions) in order to close national and global health inequities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhealthtreaty.org|title=FCGH - Framework  Convention for Global Health|website=www.globalhealthtreaty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars have addressed concerns regarding the FCGH, arguing that it would duplicate other global health governance efforts, lack feasibility, and have limited impact in regulating global health.&lt;ref&gt; S.J. Hoffman, J-A. Røttingen. 2013. "Dark Sides of the Proposed Framework Convention on Global Health's Many Virtues: A Systematic Review and Critical Analysis," Health &amp; Human Rights Journal 15(1): 117-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of NGOs==

Much work in international health is performed by [[non-governmental organizations]], or NGOs. Services provided by international health NGOs include direct health care, community potable water, vitamin supplementation, and mitigation of endemic and epidemic infectious diseases and malnutrition. Examples of NGOs dedicated to international health include:
* [[Pakistan Heart Foundation]]
* [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]]
* [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (''Doctors Without Borders'')
* The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]
* [[International Medical Corps]]
* [[Oxfam]]
* [[Partners in Health]]
* [[Project HOPE (USA)|Project HOPE]]
* [[Save the Children]]

==In harm's way==

These organizations often go in harm's way to provide services to people affected by natural disaster or conflict. For example, Médecins Sans Frontières has lost members in the [[Darfur]] area, and Care International's Iraq Director, [[Margaret Hassan]] (a long-time Iraq resident with dual Iraqi-British citizenship) was brutally murdered on the Internet by [[Al Qaeda]]-affiliated terrorists for the "crime" of providing services equitably among Iraqis. International Medical Corps was begun in response to the suffering of the Afghan people after the Soviet invasion of 1979, and is adept at providing services in dangerous places (see [[Attacks on humanitarian workers]]).

==The role of international health NGOs in international development==

Health-related NGOs also provide capacity development in areas of need; that is, helping nations develop sustainable domestic health solutions through training programs. An example of this type of aid is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080215182327/http://www.cirnetwork.org/content.cfm?id=5B&amp;newCommunity&amp;CFID=2167600&amp;CFTOKEN=29744944 Center for International Rehabilitation], which has provided rehabilitation training for Iraqi physical therapists, physicians, and rehabilitation clinic managers in Tuzla, Bosnia and Amman, Jordan. These trainees then care for amputees, spinal and head injury patients in their home country.

==NGOs vs. missionaries==

One important characteristic of NGO work is that, in the "pure" sense, they provide services based solely upon need, without political, ethnic, religious or other considerations. Thus, strictly speaking, religious [[missionary]] organizations that perform services as part of a proselytizing or evangelical campaign should be separated from the NGO category and simply be referred to as religious missionary organizations. Some religious relief organizations do provide services more as a duty or "charity", however, without requirements for the recipients to attend any preaching, prayer or other religious preconditions.ngo

==Harnessing the power of technology==

As NGO practice evolves parallel with technology, NGOs have developed more scientific and precise methods of assessment, planning and operations in humanitarian assistance and complex emergencies. One example is the [[Sphere Project]]'s  [https://web.archive.org/web/20061229181547/http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response]. They have taken other new tools into the planning offices and field: in addition to the obligatory laptop computer, they typically rely heavily upon cellular and satellite communications, the Internet, and geographic information services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/IMToolbox/web/03_Map.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208124849/http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/IMToolBox/web/03_Map.html |archivedate=2008-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or GIS. These technological improvements allow them to better focus efforts in areas of need, respond to evolving crises, and predict future needs. Indeed, in a related effort, the [[United States Holocaust Museum]] teamed with [[Google Earth]] to establish baseline GIS photos of crisis-torn Darfur, updating them at intervals, and uploading them to the Internet for public access. Since Internet "surfers" can browse these images and see where once-present villages are later obliterated, this teamwork gave lie to the Sudanese claim that it was engaging in neither ethnic cleansing nor genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/googleearth/projects/darfur/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224130801/http://www.ushmm.org/googleearth/projects/darfur/ |archivedate=2007-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The U.S. Department of Defense==

In another teamwork effort, the [[S. Ward Casscells|Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs)]] of the United States [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], as the DoD's senior medical officer, established the International Health Division[https://web.archive.org/web/20081224235922/http://fhp.osd.mil/intlhealth/] in late 2007 to help coordinate military health doctrine and practices in international development. The International Health Division places great emphasis upon working with NGOs to provide sustainable, culturally-appropriate development activities around the world. While critics maintain that DoD does not provide aid equitably and without regard to political influence, the Asian tsunami of December, 2004 (due to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]) demonstrated that DoD was capable of working in a supporting role without regard to geopolitical gain. Indeed, the DoD was surprised at the unexpected degree of improvement in American prestige as a result of its role in Southeast Asia and months later, in the Pakistan earthquake. A similar event resulted in rapid mobilization of DoD resources in response to the [[2007 Peru earthquake]], Bangladeshi [[Typhoon]] Sidr&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/28/asia/AS-GEN-Bangladesh-Cyclone.php|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|publisher=|date=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tropical Storm]] Nero in the [[Dominican Republic]], all in the last half of 2007, with no reasonable expectation of material gain for America.

In 2005, then-Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] signed DoD Directive 3000.05, "Stability, Security, Transition and Reconstruction Operations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/300005p.pdf|title=Directives Division|website=www.dtic.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document requires the DoD to assign Stability, Security, Transition and Reconstruction (SSTR) the same importance in planning and preparation as it gives to warfighting.

The rationale for SSTR is intuitive: stability promotes rule of law and economic development. These provide the base for essential services such as education, [[public health]] and [[sanitation]], law enforcement and fire suppression. Essential services, in turn, lead to increased stability and economic opportunity. Health in the general population, and in particular the labor force, is essential to productivity and consequent stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2007/pr11/en/|title=WHO - World Health Day 2007: International Health Security|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these relationships are not necessarily linear, and there is no inherent guarantee of equitable distribution of wealth in a developing society, full employment and hope for the future may be powerful disincentives to conflict. In this way, the DoD, through SSTR operations, expects to prevent some potential conflicts and criminal activities.

The International Health Division, charged with policy implications of DoDD 3000.05, is located within the Office of the ASD(HA), reporting through Force Health Protection &amp; Readiness. International Health develops DoD's policy on [[medical ethics]] and the practice of medicine in international health and development settings. International Health also identifies needs in developing nations and looks for [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), intergovernmental organizations, and private voluntary organizations (PVOs) such as professional societies, that have the ability and expertise to address these problems. In this way, the NGOs develop helping relationships with the nations or regions they work in, fostering stability and sustainability.

Other DoD international health activities occurring on a regular basis include [[Civic action program|medical civic action projects]] (MEDCAPs), in which Army, Navy or Air Force medical assets provide direct care, sanitation, and other public health services to host nation (HN) locals. Such MEDCAPs are generally traced to the [[Vietnam war]], when medical units and medical personnel assigned to combat units would organize field medical care to Vietnamese, [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and others. There is a growing realization among the military that MEDCAP care may not be the best model, if the result is merely handing out antibiotics for upper respiratory infections and anti-inflammatories for aches and pains. However, projects such as de-worming, dentistry, prenatal education and care, and veterinary care, when performed in conjunction with HN health authorities and the local health infrastructure, have indisputable and long-lasting benefits to the recipients.

Similar to MEDCAPs, the military performs [[Civic action program|Medical Readiness Training Exercises]] (MEDRETEs), [[Joint Combined Exchange Training]] (JCET), and Humanitarian-Civic Action (HCA) exercises, all of which may have direct and indirect services as a feature of the training.

Finally, the military has unparalleled logistical and lift capabilities to respond to humanitarian assistance/disaster response(HADR) needs.

In conjunction with the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]] (USUHS), the  [http://www.cdham.org/ Center for Disaster and Humanitarian Medicine (CDHAM)] develops curriculum, teaches disaster and humanitarian assistance principles to graduate, medical, and post-doctoral students and publishes courses on incident command and other related topics. The handbook on military-NGO relations, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101110012445/http://fhp.osd.mil/intlhealth/pdfs/ngo_guidebook_S1.pdf "A Guide to Non-Governmental Organizations for the Military"] is available free on-line.

==The American College of Academic International Medicine==

Among more recent developments in the area, the formation of the [[American College of Academic International Medicine]] (ACAIM) provided a renewed impetus toward the consolidation and formalization of U.S. based coordination of [[Academic International Medicine]] (AIM) efforts across the multiple currently existing platforms [http://acaim.org//]. Since its inception, ACAIM galvanized the U.S. AIM community to action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijam-web.org/article.asp?issn=2455-5568;year=2016;volume=2;issue=2;spage=121;epage=126;aulast=Anderson|title=Mission statement for the American College of Academic International Medicine: Empowering individuals, nurturing wellness, promoting excellence, stimulating minds, striving for sustainability, and celebrating inclusion|publisher=MedKnow|date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the need for the formation of cross-disciplinary, bi-directional [[International Medical Programs]] (IMPs) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321386255_A_Comprehensive_Framework_for_International_Medical_Programs_A_2017_consensus_statement_from_the_American_College_of_Academic_International_Medicine|title=A Comprehensive Framework for International Medical Programs: A 2017 consensus statement from the American College of Academic International Medicine|date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that foster the sustainable development of AIM efforts while minimizing the deleterious effects of brain drain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijam-web.org/article.asp?issn=2455-5568;year=2016;volume=2;issue=1;spage=68;epage=77;aulast=Wernick|title=Brain drain in academic medicine: Dealing with personnel departures and loss of talent|publisher=MedKnow|date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another novel and unique aspect of [[ACAIM]]'s overall mission and postulate is the need for healthcare institutions, both academic and non-academic, to recognize faculty efforts dedicated to [[International Medical Program]] development as valid expressions of academic contribution that should be granted credit equivalence with U.S. based medical outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321386174_The_American_College_of_Academic_International_Medicine_2017_Consensus_Statement_on_International_Medical_Programs_Establishing_a_system_of_objective_valuation_and_quantitative_metrics_to_facilitate_t|title=The American College of Academic International Medicine 2017 Consensus Statement on International Medical Programs: Establishing a system of objective valuation and quantitative metrics to facilitate the recognition and incorporation of academic international medical efforts into existing promotion and tenure paradigms|date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within such proposed framework, faculty members would receive [[academic RVU]] based credit for international work, with academic tracks formally recognizing [[International Medical Program]] contributions as equivalent to any other academic or educational work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321386174_The_American_College_of_Academic_International_Medicine_2017_Consensus_Statement_on_International_Medical_Programs_Establishing_a_system_of_objective_valuation_and_quantitative_metrics_to_facilitate_t|title=The American College of Academic International Medicine 2017 Consensus Statement on International Medical Programs: Establishing a system of objective valuation and quantitative metrics to facilitate the recognition and incorporation of academic international medical efforts into existing promotion and tenure paradigms|date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of new constitutionalism is the result of [[globalization]] and the growing need for [[global hegemony]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Institutions have gained power in regards to trade, mobility, and flexibility through the framework of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the [[European Union]] are all actors contributing to the power of global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

New constitutionalism as a political order emerged in the latter half of the 20th century and the term was coined by academic[[Stephen Gill (political scientist)|Stephen Gill]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  The need for economic constitutional change was the result of crisis in political order correspondingly to the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Cold War]] as well as the progress of [[globalization]] through technological means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Since then the disciplinary has grown in acceptance due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] of 2007 and the need for largescale stabilization in its aftermath.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Theorists have subsequently developed the social and economic practices both in support and disagreement of the framework to provide a comparative outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbink|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Assessing the New Constitutionalism|url=https://www.jstor.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/stable/20434076?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=40 [2]|pages=227–245|issn=0010-4159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
New constitutionalism formed in the 1980s as the result of a growing world order and the “worldwide market revolution.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The end of the [[Cold War]] represented an ideological shift and the need for transformation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This shift was reiterated by [[Margaret Thatcher|Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher]] declaring the depletion of [[socialism]] and the rise of [[conservatism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As society progressed it allowed for the evolution of capital mobility, [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporation]] and the expansion of the world market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The [[Great Depression]] and the aftermath of [[World War II]] reflected the need for reform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Reform would redirect economic and political practices, ensuring benefits for all through the creation of global institutions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Falk, R. (2014). New Constitutionalism and geopolitics: notes on legality and legitimacy and prospects for a just new constitutionalism. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 295-312. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-liberal supremacy through the dominance of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] allowed for geopolitical reconfiguration increasing the need for new political order.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Additionally the lack of consistency among nation-state principles and the constant interruption from democratic power influenced the need to provide sustainable long term economic goals by limiting [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches of government using [[Constitution|constitutional framework]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cutler, A. Claire. (2016) "Transformations in Statehood, the Investor-State Regime, and the New Constitutionalism." ''Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies'' 23, no. 1: 95-125.&lt;/ref&gt; New constitutionalism has become prominent in the aftermath of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007 global financial crisis]] as a result of the need to bypass formal trade rules and democratic controls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneiderman, D. (2014).  How to govern differently: neo-liberal, new constitutionalism and international investment law. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 159-175. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework ==
There are four main [[Policy|policies]] to define new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The first represents the development of a constitutional structure for the global market that dictates the public, private and international powers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These international economic agreements or “[[constitution]]s” resemble political constitutions and thus ensure [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The economic power is being shifted from the national to the international as well as from the public to the private to provide growth and sustainability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Second is the separation of economic policies from domestic influence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This allows for capitalist markets to grow as well as extending the commodity form and the market forces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''' ''' This separation insulates economic policies from governing regulatory powers as well as the public demand for transparency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Economic Liberation Movement|Economic liberation]] is usually accompanied by political backlash, by disconnecting these two dynamisms suppresses democratic involvement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[World Bank Group|The World Bank]] advocates for the restriction of democratic participation and limitations imposed in the economic realm by creating a hierarchical system of representation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thirdly is creating “locking in” mechanisms which incorporate; laws, rules, regulations, procedures and institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This mechanism puts limitations on legislative and policy autonomy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Agreements are formulated to “lock in” [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] content through legal guarantees and sanctions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These agreements are difficult, even impossible to change which makes economic policies autonomous.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lastly this process diminished the need for formal accountability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  New constitutionalism has created a flexible system giving privileges to [[Multinational corporation|international corporations]] and private entities creating a “double” legal standard.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This concept diminished the “watchdog” and gives the flexibility for self-regulation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   This instrument is based on the international gold standard of the [[19th century|nineteenth century]] which gave rights to investor to avoid certain jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Permitting deregulation of financial services and trade investment avoids popular pressures and limits the need for transparency.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Minimizing liability and ensuring private authority the economic sector becomes more efficient, functional and practical.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Cutler, C. (2011). The Privatization of Authority in the Global Political Economy''.'' Edited by McBride, S., &amp; Teeple, G. ''In'' ''Relations of global power: Neoliberal order and disorder''. (p.41-59). Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4426-0365-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutions ==
At the global and regional level institutions are implementing the new constitutionalism framework to advance [[global governance]] by upholding the rights of private corporations and promoting a free [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  These institutions policies will ensure [[economic growth]] at the global level.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sinclair, S. (2014). Trade agreements, the new constitutionalism and public services. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 179-195. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global ===
The [[World Trade Organization]] [[World Trade Organization|(WTO)]] is a prominent figure in governing the [[World economy|global economy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Formally it was the responsibility of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade]] built on [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] principles but lacked the greater power adapted through new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]] represents a governing global entity which has adapted to the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] main purpose is to limit national interference in the global market and challenge any nation-state regulations that could be detrimental to the economy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Any economic alternatives that are proposed by nations can be discredited by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] as well as restricting governments ability to implement policy in international jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] represents the freedom of markets and allowing investors to capitalize in a [[world economy]], by doing so provides protection to the private sector.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Stephen McBride describes the [[World Trade Organization]] as having “quasi-judicial and quasi-constitutional aura.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The judicial and constitutional supremacy highlights the difficulty in challenging the organizations because of lock in mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Regional ===
The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] ([[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]) is a considered a regional governing entity that encompasses the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Regan]] referred to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] as a “new economic constitution.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Constitution because the agreement provided restrictions on government intrusion, rights to certain actors and enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The binding agreement afforded rights to both foreign and domestic investor to protect the interests of private capital and corporations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  By limiting government powers the agreement locked in private interests and reduced governments ability to expand or restore [[public service]]s in [[free trade]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Focus at the global level has resulted in hostility between the public and private realms within [[nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This hostility creates a political struggle between the private sector who safeguard the rights of capital and the public who want to control [[capitalism]] politically, democracy and socially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The control is being denationalized and delocalized causing negative repercussions at state level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  New constitutionalism lacks political will and can have detrimental effects to global dignity and future generations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Dividing economic policies from domestic creates disturbances within the civil society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Human rights]], [[Environmental issue|environmental concerns]] and [[public service]]s are being devalued because of the lack of economic concern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

New constitutionalism favours the [[Elitism|elitists]] providing preferential treatment and widening the [[Economic inequality|social gap]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[International financial institutions]], [[investor]]s and bond-raters are holding higher positions of authority than governments or nation-states furthering global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There is an urgent need for surveillance, policy making power, regulations and transparency economic outcomes are not solely focused on monetary gain but [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] concerns as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The absence of accountability and democratic authority has led many countries to depart from the constitutional framework and reclaim their [[sovereignty]] as independent nations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Australia]] has begun to constrain the advancements of new constitutionalism while many [[South America]] states have begun to exit the global regime completely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] have begun to form provisions to improve the democratic power within the global order and no longer allow for their governments to be immobilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Olympic Broadcasting Services''' ('''OBS''') is a company which was established by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 2001 in order to serve as the Host Broadcaster organisation for all [[Olympic Games]], Olympic Winter Games and Youth Olympic Games, maintaining the standards of Olympic broadcasting between one edition and the next one.&lt;ref name=broadcasters&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.olympic.org/broadcasters |title=Broadcasters |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=International Olympic Committee |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Host Broadcaster, OBS is responsible for delivering the pictures and sounds of the Olympic Games to billions of viewers around the world. It produces and transmits unbiased live radio and television coverage of every sport from every venue. This feed is called the International Signal or the World Feed and is distributed as a service to all broadcast organisations who have purchased the television and radio rights to the Games (known as Rights Holding Broadcasters or RHBs).

In collaboration with the Local Organising Committee, OBS supervises the development of the necessary infrastructures (including the International Broadcast Centre or IBC which serves as the primary base of the broadcast operation for OBS and the RHBs during the Games) and facilities at the different Olympic venues to ensure the successful broadcast production of the Games. OBS also offers additional services, equipment and supplies to the RHBs to help them produce their unilateral production.

The [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing]] marked the first time OBS was involved as Host Broadcaster.&lt;ref name=obstv&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.obs.tv/fact_file.php?q=a2 |title=Fact File |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Olympic Broadcasting Services |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the host broadcaster role was delegated to the local organising committees or to third-party broadcasters, having to rebuild the broadcast operation in each edition.&lt;ref name=broadcasters /&gt;

Its headquarters are in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=obstv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/obs-madrid---olympic-host-broadcaster |title=OBS - OLYMPIC BROADCASTING SERVICES |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Linkedin |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beijing 2008===
{{main|Beijing Olympic Broadcasting}}
Its operations began with the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], where [[Beijing Olympic Broadcasting]], a joint venture between OBS and the [[Beijing Organizing Committee]], acted as the host broadcasting consortium and the state television network, [[China Central Television]] which is one of the host nation broadcasters of the games.

===Vancouver 2010===
For the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], a wholly owned division, Olympic Broadcasting Services Vancouver was set up. The 2010 Olympics marked the first Games where the host broadcasting facilities were provided solely by OBS.

===London 2012===
The 2012 Olympic Games were broadcast by OBS. More than 5,600+ hours of live sports, ceremonies and Olympic News Channel content were distributed to the Rights Holding Broadcasters. OBS employed 1,000+ HD cameras, including 40 High Super Slow Motion cameras and other innovative specialty equipment such as 3D cameras, Super High Vision cameras and the world’s longest cablecam which stretched 2,340m at the Rowing venue from start to finish.

===Sochi 2014===
The Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games represented the largest broadcast operation in history for a Winter Games. OBS deployed more than 450 cameras, including 12 cablecam systems, 31 High Speed Slow Motion (HSSM) cameras and a multicopter/drone used for the first time, to ultimately produce 1300+ hours of television.

In total, 464 television channels broadcast the Sochi Games, almost double the number from Vancouver, and more digital platforms offered coverage than at any previous Winter Games with 155 websites and 75 apps showing events live from Russia.

Thanks to the increased number of channels and digital platforms for Sochi 2014, there were more hours broadcast globally than any previous Winter Games with more than 100,000 hours broadcast around the world, compared with 57,000 for Vancouver 2010.

For the first time in Olympic history, the amount of digital coverage exceeded traditional television broadcasts with 60,000 hours available on digital platforms, compared with 42,000 hours on television. These were the first predominantly digital Olympic Games and OBS helped fuel the significant increase in digital coverage by launching, for the first time in Sochi, the Olympic Video Player (OVP). Available in 95 countries, the OVP provided a fully integrated data, a news channel, live streams and on-demand video.

===Rio 2016===
Rio 2016 represented the most television coverage of any previous Olympic Games, with nearly 350,000 total hours broadcast globally, far exceeding the 200,000 hours that were broadcast for the London 2012 Games. Additionally, coverage was aired across more platforms than ever before, as more than 500 television channels and 250 digital outlets conveyed the Olympic Games around the world.

The number of hours of coverage available on digital platforms nearly doubled that of traditional television, representing more than two and a half times of what was achieved for London 2012 (218,000 hours versus 81,500 hours), marking a milestone in the history of Olympic broadcasting.

Representing the largest host broadcast operation to date, Rio involved more than 7,200 OBS personnel. Further, having developed a production plan to cover all 28 Olympic sports, including new additions Golf and Rugby Sevens, OBS drew on more than 1,000 cameras for the coverage of the Rio Games.

Rio also marked the first time Olympic content was available in Virtual Reality (VR). Overall, OBS produced more than 85 hours of live VR coverage, captured by custom-developed 360-degree camera systems, to a total of 14 RHB organisations, representing 31 territories.

OBS and Japanese Rights Holder NHK continued their collaboration on 4K/8K Super Hi-Vision (SHV) technology and produced approximately 100 hours of live coverage for Rio, featuring 22.2-channel surround sound.

'''Postnationalism''' or '''non-nationalism'''{{Sfn|Bennett|1998|p=232}} is the process or trend by which [[nation states]] and national identities lose their importance relative to cross nation and self organized or supranational and global entities. Although postnationalism is not strictly considered the antonym of [[nationalism]], the two terms and their associated assumptions are antithetic as postnationalism is an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]ic process.

There are several factors that contribute to aspects of postnationalism, including economic, political, and cultural elements.

Increasing [[globalization]] of ''economic'' factors, such as the expansion of [[international trade]] with [[raw materials]], manufactured goods, and services, and the importance of multinational corporations and internationalization of financial markets, have shifted emphasis from national economies to global ones. At the same time, [[socio-political power]] is partially transferred from national authorities to supernational entities, such as [[multinational corporation]]s, the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and [[NATO]]. In addition, [[Broadcast media|media]] and [[entertainment]] industries are becoming increasingly global and facilitate the formation of trends and opinions on a supranational scale. [[human migration|Migration]] of individuals or groups between countries contributes to the formation of postnational identities and beliefs, even though attachment to citizenship and [[national identities]] often remains important.&lt;ref&gt;R. Koopmans and P. Statham; "Challenging the liberal nation-state? Postnationalism, multiculturalism, and the collective claims making of migrants and ethnic minorities in Britain and Germany"; ''American Journal of Sociology'' 105:652–96 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Hackenberg and R.R. Alvarez; "Close-ups of postnationalism: Reports from the US-Mexico borderlands"; ''Human Organization'' 60:97–104 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Bloemraad; "Who claims dual citizenship? The limits of postnationalism, the possibilities of transnationalism, and the persistence of traditional citizenship"; ''International Migration Review'' 38:389–426 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postnationalism and human rights ==
In the scholarly literature, postnationalism is linked to the expansion of international [[human rights]] law and [[peremptory norm|norm]]s.  International human rights norms are reflected in a growing stress on the rights of individuals in terms of their "personhood," not just their citizenship. International human rights law does not recognize the right of entry to any state by [[non-citizens]], but demands that individuals should be judged increasingly on [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] criteria not particularistic criteria (such as blood descent in ethnicity, or favoring a particular sex). This has impacted citizenship and immigration law, especially in [[western world|western]] countries. Germany, for example, has felt pressure to, and has diluted (if not eradicated), [[Jus sanguinis|citizenship based on ethnic descent]], which had caused German-born [[Turkish people|Turks]], for example, to be excluded from German citizenship. Scholars identified with this argument include [[Yasemin Soysal]], [[David Jacobson (scholar)|David Jacobson]], and [[Saskia Sassen]].&lt;ref&gt;Yasemin Soysal, "Limits of Citizenship:Migrants and Postnational Membership in Europe," University of Chicago Press, 1994; and David Jacobson, "Rights Across Borders: Immigration and the Decline of Citizenship", Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the European Union ==
The European integration has created a system of supranational entities and is often discussed in relationship to the concept of postnationalism.&lt;ref&gt;M. Rambour; {{cite web |url=http://erg.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/national_identity/Rambour_Paper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306143842/http://erg.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/national_identity/Rambour_Paper.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }} (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Shaw; "Postnational constitutionalism in the European Union"; ''Journal of European Policy'' 6:579–97 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Wilkinson; {{cite web |url=http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=192 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502120037/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=192 |archivedate=2008-05-02 |df= }} (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Canada ==
In 2015, Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] while defining [[Canadian values]] declared his country to be the world’s first postnational state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Tom Nuttall|title=Politicians must keep better control of migration, and tell the truth|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21699310-politicians-must-keep-better-control-migration-and-tell-truth-welcome-up?fsrc=rss%7Cspr|accessdate=28 May 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Guy Lawson|title=Trudeau’s Canada, Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/magazine/trudeaus-canada-again.html?_r=1|accessdate=11 February 2016|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
Catherine Frost, professor of [[political science]] at [[McMaster University]], argues that while the Internet and online social relations forge social and political bonds across national borders, they do not have "the commitment or cohesiveness needed to underpin a demanding new mode of social and political relations".&lt;ref&gt;C. Frost; "Internet galaxy meets postnational constellation: Prospects for political solidarity after the Internet"; ''Information Society'' 22:45–49 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In sports ==
Postnational trends have been evident in professional sports. Simon Kuper called the 2008 European soccer championship ([[UEFA Euro 2008]]) "the first postnational" European Championship.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Kuper; "Steeds Liever"; ''Vrij Nederland'' p. 24, June 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that during the tournament both for players and fans [[sportsmanship]] and enjoyment of the event were more important than national rivalries or even winning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">The '''Schøyen Collection''' is the largest private [[manuscript]] collection in the world, mostly located in [[Oslo]] and London. Formed in the 20th century by [[Martin Schøyen]], it comprises manuscripts of global [[provenance]], spanning 5,000 years of history. It contains more than 13,000 manuscript items; the oldest is about 5,300 years old. There are manuscripts from 134 different countries and territories, representing 120 distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoyencollection.com/aboutus.html ''The Schøyen Collection'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of manuscripts—geographic, linguistic, textual and material—even more than its size makes the Schøyen Collection unique. The collection has a website with many items illustrated and described. The provenance of the various cuneiform materials held by the Schøyen Collection remains subject to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-04-21.html|title=Review of: The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition and Cuneiform Texts, 2 vols|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|date=1 May 2017|publisher=|journal=BMCR|via=Bryn Mawr Classical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stand Up To Cancer''' ('''SU2C''') is a charitable program of the [[Entertainment Industry Foundation]] (EIF). SU2C aims to raise significant funds for translational cancer research through online and televised efforts. Central to the program is a telethon that was first televised by four major broadcast networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]], [[FOX]]) in over 170 countries on September 5, 2008. SU2C raised over $100 million after that evening's broadcast.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Keveney |first=Bill |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-09-05-cancer-telethon_N.htm |title=Stars 'Stand Up to Cancer,' raise $100M - USATODAY.com |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds collected by Stand Up To Cancer are then distributed by the [[American Association for Cancer Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gorman, [[Registered nurse|R.N.]]|first1=Ali|title=Telethon helping locals stand up to cancer|url=http://6abc.com/health/telethon-helping-locals-stand-up-to-cancer-/1505279/|accessdate=10 September 2016|agency=[[WPVI-TV]]|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Stand Up To Cancer was conceived of in autumn 2007, by a group of women who had been affected by cancer and believe that by merging the recourse of the media and entertainment industries into a single operation they would be able to fight against this disease in a more profound way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standup2cancer.org/faq |title=Stand Up To Cancer — FAQ |publisher=Standup2cancer.org |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stand Up To Cancer was formally launched on May 27, 2008. Current members of the SU2C Council of Founders and Advisors (CFA) include [[Katie Couric]], [[Sherry Lansing]], Kathleen Lobb, Lisa Paulsen, Rusty Robertson, Sue Schwartz, Pamela Oas Williams, and Ellen Ziffren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standup2cancer.org/su2c_leadership |title=Stand Up To Cancer — SU2C Leadership |publisher=Standup2cancer.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; All current members of the CFA were co-producers of the 2012 televised special. The late co-founder [[Laura Ziskin]] executive produced both the September 5, 2008 and September 10, 2010 broadcasts. Sung Poblete, Ph.D., R.N., has served as SU2C’s president and CEO since 2011. In the United Kingdom, [[Channel 4]], along with [[Cancer Research UK]], launched its own version of ''[[Stand Up to Cancer UK|Stand Up To Cancer]]'' in October 2012, which has continued every year since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://su2c.channel4.com/|title=Stand Up To Cancer|work=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initiative ==
Stand Up To Cancer aims to raise awareness and bring about an understanding that everyone is connected by cancer. The statistic used most often by SU2C is from the [[American Cancer Society]]: one out of every two men and one out of every three women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime,&lt;ref name=acscf&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/STT/content/STT_1x_Cancer_Facts_and_Figures_2008.asp?from=fast ACS Cancer Facts and Figures 2008]. Retrieved on 27 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning everyone is affected in some way, or will be.

The campaign has featured televised moments during [[World Series]] baseball games where fans literally "stand up to cancer" by rising and holding signs inscribed with the names of friends and loved ones who have struggled with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB stands up to cancer during Game 4 of Series|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/63396062/|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Research teams funded==
SU2C has donated hundreds of millions of dollars since the first "Dream Team" was organized in 2009. The "Dream Teams" funded by SU2C brings researchers together from institutions and universities across the world and have been among the most productive collaborations in getting new drugs to market and many teams are funded jointly with other cancer research organizations. The research is required to be [[translational]] and include laboratory and clinical members and cannot involve more than one principal investigator from each institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standup2cancer.org/the_su2c_research_model&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacr.org/FUNDING/PAGES/SUTC-LISTING.ASPX#.WFAhS6IrK-o&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these dream teams are co-sponsored by other cancer-related foundations.

The phrase "'''Think globally, act locally'''" or "'''Think global, act local'''" has been used in various contexts, including planning, environment, education, mathematics, and business.

==Definition==
'''"Think globally, act locally"''' urges people to consider the health of the entire planet and to take action in their own communities and cities. Long before governments began enforcing environmental laws, individuals were coming together to protect habitats and the organisms that live within them. These efforts are referred to as grassroots efforts. They occur on a local level and are primarily run by volunteers and helpers.

"Think Globally, Act Locally" originally began at the grassroots level, however, it is now a global concept with high importance. It is not just volunteers who take the environment into consideration. It is corporations, government officials, education system, and local communities.

Warren Heaps states, "It's really important to recognize that markets are different around the world, and company compensation programs should reflect a balance between global corporate philosophy and local practice and culture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalhrforum.com/2010/02/28/%E2%80%9Cthink-globally-act-locally%E2%80%9D-for-compensation-design "Think Globally, Act Locally for Compensation Design". Warren Heaps. 28 February 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin in town planning==
The original phrase "Think global, act local" has been attributed to Scots town planner and social activist [[Patrick Geddes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Although the exact phrase does not appear in Geddes' 1915 book "Cities in Evolution,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Geddes|first=Patrick|title=Cities in Evolution|publisher=Williams|location=London|year=1915|url=https://archive.org/details/citiesinevolutio00gedduoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea (as applied to city planning) is clearly evident: " 'Local character' is thus no mere accidental old-world quaintness, as its mimics think and say. It is attained only in course of adequate grasp and treatment of the whole environment, and in active sympathy with the essential and characteristic life of the place concerned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Geddes|first=Patrick|title=Cities in Evolution|publisher=Williams|location=London|year=1915|url=https://archive.org/details/citiesinevolutio00gedduoft|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;— [[Patrick Geddes]], was a Scottish biologist, sociologist, philanthropist and pioneering town planner.  He was also responsible for introducing the concept of "region" to architecture and planning. He has made significant contributions to the consideration of the environment. Geddes believed in working with the environment, versus working against it.&lt;ref&gt;The worlds of Patrick Geddes: Biologist, town planner, re-educator, peace-warrior. Boardman, Philip. 1978. {{ISBN|0710085486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Town planning is important to understanding of the idea "think globally, act locally". Urban management and development highly impacts the surrounding environment. The ways in which this is initiated is vital to the health of the environment. Corporations need to be aware of global communities when expanding their companies to new locations.Not only do corporations need to be aware of global differences, but also Urban and rural areas who plan on expanding or changing the dynamics of their community. As stated "Addressing the complex urban environmental problems, in order to improve urban livability through Urban Environmental Strategies (UES), involves taking stock of the existing urban environmental problems, their comparative analysis and prioritization, setting out objectives and targets, and identification of various measures to meet these objectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTUWM/0,,contentMDK:20184472~menuPK:404557~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:341511,00.html|title=Urban Environment and Climate Change - Strategic Urban Environmental Planning|work=worldbank.org|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the phrase==

The first use of the phrase in an environmental context is disputed. Some say it was coined by [[David Brower]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1373616/David-Brower.html David Brower] (obituary), [[The Daily Telegraph]], 8 November 2000; [[Joachim Radkau]]/Lothar Hahn, ''Aufstieg und Fall der deutschen Atomwirtschaft'', München, 2013, p. 300. &lt;/ref&gt; founder of [[Friends of the Earth]], as a slogan for FOE&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed: Obituary of David Ross Brower, [[The Guardian]], 8 November 2000. [http://oldsite.jmt.org:808/jmt/news/2000/brower.html Online copy]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} at the [[John Muir Trust]]&lt;/ref&gt; when it was founded in 1969,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} although others attribute it to [[René Dubos]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;Willy Gianinazzi, « Penser global, agir local. Histoire d'une idée », ''EcoRev'. Revue critique d'écologie politique'', N. 46, Summer 2018, p. 24, who quotes: Rene Dubos, « The despairing optimist », ''The American Scholar'', Spring 1977, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;. Canadian "futurist" Frank Feather also chaired a conference called "Thinking Globally, Acting Locally" in 1979 and has claimed the paternity of the expression.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, Ralph. ''The Quote Verifier''. Simon &amp; Schuster. New York, NY 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-312-34004-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible originators include French [[theologian]] [[Jacques Ellul]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ellul, ''Penser globalement, agir localement'', Pyremonde, Paris, 2006, quoting the review he did in 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The term was increasingly applied to initiatives in international education and was advanced by Stuart Grauer in his 1989 University of San Diego publication,  Think Globally, Act Locally: A Delphi Study of Educational Leadership Through the Development of International Resources in the Local Community.  In this publication it was attributed to [[Harlan Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;Grauer, Stuart. Think Globally, Act Locally: A Delphi Study of Educational Leadership Through the Development of International Resources in the Local Community. University of San Diego, San Diego 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is said that this term was used by German-American [[sociologist]] [[Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} in the 1950s or earlier, prior to the formation of the [[United Nations Organization]].

It is not only corporations that are acknowledging the importance of environmental issues, but also the education system. Government officials and school boards across the world are beginning to develop a new way of teaching. Globalization is now thought of as an important concept to understanding the world. Certain schools believe it is important to discuss global issues as young as 5 years old. It is students who are our future, therefore understanding the concept of "think globally, act locally" is fundamental to our future.&lt;ref&gt;"THINK GLOBALLY, ACT LOCALLY: PROMOTING PRESCHOOL LEARNING ABOUT OTHER CULTURES." Monica Divitini, Magnus R. Jenssen, Kristin R. Skau.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
The term is also used in business strategy, where multinational corporations are encouraged to build local roots.
This is sometimes expressed by converging the words "global" and "local" into the single word "[[glocal]]," a term used by several companies (notably [[Sony]] Corporation and other major Japanese multinationals) in their advertising and branding strategies in the 1980s and 1990s.

Currently more and more corporations are finding it extremely important to analyze the environmental damage of their company. The pressure they receive from government officials and local communities regarding environmental issues is vital to their company's image. [[Glocalization]] is an emerging concept throughout the business world. It was first developed by the Japanese, however, it has now emerged throughout Western society. [[Glocalization]] refers to the practice of conducting business according to both local and global considerations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yfsentrepreneur.com/2011/10/11/5-steps-to-reverse-engineer-your-business-strategy-in-24-hours-and-go-glocal|title=Is Your Business Glocal? How to Think Globally and Act Locally|work=YFS Magazine - Startups, Small Business News and Entrepreneurial Culture|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
The phrase is an in-joke among [[mathematician]]s, as it is often used in situations where the global [[Mathematical structure|structure]] of an object (e.g., a [[manifold]], a [[Diophantine equation]], or a [[group (mathematics)|group]]) can be inferred from the [[Local property|local]] structure. (See [[Hasse principle]] for a detailed description of one such example.)

==Big picture==

===Late 1700s–1930s (pre-WWII era)===

During this pre-WWII era, there are three big trends that operate separately, but sometimes affect each other in development and outcomes.

First, a trend of urbanization (fueled by the [[Industrial Revolution]]) as well as greater global trade and migration leads to new challenges, including those in urban sanitation and infectious diseases/pandemics. Six global [[cholera]] pandemics happen in this period because of increased commerce and migration.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

Second, there is a lot of development on the underlying theory of disease, advancements in vaccine and antibiotic development, and a variety of experimental large-scale eradication and control programs. One big example: the [[germ theory of diseases]] begins to become accepted and popularized starting around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/germtheory.html |title=Germ Theory |publisher=Harvard |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another big example is the development of the smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner in 1796.&lt;ref name=Baxby1999/&gt; Systematic eradication and control efforts include the [[Rockefeller Sanitary Commission]] and efforts to eradicate smallpox.&lt;ref name="cugh.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150918175742/http://cugh.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/modules/To%20Post%20Both%20Faculty%20and%20Trainees/29_Global_Health_In_Historical_Perspective_The_Uses_Of_History_FINAL.pptx.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Antitoxins and vaccines for numerous diseases including [[cholera]] and [[tuberculosis]] are developed during this period, building on a trend of greater understanding of and control over [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="vaccine_timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/timeline |title=Timeline – History of Vaccines |publisher=The College of Physicians of Philadelphia |accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theme during this era is the formation of various preliminary international alliances and conferences, including the [[International Sanitary Conferences]], [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]], and the [[League of Nations]] Health Committee. This is closely intertwined with the other two trends. For instance, the cholera pandemics mentioned above, as well as the growing scientific understanding of the germ theory of disease, are both key impetuses for the International Sanitary Conferences.&lt;ref name="markel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |title=Worldly approaches to global health: 1851 to the present |first=Howard |last=Markel |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418174941/http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}}

===1940s–early 1960s (post-WWII era)===
Following the end of [[World War II]], the first batch of big organizations, both international and national (with international cooperation), including the [[United Nations]] and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), form.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt; Beginning with the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] for relief of victims of war in 1943, there is a big push to begin creating large scale health initiatives, non-governmental organizations, and worldwide global health programs by the United Nations to improve quality of life around the world. [[UNICEF]], the World Health Organization, as well as the UNRRA are all part of United Nations efforts to benefit global health beginning with developing countries. These various programs aim to aid in economic endeavors by providing loans, direct disease prevention programs, health education, etc.

===Late 1960s–1970s===

After wrapping up complications caused by the end of the war, there is an international energy put in into eradication, beginning with the complete smallpox eradication in 1979. There is greater dissatisfaction with WHO for its focus on disease/infection control at the expense of trying to improve general living conditions, as well as disappointment at its low budget and staffing. This atmosphere spurs other organizations to provide their own forms of aid.&lt;ref name="palilonis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioethics.wfu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Topic-3-A-Brief-History-of-Global-Health.pdf |title=An Introduction to Global Health and Global Health Ethics: A Brief History of Global Health |author= M. A. Palilonis |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|126}} The [[Alma Ata Declaration]] and selective [[primary healthcare]] are created to express urgent action by all governments and citizens to protect and promote the health of all people equally.&lt;ref name="Alma Ata Declaration"&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/publications/almaata_declaration_en.pdf Declaration from the website of the World Health Organization].&lt;/ref&gt; More organizations form following these new active attitudes toward global health, including the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] and the [[Doctors Without Borders]] organization. Publications like the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]] highlight basic medicines required by most adults and children to survive, and set priorities for healthcare fund allocation in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/|title=WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, there is more buy-in for the idea that direct, targeted efforts to address healthcare could be worthwhile and benefit many countries.

===1980s–2000===

Certain specific efforts increase in efficiency and productivity, including improvement in maternal and child health and a focus on [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]] (the 'Big Three') in developing countries. During this time period, the [[child survival revolution]] (CSR), which helps reduce child mortality in the developing world, and [[GOBI-FFF]] are both advocated by [[James P. Grant]].&lt;ref name="David Bornstein 2007 pp. 250"&gt;David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Summit for Children]] also takes place, becoming one of the largest ever gathering of heads of states and government to commit a set of goals to improve the well-being of children. Finally, HIV/AIDS becomes the focus of many governmental and non-governmental organizations, leading to the formation of the Global Programme on AIDS (GPA) by efforts of the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|6}} However, these health organizations also make significant advancements to tuberculosis treatments, including the [[DOTS]] strategy and the formation of the [[Stop TB Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoptb.org/|title=Stop TB Partnership - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and beyond===

UN's [[Millennium Development Goals]] establishes health care as an important goal (not just combating infectious diseases).&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Later in 2015, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] build on the MDGs to outline the objectives that will transform our world by ending poverty, helping the environment, and improving health and education. More specific disease-targeting organizations are created primarily to fund healthcare plans in developing countries, including the  [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] and [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/|title=Home - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations (especially the WHO) adopt new strategies and initiatives, including the [[3 by 5 Initiative]] to widen the access to [[antiretroviral treatment]], the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/|title=World Health Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private large donors such as the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] begin to play an important role in shaping the funding landscape and direction of efforts in global health.

==Full timeline==

=== Inclusion criteria ===

The following events are selected for inclusion in the timeline:

* Major medical advances, such as the first vaccines or antibiotics for important diseases.
* Major disease outbreaks, particularly those that played a key role in identifying key medical facts about the nature of disease or epidemiology.
* Key programs, innovations, and strategies in delivery of treatments and healthcare supply chains.
* Government policies or healthcare systems that are the first of their kind in the world, or have global significance for some other reason.
* The forming of trans-national organizations and private foundations that either directly deal with global health, or fund and manage other organizations that do. Note that we also include some emergency medical relief organizations, because they have played an important role in identifying and combating disease outbreaks in the aftermath of natural or man-made disaster.
* Important conferences related to global health. For conferences held regularly, we only include an event for the first time the conference was held, or if there was a particularly influential conference.

We do ''not'' include:

* Incremental advances in medical science except the most important ones.
* Rollouts of policies by different governments, or changes to local healthcare structures, except those that are pioneering. To understand healthcare at the country level, you can see the timelines of healthcare by country.
* Incremental changes to existing trans-national organizations or private foundations in their global health programs, except those that have significance as pioneering new approaches to global health.

In addition, the German government was well aware of the PRISM surveillance program long before Edward Snowden made details public.

The Obama Administration secretly won permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2011 to reverse restrictions on the National Security Agency’s use of intercepted phone calls and e-mails, permitting the agency to search deliberately for Americans’ communications in its massive databases. The searches take place under a surveillance program Congress authorized in 2008 under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under that law, the target must be a foreigner “reasonably believed” to be outside the United States, and the court must approve the targeting procedures in an order good for one year. But a warrant for each target would thus no longer be required. That means that communications with Americans could be picked up without a court first determining that there is probable cause that the people they were talking to were terrorists, spies or “foreign powers.” The FISC extended the length of time that the NSA is allowed to retain intercepted U.S. communications from five years to six years with an extension possible for foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Both measures were done without public debate or any specific authority from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakashima|first=Ellen|title=Obama administration had restrictions on NSA reversed in 2011|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-administration-had-restrictions-on-nsa-reversed-in-2011/2013/09/07/c26ef658-0fe5-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_print.html|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2013, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' jointly reported that the NSA and the GCHQ have made repeated attempts to spy on anonymous Internet users who have been communicating in secret via the anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]. Several of these surveillance operations involve the implantation of malicious code into the computers of Tor users who visit particular websites. The NSA and GCHQ have partly succeeded in blocking access to the anonymous network, diverting Tor users to insecure channels. The government agencies were also able to uncover the identity of some anonymous Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secret NSA documents show campaign against Tor encrypted network|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secret-nsa-documents-show-campaign-against-tor-encrypted-network/2013/10/04/610f08b6-2d05-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013|author1=Barton Gellman, Craig Timberg  |author2=Steven Rich |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA slideshow on 'The TOR problem'|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-slideshow-on-the-tor-problem/499/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013|author1=Steven Rich  |author2=Matt DeLong |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Timothy B.|title=Everything you need to know about the NSA and Tor in one FAQ|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-nsa-and-tor-in-one-faq/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA report on the Tor encrypted network|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-research-report-on-the-tor-encryption-program/501/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GCHQ report on 'MULLENIZE' program to 'stain' anonymous electronic traffic|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/gchq-report-on-mullenize-program-to-stain-anonymous-electronic-traffic/502/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA and GCHQ target Tor network that protects anonymity of web users|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013|author1=James Ball, Bruce Schneier  |author2=Glenn Greenwald |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|title=Attacking Tor: how the NSA targets users' online anonymity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Tor Stinks' presentation – read the full document|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-stinks-nsa-presentation-document|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tor: 'The king of high-secure, low-latency anonymity'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-high-secure-internet-anonymity|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly sensitive signals intelligence collection program known as '''[[Stateroom (surveillance program)|Stateroom]]''' involves the interception of radio, telecommunications and internet traffic. It is operated out of the diplomatic missions of the [[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]] (Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, United States) in numerous locations around the world. The program conducted at U.S. diplomatic missions is run in concert by the U.S. intelligence agencies NSA and CIA in a joint venture group called "'''[[Special Collection Service]]'''" (SCS), whose members work undercover in shielded areas of the American Embassies and Consulates, where they are officially accredited as diplomats and as such enjoy special privileges. Under diplomatic protection, they are able to look and listen unhindered. The SCS for example used the American Embassy near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to monitor communications in Germany's government district with its parliament and the seat of the government.&lt;ref name="Spiegel20131027"&gt;{{cite news|title=Der Spiegel Cover Story: How NSA Spied on Merkel Cell Phone from Berlin Embassy - Embassy Espionage: The NSA's Secret Spy Hub in Berlin|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cover-story-how-nsa-spied-on-merkel-cell-phone-from-berlin-embassy-a-930205.html|accessdate=November 1, 2013|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=October 27, 2013|author=Jacob Appelbaum, Nikolaus Blome, Hubert Gude, Ralf Neukirch, René Pfister, Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, Jörg Schindler, Gregor Peter Schmitz and Holger Stark.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that the NSA carries out an eavesdropping effort, dubbed Operation Dreadnought, against the [[Iran]]ian leader [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]]. During his 2009 visit to [[Iranian Kurdistan]], the agency collaborated with the GCHQ and the U.S.'s [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], collecting radio transmissions between aircraft and airports, examining Khamenei's convoy with satellite imagery, and enumerating military radar stations. According to the story, an objective of the operation is "communications fingerprinting": the ability to distinguish Khamenei's communications from those of other people in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="omnivore"&gt;{{cite news

The same story revealed an operation code-named Ironavenger, in which the NSA intercepted e-mails sent between a country allied with the United States and the government of "an adversary". The ally was conducting a [[spear-phishing]] attack: its e-mails contained [[malware]]. The NSA gathered documents and [[login]] credentials belonging to the enemy country, along with knowledge of the ally's capabilities for [[Cyberwarfare|attacking computers]].&lt;ref name="omnivore"/&gt;

According to the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'', the British intelligence agency GCHQ maintains a listening post on the roof of the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Berlin|British Embassy in Berlin]] that is capable of intercepting mobile phone calls, wi-fi data and long-distance communications all over the German capital, including adjacent government buildings such as the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] (seat of the German parliament) and the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] (seat of Germany's head of government) clustered around the [[Brandenburg Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Duncan|title=Revealed: Britain's 'secret listening post in the heart of Berlin'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/revealed-britains-secret-listening-post-in-the-heart-of-berlin-8921548.html|accessdate=November 5, 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating under the code-name "Quantum Insert", the GCHQ set up a fake website masquerading as [[LinkedIn]], a social website used for [[professional network]]ing, as part of its efforts to install surveillance software on the computers of the telecommunications operator [[Belgacom]].&lt;ref name=gchqlinkin&gt;{{cite news|last=Tony Paterson|title=GCHQ used 'Quantum Insert' technique to set up fake LinkedIn pages and spy on mobile phone giants|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/gchq-used-quantum-insert-technique-to-set-up-fake-linkedin-pagesand-spy-on-mobile-phone-giants-8931528.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the headquarters of the oil cartel [[OPEC]] were infiltrated by the GCHQ as well as the NSA, which bugged the computers of nine OPEC employees and monitored the [[List of Secretaries General of OPEC|General Secretary of OPEC]].&lt;ref name=gchqlinkin/&gt;

For more than three years the GCHQ has been using an automated monitoring system code-named "Royal Concierge" to infiltrate the [[hotel reservation system|reservation systems]] of at least 350 upscale hotels in many different parts of the world in order to target, search and analyze reservations to detect diplomats and government officials.&lt;ref name="spirgelconcierge"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach  |author2=Holger Stark |lastauthoramp=yes |title='Royal Concierge': GCHQ Monitors Hotel Reservations to Track Diplomats|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/gchq-monitors-hotel-reservations-to-track-diplomats-a-933914.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=November 17, 2013|date=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; First tested in 2010, the aim of the "Royal Concierge" is to track down the travel plans of diplomats, and it is often supplemented with surveillance methods related to [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection)|human intelligence]] (HUMINT). Other covert operations include the wiretapping of room telephones and fax machines used in targeted hotels as well as the monitoring of computers hooked up to the hotel network.&lt;ref name="spirgelconcierge"/&gt;

In November 2013, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' revealed that the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] ('''DSD''') had attempted to listen to the private phone calls of the [[president of Indonesia]] and his wife. The Indonesian foreign minister, [[Marty Natalegawa]], confirmed that he and the president had contacted the ambassador in Canberra. Natalegawa said any tapping of Indonesian politicians’ personal phones “violates every single decent and legal instrument I can think of—national in Indonesia, national in Australia, international as well”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/indonesia-recalls-ambassador-yudhoyono-phone-tapping-australia Indonesia recalls Canberra ambassador over Yudhoyono phone tapping attempt, Foreign minister demands explanation after documents reveal Australian agencies targeted phones of president and his wife] The Guardian 18 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrying the title "[[3G]] impact and update", a classified presentation leaked by Snowden revealed the attempts of the ASD/DSD to keep up to pace with the rollout of 3G technology in Indonesia and across [[Southeast Asia]]. The ASD/DSD motto placed at the bottom of each page reads: "Reveal their secrets—protect our own."&lt;ref name=auind1/&gt;

Under a secret deal approved by British intelligence officials, the NSA has been storing and analyzing the internet and email records of UK citizens since 2007. The NSA also proposed in 2005 a procedure for spying on the citizens of the UK and other [[UKUSA Agreement|Five-Eyes nations alliance]], even where the partner government has explicitly denied the U.S. permission to do so. Under the proposal, partner countries must neither be informed about this particular type of surveillance, nor the procedure of doing so.&lt;ref name="ukusaball"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=James|title=US and UK struck secret deal to allow NSA to 'unmask' Britons' personal data|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The culture of compliance, which has allowed the American people to entrust NSA with extraordinary authorities, will not be compromised in the face of so many demands, even as we aggressively pursue legal authorities..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Strategy for Surveillance Powers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/11/23/us/politics/23nsa-sigint-strategy-document.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

U.S. District Judge Pauley also ruled that Congress legally set up the program and that it does not violate anyone’s constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. He further ruled that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment.

According to the New York Times the NSA is monitoring approximately 100.000 computers worldwide with spy software named Quantum. Quantum enables the NSA to conduct surveillance on those computers on the one hand and can also create a digital highway for launching cyberattacks on the other hand. Among the targets are the Chinese and Russian military, but also trade institutions within the European Union. The NYT also reported that the NSA can access and alter computers which are not connected with the internet by a secret technology in use by the NSA since 2008. The prerequisite is the physically insertion of the radio frequency hardware by a spy, a manufacturer or an unwitting user.  The technology relies on a covert channel of radio waves that can be transmitted from tiny circuit boards and USB cards inserted surreptitiously into the computers. In some cases, they are sent to a briefcase-size relay station that intelligence agencies can set up miles away from the target. The technology can also transmit malware back to the infected computer.&lt;ref name="NYT20140114" /&gt;

In a separate 20-page report dated 2012, the GCHQ cited the popular smarphone game "[[Angry Birds]]" as an example of how an application could be used to extract user data. Taken together, such forms of data collection would allow the agencies to collect vital information about a user's life, including his or her home country, current location (through [[geolocation]]), age, gender, [[ZIP code]], [[marital status]], [[income]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], education level, number of children, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=James|title=NSA and GCHQ target 'leaky' phone apps like Angry Birds to scoop user data|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/nsa-gchq-smartphone-app-angry-birds-personal-data|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=27 January 2014|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=JAMES GLANZ, JEFF LARSON  |author2=ANDREW W.

The [[Communications Security Establishment Canada]] (CSEC) has been tracking Canadian air passengers via free [[Wi-Fi]] services at a major Canadian airport. Passengers who exited the airport terminal continued to be tracked as they showed up at other [[Wi-Fi]] locations across Canada. In a CSEC document dated May 2012, the agency described how it had gained access to two communications systems with over 300,000 users in order to pinpoint a specific imaginary target. The operation was executed on behalf of the NSA as a trial run to test a new technology capable of tracking down "any target that makes occasional forays into other cities/regions." This technology was subsequently shared with Canada's [[Five Eyes]] partners - Australia, New Zealand, Britain, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Greg Weston |author2=Glenn Greenwald |author3=Ryan Gallagher |title=CSEC used airport Wi-Fi to track Canadian travellers: Edward Snowden documents |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csec-used-airport-wi-fi-to-track-canadian-travellers-edward-snowden-documents-1.2517881|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=31 January 2014|date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden leaks: Canada 'spied on airport travellers'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25977620|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=31 January 2014|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Memmott|first=Mark|title=Canada Used Airport Wi-Fi To Track Travelers, Snowden Leak Alleges |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/01/31/269418375/airport-wi-fi-used-to-track-travelers-snowden-leak-alleges|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=31 January 2014|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and TV network [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] the mobile phone of former German chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] was monitored from 2002 onwards, reportedly because of his government's opposition to [[Iraq War|military intervention in Iraq]]. The source of the latest information is a document leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The document, containing information about the '''National Sigint Requirement List''' (NSRL), had previously been interpreted as referring only to [[Angela Merkel]]'s mobile. However ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' and NDR claim to have confirmation from NSA insiders that the surveillance authorisation pertains not to the individual, but the political post – which in 2002 was still held by Schröder. According to research by the two media outlets, Schröder was placed as number 388 on the list, which contains the names of persons and institutions to be put under surveillance by the NSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA hatte auch Gerhard Schröder im Visier|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ausspaehung-des-bundeskanzlers-nsa-hatte-auch-gerhard-schroeder-im-visier-1.1880004|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=4 February 2014|author=Stefan Kornelius, Hans Leyendecker und Georg Mascolo|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ottermann|first=Philip|title=NSA tapped German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder's phone – report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/04/us-nsa-gerhard-schroeder-surveillance|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 February 2014|location=[[Berlin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: NSA spied on Merkel's predecessor too |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |work=Associated Press (AP) |publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |accessdate=5 February 2014 |date=4 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205020031/http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |archivedate=February 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smale|first=Alison|title=German Paper Says U.S. Kept Tabs on Leader|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/world/europe/german-paper-says-us-kept-tabs-on-leader.html?src=recg|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== March 2014 ==
The NSA has built an infrastructure which enables it to covertly hack into computers on a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human oversight in the process. The NSA relies on an automated system codenamed [[TURBINE (US government project)|TURBINE]] which in essence enables the automated management and control of a large network of implants (a form of remotely transmitted malware on selected individual computer devices or in bulk on tens of thousands of devices). As quoted by ''The Intercept'', TURBINE is designed to "allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individually."&lt;ref name="TC20140312"&gt;{{cite news|title=How the NSA Plans to Infect 'Millions' of Computers with Malware|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014|author=Ryan Gallagher and Greenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA has shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance – the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

Among other things due to TURBINE and its control over the implants the NSA is capable of:

* breaking into targeted computers and to siphoning out data from foreign Internet and phone networks
* infecting a target's computer and exfiltrating files from a hard drive
* covertly recording audio from a computer’s microphone and taking snapshots with its webcam
* launching cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites
* exfiltrating data from removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer

The TURBINE implants are linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine surveillance "sensors" that the NSA has installed at locations across the world, including the agency's headquarters in Maryland and eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan and Menwith Hill, England. Codenamed as TURMOIL, the sensors operate as a sort of high-tech surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent across the Internet. When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems, the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL system can be used to send alerts or "tips" to TURBINE, enabling the initiation of a malware attack. To identify surveillance targets, the NSA uses a series of data "selectors" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors can include email addresses, IP addresses, or the unique "cookies" containing a username or other identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites such as Google, Facebook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Twitter, unique Google advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique encryption key fingerprints that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs that are sent across the Internet when a Windows computer crashes or updates.&lt;ref name="TC20140312" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Ryan|title=Compare the NSA’s Facebook Malware Denial to its Own Secret Documents|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/15/nsa-facebook-malware-turbine-non-denial-denial/ |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|title=NSA's automated hacking engine offers hands-free pwning of the world|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/nsas-automated-hacking-engine-offers-hands-free-pwning-of-the-world/|accessdate=March 23, 2014|publisher=Ars Technica|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Implants|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Industrial-Scale Exploitation|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/industrial-scale-exploitation/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA Technology Directorate Analysis of Converged Data|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-technology-directorate-analysis-converged-data/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=There Is More Than One Way to Quantum|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/one-way-quantum/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA Phishing Tactics and Man in the Middle Attacks|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-phishing-tactics-man-middle-attacks/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quantum Insert Diagrams|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/quantum-insert-diagrams/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TURBINE and TURMOIL|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/turbine-turmoil/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The NSA and GCHQ’s QUANTUMTHEORY Hacking Tactics|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-gchqs-quantumtheory-hacking-tactics/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Menwith Hill Station Leverages XKeyscore for Quantum Against Yahoo and Hotmail|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/menwith-hill-station-leverages-xkeyscore-quantum-yahoo-hotmail/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Eyes Hacking Large Routers|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/five-eyes-hacking-large-routers/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Selector Types|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/selector-types/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VPN and VOIP Exploitation With HAMMERCHANT and HAMMERSTEIN|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/vpn-voip-exploitation-hammerchant-hammerstein/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Implants|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/|accessdate=March 13, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of March 2014, [[Der Spiegel]] and ''The Intercept'' published, based on a series of classified files from the archive provided to reporters by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, articles related to espionage efforts by GCHQ and NSA in Germany.&lt;ref name="TI20140329" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL20140328"&gt;{{cite news|title='A' for Angela Merkel: GCHQ and NSA Targeted Private German Companies|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gchq-and-nsa-targeted-private-german-companies-a-961444.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=March 28, 2014|author1=Laura Poitras |author2=Marcel Rosenbach |author3=Holger Stark }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British GCHQ targeted three German internet firms for information about Internet traffic passing through internet exchange points, important customers of the German internet providers, their technology suppliers as well as future technical trends in their business sector and company employees.&lt;ref name="TI20140329" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL20140328" /&gt; The NSA was granted by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] the authority for blanket surveillance of Germany, its people and institutions, regardless whether those affected are suspected of having committed an offense or not, without an individualized court order specifying on March 7, 2013.&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL20140328" /&gt; In addition Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel was listed in a surveillance search machine and database named Nymrod along with 121 others foreign leaders.&lt;ref name="TI20140329" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL20140328" /&gt; As ''The Intercept'' wrote: "The NSA uses the Nymrod system to 'find information relating to targets that would otherwise be tough to track down,' according to internal NSA documents.

== April 2014 ==
Towards the end of April, Edward Snowden said that the United States surveillance agencies spy on Americans more than anyone else in the world, contrary to anything that has been said by the government up until this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Volz Dustin|first=Dustin|title=Edward Snowden: NSA Spies Most on Americans|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/edward-snowden-nsa-spies-most-on-americans-20140430|accessdate=May 5, 2014|newspaper=National Journal|date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published by Ars Technica shows NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) employees intercepting a Cisco router.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher |first=Sean |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/ |title=Photos of an NSA "upgrade" factory show Cisco router getting implant |publisher=Ars Technica |date=May 14, 2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Intercept'' and [[WikiLeaks]] revealed information about which countries were having their communications collected as part of the [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]] surveillance program. On May 19, ''The Intercept'' reported that the NSA is recording and archiving nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas with a system called SOMALGET, a subprogram of [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]]. The mass surveillance has been occurring without the Bahamian government's permission.&lt;ref name="data pirates"&gt;{{cite web| first1=Ryan |last1=Devereaux |first2=Glenn |last2=Greenwald |first3=Laura |last3=Poitras| url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/ |title=Data Pirates of the Caribbean: The NSA Is Recording Every Cell Phone Call in the Bahamas |work=[[The Intercept]] |publisher=[[First Look Media]] |date=May 19, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the Bahamas, ''The Intercept'' reported NSA interception of cell phone metadata in [[Kenya]], the [[Philippines]], [[Mexico]] and a fifth country it did not name due to "credible concerns that doing so could lead to increased violence." WikiLeaks released a statement on May 23 claiming that [[Afghanistan]] was the unnamed nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Zach |last=Schonfeld |title=The Intercept Wouldn’t Reveal a Country the U.S. Is Spying On, So WikiLeaks Did Instead |url=http://www.newsweek.com/intercept-wouldnt-reveal-country-us-spying-so-wikileaks-did-instead-252320 |work=Newsweek |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement responding to the revelations, the NSA said "the implication that NSA's foreign intelligence collection is arbitrary and unconstrained is false."&lt;ref name="data pirates" /&gt;

Through its global surveillance operations the NSA exploits the flood of images included in emails, text messages, social media, videoconferences and other communications to harvest millions of images. These images are then used by the NSA in sophisticated [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition programs]] to track suspected terrorists and other intelligence targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Risen|first1=James|last2=Poitras|first2=Laura|title=N.S.A.

Bluster that all is well is wearing pretty thin – our analogue laws need a digital overhaul."&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; Vodafone published its first Law Enforcement Disclosure Report on June 6, 2014.&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; Vodafone group privacy officer Stephen Deadman said "These pipes exist, the direct access model exists. We are making a call to end direct access as a means of government agencies obtaining people's communication data. Without an official warrant, there is no external visibility. If we receive a demand we can push back against the agency. The fact that a government has to issue a piece of paper is an important constraint on how powers are used."&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; Gus Hosein, director of [[Privacy International]] said "I never thought the telcos would be so complicit. It's a brave step by Vodafone and hopefully the other telcos will become more brave with disclosure, but what we need is for them to be braver about fighting back against the illegal requests and the laws themselves."&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt;

Above-[[Top Secret|top-secret]] documentation of a covert surveillance program named Overseas Processing Centre 1 (OPC-1) (codenamed "CIRCUIT") by [[GCHQ]] was published by ''[[The Register]]''. Based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, GCHQ taps into undersea fiber optic cables via secret spy bases near the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and Yemen. [[BT Group|BT]] and [[Vodafone]] are implicated.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Campbell, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/03/revealed_beyond_top_secret_british_intelligence_middleeast_internet_spy_base/ "Revealed: Beyond top secret British intelligence Middleeast Internet spy base"], ''[[The Register]]'', June 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish newspaper Dagbladet Information and ''The Intercept'' revealed on June 19, 2014, the NSA mass surveillance program codenamed [[RAMPART-A]]. Under RAMPART-A, 'third party' countries tap into fiber optic cables carrying the majority of the world's electronic communications and are secretly allowing the NSA to install surveillance equipment on these fiber-optic cables. The foreign partners of the NSA turn massive amounts of data like the content of phone calls, faxes, e-mails, internet chats, data from virtual private networks, and calls made using Voice over IP software like Skype over to the NSA. In return these partners receive access to the NSA's sophisticated surveillance equipment so that they too can spy on the mass of data that flows in and out of their territory. Among the partners participating in the NSA mass surveillance program are Denmark and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA 'third party' partners tap the Internet backbone in global surveillance program|accessdate=June 19, 2014|work=Dagbladet Information|date=June 19, 2014|url=http://www.information.dk/501280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jensen|first1=Kristian|title=Documentation: The Snowden files|url=http://www.information.dk/databloggen/501278|accessdate=June 19, 2014|work=Dagbladet Information|date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Ryan|title=How Secret Partners Expand NSA's Surveillance Dragnet|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/06/18/nsa-surveillance-secret-cable-partners-revealed-rampart-a|accessdate=June 18, 2014|work=The Intercept|date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== July 2014 ==
During the week of July 4, a 31-year-old male employee of [[Germany]]'s intelligence service [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] was arrested on suspicion of [[espionage|spying]] for the [[United States]]. The employee is suspected of spying on the [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28160767 |title=Germany arrests man suspected of spying for US |publisher=BBC |date=July 4, 2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former NSA official and whistleblower [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] spoke at a [[Centre for Investigative Journalism]] conference in London. According to Binney, "at least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores." He also stated that the majority of [[Optical fiber cable|fiber optic cables]] run through the U.S., which "is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowenstein|first1=Antony|title=The ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control|journal=The Guardian|date=July 10, 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/11/the-ultimate-goal-of-the-nsa-is-total-population-control|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' released a review of a cache provided by Snowden containing roughly 160,000 text messages and e-mails intercepted by the NSA between 2009 and 2012. The newspaper concluded that nine out of ten account holders whose conversations were recorded by the agency "were not the intended surveillance targets but were caught in a net the agency had cast for somebody else." In its analysis, ''The Post'' also noted that many of the account holders were Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gellman|first1=Barton|last2=Tate|first2=Julie|last3=Soltani|first3=Ashkan|title=In NSA-intercepted data, those not targeted far outnumber the foreigners who are|journal=The Washington Post|date=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, former State Department official [[John Tye (whistleblower)|John Tye]] released an editorial in ''The Washington Post'', highlighting concerns over data collection under [[Executive Order 12333]].

|Ancient times||Typical skeletal abnormalities of tuberculosis, including characteristic [[Pott disease|Pott's deformities]], are found in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummies]] and are depicted in early Egyptian art. Tuberculosis is also noted in the [[Bible|Biblical]] books of [[Deuteronomy]] and [[Leviticus]]. Written texts describe tuberculosis in India as early as 3300 years ago and in China 2300 years ago. Tuberculosis is well known in [[classical Greece]], where it is called ''phthisis''.&lt;ref name="summary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=M. Daniel|title=The history of tuberculosis|doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2006.08.006|url=http://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111%2806%2900401-X/fulltext#back-bib19|volume=100|journal=Respiratory Medicine|pages=1862–1870|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="resmedjournal.com" /&gt;
|-
|Middle Ages and Renaissance||The incidence of tuberculosis grows progressively in these times, displacing [[leprosy]], peaking between the 18th and 19th century as field workers move to the cities looking for work.&lt;ref&gt;Aufderheide 1998:129&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of Europe, tuberculosis is known as the “king’s evil” and is widely believed that the kings of England and France can cure ''[[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis|scrofula]]'' simply by touching those affected.&lt;ref name="news-medical.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tuberculosis|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/History-of-Tuberculosis.aspx|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1700s–1800s||Description of tuberculosis is developed in medical literature. Toward 1800s [[sanatoria]] start to open for treating patients, with often successful outcomes. Understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] of tuberculosis begins with the works of [[René Laennec|Laennec]], [[Jean Antoine Villemin|Villemin]] and the identification of the tubercle bacillus as the [[etiology|etiologic]] agent by [[Robert Koch]].
|-
|1920s–1930s||The [[International Union Against Tuberculosis]] (IUAT) is founded. [[BCG vaccine]] against tuberculosis is developed. Several international conferences are held, focusing on the fundamental, biological, clinical and social aspects of tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="theunion"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tuberculosis|url=http://www.theunion.org/who-we-are/history|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1940s onward||During the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], [[SS-Obergruppenführer]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] organized the execution of more than 30,000 Polish patients suffering from tuberculosis - little knowing or caring that by that time, a cure was nearly achieved. The isolation of [[streptomycin]] is generally considered the beginning of the modern era of tuberculosis. The revolution continues with the development of [[isoniazid]], the first oral mycobactericidal drug. The advent of [[rifampin]] in the 1970s hastens recovery times, and significantly reduces the number of tuberculosis cases in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Box 1: History of tuberculosis drug development|url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v12/n5/box/nrd4001_BX1.html|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raviglione|first1=Mario C.|title=Tuberculosis: The Essentials, Fourth Edition|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlvvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22isoniazid%22+%22revolution%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mzn--kHu5t&amp;sig=cC-jsmrusNmsyZb43k_mNlBPGD0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCgOe33PnOAhVMIZAKHcNWBQsQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22isoniazid%22%20%22revolution%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1980s onward||Tuberculosis [[antibiotic resistance|drug-resistant]] strains appear, provoking a rise in incidence in countries like [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Also, the association with [[AIDS]] has contributed to the rise of tuberculosis in some sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tuberculosis (TB) and other mycobacterial diseases: diagnosis, screening, management and data|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tuberculosis-and-other-mycobacterial-diseases-diagnosis-screening-management-and-data|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Present||Today, tuberculosis continues to be a top infectious disease killer worldwide. However, the death rate has dropped 47% since 1990. Over 95% of cases and deaths are in developing countries, with the most severe burden in Africa.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt; At least 1 million children fall ill with tuberculosis each year, represent about 11% of all cases.&lt;ref name="ENDING TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN"&gt;{{cite web|title=ENDING TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN|url=http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/childhood_tb_informationsheet.pdf?ua=1|publisher=WHO|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
! Ranking !! Summary
|-
| Individual UCI World Ranking || This ranking system is calculated on a 52 week rolling basis, rankings are updated each Monday. The ranking at the end of the calendar year will be utilised to award an annual winner. Unlike previous ranking systems the UCI World Classification will include &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; male riders from the World Tour down to U23 riders. Points will be awarded on all races from World Tour level down to 1.2 and 2.2 races.
|-
| UCI World Ranking by nations || This is based on the world ranking with the best eight riders from each country contributing towards their nation's overall score.
|-
|UCI WorldTour Rankings || This is the UCI WorldTour ranking of riders, teams and nations taking part in the events of the UCI WorldTour. Only riders being part of a UCI WorldTeam obtain points in UCI WorldTour races.
|-
| Continental Ranking || There will be subsets of rankings which are made up from points scored in non-World Tour races (i.e, UCI Europe Tour, UCI Asia Tour etc) for individuals, teams and nations. This will therefore allow one rider to appear in more than one ranking, for example a rider who won Strade Bianchi and a stage in the Tour of California would be part of the Europe Tour and America Tour rankings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">'''Voices of the Poor''' was an effort in the 1990s through 2000 by the [[World Bank]] to collect the experiences of the poor across the world. The name is also used for the reports that were eventually published from the effort. The effort consisted of two parts: primary research using [[participatory poverty assessment]] (PPA)&lt;ref name="mcgee"&gt;McGee, Rosemary, ed. ''Knowing Poverty''. London, GB: Routledge, 2012.

==Key findings==

The key findings of this study include the following:&lt;ref name="ppa_guide"/&gt;{{rp|87}}

* Poverty is multidimensional (i.e. the poor deal not just with lack of money, but with various problems like lack of resources, poor health, physical violence, social isolation, etc.).
* [[NGO]]s have a limited role in the lives of the poor.

==Reception==

Writing in 2003, Hiroki Nogami praised Voices of the Poor for its use of qualitative analyses, but noted that the study did not sufficiently take into account how the opinions of the poor change with time and location.&lt;ref name=nogami/&gt;{{rp|391}}

==See also==

* ''[[Moving Out of Poverty]]'', a later project by the World Bank that distinguishes itself from Voices of the Poor in that it focuses on the dynamics of moving out of (and falling back into) poverty, and it is a longitudinal study rather than a snapshot in time.

* [[Disease Control Priorities Project]]

'''Willis Clark Conover, Jr.''' (December 18, 1920 – May 17, 1996) was a [[jazz]] producer and broadcaster on the [[Voice of America]] for over forty years. He produced jazz concerts at the [[White House]], the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], and for movies and television. By arranging concerts where people of all races were welcome, he is credited with desegregating Washington D.C. nightclubs.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Robert McG. Thomas Jr., [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/19/us/willis-conover-is-dead-at-75-aimed-jazz-at-the-soviet-bloc.html?pagewanted=1 "Willis Conover Is Dead at 75; Aimed Jazz at the Soviet Bloc"], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 19, 1996. Retrieved February 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Conover is credited with keeping interest in jazz alive in the countries of Eastern Europe through his nightly broadcasts during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Ripmaster 2007" /&gt;

== Youth ==
As a young man Conover was interested in science fiction, and published a [[science fiction fanzine]], ''Science Fantasy Correspondent''. This brought him into contact with [[horror fiction|horror]] writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. The correspondence between Lovecraft, who was at the end of his life, and the young Conover, has been published as ''Lovecraft at Last'' (Carrolton-Clark, 1975; reprint 2004).

Conover's father had intended for him to attend [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]] and follow his family's tradition of military service. Instead, he attended the [[Salisbury University|Maryland State Teacher's College]] at [[Salisbury, Maryland]], and became a radio announcer for [[WTBO]] in [[Cumberland, Maryland]].

He later moved to Washington, D.C., and focused on jazz in his programming, especially the [[Duke Ellington]] hour on Saturday nights.  His guests on this program and Saturday morning shows included many important artists, such as [[Boyd Raeburn]].

== Voice of America ==

[[File:Conover.poland 1.jpg|left|thumb|Conover's first arrival in Poland (1959)]]
Conover came to work at the [[Voice of America]], and eventually became a legend among jazz lovers, primarily due to the hour-long program on the Voice of America called ''[[Voice of America Jazz Hour]]''. Known for his sonorous [[baritone]] voice, many would argue that he was the most important presenter on Voice of America. His slow delivery and the use of scripts written in "special English" made his programmes more widely accessible and he is said to have become the first teacher of English to a whole generation of East European jazz lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexei Yurchak]], ''Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2006, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Conover was not well known in the United States, even among jazz aficionados, as the Voice of America did not broadcast domestically except on [[shortwave]], but his visits to Eastern Europe and [[Soviet Union]] brought huge crowds and star treatment for him.
He was a celebrity figure in the Soviet Union, where jazz was very popular and the Voice of America was a prime source of information as well as music.

In 1956, Conover conducted a series of interviews with jazz luminaries like [[Duke Ellington]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Stan Kenton]], [[Benny Goodman]], and [[Art Tatum]].  His interview with Tatum is noted as "the only known in-depth recorded interview with the pianist".  These interviews were selected by the [[Library of Congress]] as a 2010 addition to the [[National Recording Registry]], which selects recordings annually that are "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2010reg.html | title=The National Recording Registry 2010 | accessdate=April 10, 2011 | publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

He died of lung cancer. He had been a smoker for 57 years.&lt;ref name=CER&gt;James Lester, [http://www.ce-review.org/99/5/music5_lester.html "Willis of Oz"], ''[[Central Europe Review]]'', Vol. 1, No. 5, July 26, 1999. Retrieved February 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1990, Conover was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from [[Berklee College of Music]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/conover-willis-clark-jr&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[University of North Texas]] announced its Willis Conover Collection would make digitized copies of Conover's programs available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Doug | last=Ramsey | title=The Willis Conover Archive Is Online | series=Rifftides | website=ArtsJournal | url=http://www.artsjournal.com/rifftides/2015/09/the-willis-conover-archive-is-online.html | accessdate=September 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Environment Day''' ('''WED''') is celebrated on the 5th of June every year, and is the [[United Nations|United Nation's]] principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the [[environmental protection|protection of our environment]]. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging [[environmental issue]]s from [[marine pollution]], human [[overpopulation]], and [[global warming]], to [[sustainable consumption]] and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.

==History==
World Environment Day [WED] was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/environmentday/background.shtml|title=World Environment Day - 5 June|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the first day of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]], resulting from discussions on the integration of human interactions and the environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme "Only One Earth". Even though WED celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.

== Annual themes and major initiatives and accomplishments ==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
For almost five decades, World Environment Day has been raising awareness, supporting action, and driving change. Here is a timeline of key accomplishments in WEDs’ history:

People should be free from the over-reliance on single-use or disposables, as they have severe environmental consequences.  We should liberate our natural places, our wildlife - and our own health from plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/world-environment-day-2018-live-updates-host-nation-india-focuses-on-beat-plastic-pollution-theme-1862462|title=World Environment Day 2018 LIVE: Host Nation India Focuses On 'Beat Plastic Pollution' Theme|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian government pledged to eliminate all single use of plastic in India by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-aims-to-partner-with-un-to-promote-use-of-solar-energy/articleshow/64476669.cms|title=India aims to partner with UN to promote use of solar energy|date=2018-06-06|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Our cosmic oasis, cosmic blue pearl
the most beautiful planet in the universe
all the continents and the oceans 
united we stand as flora and fauna
united we stand as species of one earth
different cultures, beliefs and ways
we are humans, the earth is our home
all the people and the nations of the world
all for one and one for all
united we unfurl the blue flag.

The '''World Health Imaging, Telemedicine and Informatics Alliance''' (WHITIA) is a non-profit [[global health]] technology and [[social venture]] established in 2006 by affiliates of [[Northwestern University]] near [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name="McCByDesign"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://magazine.mccormick.northwestern.edu/FA2007/Xray.html | title = McCormick students and faculty tackle health care challenge in the developing world  | publisher= Robert R.

WHITIA's vision is to facilitate the deployment of thousands of digital medical imaging systems worldwide, providing one billion people with access to diagnostic imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldhealthimaging.org/ |title=Welcome to WHITIA &amp;#124; Homepage |publisher=Worldhealthimaging.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHITIA was formerly known as the World Health Imaging Alliance (WHIA) until it formally expanded its scope in June 2009.

WHITIA's first formal public launch was in April 2009 at the [[HIMSS|Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS)]] Annual Conference &amp; Exhibition in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. WHITIA announced strategic partners including [[SEDECAL]], [[Carestream Health]] and [[Merge Healthcare]], receiving extensive coverage in [[Health IT]] magazines and publications.&lt;ref name="HIMSS09"&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS111037+06-Apr-2009+BW20090406 | title = Not-for-Profit Has a Vision to Help a Billion People | publisher= Reuters | date=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoofinance1"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Merge-Healthcare-Commits-1-bw-14855801.html?x=1&amp;.v=1 | title = World Health Imaging Alliance Poised to Bring Imaging Diagnostics and Data to the Developing World | publisher= Yahoo Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 Annual  Conference of the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) in [[Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], WHITIA announced its partnership with [[Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine|SIIM]], which will allow both organizations to collaborate on specific initiatives.&lt;ref name="SIIM09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090605005136/en | title = World Health Imaging Alliance (WHIA) Announces Support From The Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) | publisher= Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IE09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.imagingeconomics.com/news/2009-06-17_01.asp | title = World Health Imaging Alliance poised to bring imaging diagnostics and data to the developing world | publisher= Imaging Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHITIA was recently ranked #15 of the top 25 most influential people, institutions, and organizations in the radiology industry.&lt;ref name="rt-image"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-10-22 | url = http://www.rt-image.com/25_Most_Influential_in_Radiology_Recognizing_the_movers_and_shakers_in_the_radio/content=9004J05E48B6A084409698724488B0441 | title = 25 Most Influential in Radiology | publisher= rt Image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2009 [[Radiological Society of North America|RSNA]] Annual Meeting, WHITIA launched, '''Remi-d''', a remote-operated screening X-ray system for use in the developing world. Its strengths in these areas stem from the higher burden of [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) and [[Tuberculosis]] (TB) co-infection, high incidences of [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|Black Lung disease]], or outbreaks of other infectious [[respiratory diseases]]. The teleradiology and remote-controlled features of Remi-d allow resource-limited areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America and Southeast Asia, where [[Radiologist]]s and [[Radiographer]]s are in short supply to have a functioning X-ray service.&lt;ref name="RSNA09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | url = http://www.news-medical.net/news/20091130/WHITIA-launches-digital-medical-X-ray-device-for-screening-infectious-diseases-in-developing-countries.aspx | title = WHITIA launches digital medical X-ray device for screening infectious diseases in developing countries | publisher= THE MEDICAL NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHITIA currently has [[Pilot (experiment)|pilot]] [[System integration|integrated]] [[digital X-ray]] sites in [[South Africa]] and [[Guatemala]] at established [[clinics]] in need and is expanding to new qualified sites in [[partnership]] with [[NGOs]] such as [[Rotary International]] while cooperating with the [[local government|local]] and [[Central government|national governments]].&lt;ref name="HTW09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.healthtechwire.com/The-Industry-s-News-unb.146+M5a262949a06.0.html | title = SIIM to Support World Health Imaging Alliance | publisher= HealthTech Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guatemala clinics ==
The Guatemala pilot sites in urban [[Guatemala City]] and [[rural]] [[Río Hondo, Zacapa|Río Hondo]] provide essential healthcare technology to thousands of people in the communities served. They are designed to be models for the wider expansion of the WHITIA network throughout the clinics in need in urban and rural Guatemala. The system's specific design for Guatemala City is an integration of some of WHITIA's partners' strengths and generosity:

* [[SEDECAL]] provides the X-ray generator and controls
* [[Carestream Health]] donates the [[Photostimulated luminescence|computed radiography]] (CR) digital scanner and plates
* [[Kane X-ray]] donates personnel to perform installation and set up of the CR and [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]]

This project was largely funded by several US and Guatemalan [[Rotary International|Rotary clubs]] along with the key resource support of the Guatemalan municipal and national governments.&lt;ref name="GUATE11"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2011-01-09 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110104006502/en/WHITIA-Announces-Completion-Digital-X-ray-Pilot-Sites | title = WHITIA Announces the Completion of Digital X-ray Pilot Sites in Urban and Rural Guatemala | publisher= Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">The '''World Population Conference''' was held at the Salle Centrale, [[Geneva]], Switzerland, from 29 August to 3 September 1927. Organized by the [[League of Nations]] and [[Margaret Sanger]], the conference was an attempt to bring together international experts on population, food supply, fertility, migration and health to discuss the problem of [[human overpopulation]]. Sir [[Bernard Mallet]] presided over the meeting, and [[William H. Welch]] was vice-president.

==Event==
The conference was truly international, with one hundred and twenty-three delegates from [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Great Britain]], [[Greece]], the [[Netherlands]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]], [[Peru]], [[Poland]], [[Siam]], [[Spain]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]]. Sessions included papers followed by open discussion on topics including biology and population growth, food and population, [[differential fertility]], falling [[birth rates]], international migration and migration restriction, heredity, and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanger|first=Margaret|title=Proceedings of the World Population Conference|year=1927|publisher=Edward Arnold &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=363–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MyRBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22proceedings+of+the+world+population+conference%22&amp;dq=%22proceedings+of+the+world+population+conference%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EMB6UdLgOOf94APlzoHgCA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The World Population Conference succeeded in drawing attention to the study of population growth and established the [[International Union for the Scientific Study of Population]]. British [[Malthusian]] leader [[Charles Vickery Drysdale]] noted that the meeting was "devoid of propagandism," and that the "weight of authority at it has surpassed all the previous gatherings, and has been second to none in brilliance. The simple fact that nearly two hundred persons of the highest eminence in biological, economic and statistical science, sociologists, statesmen, and physicians have come from all parts of the world to Geneva to confer on this question is sufficient to show that it cannot be disregarded and that it will have to be considered by the Governments of all countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drysdale|first=C. V.|title=The First World Population Conferrnce: Some Impressions|journal=Birth Control Review|date=October 1927|volume=XI|issue=10|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A second World Population Conference, sponsored by the [[United Nations]] was held in 1954 in [[Rome]], and a third in 1974 in [[Bucharest]].

==Margaret Sanger's Role==
[[Margaret Sanger]] conceived of the World Population Conference and organized a group of scientists including [[Raymond Pearl]], [[Edward Murray East]], and [[Clarence Cook Little]], to develop the program and invite speakers. She agreed that birth control would not be discussed. She established an office to administer the conference in Geneva, but just before the Conference was to open, Sir [[Bernard Mallet]] removed her name and the names of her all-female administrative staff from the printed conference programs, using the excuse that administrators and clerical staff should not be listed in a scientific program. Sanger's staff quit in protest. Sanger persuaded most back, arguing that the meeting was more important than who was credited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Margaret Sanger Papers Project|title=From Geneva to Cairo: Margaret Sanger and the First World Population Conference|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/newsletter/articles/from_geneva_to_cairo.html|work=Margaret Sanger Papers Project Newsletter|accessdate=2013-04-26|date=Spring 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sanger edited the Proceedings of the World Population Conference.
