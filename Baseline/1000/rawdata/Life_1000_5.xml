The '''2045 Initiative''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] that develops a network and community of researchers in the field of [[life extension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|publisher=Le Vif
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Russian entrepreneur [[Dmitry Itskov]] in February 2011 with the participation of Russian specialists in the field of neural interfaces, robotics, artificial organs and systems.

The main goal of the 2045 Initiative, as stated on site, is "to create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual’s personality to a more advanced non-biological carrier, and extending life, including to the point of immortality. We devote particular attention to enabling the fullest possible dialogue between the world’s major spiritual traditions, science and society".

==Future prospects==
The 2045 Initiative has a roadmap for developing cybernetic [[immortality]].&lt;ref name = social&gt;[http://2045.com/ideology/ About Us, Strategic Social Initiative, 2045]&lt;/ref&gt; The Initiative has the goal for an avatar controlled by a "brain-computer" interface to be developed between 2015 and 2020, between 2020 and 2025 creating an autonomous life-support system for the human brain linked to a robot, between 2030 and 2035 creating a computer model of the brain and human consciousness with the means to transfer it into an artificial carrier, and by 2045 create a new era for humanity with holographic bodies.&lt;ref name = social/&gt;

==Avatar Project==

One of the featured [[Life extension|life-extension]] projects is to design an artificial [[humanoid]] body (called an "avatar") and an advanced [[brain–computer interface]] system. On the biological side, a life support system will be developed for hosting a human brain inside the avatar and maintaining it alive and functional. A later phase of the project will research into the creation of an [[artificial brain]] into which the original individual [[consciousness]] may be transferred.

=== Avatar A ===

A robotic copy of a human body remotely capable of interpreting commands directly from the mind, and sending information back to the mind in a form that can be interpreted via [[brain–computer interface]]. It is estimated to be popularized in or before 2020.

=== Avatar B ===

An avatar in which a human brain is [[Brain transplant|transplanted]] at the end of one's life. Avatar B has an autonomous system providing life support for the brain and allowing it interaction with the environment, possibly mounted into an existing Avatar A Chassis. Deadline of this phase is year 2025.

=== Avatar C ===

An avatar with an artificial brain to which a human personality is transferred for emulation at the end of one's life. The first successful attempt to upload one's personality to a computer is estimated to happen around 2035.

=== Avatar D ===

A [[Holography|hologram]]- or [[diagram]]-like avatar. This is the ultimate goal of this project but is optional since, assuming either the upload is involuntary or all humans chose to upload, biological diseases are prevented in the previous phase, and it is far away from current technological achievement and our understanding on physics.

==Reception==

Professor [[George M. Church]] has complained that "there's a lot of dots that aren't connected in (Itskov's) plans. It's not a real road map." [[Martine A. Rothblatt]], the founder of [[United Therapeutics]], has claimed the Avatar Project is "no more wild than in the early '60s, when we saw the advent of [[liver transplantation|liver]] and [[Kidney transplantation|kidney]] transplants."&lt;ref name=nytimes_06_2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Segal|first=David|title=Dmitry Itskov and the Avatar Quest|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/dmitry-itskov-and-the-avatar-quest.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=9 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13219">'''Autogamy''', or '''self-fertilization''', refers to the [[Cell fusion|fusion]] of two [[gamete]]s that come from one individual.  Autogamy is predominantly observed in the form of self-pollination, a reproductive mechanism employed by many flowering plants.  However, species of [[protist]]s have also been observed using autogamy as a means of reproduction.  Flowering plants engage in autogamy regularly, while the protists that engage in autogamy only do so in stressful environments.

==Occurrence==

===Protists===
====Paramecium aurelia====
''[[Paramecium aurelia]]'' is the most commonly studied protozoan for autogamy. Similar to other unicellular organisms, ''Paramecium aurelia'' typically reproduce asexually via binary fission or sexually via cross-fertilization.  However, studies have shown that when put under nutritional stress, ''Paramecium aurelia'' will undergo meiosis and subsequent fusion of gametic-like nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, James D. "Autogamy in Paramecium cell cycle stage-specific commitment to meiosis." Experimental cell research 166.2 (1986): 475-485.
&lt;/ref&gt; This process, defined as hemixis, a chromosomal rearrangement process, takes place in a number of steps.  First, the two micronuclei of Paramecium aurelia enlarge and divide two times to form eight nuclei.  Some of these daughter nuclei will continue to divide to create potential future gametic nuclei. Of these potential gametic nuclei, one will divide two more times. Of the four daughter nuclei arising from this step, two of them become anlagen, or cells that will form part of the new organism.  The other two daughter nuclei become the gametic micronuclei that will undergo autogamous self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Diller, W. F. (1936), Nuclear reorganization processes in Paramecium aurelia, with descriptions of autogamy and ‘hemixis’. J. Morphol., 59: 11–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  These nuclear divisions are observed mainly when the Paramecium aurelia is put under nutritional stress.  Research shows that ''Paramecium aurelia'' undergo autogamy synchronously with other individuals of the same species.

====Clonal aging and rejuvenation====

In ''[[Paramecium]] tetraurelia'', vitality declines over the course of successive asexual cell divisions by binary fission. Clonal aging is associated with a dramatic increase in [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]].&lt;ref name="pmid424739"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith-Sonneborn J |title=DNA repair and longevity assurance in Paramecium tetraurelia |journal=Science |volume=203 |issue=4385 |pages=1115–7 |year=1979 |pmid=424739 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3091993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holmes GE, Holmes NR |title=Accumulation of DNA damages in aging Paramecium tetraurelia |journal=Mol. Gen. Genet. |volume=204 |issue=1 |pages=108–14 |year=1986 |pmid=3091993 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8127914"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilley D, Blackburn EH |title=Lack of telomere shortening during senescence in Paramecium |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=1955–8 |year=1994 |pmid=8127914 |pmc=43283 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When paramecia that have experienced clonal aging undergo [[meiosis]], either during conjugation or automixis, the old macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear [[DNA]] that had just experienced meiosis followed by syngamy.  These paramecia are rejuvenated in the sense of having a restored clonal lifespan.  Thus it appears that clonal aging is due in large part to the progressive accumulation of DNA damage, and that rejuvenation is due to [[DNA repair|repair of DNA damage]] during meiosis that occurs in the micronucleus during conjugation or automixis and reestablishment of the macronucleus by replication of the newly repaired micronuclear DNA.

Similar to Paramecium aurelia, the parasitic [[ciliate]] ''Tetrahymena rostrata'' has also been shown to engage in meiosis, autogamy and development of new macronuclei when placed under nutritional stress.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczanowski, Andrzej. "Cohesion of Clonal Life History, Senescence and Rejuvenation Induced by Autogamy of the Histophagous Ciliate Tetrahymena Rostrata." Protist 167.5 (2016): n. pag. PubMed. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the degeneration and remodeling of genetic information that occurs in autogamy, genetic variability arises and possibly increases an offspring’s chances of survival in stressful environments.

====Allogromia laticollaris====
''[[Allogromia laticollaris]]'' is perhaps the best-studied [[Foraminifera|foraminiferan amoeboid]] for autogamy. ''Allogromia laticollaris'' can alternate between sexual reproduction via cross-fertilization and asexual reproduction via binary fission. The details of the life cycle of Allogromia laticollaris are unknown, but similar to ''Paramecium aurelia'', ''Allogromia laticollaris'' is also shown to sometimes defer to autogamous behavior when placed in nutritional stress. As seen in Paramecium, there is some nuclear dimorphism observed in ''Allogromia laticollaris.''  There are often observations of [[Macronucleus|macronuclei]] and chromosomal fragments coexisting in ''Allogromia laticollaris.''  This is indicative of nuclear and chromosomal degeneration, a process similar to the subdivisions observed in ''Paramecium aurelia.'' Multiple generations of [[Ploidy|haploid]] ''Allogromia laticollaris'' individuals can exist before autogamy actually takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J. J. and McEnery, M. E. (1970), Autogamy in Allogromia laticollaris (Foraminifera). The Journal of Protozoology, 17: 184–195.&lt;/ref&gt; The autogamous behavior in Allogromia laticollaris has the added consequence of giving rise to daughter cells that are substantially smaller than those rising from binary fission.&lt;ref&gt;K., Sen Gupta B. Modern Foraminifera. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that this is a survival mechanism employed when the cell is in stressful environments, and thus not able to allocate all resources to creating offspring.  If a cell was under nutritional stress and not able to function regularly, there would be a strong possibility of its offspring’s fitness being sub-par.

===Self-pollination in flowering plants===
Self-pollination is an example of autogamy that occurs in flowering plants.  Self-pollination occurs when the sperm in the pollen from the stamen of a plant goes to the carpels of that same plant and fertilizes the egg cell present. Self-pollination can either be done completely autogamously or geitonogamously.  In the former, the egg and sperm cells that united came from the same flower.  In the latter, the sperm and egg cells can come from a different flower on the same plant.  While the latter method does blur the lines between autogamous self-fertilization and normal sexual reproduction, it is still considered autogamous self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G. "Contributions of Autogamy and Geitonogamy to Self-Fertilization in a Mass-Flowering, Clonal Plant." Ecology 81.2 (2000): 532. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-pollination]] can lead to [[inbreeding depression]] due to expression of deleterious recessive [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid19834483"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Charlesworth D, Willis JH |title=The genetics of inbreeding depression |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=783–96 |year=2009 |pmid=19834483 |doi=10.1038/nrg2664 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meiosis followed by self-pollination results in little genetic variation, raising the question of how meiosis in self-pollinating plants is adaptively maintained over an extended period in preference to a less complicated and less costly asexual ameiotic process for producing progeny. For instance, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is a predominantly self-pollinating plant that has an outcrossing rate in the wild estimated at less than 0.3%,&lt;ref&gt;Abbott RJ, Gomes MF.  Population genetic structure and outcrossing rate of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.

==Advantages of autogamy==
	There are several advantages for the self-fertilization observed in flowering plants and protists.  In flowering plants, it is important for some plants not to be dependent on pollinating agents that other plants rely on for fertilization. This is unusual, however, considering that many plant species have evolved to become incompatible with their own gametes.  While these species would not be well served by having autogamous self-fertilization as a reproductive mechanism, other species, which do not have self-incompatibility, would benefit from autogamy.  Protists have the advantage of diversifying their modes of reproduction. This is useful for a multitude of reasons. First, if there is an unfavorable change in the environment that puts the ability to deliver offspring at risk, then it is advantageous for an organism to have autogamy at its disposal. In other organisms, it is seen that genetic diversity arising from sexual reproduction is maintained by changes in the environment that favor certain genotypes over others.
Aside from extreme circumstances, it is possible that this form of reproduction gives rise to a genotype in the offspring that will increase fitness in the environment.  This is due to the nature of the genetic degeneration and remodeling intrinsic to autogamy in unicellular organisms.  Thus, autogamous behavior may become advantageous to have if an individual wanted to ensure offspring viability and survival. This advantage also applies to flowering plants.  However, it is important to note that this change has not shown to produce a progeny with more fitness in unicellular organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G., and Christopher R. Herlihy. "Using a Cost-benefit Approach to Understand the Evolution of Self-fertilization in Plants: The Perplexing Case of Aquilegia Canadensis (Ranunculaceae)." Plant Species Biology 19.3 (2004): 159-73. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the nutrition deprived state of the parent cells before autogamy created a barrier for producing offspring that could thrive in those same stressful environments.

==Disadvantages of autogamy==
	In flowering plants, autogamy has the disadvantage of producing low genetic diversity in the species that use it as the predominant mode of reproduction. This leaves those species particularly susceptible to pathogens and viruses that can harm it. In addition, the foraminiferans that use autogamy have shown to produce substantially smaller progeny as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G. "Contributions of Autogamy and Geitonogamy to Self-Fertilization in a Mass-Flowering, Clonal Plant." Ecology 81.2 (2000): 532. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  This indicates that since it is generally an emergency survival mechanism for unicellular species, the mechanism does not have the nutritional resources that would be provided by the organism if it were undergoing binary fission.

==Evolution of autogamy==
	The evolutionary shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization is one of the most frequent evolutionary transitions in plants.  About 10-15% of [[flowering plant]]s are predominantly self-fertilizing.&lt;ref name="pmid23595268"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wright SI, Kalisz S, Slotte T |title=Evolutionary consequences of self-fertilization in plants |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=280 |issue=1760 |pages=20130133 |year=2013 |pmid=23595268 |pmc=3652455 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.0133 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since autogamy in flowering plants and autogamy in unicellular species is fundamentally different, and plants and protists are not related, it is likely that both instances evolved separately.  In flowering plants, it is believed that autogamy evolved one million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Chunlao, Tang. "The Evolution of Selfing in Arabidopsis Thaliana." Science317.5841 (2007): 1070--72. AAAS. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, due to the little overall genetic variation that arises in progeny, it is not fully understood how autogamy has been maintained in the tree of life.

'''Avida''' is an [[artificial life]] software platform to study the [[evolutionary biology]] of [[self-replication|self-replicating]] and [[evolution|evolving]] [[computer program]]s ([[digital organism]]s). Avida is under active development by [[Charles Ofria]]'s Digital Evolution Lab at [[Michigan State University]]; the first version of Avida was designed in 1993 by Ofria, [[Chris Adami]] and C. Titus Brown at [[Caltech]], and has been fully reengineered by Ofria on multiple occasions since then.  The software was originally inspired by the [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] system.

== Design principles ==

[[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] simulated an evolutionary system by introducing computer programs that competed for computer resources, specifically processor (CPU) time and access to main memory. In this respect it was similar to [[Core Wars]], but differed in that the programs being run in the simulation were able to modify themselves, and thereby evolve. Tierra's programs were artificial life organisms.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Unlike Tierra, Avida assigns every digital organism its own protected region of memory, and executes it with a separate virtual [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. By default, other digital organisms cannot access this memory space, neither for reading nor for writing, and cannot execute code that is not in their own memory space.

A second major difference is that the virtual CPUs of different organisms can run at different speeds, such that one organism executes, for example, twice as many instructions in the same time interval as another organism. The speed at which a virtual CPU runs is determined by a number of factors, but most importantly, by the ''tasks'' that the organism performs: logical computations that the organisms can carry out to reap extra CPU speed as bonus.

== Use in research ==

Adami and Ofria, in collaboration with others, have used Avida to conduct research in digital evolution, and the scientific journals ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' have published four of their papers.

The 2003 paper "The Evolutionary Origin of Complex Features" describes the evolution of a mathematical [[Equality (mathematics)|equal]]s [[operator (programming)|operation]] from simpler bitwise operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lenski|first1=R.

[[Image:Taraxacum sect. Ruderalia MHNT.jpg|thumb|right|Wind dispersal of [[dandelion]] seeds.]]

'''Biological dispersal''' refers to both the movement of individuals ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], [[bacteria]], etc.) from their birth site to their breeding site ('natal dispersal'), as well as the movement from one breeding site to another ('breeding dispersal').
Dispersal is also used to describe the movement of [[propagule]]s such as [[seed]]s and [[spore]]s.
Technically, dispersal is defined as any movement that has the potential to lead to [[gene flow]].&lt;ref name=Ronce&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronce, O. |year=2007|title= How does it feel to be like a rolling stone?

The act of dispersal involves three phases: departure, transfer, settlement and there are different fitness costs and benefits associated with each of these phases.&lt;ref name=Bonte&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bonte, D. |author2=Van Dyck, H. |author3=Bullock, J.

Through simply moving from one habitat [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] to another, the dispersal of an individual has consequences not only for individual [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], but also for [[population dynamics]], [[population genetics]], and [[species distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dunning, J.

Dispersal can be distinguished from [[animal migration]] (typically round-trip seasonal movement), although within the [[population genetics]] literature, the terms '[[migration (disambiguation)|migration]]' and 'dispersal' are often used interchangeably.

== Types of dispersal ==
[[File:Dispersal diagram.jpeg|thumb|Dispersal from parent population]]
Some organisms are motile throughout their lives, but others are adapted to move or be moved at precise, limited phases of their life cycles. This is commonly called the '''dispersive phase''' of the life cycle. The strategies of organisms' entire life cycles often are predicated on the nature and circumstances of their dispersive phases.

In general there are two basic types of dispersal:
; Density-independent dispersal: Organisms have evolved adaptations for dispersal that take advantage of various forms of kinetic energy occurring naturally in the environment. This is referred to as density independent or passive dispersal and operates on many groups of organisms (some [[invertebrate]]s, [[fish]], [[insect]]s and [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms such as [[plant]]s) that depend on animal [[dispersal vector|vectors]], wind, gravity or current for dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maguire Jr., B.|year= 1963|title= The passive dispersal of small aquatic organisms and their colonization of isolated bodies of water|doi=10.2307/1948560|jstor=1948560|volume=33|journal=Ecological Monographs|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nathan, R.|year=2001|title=The challenges of studying dispersal|url=http://bio.huji.ac.il/ese/PDFs/Nathan2001TREE.pdf|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02272-8|volume=16|issue=9|pages=481|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928204701/http://www.bio.huji.ac.il/ese/PDFs/Nathan2001TREE.pdf|archivedate=2013-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Density-dependent dispersal: Density dependent or active dispersal for many animals largely depends on factors such as local [[population]] size, resource [[competition]], [[habitat]] quality, and habitat size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Johst, K.  |author2=Brandl, R.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1997|title= The effect of dispersal on local population dynamics|doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(97)00112-9|journal= Ecological Modelling|volume=104|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowler&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bowler, D.

Rev. |volume=80|issue=2|pages= 205–225|doi=10.1017/S1464793104006645|pmid=15921049}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fernández, L. |year=2015|title= Source-sink dynamics shapes the spatial distribution of soil protists in an arid shrubland of northern Chile|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2014.10.007|journal= Journal of Arid Environment|volume=113|pages=121–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to population density, dispersal may relieve pressure for resources in an ecosystem, and competition for these resources may be a selection factor for dispersal mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Irwini, A.J.  |author2=Taylor, P.D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title= Evolution of Dispersal in a Stepping-Stone Population with Overlapping Generations|pmid=11162790|url=http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~peter/pdf/TPB%2058%2000.pdf|journal= Theoretical Population Biology|volume=58|issue=4|pages=321–8|doi=10.1006/tpbi.2000.1490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispersal of organisms is a critical process for understanding both geographic isolation in evolution through [[gene flow]] and the broad patterns of current geographic distributions ([[biogeography]]).

A distinction is often made between '''natal dispersal''' where an individual (often a juvenile) moves away from the place it was born, and '''breeding dispersal''' where an individual (often an adult) moves away from one breeding location to breed elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Ronce /&gt;

==Costs and benefits ==
[[File:Epilobium hirsutum - Seed head - 3.jpg|thumb|230px|Epilobium hirsutum - Seed head]]

In the broadest sense, dispersal occurs when the fitness benefits of moving outweigh the costs.

There are a number of benefits to dispersal such as locating new resources, escaping unfavorable conditions, avoiding competing with [[sibling]]s, and avoiding breeding with closely related individuals which could lead to [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name=Bowler/&gt;

There are also a number of costs associated with dispersal, which can be thought of in terms of four main currencies: energy, risk, time and opportunity.&lt;ref name=Bonte/&gt;
Energetic costs include the extra energy required to move as well as energetic investment in movement machinery (e.g. wings). Risks include increased injury and mortality during dispersal and the possibility of settling in an unfavorable environment.
Time spent dispersing is time that often cannot be spent on other activities such as growth and reproduction.
Finally dispersal can also lead to [[outbreeding depression]] if an individual is better adapted to its natal environment than the one it ends up in. In social animals (such as many birds and mammals) a dispersing individual must find and join a new group, which can lead to loss of social rank.&lt;ref name=Bonte/&gt;

== Dispersal range ==

"Dispersal range" refers to the distance a species can move from an existing population or the parent organism. An [[ecosystem]] depends critically on the ability of individuals and [[populations]] to disperse from one habitat [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] to another. Therefore, biological dispersal is critical to the stability of ecosystems.

=== Environmental constraints ===

Few species are ever evenly or randomly distributed within or across [[landscapes]]. In general, [[species]] significantly vary across the landscape in association with environmental features that influence their reproductive success and population persistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Groom MJ, Meffe GK, Carroll CR |year= 2005|isbn=0-87893-597-5|title= Principles of Conservation Biology|place= Sunderland (MA)|publisher= Sinauer Associates, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin TE|year= 1998|title= Are microhabitat preferences of coexisting species under selection and adaptive? |journal=Ecology| volume=79|issue=2|pages=656–670|url=http://www.umt.edu/mcwru/personnel/martin/PDF%20Martin/Reprint550.pdf|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0656:AMPOCS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial patterns in environmental features (e.g. resources) permit individuals to escape unfavorable conditions and seek out new locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Turner MG, Gardner RH, O'Neill, Robert V |year= 2001|title= Landscape Ecology: In theory and practice, pattern and process|place= New York |publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-95123-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the organism to "test" new environments for their suitability, provided they are within animal's geographic range. In addition, the ability of a species to disperse over a gradually changing environment could enable a population to survive extreme conditions. (i.e. [[climate change]]).

As the climate changes, prey and predators have to adapt to survive. This poses a problem for many animals, for example the [[Southern rockhopper penguin|Southern Rockhopper Penguins]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cebc.cnrs.fr/publipdf/2003/TMEPS251.pdf|title = Geographic variation in the foraging behaviour, diet and chick growth of rockhopper penguins|last = Tremblay|first = Yann|date = April 11, 2003|journal = Marine Ecology Progress Series|doi = 10.3354/meps251279|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These penguins are able to live and thrive in a variety of climates due to the penguins' phenotypic plasticity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Penguin responses to climate change in the Southern Ocean|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01909.x/abstract|journal = Global Change Biology|date = 2009-07-01|issn = 1365-2486|pages = 1618–1630|volume = 15|issue = 7|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01909.x|first = Jaume|last = Forcada|first2 = Philip N.|last2 = Trathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are predicted to respond by dispersal, not adaptation this time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is explained due to their long life spans and slow microevolution. Penguins in the subantarctic have very different foraging behavior than the subtropical waters, it would be very hard to survive and keep up with the fast changing climate because these behaviors took years to shape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Dispersal barriers ===

A dispersal barrier may mean that the dispersal range of a species is much smaller than the species distribution. An artificial example is [[habitat fragmentation]] due to human land use. Natural barriers to dispersal that limit species distribution include mountain ranges and rivers. An example is the separation of the ranges of the two species of [[chimpanzee]] by the [[Congo River]].

On the other hand, human activities may also expand the dispersal range of a species by providing new dispersal methods (e.g., [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|ships]]). Many of them become [[invasive species|invasive]], like [[rat]]s and [[stinkbugs]], but some species also have a slightly positive effect to human settlers like [[honeybees]] and [[earthworm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/05/jamestown/charles-mann-text/2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispersal mechanisms ==

Most [[animal]]s are capable of [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] and the basic mechanism of dispersal is movement from one place to another. Locomotion allows the organism to "test" new environments for their suitability, provided they are within the animal's range. Movements are usually guided by inherited [[behavior]]s.

The formation of barriers to dispersal or gene flow between adjacent areas can isolate populations on either side of the emerging divide.  The geographic separation and subsequent genetic isolation of portions of an ancestral population can result in speciation.

=== Plant dispersal mechanisms ===
[[File:Bur Macro BlackBg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bur]]s are an example of a seed dispersion mechanism which uses a biotic vector, in this case [[animal]]s with [[fur]].]]
{{Main article|Seed dispersal}}
[[Seed dispersal]] is the movement or transport of [[seed]]s away from the parent plant. Plants have limited mobility and consequently rely upon a variety of [[dispersal vector]]s to transport their propagules, including both [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time.  The patterns of seed dispersal are determined in large part by the dispersal mechanism and this has important implications for the demographic and genetic structure of plant populations, as well as migration patterns and [[species]] interactions.  There are five main modes of seed dispersal: gravity, wind, ballistic, water and by animals.

=== Animal dispersal mechanisms ===

==== Non-motile animals ====
There are numerous animal forms that are non—motile, such as [[sea sponge|sponges]], [[bryozoan]]s, [[tunicate]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, and [[oyster]]s. In common, they are all either [[ocean|marine]] or aquatic. It may seem curious that plants have been so successful at stationary life on land, while animals have not, but the answer lies in the food supply. Plants produce their own food from sunlight and [[carbon dioxide]]—both generally more abundant on land than in water. Animals fixed in place must rely on the surrounding medium to bring food at least close enough to grab, and this occurs in the three-dimensional water environment, but with much less abundance in the atmosphere.

All of the marine and aquatic [[invertebrate]]s whose lives are spent fixed to the bottom (more or less; anemones are capable of getting up and moving to a new location if conditions warrant) produce dispersal units. These may be specialized "buds", or motile sexual reproduction products, or even a sort of alteration of generations as in certain [[cnidaria]].

Corals provide a good example of how sedentary species achieve dispersion. Corals reproduce by releasing sperm and eggs directly into the water. These release events are coordinated by lunar phase in certain warm months, such that all corals of one or many species on a given reef will release on the same single or several consecutive nights. The released eggs are fertilized, and the resulting [[zygote]] develops quickly into a multicellular ''[[planula]]''. This motile stage then attempts to find a suitable substratum for settlement. Most are unsuccessful and die or are fed upon by zooplankton and bottom dwelling predators such as anemones and other corals. However, untold millions are produced, and a few do succeed in locating spots of bare limestone, where they settle and transform by growth into a '''''polyp'''''. All things being favorable, the single polyp grows into a coral head by budding off new polyps to form a colony.

==== Motile animals ====
{{main article|Animal locomotion|Animal migration}}
The majority of all animals are [[Motility|motile]]. Although motile animals can, in theory, disperse themselves by their spontaneous and independent locomotive powers, a great many species utilize the existing kinetic energies in the environment, resulting in passive movement. Dispersal by water currents is especially associated with the physically small inhabitants of marine waters known as [[plankton|zooplankton]]. The term plankton comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]], πλαγκτον, meaning "wanderer" or "drifter".

====Dispersal by dormant stages====
Many animal species, especially freshwater invertebrates, are able to disperse by wind or by transfer with an aid of larger animals (birds, mammals or fishes) as dormant eggs, dormant embryos or, in some cases, dormant adult stages. [[Tardigrades]], some [[rotifers]] and some [[copepods]] are able to withstand desiccation as adult dormant stages. Many other taxa ([[Cladocera]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]], [[Copepoda]] and so on) can disperse as dormant eggs or embryos. Freshwater [[sponges]] usually have special dormant propagules called [[gemmulae]] for such a dispersal. Many kinds of dispersal dormant stages are able to withstand not only desiccation and low and high temperature, but also action of digestive enzymes during their transfer through digestive tracts of birds and other animals, high concentration of salts and many kinds of toxicants. Such dormant-resistant stages made possible the long-distance dispersal from one water body to another and broad distribution ranges of many freshwater animals.

== Quantifying dispersal ==

Dispersal is most commonly quantified either in terms of rate or distance.

Dispersal rate (also called [[Net migration rate|migration rate]] in the [[population genetics]] literature) or probability describes the probability that any individual leaves an area or, equivalently, the expected proportion of individual to leave an area.

The dispersal distance is usually described by a '''dispersal kernel''' which gives the [[probability distribution]] of the distance traveled by any individual. A number of different functions are used for dispersal kernels in theoretical models of dispersal including the [[negative exponential distribution]],&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chapman, D.

== Consequences of dispersal ==
Dispersal not only has costs and benefits to the dispersing individual (as mentioned above), but it also has consequences at the level of the [[population]] and [[species]] as well.

Most populations have a patchy spatial distribution. Dispersal, by moving of individuals between different sub-populations, can increase the overall [[landscape connectivity|connectivity]] of the population, helping to minimize the risk of [[stochastic]] extinction, since if a sub-population goes [[extinct]] by chance, it is likely to be recolonized if the dispersal rate is high.
Increased connectivity can also decrease the degree of local adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lenormand, T. |year=2002|title= Gene flow and the limits to natural selection|journal= Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=17|issue=4|pages= 183–189|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02497-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological immortality''' (sometimes referred to ''bio-indefinite'' mortality) is a state in which the [[rate of mortality]] from [[senescence]] is stable or decreasing, thus decoupling it from [[chronological]] age. Various unicellular and multicellular species, including some vertebrates, achieve this state either throughout their existence or after living long enough. A [[Biology|biologically]] immortal [[life|living]] being can still die from means other than senescence, such as through injury or disease.

This definition of [[immortality]] has been challenged in the ''Handbook of the Biology of Aging'',&lt;ref name="Masoro2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=E.J. |last=Masoro |editor=Austad, S.N. |year=2006 |title=Handbook of the Biology of Aging |edition=Sixth |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego, CA |isbn=0-12-088387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age may be negligible at extremely [[old age]]s, an idea referred to as the [[Late-life mortality deceleration|late-life mortality plateau]]. The rate of mortality may cease to increase in old age, but in most cases that rate is typically very high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Late life: a new frontier for physiology |author1=Michael R.

The term is also used by biologists to describe cells that are not subject to the [[Hayflick limit]] on how many times they can divide.

==Cell lines==
{{Main article|Cell culture|Immortalised cell line}}
[[Biologist]]s chose the word "immortal" to designate cells that are not subject to the [[Hayflick limit]], the point at which cells can no longer divide due to [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] or shortened [[telomere]]s. Prior to [[Leonard Hayflick]]'s theory, [[Alexis Carrel]] hypothesized that all normal [[somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells were immortal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shay, J.

The term "immortalization" was first applied to [[cancer]] cells that expressed the telomere-lengthening [[enzyme]] [[telomerase]], and thereby avoided [[apoptosis]]—i.e. cell death caused by intracellular mechanisms. Among the most commonly used cell lines are [[HeLa]] and [[Jurkat cells|Jurkat]], both of which are immortalized cancer cell lines. HeLa cells originated from a sample of [[cervical cancer]] taken from [[Henrietta Lacks]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="Immortal Life"&gt;{{cite book | last = Skloot | first = Rebecca | authorlink = Rebecca Skloot | title = [[The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]] | publisher = Crown/Random House | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4000-5217-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cells have been and still are widely used in biological research such as creation of the [[polio vaccine]],&lt;ref name="Smith_2002"&gt;{{cite news | first = Van | last = Smith | title = The Life, Death, and Life After Death of Henrietta Lacks, Unwitting Heroine of Modern Medical Science. | url = http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3426 | publisher = [[Baltimore City Paper]] | date = 2002-04-17 | accessdate = 2010-03-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040814160109/http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3426 | archivedate = 2004-08-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; sex hormone steroid research,&lt;ref&gt;Bulzomi, Pamela.

===Bacteria and some yeast===
Many unicellular organisms age: as time passes, they divide more slowly and ultimately die. Asymmetrically dividing [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]] also age. However, symmetrically dividing [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]] can be biologically immortal under ideal growing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Current Biology: Volume 23, Issue 19, 7 October 2013, Pages 1844–1852 "Fission Yeast Does Not Age under Favorable Conditions, but Does So after Stress." Miguel Coelho1, 4, Aygül Dereli1, Anett Haese1, Sebastian Kühn2, Liliana Malinovska1, Morgan E. DeSantis3, James Shorter3, Simon Alberti1, Thilo Gross2, 5, Iva M. Tolić-Nørrelykke1&lt;/ref&gt; In these conditions, when a cell splits symmetrically to produce two daughter cells, the process of [[cell division]] can restore the cell to a youthful state. However, if the parent asymmetrically buds off a daughter only the daughter is reset to the youthful state—the parent isn't restored and will go on to age and die. In a similar manner [[stem cell]]s and [[gamete]]s can be regarded as "immortal".

===Hydra===
[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|''Hydra'']]
[[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]] are a [[genus]] of the [[Cnidaria]] phylum. All cnidarians can regenerate, allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Hydras are simple, [[freshwater]] animals possessing [[radial symmetry]] and no post-[[mitotic]] cells. All hydra cells continually divide.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} It has been suggested that hydras do not undergo [[senescence]], and, as such, are biologically immortal. In a four-year study, 3 cohorts of hydra did not show an increase in mortality with age. It is possible that these animals live much longer, considering that they reach maturity in 5 to 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martínez |first=Daniel E. |year=1998 |url=http://www.biochem.uci.edu/Steele/PDFs/Hydra_senescence_paper.pdf |title=Mortality patterns suggest lack of senescence in Hydra |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=217–225 |publisher=Elsevier Science Inc. |doi=10.1016/S0531-5565(97)00113-7 |pmid=9615920 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426043703/http://www.biochem.uci.edu/steele/PDFs/Hydra_senescence_paper.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not explain how hydras are consequently able to maintain [[telomere]] lengths.

===Jellyfish===
''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', or ''[[Turritopsis nutricula]]'', is a small ({{convert|5|mm|in|sp=us}}) species of [[jellyfish]] that uses [[transdifferentiation]] to replenish cells after [[sexual reproduction]]. This cycle can repeat indefinitely, potentially rendering it biologically immortal. This organism originated in the [[Caribbean sea]], but has now spread around the world. Similar cases include hydrozoan ''Laodicea undulata''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|author = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|volume=149|pages=339–346|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scyphozoan ''[[Aurelia (genus)|Aurelia]]'' sp.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 2015-12-21|journal = PLOS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|access-date = 2015-12-31|volume = 10|pages = e0145314|display-authors = etal|pmc = 4687044|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109164816/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0145314|archivedate = 2016-01-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobsters===
{{further information|Lobster#Longevity}}
Research suggests that lobsters may not slow down, weaken, or lose fertility with age, and that older lobsters may be more fertile than younger lobsters. This does not however make them immortal in the traditional sense, as they are significantly more likely to die at a shell moult the older they get (as detailed below).

Their longevity may be due to [[telomerase]], an [[enzyme]] that repairs long repetitive sections of [[DNA sequence]]s at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as [[telomeres]]. Telomerase is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages but is generally absent from adult stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cong YS | title = Human Telomerase and Its Regulation | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–425 |date=2002 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.66.3.407-425.2002 | pmid=12208997 | pmc=120798}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike vertebrates, lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfram Klapper |author2=Karen Kühne |author3=Kumud K.

Lobsters grow by [[moulting]] which requires a lot of energy, and the larger the shell the more energy is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lobsters.org/tlcbio/biology3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211101926/http://www.lobsters.org/tlcbio/biology3.html |archivedate=2015-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the lobster will die from exhaustion during a moult. Older lobsters are also known to stop moulting, which means that the shell will eventually become damaged, infected, or fall apart and they die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/?no-ist|title=Don’t Listen to the Buzz: Lobsters Aren’t Actually Immortal|first=Marina|last=Koren|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150212053821/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/?no-ist|archivedate=2015-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European lobster]] has an average life span of 31 years for males and 54 years for females.

===Planarian flatworms===
[[File:Polycelis felina.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Polycelis felina'', a freshwater planarian]]
[[Planarian|Planarian flatworms]] have both sexually and asexually reproducing types. Studies on genus [[Schmidtea mediterranea]] suggest these planarians appear to regenerate (i.e. heal) indefinitely, and asexual individuals have an "apparently limitless [telomere] regenerative capacity fueled by a population of highly proliferative adult stem cells". "Both asexual and sexual animals display age-related decline in telomere length; however, asexual animals are able to maintain telomere lengths somatically (i.e. during reproduction by fission or when regeneration is induced by [[amputation]]), whereas sexual animals restore telomeres by extension during sexual reproduction or during embryogenesis like other sexual species. Homeostatic telomerase activity observed in both asexual and sexual animals is not sufficient to maintain telomere length, whereas the increased activity in regenerating asexuals is sufficient to renew telomere length... "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thomas C. J. Tan |author2=Ruman Rahman |author3=Farah Jaber-Hijazi |author4=Daniel A. Felix |author5=Chen Chen |author6=Edward J. Louis |author7=Aziz Aboobaker |last-author-amp=yes |title=Telomere maintenance and telomerase activity are differentially regulated in asexual and sexual worms |journal=PNAS |volume=109 |issue=9 |date=February 2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1118885109 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/02/22/1118885109.full.pdf+html |pages=4209–4214 |pmid=22371573 |pmc=3306686 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306010425/http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/02/22/1118885109.full.pdf+html |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifespan: For sexually reproducing planaria: "the lifespan of individual planarian can be as long as 3 years, likely due to the ability of neoblasts to constantly replace aging cells". Whereas for asexually reproducing planaria: "individual animals in clonal lines of some planarian species replicating by fission have been maintained for over 15 years". They do not live forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geochembio.com/biology/organisms/planarian/#dev_stages|title=''Schmidtea '', model planarian|website=www.geochembio.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230230657/http://www.geochembio.com/biology/organisms/planarian/#dev_stages|archivedate=2010-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts to engineer biological immortality in humans ==
Although the premise that biological aging can be halted or reversed by foreseeable technology remains controversial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Robin|title=The extreme arrogance of anti-aging medicine|journal=Biogerontology|date=April 2009|volume=10|issue=2|pages=223–228|doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9170-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10522-008-9170-6|accessdate=1 June 2013|pmid=18726707}}&lt;/ref&gt; research into developing possible therapeutic interventions is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rejuvenation Research|url=http://www.liebertpub.com/REJ|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the principal drivers of international collaboration in such research is the [[SENS Research Foundation]], a non-profit organization that advocates a number of what it claims are plausible research pathways that might lead to engineered [[negligible senescence]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Reimagined Research Strategy for Aging|url=http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research|publisher=SENS Research Foundation|accessdate=1 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527212514/http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research|archivedate=27 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://longevityreporter.org/blog/2016/8/8/the-renaissance-of-rejuvenation-biotechnology|title=The Renaissance of Rejuvenation Biotechnology|last=Aguiar|first=Sebastian|date=|work=Longevity Reporter|access-date=2018-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305063256/http://longevityreporter.org/blog/2016/8/8/the-renaissance-of-rejuvenation-biotechnology|archive-date=2018-03-05|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, scientists at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the Mayo Clinic employed genetic and pharmacological approaches to ablate pro-aging senescent cells, extending healthy lifespan of mice by over 25%.

In early 2017, Harvard scientists headed by biologist [[David Andrew Sinclair|David Sinclair]] announced they have tested a metabolic precursor that increases [[NAD+]] levels in mice and have successfully reversed the cellular aging process and can protect the DNA from future damage. "The old mouse and young mouse cells are indistinguishable", David was quoted. Human trials are to begin shortly in what the team expect is 6 months at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/03/harvard-scientists-pinpoint-critical-step-in-dna-repair-cellular-aging/|title=Harvard scientists pinpoint critical step in DNA repair, cellular aging|date=2017-03-23|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
To achieve the more limited goal of halting the increase in mortality rate with age, a solution must be found to the fact that any intervention to remove senescent cells that creates competition among cells will increase age-related mortality from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Paul |last2=Masel |first2=Joanna |title=Intercellular competition and the inevitability of multicellular aging |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=5 December 2017 |volume=114 |issue=49 |pages=12982–12987 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1618854114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future medicine, life extension and  "swallowing the doctor"==

Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to [[life extension#Nanotechnology|life extension]] through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical [[molecular machines]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Creatures 2''''' is the second game in the [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]] [[artificial life]] game series made by [[Creature Labs]], and the sequel to 1996 game ''[[Creatures (artificial life series)|Creatures]]''. It features three species: the cute, dependent [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Norns]], the cantankerous [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Grendel]]s and the industrious [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Ettins]]. The game tries to simulate life, and includes a complex two-dimensional ecology of plants, animals and insects, which provide the environment for the three main species to live and develop in.  The player interacts with the world using a hand-shaped cursor, and tries to encourage the creatures' development by manipulating various objects around the world, guiding the creatures using the cursor and encouraging the creatures to speak.

Many new gameplay features included in Creatures 2 not present in the original game include a new [[physics]] model and a global weather system, along with brand new applets and a world twice the size of the Creatures 1 world.

The [[executable]] file for the game was in fact an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for its scripting [[Programming language|language]], thus allowing users to make total conversions or derivative works from the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

== Gameplay ==
Like the other games in the series, Creatures 2 is mostly open-ended, with no predetermined goals, allowing the player to raise Norns at their own pace. In each new world, the player begins in the [[Incubator (egg)|incubator]] cavern area. The [[hatchery]], one of the game's in-built applets, allows the player to add Norn eggs to the world, which can be hatched via the incubator. Norns may also be downloaded from the internet and imported into to use in the game.

Once Norns reach [[adolescence]] at around an hour old, they are ready to breed, and female Norns will begin an [[oestrogen]] cycle. When Norns mate, there is a long kissing sound with a pop at the end – known as a kisspop. Like real life, not all mating results in a pregnancy. The Norn reproductive process can be monitored via the Breeder's Kit.

At the beginning, the player is only able to navigate a small area of Albia. As their Norns explore the world, however, more areas will be able to visited. If a Norn falls into water and is picked up, it cannot be placed in an unvisited area.

Like the previous game, every plant, animal and insect in Albia is a separate system called an autonomous agent, or just "agent" for short. Many user-created agents have been made, which can be injected into the world using the Injector Kit applet, which also includes an analysis page giving the opportunity  to check new objects for potentially harmful contents before injecting them.

Albia, the world in which Creatures 2 is set, is a vast disc-world filled with a wide variety of flora, ranging from the Cacti that inhabit the desert to the exclusive mushroom-like Gelsemium plant that can only be found in a single cavern. Albia is also home to a substantial amount of animal life, such as [[bee]]s which pollinate [[flower]]s and create [[honey]], and Zander fish, which provide a food source for creatures near the oceans. Scattered throughout the world are various seed launchers, which can be used to replenish stocks if any life-forms become extinct.

Albia also has four seasons: [[Spring (season)|Spring]], [[Summer]], [[Winter]] and [[Autumn]], and boasts its very own climate, with weather such as snow mainly occurring during the colder months, and rain mostly during the Spring. The game also has an on-screen [[thermometer]], allowing the player to monitor Albia's temperature at all times.

== Development ==
Creatures 2's release was widely anticipated. It is likely that around 450,000 copies of the original Creatures had been sold by the time the game was released, and a huge following had developed behind it. The "Early Adoption Program", a promotion where 250 copies of Creatures 2 were given away prior to its official release in September 1998, was scheduled to begin in July 1998, but was pushed back as the game was not close to release quality at the point at which the EAP was scheduled to start. In the end, most received their copies several weeks after the release date.

Upon release, the game suffered from numerous flaws, such as a deficient Norn genome that lead to a condition dubbed "One Hour Stupidity Syndrome (OHSS)", which caused Norns to forgot basic survival skills such as eating and sleeping. The task of creating the new Norn genome was given to Sandra Linkletter (Slink), who was also a member of the Creatures community. During development, many problems emerged, most likely due to disagreements between Slink and the Creatures 2 team. Slink later claimed that her design had been compromised by the geneticist brought on to finish her work, Eric Goodwin, and later accused Cyberlife of deriving their update from hers.

Cyberlife later released a patch with an improved genome after several weeks had passed. Several users also created improved Norn genomes, such as the Canny Norn genome created by Chris Double and Lis Morris.

The '''Daemonites''' are a [[fiction]]al [[List of extraterrestrials in fiction|alien race]] in the [[Wildstorm Universe]]. They were created by [[Jim Lee]] and first appeared in ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.s.]]'' #1 (August 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=34217 |title=Marz Shares His "Voodoo" Magic |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date= |accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=28539 |title=When Words Collide: 1285621082 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
Daemonites are reptilian aliens from the planet Daemon, who are capable of possessing [[host (biology)|host]] bodies. Daemonites need to possess a host to survive on planets with a climate different from Daemon, like Earth (though a deal with the [[D'rahn]] eliminated this weakness from all Daemonites that resided on Earth at the time). When possessing a host, the Daemonite has access to all abilities that host has. A Daemonite can change his host into his true, Daemonite form, but can only maintain this form for a short period of time.

Some Daemonites, particularly the more elite, are also avid shape-changers capable of taking on the physical form of whoever or whatever they see fit at will. Some of the stronger members of their race can also resume the semblance of inorganic substances e.i. metals, granules, liquids; in order to add to their own deadliness, even able to alternate while possessing a host. Albeit changing back rather quickly soon afterwards.

Daemonites can survive for millennia and are possibly even [[Immortality|immortal]]. They are capable of regenerating missing limbs and quickly recover from serious injuries able to heal from destroyed organs, critical injuries and heavy brain damage, though the healing capacity varies from Daemonite to Daemonite and few to most lack the capability to survive a destroyed head or brain. healing processes can be accelerated while within a host body as well.

Some Daemonites even have a capacity for chronokinesis, having taught it to Voodoo of the WildC.A.Ts during her recovery process.

Higher born Daemonite class' akin to Kherubim lords hold a plethora of new and exotic attributes open to them, This particular species genus are called Daemonite Royalty. This upper tier possess a number of traits that make them superior to their weaker kin such as complete bio-molecular physical control, hive mind collectives, multi-hosting and vast mental and physical energy manipulation. Four members of this group include [[Helspont]], Defile, Hightower and S'Ryn each possessing hosts of unique abilities all their own.

The true form of the Daemonites differs depending on the artist, but generally includes dark green skin, long sharp claws, sharp teeth, and a hunched posture.

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, which merges the Wildstorm universe, Daemonites take on a whole new look and feel while retaining many old aspects it shared in the Wildstorm imprint. For starters, The Daemonites have become a telepathic hive intelligence capable of not only reading and sharing thoughts between other Daemonites and their respective hosts. But are also avid mentalists capable of probing minds and having open mind to mind communications with other individuals, even being able to psionically track targets via their unique neural signal's.

Other proclivities include an enhancement of their Metamorphosis capabilities to enable the phasing through solid matter with ease, akin to a martian.

==History==
Millennia ago, the Daemonites discovered [[interstellar travel]] and started to conquer the universe. Their ability to possess other species gave them a distinct advantage over most species, allowing infiltration and survival in almost any environment. Their rise to power was unopposed until they encountered the [[Kherubim]]. The Kherubim were a noble race of nearly immortal warriors. Despite the Daemonites' ability to possess the Kherubim, the Kherubim's technology allowed them to detect possessed individuals. The war raged for millennia.

A Daemonite vessel fought a Kherubim vessel near Earth, thousands of years ago. Both spaceships were damaged and crashlanded on Earth. The Daemonites decided to conquer this world and use its population as host bodies, while the Kherubim wanted to defend humanity. The Daemonite-Kherubim War inspired many tales of gods, demons, angels and monsters. Most of the Daemonites organised themselves as the Cabal and focused on the goal of Daemonite Reunification: a return to Daemon. They were opposed by multiple heroes, such as [[Axel Brass]] and  the [[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]].

Unbeknownst to those stranded on Earth, the Kherubim won the war and imposed heavy [[war reparations|reparations]] on Daemon. Daemonite society went bankrupt trying to pay and many Daemonites migrated to prosperous Khera, but were confined to [[ghetto]]s.

When the Daemonites on Earth found out, many of them ceased their quest for Reunification. Some settled down, others became mercenaries and others again, like Lord Helspont, now focused on increasing their own power and wealth. Helspont finds a 'sleeper ship' of Daemonites and manages to recruit them to his cause. Most of these Daemonites are slain by human police officers.

Later, the Daemonite Lord Helspont found a Kheran World Shaper Engine on Earth and discovered that the Kherans were  sending Shaper Engines across the universe to land on planets and turn them into ideal habitats for Kherubim. He also discovered that one of these engines had created new races across the universe, including the humans and Daemonites.

===The New 52===
Since DC Comics' [[The New 52]] relaunch in 2011, the Daemonites have been featured in several series. Most notably, they play a central role in both the ''[[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]]'' and ''[[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]]'' ongoing series, both featuring title characters who originated in the Wildstorm Universe. The Daemonites have also been featured in the relaunched ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'', ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'', ''[[Demon Knights]]'' and ''[[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]]'' series. In ''Demon Knights'', they obliterate every incarnation of [[Camelot]] and attempt to slay Merlin to stop him creating them.&lt;ref&gt;''Demon Knights'' #1, #8, #0&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wild Storm===
With the coming of the [[DC Rebirth]] publishing, Wildstorm characters have now undergone extensive revamp, once again with characters such as the WildC.A.T.S and Stormwatch being relegated to their own separate continuum. In the new continuity written and illustrated by [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Jon Davis-Hunt]], The initial Daemonites appear on site at an old [[International Operations|Internal Operations]] safe house where a firefight ensued between two separate factions who have powerful ties to the world at large. They would encounter another familiar face in [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lucy Blaze]] who was dispatched by Stormwatch's ground division, who initially reacted with hostility to their presence. Said Daemonite commented that they were only observing, seeing that something new was going on and that Lucy should't interfere with it before fading away into the shadows.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wild Storm'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Little is known about Daemonite culture. The Daemonites on Earth are ruled by three Lords or Royalty as coined by some of them. Most Daemonites on Earth are aggressive and completely devoted to the cause of Reunification. A process in which all existent Daemonites throughout the universe congregate at central focal point where a Lord resides to begin conquest of native worlds. 

On Khera, the WildC.A.Ts encountered Daemonite civilians whose behaviour was very much like human behaviour. The Daemonites on Khera seemed to have a more [[tribe|tribal]] structure, but this could be a result of being confined to low-tech ghettos. After encountering peaceful Daemonites on Khera, the WildC.A.Ts have encountered several peaceful Daemonites on Earth as well.

The Daemonites on Khera showed WildC.A.Ts-member [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]], part Daemonite herself, rituals where Daemonites possessed other Daemonites. This ritual transferred memories, emotions and knowledge between Daemonites and forged a strong bond between Daemonites.

The strongest of Daemonites possess can grow into a host of special powers ranging to metamorphosis, structure merging, time manipulation, some psychic powers, etc. While the Daemonite Royalty come to withhold entirely unique powers and abilities all their own. Likewise, it is unknown if a Daemonite is either born into or becomes one

==Hierarchy==
While very little is known of the Daemonite social circle. There seem to be two main castes present within their species.
* Drone: standard bioluminecent or fully natural Daemon race, making up the brunt of their species army who serve the lords and royalty.
* Brute: Larger, stronger and vastly more ferocious. These Daemonites are the backbone of Daemons forces when it comes to closed quarters combat.
* Officer: A high Ranking Daemonite commander of the armed forces boasting unique special traits who answer directly to the higher caste of Daemonite Lords.
* Royalty: Mirroring the pantheon of Kheran society. Daemonite Royalty, often referred to as Lords, are the ruling power of their species. Shareholding in powers and ability far beyond the norm of their race.

==Technology==
Daemonites prefer to use their own natural abilities in battle, but their technology is very advanced. They have spaceships capable of interstellar flight. [[Nanotechnology]] allows them to create highly advanced weaponry in a short period of time. [[Mister Majestic]] discovered a Daemonite-built portal into the [[Bleed (Wildstorm)|Bleed]], allowing them to enter [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimensions]].

Daemonites on Earth often wear special ''stealth-suits'', hiding them from most forms of detection. Others wear ''flash-suits'', which are armoured and possess built-in weaponry.

==Notable Daemonites==
*Lord [[Helspont]], A powerful and much feared Daemonite Lord.
*Olympia Atreides, former member of the [[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]], first Daemonite trained as a Coda.
*Mr. White, Daemonite criminal and rare [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] 
*S'ryn, Daemonite officer and enemy of [[Backlash (Marc Slayton)|Backlash]]
*Hightower, Officer and Rival Lord of Helspont and Defile, deceased
*Lord Defile, A well known Daemonite royalty with vast psionic powers

'''Dead on arrival''' ('''DOA'''), also '''dead in the field''' and '''brought in dead''' ('''BID''') indicates that a patient was found to be already [[Clinical death|clinically dead]] upon the arrival of professional medical assistance, often in the form of [[first responder]]s such as [[emergency medical technician]]s, [[paramedic]]s, or [[police]].

In some jurisdictions, first responders must consult verbally with a [[physician]] before officially pronouncing a patient deceased, but once [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] is initiated, it must be continued until a physician can pronounce the patient dead.

==Medical DOA==
When presented with a patient, medical professionals are required to perform [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) unless specific conditions are met which allow them to pronounce the patient as deceased. In most places, these are examples of such criteria:
* Injuries not compatible with life. These include but are not necessarily limited to [[decapitation]] or other catastrophic brain trauma, [[incineration]], severed body, and injuries that do not permit effective administration of CPR. If a patient has sustained such injuries, it should be intuitively obvious that the patient is non-viable. 
* ''[[Rigor mortis]]'', indicating that the patient has been dead for at least a few hours. ''Rigor mortis'' can sometimes be difficult to determine, so it is often used reported along with other determining factors.
* Obvious [[Decomposition#Stages of decomposition|decomposition]].
* ''[[Livor mortis]]'' (lividity), indicating that the body has been pulseless and in the same position long enough for blood to sink and collect within the body, creating purplish discolorations at the lowest points of the body (with respect to [[gravity]]).
* [[Stillbirth]]. If it can be determined without a doubt that an infant died prior to birth, as indicated by skin blisters, an unusually soft head, and an extremely offensive odor, resuscitation should not be attempted. If there is even the slightest hope that the infant is viable, CPR should be initiated; some jurisdictions maintain that life-saving efforts should be attempted on all infants to assure parents that [[Futile care|all possible actions were performed to save their child, futile as the medical professionals may have known them to be]]. 
* Identification of valid [[do not resuscitate]] orders.

This list may not be a comprehensive picture of medical practice in all jurisdictions or conditions. For example, it may not represent the standard of care for patients with terminal diseases such as advanced cancer. In addition, jurisdictions such as [[Texas]] permit withdrawal of medical care from patients who are deemed unlikely to recover. {{further|Texas Futile Care Law}}

Regardless of the patient, a pronouncement of [[death]] must always be made with absolute certainty and only after it has been determined that the patient is not a candidate for resuscitation. This type of decision is rather sensitive and can be difficult to make.

Legal definitions of death vary from place to place; for example, irreversible brain-stem death, prolonged [[clinical death]],  etc.

==Colloquial use==
*When, as with computers, product complexity is high and diagnostics are involved, the medical metaphor is perhaps appropriate, as [[boot image control|complex diagnostics]] might be required to determine if the product "is really dead".
*In another context, "dead on arrival" may be used to describe an idea or product that is considered to be fundamentally flawed, and therefore viewed as an utter failure from the start.

Death – particularly the death of [[human]]s – has commonly been considered a [[sadness|sad]] or unpleasant occasion, due to the [[affection]] for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial [[human bonding|bonds]] with the deceased. Other concerns include [[death anxiety (psychology)|fear of death]], [[necrophobia]], [[anxiety]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], [[grief]], [[emotional pain]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[sympathy]], [[compassion]], [[solitude]], or [[saudade]]. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an [[afterlife]], and also hold the idea of [[Heaven|reward]] or [[Judgement (afterlife)|judgement]] and [[Hell|punishment for past sin]].

== Etymology ==
The word death comes from [[Old English]] ''dēaþ'', which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *''dauþuz'' (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *''dheu-'' meaning the "process, act, condition of dying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |title=Death |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013162848/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated terms ==
[[File:Leonardo Skeleton 1511.jpg|thumb|''Study of Skeletons'', c. 1510, by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
The concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death.  When a person has died, it is also said they have ''passed away'', ''passed on'', ''expired'', or are ''gone'', among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a ''corpse'', ''[[cadaver]]'', a ''body'', a ''set of remains'', and when all flesh has rotted away, a [[skeleton]]. The terms ''[[carrion]]'' and ''carcass'' can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals.  As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the [[participle]] form of "decease", as in ''the deceased''; another noun form is ''decedent''.  The ashes left after a [[cremation]] are sometimes referred to by the [[neologism]] ''cremains'', a [[portmanteau]] of "cremation" and "remains".

== Senescence ==
[[File:Dead magpie.jpg|thumb|alt=A dead magpie|A dead [[Eurasian magpie]]]]

[[Senescence]] refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick &amp; Moody, 2003).

Almost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as "senescence". Some organisms experience [[negligible senescence]], even exhibiting [[biological immortality]].

===Signs===
Signs of death or strong indications that a [[endotherm|warm-blooded animal]] is no longer alive are:
* [[Respiratory arrest]] (no [[breathing]])
* [[Cardiac arrest]] (no [[heart rate|pulse]])
* [[Brain death]] (no neuronal activity)
* {{lang|la|[[Pallor mortis]]}}, paleness which happens in the 15–120 minutes after death
* {{lang|la|[[Livor mortis]]}}, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
* {{lang|la|[[Algor mortis]]}}, the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
* {{lang|la|[[Rigor mortis]]}}, the limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin ''rigor'') and difficult to move or manipulate
* [[Decomposition]], the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.

For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality;%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated.] Book Review by Dr. Peter Fenwick  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518024043/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality%3B%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf |date=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf Facing the finality – Death and Adjustment Hypotheses] Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life. This general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicine.

It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1991 |last=Metcalf |first=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary{{clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see WP:CITE) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} In this context "death" describes merely the state where something has ceased, for example, life. Thus, the definition of "life" simultaneously defines death.

Historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "brain death" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.

The category of "brain death" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: "By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant "brain-dead" women)."&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=F.G. |title=Death and organ donation: back to the future |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616–620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&amp;nbsp;– irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&amp;nbsp;– has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].

Even by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.

===Legal===
{{See also|Legal death}}

The death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions.
A [[death certificate]] is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor, or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death.

===Misdiagnosed===
{{See also|Premature burial}}
[[File:Wiertz burial.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Wiertz]]'s painting of a man buried alive]]
There are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then "coming back to life", sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when [[embalming]] procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before [[burial]], ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the [[rectum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|pp=56,&amp;nbsp;71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in [[England]] and [[Wales]], although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of [[electric shock]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned [[nerve]]s to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an [[emergency department|emergency room]].&lt;ref name=Limmer&gt;{{cite book|title=Brady Emergency Care AHA |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-159390-9 |author=Limmer, Dan; O'Keefe, Michael F.; Bergeron, J.

As medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be re-evaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death (as happened when CPR and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death). The lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead. Therefore, the concept of information-theoretic death&lt;ref name="InfoDeath"&gt;{{cite web

There have been some scientific attempts to bring dead organisms back to life, but with limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/28/blood-swapping-reanimates-dead-dogs/ |title=Blood Swapping Reanimates Dead Dogs |newspaper=Fox News |date=28 June 2005 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014135940/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/28/blood-swapping-reanimates-dead-dogs.html |archivedate=14 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--to find this if it goes dead: original url http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,160903,00.html--&gt; In [[science fiction]] [[scenario]]s where such technology is readily available, real death is distinguished from reversible death.

The leading cause of human death in [[developing countries]] is [[infectious disease]]. The leading causes in [[developed countries]] are [[atherosclerosis]] ([[heart disease]] and [[stroke]]), [[cancer]], and other diseases related to [[obesity]] and [[aging]]. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging,&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; leading to various complications known as [[aging-associated diseases]]. These conditions cause loss of [[homeostasis]], leading to [[cardiac arrest]], causing loss of [[oxygen]] and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the [[Human brain|brain]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, approaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; With improved medical capability, dying has become [[respite care|a condition to be managed]].

Many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[physical fitness|physical activity]], but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human [[longevity]]. The [[evolution of aging|evolutionary cause of aging]] is, at best, only just beginning to be understood.

[[Hans Selye|Selye]] proposed a unified non-specific approach to many causes of death. He demonstrated that [[Stress (biology)|stress]] decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource, ''adaptation energy''. The animal dies when this resource is exhausted.&lt;ref name="SelyeAE2"&gt;Selye, H. (1938). Experimental evidence supporting the conception of "adaptation energy", Am. J. Physiol. 123 (1938), 758–765.&lt;/ref&gt; Selye assumed that  the adaptability is a finite supply, presented at birth. Later on, Goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored (up to a limit), as a capital reserve of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldstone B |year=1952 |title=The general practitioner and the general adaptation syndrome |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent works,  adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the "dominant path" in the model of adaptation. It is demonstrated that oscillations of well-being appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gorban A.N. |author2=Tyukina T.A. |author3=Smirnova E.V. |author4=Pokidysheva L.I. |year=2016 |title=Evolution of adaptation mechanisms: adaptation energy, stress, and oscillating death|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287251014 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.12.017 |pmid=26801872 |journal=J.

=== Autopsy ===
[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of an autopsy, by Rembrandt, entitled "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp"|An autopsy is portrayed in ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]
An [[autopsy]], also known as a ''postmortem examination'' or an ''obduction'', is a [[medical procedure]] that consists of a thorough [[Medical examination|examination]] of a human [[dead body|corpse]] to determine the cause and manner of a person's death and to evaluate any [[disease]] or [[injury]] that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].

Autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.

A "necropsy" is an older term for a postmortem examination, unregulated, and not always a medical procedure. In modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals.

== Life extension ==
{{Main|Life extension}}

Life extension refers to an increase in [[maximum life span|maximum]] or [[life expectancy|average lifespan]], especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the [[senescence|processes of aging]]. Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.

A United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816050024/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.

Researchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as "biomedical [[gerontologist]]s". They try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down, for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called "life extensionists" or "longevists". The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti-aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed.

== Reperfusion ==
"One of medicine's new frontiers: treating the dead", recognizes that cells that have been without oxygen for more than five minutes die,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter |date=1993 |isbn=978-1-4176-4352-3 |publisher=Turtleback Books |author=[[Sherwin Nuland|Nuland, Sherwin B.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; not from lack of oxygen, but rather when their oxygen supply is resumed. Therefore, practitioners of this approach, e.g., at the Resuscitation Science institute at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], "aim to reduce oxygen uptake, slow metabolism and adjust the blood chemistry for gradual and safe [[reperfusion therapy|reperfusion]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Adler, Jerry |date=7 May 2007 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18368186 |title=To Treat the Dead (The new science of resuscitation is changing the way doctors think about heart attacks – and death itself) |work=Newsweek |accessdate=3 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503021611/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18368186 |archivedate=3 May 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In society, the nature of death and humanity's [[Mortality salience|awareness of its own mortality]] has for millennia been a concern of the world's [[religious traditions]] and of [[philosophy|philosophical inquiry]]. This includes belief in [[resurrection]] or an [[afterlife]] (associated with [[Abrahamic religions]]), [[reincarnation]] or rebirth (associated with [[Dharmic religions]]), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as [[eternal oblivion]] (associated with [[atheism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fuKB8MPMdG4C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Handbook to the Afterlife |last1=Heath |first1=Pamela Rae |last2=Klimo |first2=Jon |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2010 |page=18 |isbn=978-1-55643-869-1 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemoration ceremonies after death may include various [[mourning]], [[funeral]] practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a ''corpse'' or ''body'', are usually [[burial|interred]] whole or [[cremated]], though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of [[Disposal of human corpses|mortuary disposal]]. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include ''[[rest in peace]]'', or its [[initialism]] RIP.

Death is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the [[afterlife]] and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body ([[reincarnation]]) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mullin|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mummification]] or [[embalming]] is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of [[Decomposition|decay]].

Legal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased [[estate (law)|estate]] and the issues of [[inheritance]] and in some countries, [[inheritance tax]]ation.

[[File:Grave stone2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gravestones in Japan|Gravestones in [[Kyoto]], Japan]]
[[Capital punishment]] is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as [[adultery]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]], the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|retentionist]] countries, [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[political corruption|corruption]] are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004030535/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |archivedate=4 October 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death in warfare and in [[suicide attack]] also have cultural links, and the ideas of [[dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]], [[mutiny]] punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and [[death notification]] are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]], but also further back in time with suicide bombings, [[kamikaze]] missions in [[World War II]] and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and [[martyrdom]] have had significant cultural impacts.

[[Suicide]] in general, and particularly [[euthanasia]], are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, ending a life with honor by [[seppuku]] was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. [[Death (personification)|Death is personified]] in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the [[Grim Reaper]], [[Azrael]], the [[Hindu]] God [[Yama]] and [[Father Time]].

In [[Brazil]], a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry.  Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nations |first=Marilyn K. |last2=Amaral |first2=Mara Lucia |title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=September 1999 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204–220 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a ''fait accompli'', with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.

== Consciousness ==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}

Much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called ''[[eternal oblivion]]''. Belief that the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] is preserved after physical death is described by the term ''[[afterlife]]''.

== In biology ==
[[File:Earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Earthworm]]s are a good example of soil-dwelling detritivores.]]
After death the remains of an organism become part of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Animals may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]]. [[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.

[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be decomposed fully. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}

Contemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.

=== Extinction ===
{{Main|Extinction}}
[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.W. Norton]] |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-393-31755-8 |pages=43–44 |chapter=Up to the Starting Line|title-link=Guns, Germs, and Steel }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of [[Taxon|taxa]], reducing [[biodiversity]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly "reappear" (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}

Inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.

Organisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are "immortal" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. In [[multicellular]] organisms (and also in [[multinucleate]] [[ciliates]]),&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Online Chapter 2: [http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780199657148/ The diversity of sexual cycles], p. 12. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Weismann barrier|Weismannist development]], that is, with a division of labor between mortal [[somatic cells|somatic (body) cells]] and "immortal" [[germ cell|germ (reproductive) cells]], death becomes an essential part of life, at least for the somatic line.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert |first=S.F. |year=2003 |title=Developmental biology |edition=7th |place=Sunderland, Mass |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=34–35 |isbn=978-0-87893-258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Volvox]]'' algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence include death of somatic line as a regular, genetically regulated part of its [[Biological life cycle|life history]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00497-010-0158-4 |pmid=21174128 |pmc=3098969 |title=Evolution of reproductive development in the volvocine algae |last=Hallmann |first=A. |journal=Sexual Plant Reproduction |date=June 2011 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=97–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
Death is an important subject of religious doctrine.

=== Buddhism ===
{{See also|Anussati#The ten recollections}}

In Buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|"deathless"]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain  enlightenment, therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not that for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.&lt;ref name="Blum 2004"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name="Blum 2004" /&gt;

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]
{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}
Death is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating.  Persons who come into contact with corpses are [[Tumah and taharah|ritually impure]].  There are a [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|variety of beliefs about the afterlife]] within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference of life over death.  This is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any [[Mitzvah|commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;Soloveitchik, Joseph B.  ''Halakhic Man.'' Qtd. in [https://elmad.pardes.org/2018/04/tazria-metzora-understanding-purity/ Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7095">'''Gerontechnology''' is an inter- and multidisciplinary academic and professional field combining [[gerontology]] and [[technology]]. Sustainability of an ageing society depends upon our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including [[assistive technology]] and [[inclusive design]], for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort and safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to [[health]], [[House|housing]], mobility, [[communication]], [[leisure]] and work of older people. Research outcomes form the basis for [[designers]], [[Construction worker|builders]], [[engineers]], [[manufacturers]], and those in the health professions ([[nursing]], [[medicine]], [[gerontology]], [[geriatrics]], [[environmental psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of  ages.

==Description==
Gerontechnology, which has also been called '''''gerotechnology''''' is considered an adjunct to the promotion of human [[health]] and [[well-being]]. It pertains to both human development and aging with the aim to compress [[morbidity]] and to increase [[vitality]] and [[quality of life]] throughout the [[life-span]]. It creates solutions to extend the working phase in society by maximizing the vital and productive years in the later years of life, which consequently reduces the [[cost of care]].

The overall framework of gerontechnology may be seen as a matrix of '''domains of human activity''': (1) health &amp; self-esteem, housing &amp; [[activities of daily living]], communication &amp; governance, mobility &amp; transport, work &amp; leisure, and (2) '''technology interventions''' or impact levels (enhancement &amp; satisfaction, prevention &amp; engagement, compensation &amp; assistance, care and care organisation). Underpinning all these elements are generic and applied [[evidence-based]] research. Such research supports the development of products and services.

Gerontechnology has much in common with other interdisciplinary domains, such as [[Assistive Technology]] (for the compensation &amp; assistance and the care support &amp; care organisation rows of the matrix), and [[Universal Design]] for the development of all products and services pertaining to gerontechnology.

==Gerontological design==
Gerontological design focuses on providing effective solutions to improve the way of life for aging people, through gerontological knowledge and [[design research]] methods to obtain a better understanding of individuals' preferences and requirements.

Gerontological design also refers specifically to the study and practice of building design methods that support elderly users in the built environment.  Some universities host professors, commonly in architecture or interior design departments, that specialize in the study and teaching of this design specialization.  Not only does this include the examination of building design characteristics that impact older adults' physiological well-being, but it can also include the investigation of building design characteristics that impact informational needs (i.e. finding one's way around in a space) or social interaction needs (Campbell, 2012).

Between 2008 and 2030, [[Singapore]] will witness an age profile shift in its population's history. In 2005, one in 12 residents was 65 years or older. By 2030, one in five residents will be 65 years or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Community Development, Committee on Ageing Issues |year=2006 |title=Report on the Ageing population.

By 2050, it is envisaged that the percentage could rise to nearly 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2004|title=Global population at a glance: 2002 and beyond.

Products and services relevant to the "silver industry" or the "mature market" increasingly abound in the marketplace. The demand for designers with a keen sense for the aging population's needs who employ gerontological design process knowledge concomitantly rises.

== Publications ==
An international academic journal with delayed open-access, '''''Gerontechnology''''' [http://www.gerontechjournal.net], is published by the '''International Society for Gerontechnology (ISG)''' [http://www.gerontechnology.org].

A comprehensive edited book "'''''Gerontechnology'''''" [http://www.springerpub.com/gerontechnology-9780826128881.html]has been published in 2016.

== Education ==
[[Image:SetupResearch.jpg|thumb]] The first ISG Masterclass [http://www.phe.bwk.tue.nl/ISGMasterClass/Main_mclass.htm] for PhD students in 2006 produced a scheme to support gerontechnological research.

{{Emotion}}

'''Guilt''' is a [[cognitive]] or an [[emotion]]al experience that occurs when a person [[belief|believes]] or [[understanding|realizes]]—accurately or not—that they have compromised their own standards of conduct or have violated a universal [[Morality|moral]] standard and bear significant [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for that violation.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare: {{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/gale-psychology-encyclopedia/guilt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502063427/http://www.enotes.com/gale-psychology-encyclopedia/guilt |archivedate=2 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }} "In psychology, what is "guilt," and what are the stages of guilt development?". eNotes.com. 2006. 31 December 2007: 'Let's begin with a working definition of guilt. Guilt is “an emotional state produced by thoughts that we have not lived up to our ideal self and could have done otherwise.”' Retrieved 2017-12-03.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Guilt is closely related to the concept of [[remorse]].

==Psychology==
Guilt is an important factor in perpetuating [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leslie J. Shapiro, LICSW |url=https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |title=Pathological guilt: A persistent yet overlooked treatment factor in obsessive-compulsive disorder — |publisher=Aacp.com |accessdate=27 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201040951/https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt and its associated causes, merits, and demerits are common themes in [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]]. Both in specialized and in ordinary language, guilt is an affective state in which one experiences conflict at having done something that one believes one should not have done (or conversely, having not done something one believes one should have done). It gives rise to a feeling which does not go away easily, driven by '[[conscience]]'. [[Sigmund Freud]] described this as the result of a struggle between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and the [[superego]]&amp;nbsp;– parental imprinting. Freud rejected the role of [[God]] as punisher in times of illness or rewarder in time of wellness. While removing one source of guilt from patients, he described another. This was the unconscious force within the individual that contributed to illness, Freud in fact coming to consider "the obstacle of an unconscious sense of guilt...as the most powerful of all obstacles to recovery."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 390–1&lt;/ref&gt; For his later explicator, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], guilt was the inevitable companion of the signifying subject who acknowledged normality in the form of [[the Symbolic]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey]], ''Shakespeare in Theory and Practice'' (2008) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] claims that "many people suffer all their lives from this oppressive feeling of guilt, the sense of not having lived up to their parents' expectations....no argument can overcome these guilt feelings, for they have their beginnings in life's earliest period, and from that they derive their intensity."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (1995) pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; This may be linked to what Les Parrott has called "the disease of false guilt....At the root of false guilt is the idea that what you ''feel'' must be true."&lt;ref&gt;Parrott, pp. 158–9&lt;/ref&gt; If you ''feel'' guilty, you must ''be'' guilty!

The philosopher [[Martin Buber]] underlined the difference between the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] notion of guilt, based on internal conflicts, and ''existential guilt'', based on actual harm done to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buber, M. |title=Guilt and guilt feelings |journal=Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114–29 |date=May 1957 |pmid=13441838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is often associated with [[anxiety]]. In [[mania]], according to [[Otto Fenichel]], the patient succeeds in applying to guilt "the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation...re-enacts being a person without guilt feelings."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) pp. 409–10&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychological research, guilt can be measured by using questionnaires, such as the [[Discrete emotion theory|Differential Emotions Scale]] (Izard's DES), or the [[Dutch Guilt Measurement Instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Van Laarhoven, H et al. | title=Comparison of attitudes of guilt and forgiveness in cancer patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients in a palliative care setting |journal=Cancer Nursing |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=483-492 |date=November–December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defenses===
Defenses against feeling guilt can become an overriding aspect of one's personality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]] ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;  The methods that can be used to avoid guilt are multiple.  They include:
#[[Psychological repression|Repression]], usually used by the [[superego]] and ego against instinctive impulses, but on occasion employed against the superego/conscience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11)p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;  If the defence fails, then (in a return of the repressed) one may begin to feel guilty years later for actions lightly committed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Psychological projection|Projection]] is another defensive tool with wide applications. It may take the form of [[blaming the victim]]: The victim of someone else's accident or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being that the victim may be at fault for having attracted the other person's hostility.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pursuit of Health'', June Bingham &amp; Norman Tamarkin, M.D., Walker Press&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, not the guilt, but the condemning agency itself, may be projected onto other people, in the hope that they will look upon one's deeds more favorably than one's own conscience  (a process that verges on [[Ideas of reference and delusions of reference|ideas of reference]]).&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165 and p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;
#Sharing a feeling of guilt, and thereby being less alone with it, is a motive force in both art and joke-telling; while it is also possible to "borrow" a sense of guilt from someone who is seen as in the wrong, and thereby assuage one's own.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165-6 and p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
#Self-harm may be used as an alternative to compensating the object of one's transgression – perhaps in the form of not allowing oneself to enjoy opportunities open to one, or benefits due, as a result of uncompensated guilt feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelissen | first1 = R.

=== Behavioral responses ===
Feelings of guilt can prompt subsequent virtuous behavior. People who feel guilty may be more likely to exercise restraint,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guilty pleasures and grim necessities: Affective attitudes in dilemmas of self-control.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/80/2/206/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; avoid self-indulgence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The effects of nonconsciously priming emotion concepts on behavior.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/93/6/927/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibit less prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Dynamic Model of Guilt Implications for Motivation and Self-Regulation in the Context of Prejudice|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2007-06-01|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 17576266|pages = 524–530|volume = 18|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01933.x|language = en|first = David M.|last = Amodio|first2 = Patricia G.|last2 = Devine|first3 = Eddie|last3 = Harmon-Jones|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161205085614/http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|archivedate = 5 December 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt appears to prompt reparatory behaviors to alleviate the negative emotions that it engenders. People appear to engage in targeted and specific reparatory behaviors toward the persons they wronged or offended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Guilty Feelings, Targeted Actions|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/38/5/607|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date = 2012-05-01|issn = 0146-1672|pmid = 22337764|pages = 607–618|volume = 38|issue = 5|doi = 10.1177/0146167211435796|language = en|first = Cynthia E.|last = Cryder|first2 = Stephen|last2 = Springer|first3 = Carey K.|last3 = Morewedge|pmc=4886498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of guilt in psychopaths===
Individuals high in [[psychopathy]] lack any true sense of guilt or [[remorse]] for harm they may have caused others. Instead, they [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] their behavior, [[blame]] someone else, or [[Denial|deny]] it outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Birket-Smith, Morten |author2=Millon, Theodore |author3=Simonsen, Erik |author4=Davis, Roger E. |chapter=11. Psychopathy and the Five-Factor Model of Personality, Widiger and Lynam |title=Psychopathy: Antisocial, Criminal, and Violent Behavior |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=173–7 |isbn=1-57230-864-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;!--Check Edition--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A person with psychopathy has a tendency to be harmful to his or herself and to others. They have little ability to plan ahead for the future. An individual with psychopathy will never find themselves at fault because they will do whatever it takes to benefit themselves without reservation. A person that does not feel guilt or remorse would have no reason to find themselves at fault for something that they did with the intention of hurting another person. To a person high in psychopathy, their actions can always be rationalized to be the fault of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neumann |first=Craig S. |author2=Kosson, David S. |author3=Forth, Adelle E. |author4=Hare, Robert D. |title=Factor structure of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV) in adolescent females|journal=Psychological Assessment|year=2013|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.2.142 |volume=18 |pages=142–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by psychologists as part of a lack of moral reasoning (in comparison with the majority of humans), an inability to evaluate situations in a moral framework, and an inability to develop emotional bonds with other people due to a lack of [[empathy]].

===Causes===

====Evolutionary theories====
Some evolutionary psychologists theorize that guilt and [[shame]] helped maintain beneficial relationships, such as [[reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pallanti, S., Quercioli, L. |title=Shame and psychopathology |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=28–43 |date=August 2000 |pmid=18192938}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person feels guilty when he harms another, or even fails to reciprocate kindness, he is more likely not to harm others or become too selfish. In this way, he reduces the chances of retaliation by members of his tribe, and thereby increases his survival prospects, and those of the tribe or group. As with any other emotion, guilt can be [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] to control or influence others. As highly social animals living in large, relatively stable groups, humans need ways to deal with conflicts and events in which they inadvertently or purposefully harm others. If someone causes harm to another, and then feels guilt and demonstrates regret and sorrow, the person harmed is likely to forgive. Thus, guilt makes it possible to forgive, and helps hold the social group together.

====Social psychology theories====
When we see another person suffering, it can also cause us pain. This constitutes our powerful system of empathy, which leads to our thinking that we should do something to relieve the suffering of others. If we cannot help another, or fail in our efforts, we experience feelings of guilt. From the perspective of group selection, groups that are made up of a high percentage of co-operators outdo groups with a low percentage of co-operators in between-group competition. People who are more prone to high levels of empathy-based guilt may be likely to suffer from anxiety and depression; however, they are also more likely to cooperate and behave altruistically. This suggests that guilt-proneness may not always be beneficial at the level of the individual, or within-group competition, but highly beneficial in between-group competition.{{Citation needed|reason=cf. Dearing, et al. in Addictive Behaviors Vol 30.7 for conflicting research.|date=December 2008}}

====Other theories====
Another common notion is that guilt is assigned by social processes, such as a [[jury trial]] (i. e., that it is a strictly legal concept). Thus, the ruling of a jury that [[O. J. Simpson]] or [[Julius Rosenberg]] was "guilty" or "not innocent" is taken as an actual judgment by the whole society that they must act as if they were so. By corollary, the ruling that such a person is "not guilty" may not be so taken, due to the asymmetry in the assumption that one is [[Presumption of innocence|assumed innocent until proven guilty]], and prefers to take the [[risk]] of freeing a guilty party over convicting innocents. Still others—often, but not always, theists of one type or another—believe that the origin of guilt comes from violating universal principles of right and wrong. In most instances, people who believe this also acknowledge that even though there is proper guilt from doing 'wrong' instead of doing 'right', people endure all sorts of guilty feelings which do not stem from violating universal moral principles.

==Collective guilt==

{{main|Collective responsibility}}
Collective guilt (or group guilt) is the unpleasant and often emotional reaction that results among a group of individuals when it is perceived that the group illegitimately harmed members of another group. It is often the result of “sharing a social identity with others whose actions represent a threat to the positivity of that identity.” For an individual to experience collective guilt, he must identify himself as a part of the in-group. “This produces a perceptual shift from thinking of oneself in terms of ‘I’ and ‘me’ to ‘us’ or ‘we’.”&lt;ref name="Collective"&gt;{{cite book |last=Branscombe |first=Nyla, R. |author2=Bertjan Doosje |year=2004
|title=Collective Guilt: International Perspectives |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-52083-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Traditional [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]], [[Korean society]] and [[Chinese culture]]&lt;ref&gt;Bill Brugger, ''China, Liberation and Transformation'' (1981) pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes said to be "[[shame]]-based" rather than "guilt-based", in that the social consequences of "getting caught" are seen as more important than the individual feelings or experiences of the agent (see the work of [[Ruth Benedict]]). The same has been said of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek society]], a culture where, in [[Bruno Snell]]'s words, if "honour is destroyed the moral existence of the loser collapses."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. I. Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'' (1967) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

This may lead to more of a focus on [[etiquette]] than on [[ethics]] as understood in Western civilization, leading some{{who|date=April 2012}} in Western civilizations to question why the word ''[[ethos]]'' was adapted from [[Ancient Greek]] with such vast differences in cultural norms. [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] inherit most notions of guilt from [[Judaism]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, [[Ancient Persia|Persia]]n, and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ideas, mostly as interpreted through [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who adapted [[Plato]]'s ideas to Christianity. The [[Latin]] word for guilt is ''culpa'', a word sometimes seen in law literature, for instance in ''mea culpa'' meaning "my fault (guilt)".

Guilt, from [[Old English|O.E.]] ''gylt'' "crime, sin, fault, fine, debt", derived from O.E. ''gieldan'' "to pay for, debt". The mistaken use for "sense of guilt" is first recorded in 1690. "Guilt by association" is first recorded in 1941. "Guilty" is from O.E. ''gyltig'', from ''gylt''.

===In literature===
Guilt is a main theme in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', Tennessee Williams' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" and "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]", and many other works of literature. In Sartre's ''[[The Flies]]'', the Furies (in the form of flies) represent the morbid, strangling forces of neurotic guilt which bind us to authoritarian and totalitarian power.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fagles trans., ''The Oresteia'' (Penguin 1981) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is a major theme in many works by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and is an almost universal concern of novelists who explore inner [[life]] and [[secret]]s.

===In the Christian Bible===
Guilt in the Christian [[Bible]] is not merely an emotional state but is a legal state of deserving punishment. The [[Hebrew Bible]] does not have a unique word for guilt, but uses a single word to signify: "sin, the guilt of it, the punishment due unto it, and a sacrifice for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Owen, J. |chapter=Chapter 8|title=The Doctrine of Justification by Faith |publisher=Johnstone and Hunter |location=London |year=1850 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek [[New Testament]] uses a word for guilt that means "standing exposed to judgment for sin" (e. g., [[Romans 3]]:19). In what Christians call the "[[Old Testament]]", Christians believe the Bible teaches that, through sacrifice, one's sins can be forgiven (Judaism categorically rejects this idea, holding that forgiveness of sin is exclusively through repentance, and the role of sacrifices was for atonement of sins committed by accident or ignorance [http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/11-08-02.html]). The New Testament says that this forgiveness is given as written in 1 Corinthians 15:3–4: "3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, for that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures." Some believe that the Old and New Testaments have differing opinions on the expiation of guilt because the Old Testaments were subject to the Age of Law and the New Testaments replace the Age of Law with the now current Age of Grace. However, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament salvation was granted based on God's grace and forgiveness (Gen 6:8; 19:19; Exo 33:12–17; 34:6–7). Animal sacrifices were only a symbol of the future sacrifice of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (Heb 10:1–4; 9–12). The whole world is guilty before God for abandoning him and his ways (Rom 3:19). In Jesus Christ, God took upon himself the sins of the world and died on the cross to pay our debt (Rom 6:23). Those who repent and accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins, will be redeemed by God and thus not guilty before him. They will be granted eternal life which will take effect when Jesus comes the second time (1 Thess 4:13–18). In contrast to surrounding nations which addressed their guilt with human sacrifice, the Israeli authors of the Bible called that an abomination (1 Kings 11:7, Jer 32:35). The Bible agrees with pagan cultures that guilt creates a cost that someone must pay (Heb 9:22). (This assumption was expressed in the previous section, "Defences": "Guilty people punish themselves if they have no opportunity to compensate the transgression that caused them to feel guilty. It was found that self-punishment did not occur if people had an opportunity to compensate the victim of their transgression.") But unlike pagan deities who demanded it be paid by humans, God, according to the Bible, loved us enough to pay it Himself, as a good father would, while calling us His "children" and calling Himself our "father" (Mat 5:45).

'''Harald Olav Aabrekk''' (born 22 February 1956) is a Norwegian [[association football|football]] coach and a former player. He played for [[Sogndal Fotball|Sogndal]] and [[SK Brann|Brann]] in the [[Tippeligaen]], Norway's top professional football league. He has been head coach of Sogndal, [[Tromsø IL|Tromsø]], Brann, [[FK Haugesund|Haugesund]], [[Vålerenga Fotball|Vålerenga]] and [[Aalesunds FK|Aalesund]],  and has also served as an assistant coach for the [[Norway national football team|Norwegian national football team]].

==Playing career==
Aabrekk made his debut for Sogndal in 1974 in the [[Norwegian Second Division]] (the third tier of Norwegian football).&lt;ref name="Sogndal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Alaget/Spelarstall/Spelarinfo/tabid/620/person/504/mid/1437/Default.aspx |title=Harald Aabrekk – Statistikk Sogndal |publisher=[[Sogndal Fotball]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=8 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Klubben/Historia/5HaraldAabrekkogstartenpå90talet/tabid/489/Default.aspx |title=90-talet og Hardal Aabrekk |publisher=Sogndal Fotball |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208033129/http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Klubben/Historia/5HaraldAabrekkogstartenp%C3%A590talet/tabid/489/Default.aspx |archive-date=8 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for a short spell at SK Brann, where he played a match in the [[Tippeligaen]] (the top division) in [[1978 Norwegian First Division|1978]],&lt;ref name="Brann"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brann.no/historie/spillerdatabase/spillerarkiv/harald-aabrekk/ |title=Statistics; Brann |publisher=[[SK Brann]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he played for Sogndal throughout his career and was a major contributor to their promotion to the [[Norwegian First Division]] in 1981. He scored Sogndal's first goal in that division, against [[Molde FK|Molde]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"/&gt; He played a total of 133 league games from 1973 to 1982, including 22 matches in the [[1982 Norwegian First Division|First Division in 1982]].&lt;ref name="Sogndal"/&gt;

==Coaching career==
Aabrekk started his coaching career in his home county, [[Sogn og Fjordane]], at lower-league clubs Eid, Sandane, and [[Stryn TIL|Stryn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-blir-ny-sogndal-trener/ |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk blir ny Sogndal-trener |publisher=SK Brann |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801042447/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-blir-ny-sogndal-trener/ |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Nyheter/Aktuelt/tabid/486/smid/1092/ArticleID/10197/reftab/360/t/Harald-Aabrekk-er-tilbake/Default.aspx |language=Norwegian |title=Harald Aabrekk er tilbake |publisher=Sogndal Fotball |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming head coach of Sogndal. In 1990, his first season with them, Sogndal was promoted to the Tippeligaen in spite of a 5–0 loss against [[Bryne FK|Bryne]] in their first home match.&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"/&gt; He then served as head coach of Tromsø in the Tippeligaen from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref name="redningsmann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/incoming/article115043.ece |title=Trist redningsmann |first=Roy |last=Ellingsen |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=Norwegian |date=7 August 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917153008/http://fotball.bt.no/incoming/article115043.ece |archivedate=17 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, during a match against [[FK Bodø/Glimt|Bodø/Glimt]], Aabrekk tried to stall for time by acting as if he were injured after he was run down by Bodø/Glimt's physiotherapist Truls Karlsen. Although uninjured, he was taken by ambulance to hospital.&lt;ref name="hospital"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2006/11/04/481856.html |language=Norwegian |title=Fotballens største skuespillere |work=[[Dagbladet]] |first=Sigve |last=Kvamme |date=4 November 2006 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Verdens Gang]]'', he excused his behavior by saying, "I felt I was lying on the ground a bit too long, and I did not dare to get up so I stayed on the ground. I lay there and was thinking, 'What's going on?' It was not planned, and it was definitely not very smart. I would rather call it a blackout." This episode, according to the Norwegian newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'', was the third worst case of acting in the history of football.&lt;ref name="hospital"/&gt;

Aabrekk later worked for the [[Football Association of Norway]] as a coordinator for youth development in [[Western Norway]]. He also served as [[Nils Johan Semb]]'s assistant coach for the [[Norway national under-21 football team|Norwegian under-21 team]] from 1992 to 1998, and when Semb succeeded [[Egil Olsen]] as head coach of the [[Norway national football team|Norwegian national team]] in 1998, Aabrekk became assistant coach of the national senior team.&lt;ref name="redningsmann"/&gt; At the same time, he worked as [[Kjell Tennfjord]]'s assistant in Brann, and in the summer of 1998 he became their head coach.&lt;ref name="tilbake"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-tilbake-i-brann/ |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk tilbake i Brann |publisher=SK Brann |date= |accessdate=8 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222190913/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-tilbake-i-brann/ |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After leading Brann to the finals of the [[1999 Norwegian Football Cup|1999 Norwegian Cup]], where they lost 2–0 against [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/1999/10/31/181874.html |language=Norwegian |title=Uten Aabrekk slokner Brann |work=Dagbladet |date=31 October 1999 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he received a one-year leave of absence to work full-time as assistant coach of the national team during their preparations for the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] football championship. He resigned from his job at Brann without returning,&lt;ref name="tilbake"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aktuell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2007/11/25/519211.html |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk er aktuell for Brann |work=Dagbladet |first=Stian |last=Haraldsen |date=25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Brann had already hired [[Teitur Thordarson]] as their head coach and offered Aabrekk a position in their youth department, a job Brann claimed it was impossible to combine with the position of assistant coach of the national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/norsk/artikkel.php?artid=3088968 |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk slutter i Brann |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |date=21 December 2000 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Aabrekk joined Sogndal as Torbjørn Glomnes's assistant coach&lt;ref name="redningsmann"/&gt; and saved the team from [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]].&lt;ref name="tidenes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article215924.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Derfor er Aabrekk tidenes Sogndal-trener |work=Bergens Tidende |first=Mads |last=Bøyum |date=27 November 2011 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222130219/http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article215924.ece |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September 2002 Haugesund announced that Aabrekk would join them as head coach on 1 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/artikkel.php?artid=1491118 |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk tar over Haugesund |work=Verdens Gang |date=17 September 2002 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a match against [[IK Start|Start]] on 19 October 2003, Aabrekk told referee Bjørn Hansen that he was "bought and paid for" twice after Aabrekk was dismissed from the bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/artikkel.php?artid=81222 |language=Norwegian |title= Sa dommeren var kjøpt og betalt |work=Verdens Gang |first=Dag |last=Langholm |date=20 October 2003 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was at Haugesund until the end of the 2005 season,&lt;ref name="redningsmann"/&gt; when he joined [[Vålerenga Fotball|Vålerenga]]'s coaching staff along with Egil Olsen and [[Petter Myhre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siste.no/fotball/eliteserien/article1874056.ece |language=Norwegian |title=VIF forsterker trenerteamet |work=[[Avisenes Nyhetsbyrå]] |publisher=siste.no |date=18 December 2005 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July 2007 Myhre resigned as head coach of Vålerenga and Aabrekk was appointed head coach as caretaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.aftenposten.no/eliteserien/article86380.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Helt og holdent mitt valg |work=[[Aftenposten]] |first=Helle |last=Skjervold |first2=Øyvind |last2=Nordli |date=27 July 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307132445/http://fotball.aftenposten.no/eliteserien/article86380.ece |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following two wins and a draw in the next three matches, Vålerenga gave him the job until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/norsk/artikkel.php?artid=194855 |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk fortsetter som VIF-trener |work=Verdens Gang |date=14 August 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Aabrekk was hired by Brann as a scout.&lt;ref name="tilbake"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv2.no/sport/fotball/tippeligaen/aabrekk-blir-brannspeider-1751146.html |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk blir Brann-speider |work=[[TV 2 (Norway)]] |first=Sturla |last=Johannessen |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halfway through the season, the club wanted Aabrekk and the assistant coach, Espen Steffensen, to switch jobs. Steffensen did not accept this and was fired, and Aabrekk became the new assistant coach of Brann,&lt;ref name="redningsmann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2008/08/07/542882.html |language=Norwegian |title=Mjelde-assistent sparket i Brann |work=Dagbladet |first=Sigve |last=Kvamme |date=7 August 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the wishes of head coach [[Mons Ivar Mjelde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article115097.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Dette er tredd ned over hodet på meg |work=Bergens Tidende |date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922160549/http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article115097.ece |archivedate=22 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Brann's bad performances and local press criticism of the lack of cooperation between Mjelde and Aabrekk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2008/08/28/545015.html |language=Norwegian |title=Fortjener ikke å flytte kjegler for Aabrekk |work=Dagbladet |first=Sigve |last=Kvamme |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914180917/http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2008/08/28/545015.html |archive-date=14 September 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mjelde announced on 7 October 2008 that he would resign as head coach at the end of the season. At the same time, the club announced that Aabrekk would return immediately to his job as scout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article119843.ece |title=Mjelde slutter i Brann |work=Bergens Tidende |language=Norwegian |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624022045/http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article119843.ece |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a position he kept until the contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article149156.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk ferdig i Brann |work=Bergens Tidende |first=Silje |last=Dyregrov |date=31 August 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903121621/http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article149156.ece |archivedate=3 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aabrekk was then hired as head coach of his old club, Sogndal from 1 January 2010, succeeding Karl Oskar Emberland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/norsk/1-divisjon/artikkel.php?artid=573924 |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk ansatt som Sogndal-trener |work=Verdens Gang |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season there, the team won promotion to the Tippeligaen, and in the next they avoided relegation. Following the 2011 season, Aabrekk retired. In his last match, he was named "Best Sogndal coach ever".&lt;ref name="tidenes"/&gt;

Aabrekk was hired as manager for Aalesunds FK before the 2015 season, but sacked four matches into the season, when his club was last in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.smp.no/100Sport/fotball/eliteserien/article527177.snd|title = Harald Aabrekk sparket som Aalesund-trener|date = 28 April 2015|accessdate = 28 April 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30218">'''Homochirality''' is a uniformity of [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], or handedness. Objects are ''chiral'' when they cannot be superposed on their mirror images. For example, the left and right hands of a human are approximately mirror images of each other but are not their own mirror images, so they are ''chiral''. In [[biology]], 19 of the 20 natural [[amino acid]]s are homochiral, being &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (left-handed), while [[sugar]]s are &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (right-handed).&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson, Lehninger et al |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homochirality'' can also refer to ''enantiomerically pure'' substances in which all the constituents are the same [[enantiomer]] (a right-handed or left-handed version of an atom or molecule), but some sources discourage this use of the term.

It is unclear whether homochirality has a purpose, however, it appears to be a form of information storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=James D.|title=A new definition of life|journal=Chirality|date=March 2009|volume=21|issue=3|pages=354–358|doi=10.1002/chir.20590|pmid=18571800}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suggestion is that it reduces [[entropy]] barriers in the formation of large organized molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Julian|first1=Ryan R.|last2=Myung|first2=Sunnie|last3=Clemmer|first3=David E.|title=Do Homochiral Aggregates Have an Entropic Advantage?|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=January 2005|volume=109|issue=1|pages=440–444|doi=10.1021/jp046478x|pmid=16851034}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been experimentally verified that amino acids form large aggregates in larger abundance from [[enantiopure]] substrates than from [[racemic]] ones.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It is not clear whether homochirality emerged before or after life, and many mechanisms for its origin have been proposed.&lt;ref name=jafarpour2017 /&gt; Some of these models propose three distinct steps: ''mirror-symmetry breaking'' creates a minute enantiomeric imbalance, ''chiral amplification'' builds on this imbalance, and ''chiral transmission'' is the transfer of chirality from one set of molecules to another.

==In biology==

Amino acids are the building blocks of [[peptide]]s and [[enzyme]]s while sugar-peptide chains are the backbone of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Peptides &amp; Proteins|url=https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/protein2.htm|website=Natural Products|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lam|first1=Eric|chapter=Nucleic acids and proteins|editor-last1=Dey|editor-first1=P.M.|editor-last2=Harborne|editor-first2=J.B.|title=Plant Biochemistry.|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080525723|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological organisms, amino acids appear almost exclusively in the left-handed form (&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids) and sugars in the right-handed form (R-sugars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zubay |first1=Geoffrey |title=Origins of Life: On Earth and in the Cosmos |date=2000 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780080497617 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=August 2018}} Since the enzymes catalyze reactions, they enforce homochirality on a great variety of other chemicals, including [[hormone]]s, toxins, fragrances and food flavors.&lt;ref name=Seckbach&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seckbach|first1=edited by Joseph|title=Genesis - in the beginning : precursors of life, chemical models and early biological evolution|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789400729407}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|493&amp;ndash;494}} [[Glycine]] is achiral, as are some other non-[[proteinogenic]] amino acids are either achiral (such as [[dimethylglycine]]) or of the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomeric form.

Biological organisms easily discriminate between molecules with different chiralities. This can affect physiological reactions such as smell and taste. [[Carvone]], a [[terpenoid]] found in [[essential oil]]s, smells like mint in its L-form and [[caraway]] in its R-form.&lt;ref name=Seckbach/&gt;{{rp|494}}{{verify source|date=August 2018}} [[Limonene]] tastes like lemons when right-handed and oranges when left-handed.&lt;ref name=Hazen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|author-link=Robert Hazen|title=Genesis : the scientific quest for life's origins|date=2007|publisher=Joseph Henry|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309103107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}

Homochirality also affects the response to drugs. [[Thalidomide]], in its left-handed form, cures [[morning sickness]]; in its right-handed form, it causes birth defects.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;{{rp|168}} Unfortunately, even if a pure left-handed version is administered, some of it can convert to the right-handed form in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Silas|title=Chiral Toxicology: It's the Same Thing...

Chiral preferences can also be found at a macroscopic level. Snail shells can be right-turning or left-turning helices, but one  form or the other is strongly preferred in a given species.

==Origins==
===Symmetry breaking===
Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystal]]s, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis.&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, chirality would be selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Clark (author) |date=July–August 1999 |title=Polarized Starlight and the Handedness of Life |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=87 |issue=4 |page=336 |bibcode=1999AmSci..87..336C |doi=10.1511/1999.4.336 |issn=0003-0996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[enantiomeric excess]] can be amplified into a large one by [[Autocatalysis#Asymmetric autocatalysis|asymmetric autocatalysis]], such as in the [[Soai reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shibata |first1=Takanori |last2=Morioka |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Hayase |first3=Tadakatsu |last4=Choji |first4=Kaori |last5=Soai |first5=Kenso |display-authors=3 |date=17 January 1996 |title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=471–472 |doi=10.1021/ja953066g |issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other.&lt;ref name="Soai2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soai |first1=Kenso |last2=Sato |first2=Itaru |last3=Shibata |first3=Takanori |year=2001 |title=Asymmetric autocatalysis and the origin of chiral homogeneity in organic compounds |journal=The Chemical Record |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=321–332 |doi=10.1002/tcr.1017 |issn=1528-0691 |pmid=11893072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One supposition is that the discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the [[Murchison meteorite]] supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence for the existence of [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] originating from [[Mie scattering]] on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an [[enantiomeric excess]] within chiral material in space.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich/&gt;{{rp|123&amp;ndash;124}} Interstellar and near-stellar magnetic fields can align dust particles in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Helman |first=Daniel S |date=6 July 2018 |title=Galactic Distribution of Chirality Sources of Organic Molecules |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=151 |pages=595–602 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.07.008 |issn=0094-5765|bibcode=2018AcAau.151..595H |arxiv=1612.06720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see [[Parity (physics)|Parity violation]]) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules. Homochirality may also result from [[spontaneous absolute asymmetric synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel/courses/569/Essays_Fall2006/files/Rajan.pdf|title=How did protein amino acids get left-handed while sugars got right-handed?|first=Aruna|last=Rajan|publisher=Term Paper for Physics 569*|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soai_interview&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Highlights in Chemical Science |year= 2008 |issue= 5 |url= http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2008/05/Kenso_Soai_interview.asp |title= Interview: In the beginning... |accessdate=June 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that homochirality is simply a result of the natural autoamplification process of life—that either the formation of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ermann |first1=L |title=Homochirality: the key to unlocking the origin of life? |journal=Applied Theoretical Biology |date=2013 |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=21–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cause of chirality consensus | author= Jaakkola, S., Sharma, V. and Annila, A.| journal = Curr.

===Amplification===
====Theory====
[[File:Frank's model phase portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Phase portrait of Frank's model: starting from almost everywhere in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; plane (except &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; = &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; line), the system approaches to one of the homochiral states]]
In 1953, [[Frederick Charles Frank|Charles Frank]] proposed a model to demonstrate that homochirality is a consequence of [[autocatalysis]].&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomers of a chiral molecule are autocatalytically produced from an achiral molecule A

:A + &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;,{{pad}}A + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;

while suppressing each other through a reaction that he called ''mutual antagonism''

:&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → ∅.
In this model the racemic state is unstable in the sense that the slightest enantiomeric excess will be amplified to a completely homochiral state. This can be shown by computing the reaction rates from the [[law of mass action]]:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d[\ce L]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce L] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]}\\
\frac{d[\ce D]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce D] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for the autocatalytic reactions, &lt;math&gt;k_d&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for mutual antagonism reaction, and the concentration of A is kept constant for simplicity. By defining the enantiomeric excess &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math chem&gt;\Phi = \frac{[\ce D] - [\ce L]}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]},&lt;/math&gt;
we can compute the rate of change of enatiomeric excess using [[chain rule]] from the rate of change of the concentrations of enantiomeres &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.
:&lt;math chem&gt;
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = \left(\frac{2k_d \ce{[L] [D]}}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]}\right)\Phi.
&lt;/math&gt;
Linear stability analysis of this equation shows that the racemic state &lt;math&gt;\Phi = 0&lt;/math&gt; is unstable. Starting from [[almost everywhere]] in the concentration space, the system evolves to a homochiral state.

It is generally understood that autocatalysis alone does not yield to homochirality, and the presence of the mutually antagonistic relationship between the two enantiomers is necessary for the instability of the racemic mixture. However, recent studies show that homochirality could be achieved from autocatalysis in the absence of the mutually antagonistic relationship, but the underlying mechanism for symmetry-breaking is different.&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Experiments====
There are several laboratory experiments that demonstrate how a small amount of one enantiomer at the start of a reaction can lead to a large excess of a single enantiomer as the product. For example, the Soai reaction is [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]]. If the reaction is started with some of one of the product enantiomers already present, the product acts as an [[Enantioselective synthesis|enantioselective]] catalyst for production of more of that same enantiomer.&lt;ref name=shibata&gt;{{cite journal|title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol|author1=Takanori Shibata |author2=Hiroshi Morioka |author3=Tadakatsu Hayase |author4=Kaori Choji |author5=Kenso Soai | journal = [[J.

Soc.]] | year=1996| volume= 118 | issue=2| pages=471–472 | doi=10.1021/ja953066g}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial presence of just 0.2 [[Equivalent (chemistry)|equivalent]] one enantiomer can lead to up to 93% [[enantiomeric excess]] of the product.

A high asymmetric amplification of the [[enantiomeric excess]] of sugars are also present in the [[amino acid]] catalyzed asymmetric formation of [[carbohydrates]]&lt;ref name=Engqvist&gt;{{cite journal| title=Plausible origins of homochirality in the amino acid catalyzed neogenesis of carbohydrates|author1=Armando Córdova |author2=Magnus Engqvist |author3=Ismail Ibrahem |author4=Jesús Casas |author5=Henrik Sundén | journal=[[Chem.

One classic study involves an experiment that takes place in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=kondepudi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Sodium Chlorate Crystallization| author= Kondepudi, D. K., Kaufman, R. J. &amp; Singh, N.| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 250 | pages = 975–976|year=1990|doi=10.1126/science.250.4983.975|pmid=17746924|issue=4983|bibcode = 1990Sci...250..975K }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sodium chlorate]] is allowed to [[crystallization|crystallize]] from water and the collected crystals examined in a [[polarimeter]], each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the [[Levorotation|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;]] form or the [[Dextrorotation|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;]] form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; crystals collected equals the amount of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium chlorate solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; or exclusively &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;. In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-crystals and 18 others &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to [[autocatalysis]] taking place in the [[nucleation]] process.

In a related experiment, a crystal suspension of a racemic [[amino acid]] derivative continuously stirred, results in a 100% crystal phase of one of the enantiomers because the enantiomeric pair is able to equilibrate in solution  (compare with [[dynamic kinetic resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noorduin|first1=Wim L.|last2=Izumi|first2=Toshiko|last3=Millemaggi|first3=Alessia|last4=Leeman|first4=Michel|last5=Meekes|first5=Hugo|last6=Van Enckevort|first6=Willem J.

===Transmission===
Many strategies in [[asymmetric synthesis]] are built on chiral transmission. Especially important is the so-called [[organocatalysis]] of organic reactions by proline for example in [[Mannich reaction]]s.

==Optical resolution in racemic amino acids==
There exists no theory elucidating correlations among &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. If one takes, for example, [[alanine]], which has a small [[methyl]] group, and [[phenylalanine]], which has a larger [[benzyl]] group, a simple question is in what aspect, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-alanine resembles &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine more than &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine, and what kind of mechanism causes the selection of all &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and phenylalanine was &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.

When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized.&lt;ref name=kojo/&gt; It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;- or &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee was reported to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.

This is the first study elucidating reasonably the formation of chirality from racemic amino acids with experimental evidences.

==History of term==
This term was introduced by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in 1904, the year that he published his Baltimore Lecture of 1884. Kelvin used the term homochirality as a relationship between two molecules, i.e. two molecule are homochiral if they have the same chirality.&lt;ref name=Engqvist/&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=David G.|title=Stereochemistry|date=2001|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84755-194-8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, homochiral has been used in the same sense as [[enantiomer]]ically pure. This is permitted in some journals (but not encouraged),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anslyn|first1=Eric V.|last2=Dougherty|first2=Dennis A.|title=Modern physical organic chemistry|date=2006|publisher=University Science Books|location=Sausalito, Calif.|isbn=9781891389313}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|342}}&lt;ref&gt;However, the message can be confusing. In {{cite journal|last1=Moss|first1=G. P.|title=Basic terminology of stereochemistry (IUPAC Recommendations 1996)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1 January 1996|volume=68|issue=12|pages=2193–2222|doi=10.1351/pac199668122193|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/pac.1996.68.issue-12/pac199668122193/pac199668122193.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2018}}, the entry for ''Enantiomerically Pure/Enantiopure'' says "Use of homochiral as a synonym is strongly discouraged"; but the entry for ''Homochiral'' says "See ''enantiomerically pure/enantiopure''."&lt;/ref&gt; its meaning changing into the preference of a process or system for a single [[optical isomer]] in a pair of isomers in these journals.

The '''human condition''' is "the characteristics, key events, and situations which compose the essentials of [[human]] existence, such as birth, growth, emotionality, aspiration, conflict, and mortality".&lt;ref&gt;"[[wikt:human condition|human condition]]" entry at [[Wiktionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very broad topic which has been and continues to be pondered and analyzed from many perspectives, including those of [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[art]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], and [[biology]].

As a [[terminology|literary term]], "the human condition" is typically used in the context of ambiguous subjects such as the [[meaning of life]] or [[morality|moral concerns]].&lt;ref name="lit"&gt;[http://learn.lexiconic.net/humancondition.htm The human condition in literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some perspectives==

Each [[major religious groups|major religion]] has definitive beliefs regarding the human condition. For example, [[Buddhism]] [[Four Noble Truths|teaches]] that life is a perpetual cycle of [[dukkha|suffering]], death, and rebirth from which humans can be liberated via the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Meanwhile, [[Christianity]] teaches that humans are born in a [[original sin|sinful condition]] and are [[Christian views on hell|doomed]] in the [[afterlife]] unless they receive [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

Philosophers have provided many perspectives. An influential ancient view was that of the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' in which [[Plato]] explored the question "what is justice?" and postulated that it is not primarily a matter among individuals but of [[society]] as a whole, prompting him to devise a [[utopia]]. Two thousand years later [[René Descartes]] declared "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]" because he believed the human mind, particularly its faculty of [[reason]], to be the primary determiner of [[truth]]; for this he is often credited as the father of modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;pg=PA511 ''History of Western Philosophy''] pp.511, 516–7&lt;/ref&gt; One such modern school, [[existentialism]], attempts to reconcile an individual's sense of disorientation and confusion in a universe believed to be [[absurdism|absurd]].

Many works of literature provide perspective on the human condition.&lt;ref name="lit"/&gt; One famous example is [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] monologue "[[All the world's a stage]]" that pensively summarizes seven phases of human life.

Psychology has many theories, such as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] and the notion of [[identity crisis]]. It also has various methods, e.g. the [[logotherapy]] developed by [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor [[Viktor Frankl]] to discover and affirm human meaning. Another method, [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], has become a widespread treatment for [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driessen Ellen |author2=Hollon Steven D | year = 2010 | title = Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Mood Disorders: Efficacy, Moderators and Mediators | url = | journal = Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 537–55 | doi=10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.005 | pmid=20599132 | pmc=2933381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 1859, when [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', the biological [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[evolution]] has been significant. The theory posits that the human [[species]] is related to all others, living and extinct, and that [[natural selection]] is the primary survival factor. This has provided a basis for new beliefs, e.g. [[social Darwinism]], and for new [[technology]], e.g. [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gladki A, Kaczanowski S, Szczesny P, Zielenkiewicz P |title=The evolutionary rate of antibacterial drug targets |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=14 |pages=36 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23374913 |url= |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-36 |pmc=3598507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term==

Notable uses of the term "the human condition" include  [[André Malraux]]'s novel ''[[Man's Fate]]'', [[René Magritte]]'s painting ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La Condition Humaine]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]]'s [[The Human Condition (book)|political philosophy]], and [[Masaki Kobayashi]]'s [[The Human Condition (film series)|film trilogy]].

In [[chemistry]], '''inherent chirality''' is a property of asymmetry in molecules arising, not from a stereogenic or chiral center, but from a twisting of the molecule in 3-D space.   The term was first coined by Volker Boehmer in a 1994 review, to describe the chirality of [[calixarenes]] arising from their non-planar structure in 3-D space.

This phenomena was described as resulting from “the absence of a place of symmetry or an inversion center in the molecule as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalla Cort|first=Antonella|last2=Mandolini|first2=Luigi|last3=Pasquini|first3=Chiara|last4=Schiaffino|first4=Luca|date=2004-10-01|title="Inherent chirality" and curvature|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=B404388J|journal=New J.

== History ==

=== Calixarenes ===
After creating a series of traditionally chiral calixarenes (through the addition of a chiral substituent group on the top or bottom rim of the macrocycle,) the first inherently chiral calixarenes were synthesized in 1982, though the molecules were not yet described as such.  The inherently chiral calixarenes featured an XXYZ or WXYZ substitution pattern, such that the planar representation of the molecule does not show any chirality, and if the macrocycle were to be broken open, this would produce an achiral linear molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Shao-Yong|last2=Xu|first2=Yao-Wei|last3=Liu|first3=Jun-Min|last4=Su|first4=Cheng-Yong|date=2011-01-17|title=Inherently Chiral Calixarenes: Synthesis, Optical Resolution, Chiral Recognition and Asymmetric Catalysis|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/12/1/429|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=429–455|doi=10.3390/ijms12010429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chirality in these calixarenes is instead derived from the curvature of the molecule in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-31867-7|title=Calixarenes and Beyond {{!}} SpringerLink|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-31867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2corannulene.png|thumb|a) 2D representation of corannulene, b) 3D representation of corannulene bowl flip with C5 symmetry.]]

=== Definition ===
Due to the initial lack of a formal definition after the initial conception, the term inherent chirality was utilized to describe a variety of chiral molecules that don’t fall into other defined chirality types.  The first fully formulated definition of inherent chirality was published in 2004 by Mandolini and Schiaffino, (and later modified by Szumna):

''“inherent chirality arises from the introduction of a curvature in an ideal planar structure that is devoid of perpendicular symmetry planes in its bidimensional representation'''."'''''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Inherent chirality has been known by a variety of names in the literature including bowl chirality (in fullerene fragments), intrinsic chirality, helicity (see section 3a) residual enantiomers (as applied to sterically hindered molecular propellers,) and cyclochirality (though this is often considered to be a more specific example and cannot be applied to all inherently chiral molecules.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A simple example of inherent chirality is that of corannulene commonly referred to as “bowl chirality” in the literature.  The chirality of an unsubstituted corranulene (containing no classic stereogenic centers) cannot be seen in a 2D representation, but becomes clear when a 3D representation is evoked, as the C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry of corranulenes provides the molecules with a source of chirality (figure 2.)  Racemization of these molecules is possible through an inversion of curvature, though some inherently chiral molecules have inversion barriers comparable to a classic chiral center.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Molecular Symmetry ==
[[File:3paracyclophane.png|thumb|150x150px|Inherently chiral paracyclophane, rendered chiral by the bromide substituent hindering rotation of the phenylene.]]

=== Chiral Plane ===
Some inherently chiral molecules contain [[Planar chirality|chirality planes]], or planes within a given molecules across which the molecule is dissymmetric.  Paracyclophanes often contain chiral planes if the bridge across the phenylene unit is short enough, or if the phenylene contains another substituent, not in the bridge, that hinders rotation of the phenylene unit.

=== Chiral axis ===
Similar to chirality planes, [[Axial chirality|chirality axes]] arise from an axis about which the spatial arrangement of substituents creates chirality.  This can be seen in helical molecules (see section 3a) as well as some alkenes.

[[File:10helicene.png|thumb|133x133px|Helicene molecule with inherent chirality.]]
Helical molecules are considered to have inherent chirality, but this is sometimes referred to as helical chirality or ''helicity''.  The IUPAC definition of helicity is: ''chirality of a helical, propeller or screw-shaped molecular entity.''  [[Helicene]]s (figure 4) are chiral polycyclic aromatic compounds that lack conventional chiral centers, but are chiral due to the helical shape of the 3D molecules.

[[Spiro compound#Chirality|Spiro compounds]] (compounds with a twisted structure of two or more rings) can have inherent chirality at the spiroatom, due to the twisting of the achiral ring system.

Inherently chiral alkenes have been synthesized through the use of a “buckle” where in an achiral, linear alkene is forced into a chiral conformation.  Alkenes have no classical chirality, so generally, an external stereogenic center must be introduced.  However, by locking the alkene into a conformation through the use of an achiral buckle allows for the creation of an inherently chiral alkene.  Inherently chiral alkenes have been synthesized through the use of dialkoxysilanes, with a large enough racemization barrier that enantiomers have been isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tomooka|first=Katsuhiko|last2=Miyasaka|first2=Shouji|last3=Motomura|first3=Shougo|last4=Igawa|first4=Kazunobu|date=2014-06-16|title=Planar Chiral Dialkoxysilane: Introduction of Inherent Chirality and High Reactivity in Conventional Achiral Alkene|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.201402434/abstract|journal=Chemistry – A European Journal|language=en|volume=20|issue=25|pages=7598–7602|doi=10.1002/chem.201402434|issn=1521-3765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jennifer Aaker''' (born 1967, California) is an American social psychologist, author and General Atlantic Professor of Marketing at [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]. Best known for her research on time, money and happiness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Nancy|title=The Corporate Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1722637/corporate-pursuit-happiness|work=March, 2011|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker also focuses on the transmission of ideas through social networks, the power of story in decision making, and how to build global brands across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Brainiacs: Most Influential Women In Technology|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/women-in-tech/2011/brainiacs/jennifer-aaker|work=2011|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty Profile:  Jennifer Aaker|url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/|publisher=Stanford Graduate School of Business|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the recipient of the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award from the [[Society for Consumer Psychology]] and the Stanford Distinguished Teaching Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Psychology Today |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/jennifer-aaker |work=2014 |publisher=Psychology Today |accessdate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306113958/http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/jennifer-aaker |archivedate= 6 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Aaker was born in [[Palo Alto, California]], to Kay Aaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wake|first=Jennifer|title=The Gift of Time: Skilled Volunteers Found in Local Retirees|url=http://www.volunteereastbay.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/The_Gift_of_Time.pdf|work=April 15, 2009|publisher=La Morinda Weekly|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Aaker]], a professor and brand consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David A. Aaker, Author Profile|url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/David-A-Aaker/1451364|publisher=Simon and Schuster|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she studied under social psychologist [[Philip E. Tetlock]] and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Daniel Kahneman]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Psychology]] in 1989. In 1990, Aaker began postgraduate work at Stanford Graduate School of Business, earning a Ph.D. in marketing with a minor in psychology in 1995. Her dissertation on brand personality led to the publication of three academic papers  in ''Journal of Marketing Research'' and ''Journal of Consumer Research'' and won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honors and Recognition |url=http://faculty.gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=2013 |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=15 June 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Aaker began her academic career in 1995 as an assistant professor at the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]].  In 1999, she returned to the Stanford Graduate School of Business as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor in 2001, and earned a full professorship in 2004. In 2005, Aaker was named General Atlantic Professor of Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaker CV at Stanford Graduate School of Business |url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=January, 2013 |publisher=Stanford University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722150424/http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been published in scholarly journals in psychology and marketing and has been highlighted in ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'', ''[[Forbes]],'' [[NPR]], ''[[CBS MoneyWatch]]'', ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]].'' She serves as an advisory board member for several private companies.

As a social psychologist and marketer, Aaker began her research career by proposing a "Dimensions of Brand Personality" framework to describe and measure the "personality" of a brand, defined as the set of human characteristics associated with it. The five core dimensions are Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness.  In a global analysis of brands, Aaker and her colleagues revealed two novel brand personality dimensions. In Japan, individuals viewed brands as Peaceful, and in Spain, individuals viewed brands as Passionate.  Aaker’s model showed that brand personality dimensions influence consumer preference and choice and provided a framework that illuminated how to build strong global brands that meet multi-cultural needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaker|first=Jennifer|title=Dimensions of Brand Personality|date=August 1997|url=http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/Papers/Dimensions%20of%20BP%20JMR%201997.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Aaker shifted her research focus to understanding time, money and happiness. In this work, she suggested that time is a resource that, like money, is not only important but more subjective than we think. In 2010, she published two papers with [[Sepandar Kamvar|Sep Kamvar]] and Cassie Mogilner on the dynamic meaning of happiness.  Prior research had suggested that the meaning of happiness is either similar across individuals, or highly subjective and idiosyncratic.  Aaker and her colleagues show that the answer lies between the two and that there is in fact a predictable shift in the meaning of happiness and how it is experienced over one's life and even within the day or week. The research also showed that the meaning of happiness that one holds impacts the choices people make.

Aaker has also examined questions such as why people give to others, how small acts create significant change, and how those effects can be fueled by social media.

In 2010, Aaker and her husband, startup advisor Andy Smith, authored the book ''The Dragonfly Effect:  Quick, Effective and Powerful Ways to Use Social Media to Drive Social Change.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.dragonflyeffect.com/|work=2013|publisher=Official Website|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    With a title inspired by the dragonfly’s unique ability to propel itself in any direction when its four wings worked in concert, the book examined the manner in which synchronized ideas can be used to create rapid transformations through social media. A literary award winner,[5] ''The Dragonfly Effect'' has been translated into over 10 languages. In 2013, Aaker, Smith and McCarthy published ''The Power of Stories'', a companion to ''The Dragonfly Effect'', which further explored social media through psychological insight and provided a hands-on tool to help companies put the model to work.

In a real world demonstration of the Dragonfly Effect, Aaker and her students founded 100K Cheeks,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Avril|title=Names You Need to Know|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/avrildavid/2011/05/17/names-you-need-to-know-the-dragonfly-effect/|work=May 17, 2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Stores|ISBN=1484184386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  an organization dedicated to registering 100,000 South Asian donors in the National Bone Marrow Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Challenges (Get Involved) |url=http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |publisher=Haas Center for Public Service |accessdate=13 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221230214/http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |archivedate=21 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to utilizing social networks, Aaker ran the first ever cheek swab in India; as a result of these efforts, 100K Cheeks exceeded their goal by registering more than 115,000 potential donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.inktalks.com/discover/53/pursuit-of-happiness|work=November 27, 2011|publisher=Ink Talks|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beth Kanter Katie Delahaye Paine|first=Katie Delahaye Paine|title=Measuring the Networked Nonprofit: Using Data to Change the World|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-1-118-13760-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vL_lhYF0Uf4C&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=jennifer+aaker+100k+cheeks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/the_dragonfly_effect|work=October 2011|publisher=Stanford Social Innovation Review|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Social media is not inherently meaningful," Aaker said in an interview on the subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6970">This is a list of people claimed to be [[immortality|immortal]]. This list does not reference purely spiritual entities ([[spirit]]s, [[deity|gods]], [[demon]]s, [[angel]]s), non-humans ([[monster]]s, [[extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]]s, [[elf|elves]]), or artificial life ([[artificial intelligence]], [[robot]]s).

This list comprises people claimed to achieve a deathless existence on Earth.  This list does not contain those people who are supposed to have attained immortality through the typical means of a religion, such as a [[Christian]] in [[Heaven]].  It also does not include people whose immortality involves living in a place not on Earth, such as [[Heracles]] on [[Mount Olympus]]&lt;ref&gt;While Mount Olympus actually exists, the Greeks understood a distinction between the Olympus of the Gods and the part that could be seen by humans. See {{citation | last=Dudley | first=John | year=1846 | title=Naology: or, A treatise on the origin, progress, and symbolical import of the sacred structures of the most eminent nations and ages of the world | publisher=F. and J. Rivington | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHAAAAAAMAAJ | page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Eight Immortals]] of [[Taoism]] in [[Mount Penglai]].  It also does not include people who, according to their religion, became deities or actually were deities the whole time, such as [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] (who as part of the [[Trinity]] was, according to Christianity, also [[God in Christianity|God]]) or [[Parashurama]] according to [[Hindu]] mythology. &lt;!--in [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Mount Meru]]--&gt;

These listings are in chronological order, though some dates are approximate.

* Nicolas Flamel. He is believed to find the book of Abraham the mage, get the ever-changing text decoded and find a spell for immortality, along with his wife.

* [[Ziusudra]] (also Zi-ud-sura and Zin-Suddu; Hellenized Xisuthros: "found long life" or "life of long days") of Shuruppak is listed in the WB-62 Sumerian king list{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} recension as the last king of Sumer prior to the deluge. He is subsequently recorded as the hero of the Sumerian flood epic. He is also mentioned in other ancient literature, including The Death of Gilgamesh{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and The Poem of Early Rulers,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and a late version of The Instructions of Shuruppak refers to Ziusudra. [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Atrahasis]] ("extremely wise") and [[Utnapishtim]] ("he found life"), as well as biblical [[Noah]] ("rest") are similar heroes of [[flood legend]]s of the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Transliteration from "The Flood Tablet" Tablet 256/Block 7 in The British Museum: ti digir-gin7 mu-un-na-sum-mu | zi da-ri2 digir-gin7 mu-un&lt;na&gt;-ab-e11-de3 (They brought down to him eternal life.

* [[Achilles]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], [[Menelaus]], and [[Peleus]], were said to have achieved physical immortality through the intervention of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dag Øistein Endsjø]]. ''Greek Resurrection Beliefs and the Success of Christianity.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Wandering Jew]] (b. 1st century BC), a Jewish shoemaker.  According to legend, he taunted Jesus on his way to [[crucifixion]]. Jesus cursed him to "go on forever till I return." Thus, the Wandering Jew is to live until the [[Second Coming|second coming of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/filologie/hebra/2-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John the Apostle]] (AD 6-101), one of Jesus's followers.  Some [[Mormons]], in conjunction with their own scriptures, interpret the biblical scripture found at John 21:21-23 to mean that John will ''tarry'' or remain on the earth until the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref&gt;The Immortal by JJ Dewey&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Three Nephites]] (between AD 34 and 35), three men described in the [[Book of Mormon]] who are given power over death in order to fulfill their desire to minister among men until Jesus comes again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/3_ne/28 3 Nephi 28&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Galahad|Sir Galahad]] (dates for his life fall between the 2nd century and the 6th century), one of the three [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian]] knights to find the [[Holy Grail]].  Of them, Galahad is the only one to have achieved immortality by it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Merlin]] (dates for his life fall between the 2nd century and the 6th century); in some accounts, Merlin is trapped by an [[Incantation|enchantment]] by [[Nimue]], and while some end with Merlin dying, in others he remains in the trap (variously a tomb, a cave, a mist, or a tree) indefinitely.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], the world's first murder, cursed with immortality for his crime
* [[Matiu Turipa]] , (dates his life in 18th century) Was Cursed to live forever, To never pass on by the Maori God's at the age of 20, for his betrayal of his people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Failed quests for immortality==
* [[Gilgamesh]] (possibly reigned during the [[26th century BC]]) after the death of his companion, [[Enkidu]], Gilgamesh pursues immortality to avoid Enkidu's fate. Gilgamesh fails two tests and does not become immortal, realising instead that mortals attain immortality through lasting works of civilization and [[culture]].  [[Epic of Gilgamesh|Gilgamesh's story]] is among the [[ancient literature|oldest stories recorded]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Qin Shi Huang]], the First [[Emperor of China]] who reigned during 259 BC–210 BC, also sought immortality in his old age. Twice he sent hundreds of people under the direction of [[Xu Fu]] to find the legendary [[elixir of life]], but failed. He died of [[mercury poisoning]] after he had eaten too many mercury pills, prescribed by his court doctors to make him immortal.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In [[Christianity]], '''missional living''' is the adoption of the posture, thinking, behaviors, and practices of a [[Mission (Christian)|missionary]] in order to engage others with the [[Good news (Christianity)|gospel]] message. The missional church movement, a [[church renewal]] movement predicated on the necessity of missional living by Christians, gained popularity at the end of the twentieth century due to advocates like [[Timothy J. Keller|Tim Keller]] and others in the Gospel and Our Culture Network.  Advocates contrast missional living with the concept of a select group of "professional" missionaries, emphasizing that all Christians should be involved in the [[Great Commission]] of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Keller, "The Missional church by Tim Keller" http://download.redeemer.com/pdf/learn/resources/Missional_Church-Keller.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Understanding ''Missional''==
The missional living concept is rooted in the ''[[Missio dei]]'' (Latin, "the sending of God"). In 1934, Karl Hartenstein, a German [[Missiology|missiologist]], coined the phrase in response to [[Karl Barth]] and his emphasis on ''actio Dei'' ("the action of God"). In their view, missional activities stemming from God.&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, David J, Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1991), 420.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Triune God is the primary acting agent in the world and within the church.

According to Lesslie Newbigin and Jesus' statements in the Gospel according to John, every Christian has been sent by Jesus with the gospel together in community to those in the surrounding culture for the sake of the King and His kingdom: “The Church is sent into the world to continue that which he came to do, in the power of the same Spirit, reconciling people to God.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Lesslie Newbigin]], ''The Gospel in a Pluralist Society'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1989, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus said, “As the Father has sent Me, I am sending you” (John 20:21).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"No one can say: ‘Since I’m not called to be a missionary, I do not have to evangelize my friends and neighbors.’ There is no difference, in spiritual terms, between a missionary witnessing in his home town and a missionary witnessing in Katmandu, Nepal. We are all called to go—even if it is only to the next room, or the next block.”"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hale, ''On Being a Missionary'', p 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==A missional (missionary) perspective==
''Missional living'' is the embodiment of the mission of Jesus in the world by incarnating the gospel. "It is imperative that Christians be like Jesus, by living freely within the culture as missionaries who are as faithful to the Father and his gospel as Jesus was in his own time and place."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Driscoll (pastor)|Mark Driscoll]], ''The Radical Reformission'', Zondervan, 2004, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This embodiment of the gospel is often referred to as "contextualization" or "inculturation."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Both refer to more than a simple translation of the gospel into different languages and cultures in the way that one translates a history book or a science text. Rather, they point to the embodiment of the living Word in human culture and social settings in such a way that its divine nature and power are not lost. True contextualization is more than communication. It is God working in the hearts of people, making them new and forming them into a new community. It is his Word transforming their lives, their societies, their cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hiebert and Eliose Hiebert Meneses, ''Incarnational Ministry'', Baker Book House, 1995, 370.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These five biblical distinctives form the foundation of a missional perspective:&lt;ref&gt;Dave DeVries, ''Missional Transformation: Fueling Missionary Movements that Transform America'', Bakke Graduate University, 2007, 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Church is sent by Jesus Christ (John 17:18; 20:21, Luke 9:2; Matt 28: 19–20; Acts 1:8)
# The Church is sent with the Cross (1 Cor 1:18, Eph 2:16, Col 2:14, 1 Pet2:24, 2 Cor 5:17–24)
# The Church is sent in Community (Acts 2:42–47; 5:42; John 13:34–35; 1 John 3:16–17)
# The Church is sent to every Culture (John 1:14; Matt 20:28; Acts 17:22–34; Luke 5:29)
# The Church is sent for the King and His Kingdom (Matt 10:7; 25:34; Luke 4:43; Rev 11:15–17; Jer 10:7; John 18:36)

[[Image:A Missional Perspective.JPG]]

===Sent===
Jesus sent His disciples on a mission. The missional church defines itself in terms of its mission—being sent ones who take the gospel to and incarnate the gospel within a specific culture. &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Jesus was the first apostle. He was sent by his Father. He, in turn, sent the Twelve. They went to people who would then take the gospel to the rest of the world. Whoever received it would understand that they, too, had been sent. With the gospel being what it is, the church as bearer of the gospel is bound to be apostolic."&lt;ref&gt;Jim Petersen and Mike Shamy, ''The Insider'', NavPress, 2003, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Cross===
Jesus Christ said that He came to earth to seek and to save that which was lost (Luke 19:10). He accomplished salvation through the cross. By dying on the cross, He paid the penalty for sin and satisfied God’s wrath. According to Scripture, without the cross, there is no salvation, no forgiveness, and no hope; because of the cross, there is eternal life. The mission and message of Jesus surround the cross. “For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God” (1 Cor 1:18).

===Community===
Jesus loves the Church and He gave His life to redeem the Church. Community exists for Mission! Christians are to bring the gospel ''together'' to the culture. "The church is called to ''do'' the work of Christ, to be the means of his ''action'' in and for the world....Mission, in its widest as well as its more focused senses, is what the church is there for. God intends to put the world to rights; he has dramatically launched this project through Jesus. Those who belong to Jesus are called, here and now, in the power of the Spirit, to be agents of that putting-to-rights purpose."&lt;ref&gt;[[N. T. Wright]], ''Simply Christian'', HarperSanFrancisco, 2006, 201, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
George Peters notes, “If man is to be reached, he must be reached within his own culture.”&lt;ref&gt;George Peters, ''A Biblical Theology of Missions'', Moody Press, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;  This principle is observed when God became a man in the form of Jesus to come to earth and incarnate the gospel. As missionaries sent by Jesus, every Christian must learn to exegete their surrounding culture, uncovering the language, values, and ideas of the culture. Using this information, they take steps to reach people with the gospel message in the context of the surrounding culture.

===King and Kingdom===
The kingdom was central to Jesus’ message and mission. The Book of Acts ends with Paul, under house arrest in Rome, “proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance” (Acts 28:31). Christians are sent to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom so that others may enter the kingdom.
George Hunsberger conveys the idea that the Church is pointing beyond itself to the kingdom of God. The Church is not an end in itself; God has a mission that goes beyond the Church which includes the kingdom. The kingdom and the Church must never be divorced, yet they also must never be equated. In a similar way, “the reign must never be separated from the One who reigns.”&lt;ref&gt;George R. Hunsberger, “Called and Sent to Represent the Reign of God,” in ''Missional Church'', ed. Darrel Guder, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1998, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  The kingdom is always at the heart of the King.

==The missional church==
The missional church movement first arose during the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. The movement seeks to rethink and redefine the nature of the church and create a new paradigm in which churches are seen as missional in nature, instead of attractional in nature. Leaders in the movement argue that instead of churches attempting to attract people to churches through church programs, churches should instead take the gospel outside of the church and engage society with the gospel, often by being involved not only in missions and evangelism but also in social justice movements. The missional church defines itself in terms of its mission — being ''sent ones'' who take the gospel to and incarnate the gospel within a specific cultural context. &lt;blockquote&gt;The church exists, in other words, for what we sometimes call "mission": to announce to the world that Jesus is its Lord.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wright (theologian)|N. T. Wright]], ''Simply Christian'', 2006, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Mission is not just a program of the church. It defines the church as God’s sent people. Either we are defined by mission, or we reduce the scope of the gospel and the mandate of the church. Thus our challenge today is to move from church with mission to missional church."&lt;ref&gt;Guder, ed., ''Missional Church'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Christian church|Church]] has a mission because Jesus has a mission. There is one mission.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Missional church is a community of God’s people that defines itself, and organizes its life around, its real purpose of being an agent of God’s mission to the world. In other words, the church’s true and authentic [[organizing principle]] is mission. When the church is in mission, it is the true church. The church itself is not only a product of that mission but is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible. The mission of God flows directly through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus. To obstruct this is to block God’s purposes in and through his people."
&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Hirsch]], ''The Forgotten Ways'', Brazos, 2007, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Missional living is a term that is used in contrast with historical institutional churches. Church leaders as well as Christians in general have often regarded the Church as an institution to which outsiders must come in order to receive a certain product, namely, the gospel and all its associated benefits. Institutional churches are sometimes perceived to exist for the members and depend on pastors and staff to evangelize the lost. The "missional church", on the other hand, attempts to take Christ to "the lost" and its members are personally engaged in reaching their communities with the message of Jesus Christ.

In '''philosophy''', '''moral conversion''' is an [[Existential humanism|existential]] [[Existential crisis|change]] in the person, who is perceived as the moral agent adopting new moral standards (or [[mores]]) in a process of internal transformation. Moral conversion is a relatively rare event in a person's normal development. It involves a decision that is both conscious and existentialist (i.e. based on critical questioning).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=194}} Moral conversion is based on the [[internalist]] view of [[morality]].{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=7}}

==As an existential event==
The process of moral conversion was described by [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] of the [[University of Chicago]], who developed the so-called [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]. Six classes of moral conversion were identified, based on progressively higher and higher levels of moral reasoning, beginning with the ''preconventional'' level of a child, and concluding with the ''postconventional'' (or autonomous) level of an adult aware of ethical principles guiding universally moral behaviour.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=203}}

Notably, the notion of moral conversion has been distinguished from the theory of moral development ''per se'', by [[Walter E. Conn]] (of [[Villanova University]]) and [[John C. Gibbs]] (of the [[Ohio State University]]).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=205}} Moral conversion, according to Conn and Gibbs, involves critical questioning and therefore differs from any spontaneous moral development (Kohlberg). It results in the setting forth of the "self-chosen values" (Conn), which bring the existential dimension to the transforming process.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=219&amp;ndash;224}}

[[Alfredo J. Mac Laughlin]] of St. Ambrose University defines moral conversion by the frequent occurrence of the "{{nobreak|sharp-turn}} conversions" resulting from the presence of [[free will]], which differ from the natural/spontaneous development taking place in incremental stages (Kohlberg).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=234}} The most significant aspect of moral conversion is the withdrawal from the moral convictions of the past, which is based on "critical self-appropriation" or the ''critical'' discovery of oneself.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=250}} It depends on the sense of authenticity beyond the possibility of predictions.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=253}}

==As self-transcendence==
[[Bernard Lonergan]] explains that moral conversion is not moral perfection. It is the "withdrawal from self-enclosure" or the shift from personal satisfaction criterion to values that transcend oneself (or one's own group interests). Moral conversion, according to Lonergan, is one of three different types of conversion along with the ''intellectual'' and the [[Religious conversion|''religious'' conversion]].{{sfn|Conn|1982}} From a causal point of view, it is the difference between varying levels of consciousness leading to a higher sense of responsibility for the world.{{sfn|Doran|2011|p=13&amp;ndash;18}}

'''Mortality [[forecasting]]''' refers to the art and science of determining likely future mortality rates.  It is especially important in rich countries with a high proportion of aged people, since aged populations are expensive in terms of [[pensions]] (both public and private).  It is a major topic in [[Ageing]] studies.

The early modern age saw various economic changes as well as several significant diseases that have affected the mortality rates. Data collection during this time was not consistent or broadly recorded and there have been efforts to reconstruct plausible statistics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laqueur|first=Thomas|title=The Work of the Dead: A Cultural History of Mortal Remains|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|volume=72|issue=4|pages=504–506|doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrx024|issn=0022-5045|via=|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates vary on geographic location, social environment, and cultural values.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There were also gender differences in the mortality rates, leading to an excess mortality rate in urban areas and in the female population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Derosas|first=Renzo|title=Life Under Pressure: Mortality And Living Standards In Europe And Asia, 1700-1900|date=|url=|work=Infant and Child Mortality|volume=|pages=327–398, 431–440|publisher=|isbn=|access-date=2018-07-24|last2=Breschi|first2=Marco|last3=Fornasin|first3=Alessio|last4=Manfredini|first4=Matteo|last5=Munno|first5=Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main cause of death was [[stillbirth]], which could be attributed to, but not limited to, maternal infections, birth complications, and congenital anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/epidemiology/stillbirth/en/|title=Stillbirths|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another contributing factor to the mortality rate was food insecurity and shortages as well as unemployment, both of which varied per region.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Post|first=John D.|date=1990|title=The Mortality Crises of the Early 1770s and European Demographic Trends|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=21|issue=1|pages=29|doi=10.2307/204917|issn=0022-1953|jstor=204917}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final factor was violence, which occurred mainly due to [[Structural violence|structural]] or systemic violence; however, violence since the 12th century has been steadily falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Campbell|first=Roderick Campbell|title=Toward a Deep History of Violence and Civilization|url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=2084655|work=Violence and Civilization: Studies of Social Violence in History and Prehistory|volume=|pages=1–22|publisher=|isbn=9781782976202|access-date=2018-07-25|date=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Steven Pinker on the myth of violence|last=Pinker|first=Steven|date=2007|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|doi = 10.1037/e597002010-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Collection ==
Data from the early modern age was not accurately or consistently collected. However, there have been a number of studies and reconstructed statistics from this era, particularly on children and women. There has not been any empirical research published and the only information has been theoretical as there has been insufficient data and sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was also common for many statistics to go unreported; this is especially true regarding unmarried women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Models and theoretic equations need to take into account "social, economic, cultural, geographical, and even climatological variables" in order to accurately reflect the statistics of the time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Gender differences ==
One study, the Eurasia Project, has shown that boys, especially those under one year, had a higher mortality rate during childhood than girls, but the mortality rate for men and women were about equal. It has also been shown that there is a higher male mortality than female mortality rate during the time of famine. Male mortality has also been linked to "economic modernization and urbanization ... especially for cardiovascular disease".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Women faced increased mortality during childbirth as pregnancy and childbirth compromised the mother's immune system, with the most common causes of death being [[Postpartum infections|puerperal fever]], [[Pre-eclampsia|toxemia]], and [[Postpartum bleeding|hemorrhage]]. These dangers suggest an association to the excess female mortality, especially considering that women had to compete more for resources as they had no property rights and had a lower ranking in the household hierarchy. The average age of childbearing differed between Asia and Europe with an average difference of five years, which would affect cross-cultural data collection. Children born to mothers 35 years or older had a higher risk of mortality than children born to younger mothers. linking a mother's health and a child's survival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Female infants and children often had a higher mortality rate, especially in times of food insecurity, compared to male infants and children. However, a maternal presence worked as a protective factor for children. regardless of age or gender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Economics ==
Food insecurity and shortages were common throughout this time period and were matched with the high food prices and high unemployment rate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is shown through the differences in mortality rates between the lower and upper class, with poor infants being up to two times more likely to die than their wealthier counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 17th century Europe, it was common that at least one in five children from the same family would die before the age of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21375348|title=Making sex : body and gender from the Greeks to Freud|last=Walter.|first=Laqueur, Thomas|date=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674543492|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=21375348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this high rate, it was common for there to be a large amount of children in one family so that there would be a higher rate of survival. Especially among poorer families, having multiple children was common in order to ensure there would be children to contribute to the family later on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the early modern era, house calls were common. If the patient was female, the doctor, commonly an upper class male, would typically be summoned by a male family member who wound remain throughout the examination. The physician and male family member would then discuss the diagnosis and treatment plan without the female's input. This practice reinforced and perpetuated social hierarchies and patriarchal values.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Furth|first=Charlotte|date=1999-03-05|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|journal=Isis|volume=93|issue=3|pages=479–480|doi=10.1086/374084|isbn=9780520208292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and diseases ==

Food shortages and insecurity were leading concerns in the 18th century, especially in Europe, and these were exacerbated by reduced harvests yields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Disease was another leading cause of death, with rats and fleas being the common carriers of disease, specifically plagues, during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html|title=FAQ {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]] was a plague that affected much of the world, originating in Asia and spreading to Europe through diseased fleas and rats. This epidemic has been reported to have been the cause of death for approximately "60% of the European population".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the end of the 19th century, there was a plague, known as the [[Third plague pandemic|Modern Plague]], that started in China and spread to different cities through ports, reportedly causing roughly ten million deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/history/index.html|title=History {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|date=2018-05-31|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plague affected Asia, the Americas, and Africa and lasted into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There were also epidemics that occurred locally and did not spread to national levels, notably in 18th century England.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These local epidemics included fevers, dysentery, smallpox, starvation, typhoid fever, under-nutrition, cholera, malaria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

By the end of the era, [[disease]] and [[malnutrition]] were no longer the main leading causes of death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''nanobe''' is a tiny filamental [[structure]] first found in some [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[sediment]]s.  Some scientists [[Hypothesis|hypothesize]] that nanobes are the smallest form of [[life]], 1/10 the size of the [[Mycoplasma|smallest known]] [[Bacterium|bacteria]].&lt;ref name=Nanjundiah2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nanjundiah | first =  V. | year = 2000 | title = The smallest form of life yet? | journal = Journal of Biosciences | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–10 | url = http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/archive/00001799/01/25smallest25(1)-9to10mar2000.pdf | doi = 10.1007/BF02985175 | pmid = 10824192 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No conclusive evidence exists that these structures are, or are not, living organisms, so their classification is controversial.

The 1996 discovery of nanobes was published in 1998&lt;ref name=nanobepaper1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Uwins, Philippa, J. R.|url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/nanobes/nanobes.pdf|title=Novel nano-organisms from Australian sandstones|work= [[American Mineralogist]]| volume=83|pages=1541–1550|year=1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Philippa Uwins ''et al.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/nanobes/nanophil.html Nanobes: About Philippa Uwins and the Discovery Team]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of Queensland]], [[Australia]]. They were found growing from rock samples (both full-diameter and sidewall cores) of [[Jurassic]] and [[Triassic]] sandstones, originally retrieved from an unspecified number of [[oil exploration]] wells off Australia's west coast. Depths of retrieval were between {{convert|3400|m|mi|1}} and {{convert|5100|m|mi|1}} below the sea bed. While Uwins ''et al.'' present assertions against it, they do not exclude the possibility that the nanobes are from a surface contaminant, not from the rock units cited.

The smallest are just 20 [[Nanometre|nanometers]] in diameter. Some researchers believe that these structures are [[crystal]] growths, but the staining of these structures with dyes that bind to [[DNA]] might indicate that they are living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/nanobes/index.html "Nanobacteria and Nanobes- Are They Alive?"]&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar to the structures found in [[ALH84001]], a [[Mars meteorite]] found in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]]. 
Nanobes are similar in size to [[nanobacteria]], which are also structures that have been proposed to be extremely small living organisms. However, these two should not be confused. Nanobacteria are thought to be cellular organisms, while nanobes are hypothesized to be a previously unknown form of life or [[protocell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Claims ==
{{unsourced section|date=July 2017}}

* It is a living organism (contains [[DNA]] or some analogue, and reproduces).
* Has a [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] similar to [[Actinomycetes]] and [[fungi]].
* Nanobes are about 20 [[Nanometre|nm]] in diameter, which may be too small to contain the basic elements for an organism to exist (DNA, ribosomes, etc.), suggesting that if they grow and reproduce they would need to do so in an unconventional way.
* The [[Martian meteorite]] [[ALH84001]], discovered in 1984 in the [[Antarctic]], contained similar tubular structures which some [[astrobiology|astrobiologists]] suggested could be evidence of life at an earlier time on [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McSween, H. Y. |title=Evidence for life in a martian meteorite? |journal=GSA Today |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=1–7 |year=1997 |pmid=11541665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

A review in ''Microbes and Environments''&lt;ref name=Velimirov2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = Velimirov, B. | year = 2001 | title = Nanobacteria, Ultramicrobacteria and Starvation Forms: A Search for the Smallest Metabolizing Bacterium | journal = Microbes and Environments | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 67–77 | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsme2/16/2/16_2_67/_pdf | accessdate = 2008-06-23 | doi = 10.1264/jsme2.2001.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the various ultra-small forms of proposed life states that the main criticism of nanobes is that they appear too small to contain the biochemical machinery needed to sustain life. The review also states that there is no evidence that nanobes are organisms in themselves and not fragments of larger organisms.

Tony Taylor was one of the authors of the original nanobe paper.&lt;ref name=nanobepaper1998 /&gt; He argues that the conspicuous lack of phosphorus in the X-ray spectroscopy data and the failure to find DNA using various DNA amplification techniques demonstrates that nanobes do not have any DNA or RNA. He also argues that they may have a completely different mechanism for heredity, which would account for many of their unusual chemical and physical properties.

[[File:Testudo horsfieldii locking into the camera.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Some tortoises show negligible senescence.]]
'''Negligible senescence''' is a term coined by [[biogerontology|biogerontologist]] [[Caleb Finch]] to denote organisms that do not exhibit evidence of [[senescence]] (biological aging), such as measurable reductions in their reproductive capability, measurable functional decline, or rising death rates with age.&lt;ref name=FinchLSG&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finch |first1=Caleb |title=Longevity, Senescence and the Genome |date=1994 |publisher=.  University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |pages=206-247 |chapter=Negligible Senescence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of species for whose organisms scientists have not detected an increase in mortality rate after maturity.&lt;ref name=FinchLSG/&gt; This may mean that the lifespan of the organism is so long that researchers' subjects have not yet lived up to the time when a measure of the species' longevity can be made. Turtles, for example, were once thought to lack senescence, but more extensive observations have found evidence of decreasing fitness with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Study of negligibly senescent animals may provide clues that lead to better understanding of the aging process&lt;ref name=FinchLSG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerin | first1 = J | year = 2004 | title = Emerging area of aging research: long-lived animals with "negligible senescence" | url = | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1019 | issue = | pages = 518–20 | doi=10.1196/annals.1297.096 | pmid=15247078}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influence [[evolution of aging|theories of aging]]. The phenomenon of negligible senescence in some animals is a traditional argument for attempting to achieve similar negligible senescence in humans by technological means.

There are also organisms{{which|date=January 2017}} that exhibit negative senescence, whereby mortality chronologically decreases as the organism ages, for all or part of the life cycle, in disagreement with the [[Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)62033-8 |title=Evolution's greatest mistakes |year=2007 |author=Ainsworth, C |journal=New Scientist |volume=195 |pages=36–39 |last2=Lepage |first2=M|issue=2616}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Late-life mortality deceleration]]). Furthermore, there are species that have been observed to regress to a larval state and regrow into adults multiple times, such as ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |title=Cheating Death: The Immortal Life Cycle of '&amp;#39;Turritopsis'&amp;#39; |publisher=8e.devbio.com |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402085711/http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |archivedate=2010-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have indicated a connection between phenomena related to negligible senescence and the general stability of an organism's [[genome]], specifically [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] processes, over its lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kogan|first1=Valeria|first2=Ivan|last2=Molodtcov|first3=Leonid I.|last3=Menshikov|first4=Robert J.|last4=Shmookler Reis|first5=Peter|last5=Fedichev|title=Stability analysis of a model gene network links aging, stress resistance, and negligible senescence|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|year=2015|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13589|doi=10.1038/srep13589|pages=13589|pmid=26316217|pmc=4551969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In vertebrates==
Some fish, such as some varieties of [[sturgeon]] and [[rougheye rockfish]], and some [[tortoise]]s and [[turtle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = J | year = 2001 | title = Escaping senescence: demographic data from the three-toed box turtle (Terrapene carolina triunguis)". | url = | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 36 | issue = 4–6| pages = 829–32 | doi=10.1016/s0531-5565(00)00243-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; are thought to be negligibly senescent, although recent research on turtles has uncovered evidence of senescence in the wild.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warner|first=Daniel A.|last2=Miller|first2=David A. W.|last3=Bronikowski|first3=Anne M.|last4=Janzen|first4=Fredric J.|date=2016-06-07|title=Decades of field data reveal that turtles senesce in the wild|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/23/6502|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=23|pages=6502–6507|doi=10.1073/pnas.1600035113|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4988574|pmid=27140634}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of a captured fish specimen can be measured by examining growth patterns similar to [[tree rings]] on the [[otolith]]s (parts of motion-sensing organs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = J | year = 1882 | title = Confirmation on longevity in Sebastes diploproa (pisces Scorpaenidae) from 210Pb/226Ra measurements in otoliths | url = | journal = Maritime Biology | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 209–215 | doi=10.1007/bf00394632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In plants==
In plants, [[aspen]] trees are one example of [[biological immortality]]. Each individual tree can live for 40–150 years above ground, but the [[root]] system of the [[clonal colony]] is long-lived. In some cases, this is for thousands of years, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground. One such colony in [[Utah]], given the nickname of [[Pando (Quaking Aspen)|"Pando"]], is estimated to be 80,000 years old, making it possibly the [[list of long-living organisms|oldest living colony]] of aspens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/brca/naturescience/quakingaspen.htm Quaking Aspen] by the [[Bryce Canyon]] [[National Park Service]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's oldest known living non-[[Vegetative cloning|clonal]] organism was the [[Methuselah (tree)|Methuselah tree]] of the species ''[[Pinus longaeva]]'' growing high in the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] of [[Inyo County, California|Inyo County]] in eastern [[California]], aged {{Age as of date|4789|1957|August|5}} years.&lt;ref name=database&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pinus_longaeva.php |title= ''Pinus longaeva'' |accessdate= 2008-06-20 |publisher= Gymnosperm Database|date= March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This record was superseded in 2012 by another Great Basin bristlecone pine located in the same region as Methuselah, and was estimated to be 5062 years old. The tree was sampled by Edmund Schulman and dated by Tom Harlan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rmtrr.org/oldlist.htm |title=OLDLIST, a database of old trees |last=Brown |first=Peter M |date=2012 |publisher=Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Research, Inc. |access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In bacteria==
Among [[bacteria]], individual organisms are vulnerable and can easily die, but on the level of the [[Colony (biology)|colony]], bacteria can live indefinitely. The two daughter bacteria resulting from [[cell division]] of a parent bacterium can be regarded as unique individuals or as members of a biologically “immortal” colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chao|first=Lin|author2=Guttman, David S.|title=A Model for Damage Load and Its Implications for the Evolution of Bacterial Aging|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=26 August 2010|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e1001076|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001076|pmid=20865171|pmc=2928801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two daughter cells can be regarded as “rejuvenated” copies of the parent cell because damaged macromolecules have been split between the two cells and diluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rang|first=Camilla U.|author2=Peng, Annie Y. |author3=Chao, Lin |title=Temporal Dynamics of Bacterial Aging and Rejuvenation|journal=Current Biology|date=8 November 2011|volume=21|issue=21|pages=1813–1816|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.09.018|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211010207|pmid=22036179}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[asexual reproduction]].

==Cryptobiosis==
Some rare organisms, such as [[tardigrade]]s, usually have short lifespans, but are able to survive for thousands of years — and, perhaps, indefinitely — if they enter into the state of [[cryptobiosis]], whereby their [[metabolism]] is reversibly suspended. It is hypothesized by advocates of [[cryonics]] that the human [[central nervous system]] can be similarly put into a state of [[suspended animation]] shortly before [[brain death]] to be revived at a future point in the technological development of humankind when such operation would be possible.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3045">'''Paratomy''' is a form of [[asexual reproduction]] in animals where the organism splits in a plane perpendicular to the [[antero-posteriorly|antero-posterior axis]] and the split is preceded by the "pregeneration" of the anterior structures in the posterior portion.The developing organisms have their body axis aligned i.e. they develop in a head to tail fashion.

[[Budding]] can be considered to be similar to paratomy except that the body axes need not be aligned: the new head may grow toward the side or even point backward (e.g. ''[[Convolutriloba retrogemma]]'' an [[acoela|acoel]] flat worm).&lt;ref name=Akesson2001&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1046/j.1463-6395.2001.00084.x| issn = 1463-6395| volume = 82| issue = 3| pages = 231–239| last = Åkesson| first = Bertil|author2=Robert Gschwentner |author3=Jan Hendelberg |author4=Peter Ladurner |author5=Johann Müller |author6=Reinhard Rieger | title = Fission in ''Convolutriloba longifissura'': asexual reproduction in acoelous turbellarians revisited| journal = Acta Zoologica| accessdate = 2011-07-13| date = 2001-12-01| url = http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c719135/pdf/Akesson-Gschwentner-2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/bdrc.20135| issn = 1542-9768| volume = 84| issue = 4| pages = 257–264| last = Egger| first = Bernhard| title = Regeneration: rewarding, but potentially risky| journal = Birth Defects Research.

'''''Phaedon''''' ({{lang-de|Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele}}), published in 1767, is a book by the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]], in which Mendelssohn offers a defense of [[immortality]].&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Lenn E. |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
''Phaedon'' is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul.&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popkind"&gt;{{cite book |author=Popkin, Richard H. |editor=Audi, Robert |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |isbn=0-521-63722-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue [[Phaedo]], in which [[Socrates]] argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including [[Plotinus]], [[Descartes]], and [[Leibniz]], argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the ''Phaedon'', Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that [[Kant]] calls ''the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology''). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.

==Reception==
Materialistic views were at the time rampant and fashionable, and faith in immortality was at a low ebb. At this favourable juncture appeared Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele (Phaedo or On the Immortality of Souls; 1767). Modelled on [[Plato]]'s dialogue of the same name, Mendelssohn's work possessed some of the charm of its Greek exemplar and impressed the German world with its beauty and lucidity of style. The Phaedon was an immediate success, and besides being one of the most widely read books of its time in German it was speedily translated into several European languages, including English. The author was hailed as the "German Plato," or the "German Socrates"; royal and other aristocratic friends showered attentions on him, and it was said that "no stranger who came to Berlin failed to pay his personal respects to the German Socrates."

[[Immanuel Kant]] criticized Mendelssohn's argument for immortality in the second edition of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787), at B413–15. Commentators disagree over whether Kant's criticism is successful. Mendelssohn's arguments have been largely overlooked by contemporary analytic philosophers, but philosophers including [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[E.J. Lowe]] have offered arguments for the simplicity of the soul.

[[File:Phoenix-Fabelwesen.jpg|thumb|right|A phoenix depicted in a book of legendary creatures by [[Friedrich Justin Bertuch|FJ Bertuch]] (1747–1822)]]
In [[Greek mythology]], a '''phoenix''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|n|ᵻ|k|s}}; {{lang-grc|φοῖνιξ}}, ''phoînix'') is a long-lived [[bird]] that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. 

Associated with the Sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the [[ash]]es of its predecessor. According to some sources, the phoenix dies in a show of flames and combustion, although there are other sources that claim that the legendary bird dies and simply decomposes before being born again.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 146]}} There are different traditions concerning the lifespan of the phoenix, but by most accounts the phoenix lived for  500 years before rebirth.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA67 67&amp;ndash;70]}} [[Herodotus]], [[Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pope Clement I]], [[Lactantius]], [[Ovid]], and [[Isidore of Seville]] are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif.

In the historical record, the phoenix "could symbolize renewal in general as well as the sun, time, [[Roman Empire|the Empire]], [[metempsychosis]], [[consecration]], [[resurrection]], life in the heavenly [[Paradise]], [[Christ (title)|Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[virginity]], the exceptional man, and certain aspects of Christian life".{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9 9]}}

==Etymology==
The modern English noun ''phoenix'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''phenix'' (before 1150), itself from [[Old English]] ''fēnix'' (around 750). Old English ''fēnix'' was borrowed from Medieval Latin ''phenix'', which is derived from Classical Latin ''phoenīx''. The Classical Latin ''phoenīx'' represents Greek φοῖνιξ ''phoinīx''.{{Sfn | Barnhart | 1995 | p = 564}}

In ancient Greece and Rome, the bird, phoenix, was sometimes associated with the similar-sounding [[Phoenicia]], a civilization famous for its production of purple dye from conch shells. A late antique etymology offered by the 6th- and 7th-century CE archbishop [[Isidore of Seville]] accordingly derives the name of the phoenix from its allegedly purple-red hue. Because the costly purple dye from Phoenicia was associated with the upper classes in antiquity and, later, with royalty, in the medieval period the phoenix was considered "the royal bird".{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 51}}

In spite of these [[folk etymology|folk etymologies]], with the deciphering of the [[Linear B]] script in the 20th century, the original Greek φοῖνιξ was decisively shown to be derived from [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''po-ni-ke'', itself open to a variety of interpretations.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 62–66}}

==Relation to the Egyptian Bennu==
Classical discourse on the subject of the phoenix points to a potential origin of the phoenix in [[Ancient Egypt]]. In the 19th century scholastic suspicions appeared to be confirmed by the discovery that Egyptians in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] had venerated the [[Bennu]], a solar bird observed in some respects to be similar to the Greek phoenix.  However, the Egyptian sources regarding the bennu are often problematic and open to a variety of interpretations. Some of these sources may have actually been influenced by Greek notions of the phoenix, rather than the other way around.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 14–25}}

[[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BC, gives a somewhat skeptical account of the phoenix:

{{quote|[The Egyptians] have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow:– The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball, and puts his parent inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html Book II] Trans. G. Rawlinson (1858)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Appearance==
[[File:Phoenix_detail_from_Aberdeen_Bestiary.jpg|thumb|right|Detail from the 12th-century ''[[Aberdeen Bestiary]]'', featuring a phoenix]]
The phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|nimbus]], which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these nimbuses often have seven rays, like [[Helios]] (the sun Titan of Greek mythology).{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 246–247}} Pliny the Elder&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Magic and the Supernatural in the Modern Visual and Performing Arts'', edited by Filippo CarlÁ,Irene Berti, page172&lt;/ref&gt; also describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} and [[Ezekiel the Tragedian|Ezekiel the Dramatist]] compared it to a rooster.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}}

Although the phoenix was generally believed to be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. [[Tacitus]] says that its color made it stand out from all other birds.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 253}} Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and [[Herodotus]]'s claim of the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 259}} Ezekiel the Dramatist declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}} but [[Lactantius]] said that its eyes were blue like sapphires{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 256}} and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 257–258}}

Herodotus, Pliny, [[Solinus]], and [[Philostratus]] describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 251}} but Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was even larger than an ostrich.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 252}}

==In later European culture==
[[Dante]] refers to the phoenix in ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' Canto XXIV:
{{Verse translation|lang=it|
&lt;poem&gt;Così per li gran savi si confessa
che la fenice more e poi rinasce,
quando al cinquecentesimo anno appressa;

erba né biado in sua vita non pasce,
ma sol d’incenso lagrime e d’amomo,
e nardo e mirra son l’ultime fasce.&lt;/poem&gt;
|attr1=In the [[:s:it:Divina Commedia/Inferno/Canto XXIV|original Italian]]|
&lt;poem&gt;Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed
The phoenix dies, and then is born again,
When it approaches its five-hundredth year;

On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,
But only on tears of [[incense]] and [[amomum]],
And [[Spikenard|nard]] and [[myrrh]] are its last [[shroud|winding-sheet]].&lt;/poem&gt;
|attr2=In [[s:The Divine Comedy/Inferno/Canto XXIV|English translation]]
}}

In the play ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], the King says in [[s:The Life of King Henry the Eighth|Act V Scene v]], in flattering reference to his young daughter Elizabeth (who was to become [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]):

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
Her ashes new create another heir
As great in admiration as herself;
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was,
And so stand fix'd.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Analogues==
Scholars have observed analogues to the phoenix in a variety of cultures. These analogues include the [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] [[garuda]] and [[gandaberunda]], the [[Slavic folklore|Russian]] [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|firebird]], the [[Persian mythology|Persian]] [[Simorgh]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] paskunji, the Arabian Anka عنقاء, and from that, the [[Turkish mythology|Turkish]] Zümrüdü Anka, the [[Tibet]]an Me byi karmo, the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]] [[fenghuang]] and [[Vermilion Bird|zhu que]], and the Japanese [[fenghuang|hō-ō]].{{Sfn | Garry | El-Shamy | 2005 | pp = 84–87}}

{{Individualism sidebar}}
'''Rational egoism''' (also called '''rational selfishness''') is the principle that an action is rational if and only if it maximizes one's self-interest.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Baier (1990), p. 201; Gert (1998), p. 69; Shaver (2002), §3; Moseley (2006), §2.&lt;/ref&gt; The view is a [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] form of [[wikt:egoism|egoism]]. It is distinct from [[psychological egoism]] (according to which people are ''motivated'' only to act in their own self-interest) and [[ethical egoism]] (that moral agents ''ought'' only to do what is in their own self-interest).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Rational egoism was embodied by Russian author [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]] in the 1863 book ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Walicki|author2=Hilda Andrews-Rusiecka|title=A History of Russian Thought: From the Enlightenment to Marxism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev4ad5wKI9oC&amp;pg=PA196|year=1979|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1132-6|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chernyshevsky's standpoint was ultimately socialistic, and was criticised by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in the 1864 book ''[[Notes from Underground]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Case against Rational Egoism in Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground |author=James P. Scanlan |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=60 |issue=3 |date=July 1999 |pages=549–67 |doi=10.1353/jhi.1999.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/context.html |title=SparkNotes: Notes from Underground: Context |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[SparkNotes]] |publisher= |access-date=2015-05-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] discussed rational egoism in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', first published in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; A method of ethics is "any rational procedure by which we determine what individual human beings 'ought' – or what it is 'right' for them – to do, or seek to realize by voluntary action".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Sidgwick considers three such procedures, namely, rational egoism, dogmatic intuitionism, and [[utilitarianism]]. Rational egoism is the view that, if rational, "an agent regards quantity of consequent pleasure and pain to himself alone important in choosing between alternatives of action; and seeks always the greatest attainable surplus of pleasure over pain".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Sidgwick found it difficult to find any persuasive reason for preferring rational egoism over [[utilitarianism]]. Although utilitarianism can be provided with a rational basis and reconciled with the morality of common sense, rational egoism appears to be an equally plausible doctrine regarding what we have most reason to do. Thus we must "admit an ultimate and fundamental contradiction in our apparent intuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct; and from this admission it would seem to follow that the apparently intuitive operation of Practical Reason, manifested in these contradictory judgments, is after all illusory".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ayn Rand ==
The author and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] also discusses a theory that she called 'rational egoism'. She holds that it is both irrational and immoral to act against one's self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2006); Moseley (2006), §2a.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her view is a conjunction of both rational egoism (in the standard sense) and [[ethical egoism]], because according to [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]], egoism cannot be properly justified without an [[epistemology]] based on [[rationality|reason]]:

Her book ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' (1964) explains the concept of rational egoism in depth. According to Rand, a rational man holds his own life as his highest value, rationality as his highest [[virtue]], and his happiness as the final purpose of his life.

Conversely, Rand was sharply critical of the [[ethical altruism|ethical doctrine of altruism]]:

{{quote|Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute is ''self-sacrifice'' – which means self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial self-destruction – which means the ''self'' as a standard of evil, the ''selfless'' as a standard of the good.
Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar. This is not the issue. The issue is whether you ''do'' or do ''not'' have the right to exist ''without'' giving him that dime. The issue is whether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who might choose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue is whether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal. Any man of self-esteem will answer: ''No.'' Altruism says: ''Yes.''"&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand, "Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World," ''Philosophy: Who Needs it'', 1982, New American Library, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
Two objections to rational egoism are given by the English philosopher [[Derek Parfit]], who discusses the theory at length in ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;D. Parfit (1984), parts II and III&lt;/ref&gt; First, from the rational egoist point of view, it is rational to contribute to a [[pension scheme]] now, even though this is detrimental to one's present interests (which are to spend the money now). But it seems equally reasonable to maximize one's interests now, given that one's reasons are not only relative to him, but to him as he is now (and not his future self, who is argued to be a "different" person). Parfit also argues that since the connections between the present mental state and the mental state of one's future self may decrease, it is not plausible to claim that one should be indifferent between one's present and future self.

The "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]" model of [[evolution]] suggests that human (and animal) behaviors that seem altruistic are actually selfish, if viewed from the perspective of [[Gene|genes]]/[[Phenotype|phenotypes]].  People help each other "selflessly" because copies of their own genes also exist in others, so behaviors that help the genes survive are [[Natural selection|selected]] for, with the altruistic drive [[Kin selection|decreasing with genetic distance]].

{{short description|theme in fiction and legends}}
{{broader|Rotating locomotion in living systems}}
[[Legend]]s and [[speculative fiction]] reveal a longstanding human fascination with [[Rotating locomotion in living systems|rolling and wheeled creatures]]. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe,{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} Japan,{{r|Pruett}} [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Mexico,{{r|Gambino}} the United States, and Australia,{{r|Full93}} and in numerous modern works.

==Rolling creatures==
[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]
The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}}

[[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s 1825 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having "the shape of a star or wheel".{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} The 1863 edition of this book featured an illustration by [[Louis Le Breton]], depicting a creature with five legs radially arranged.{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

[[Neil R. Jones]]' 1937 story "On the Planet Fragment" featured aliens dubbed the Disci, which were shaped like wheels with limbs around the circumference. One of their methods of locomotion was a "rolling motion like that of a cartwheel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?87356|title=Internet Speculative Fiction Database entry for "On the Planet Fragment"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.isfdb.org|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1944 science fiction short story "[[Arena (short story)|Arena]]", by [[Fredric Brown]], features a telepathic alien called an Outsider, which is roughly spherical and moves by rolling.{{r|Brown}} The story was the basis for a 1967 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode of the [[Arena (Star Trek)|same name]], and possibly also a 1964 episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' entitled [[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|"Fun and Games"]], though neither television treatment included a spherical creature.{{r|arena}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] invented a creature that was capable of rolling itself forward, which he named ''Pedalternorotandomovens centroculatus articulosus''. He illustrated this creature in his 1951 lithograph {{lang|nl|[[Curl-up|Wentelteefje]]}} (also known by the English title ''Curl-up'').{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Escher}}

A 1956 [[Scrooge McDuck]] comic, ''[[Land Beneath the Ground!]]'', by [[Carl Barks]], introduced Terries and Fermies (a play on the phrase ''[[wikt:terra firma|terra firma]]''), creatures who move from place to place by rolling. The Terries and Fermies have made a sport of their rolling abilities, causing earthquakes in the process.{{r|coa1}}{{r|coa2}}

Northern Irish author [[James White (author)|James White]]'s [[Sector General]] series features "Rollers" from the planet Drambo, doughnut-shaped aquatic organisms that do not have [[heart]]s, but which instead must roll continuously to maintain [[Circulatory system|circulation]] by means of gravity.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|Louie}} The Rollers are described in the short story "Spacebird" in the 1980 edition of ''[[Ambulance Ship]]'', and in other works in the series.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|"Final_Diagnosis"}}{{r|"Double_Contact"}}

In ''[[The Citadel of Chaos]]'' (1983) by [[Steve Jackson (British game designer)|Steve Jackson]], the reader may encounter Wheelies, disc-shaped creatures with four arms who move by doing [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]].&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomson|first1=Neil|title=Fighting Fantasy Reviewed - The Citadel of Chaos|url=https://rpggeek.com/thread/488700/fighting-fantasy-reviewed-citadel-chaos|website=RPGGeek|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Steve|title=The Citadel of Chaos|date=1983|isbn=978-1-84831-076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tuf Voyaging]]'', a 1986 science fiction novel by [[George R. R. Martin]], features an alien called a Rolleram, described as a "berserk living cannonball of enormous size", which kills its prey by rolling over it and crushing it, before digesting it externally. Adults of the species weigh approximately six metric tons and can roll faster than {{convert|50|kph|mph|abbr=off}}.{{r|martin}}

In the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991, the eponymous [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and his sidekick [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]] move by rolling.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

The 1995 short story "Microbe", by [[Kenyon College]] biologist and [[feminist science fiction]] writer [[Joan Slonczewski]], describes an exploratory expedition to an alien world whose plant and animal life consists entirely of [[torus|doughnut-shaped]] organisms.{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}}

==Wheeled creatures==
Toy animals with wheels dating from the [[Pre-Columbian era]] were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

[[File:Wheeler Ozma of Oz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=L. Frank Baum's "Wheeler"|A "Wheeler" in L. Frank Baum's ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' (Illustration by [[John R. Neill]])]]
{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
[[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}}  Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}} They also make an appearance in the 1985 film ''[[Return to Oz]]'', based partly on  ''Ozma of Oz''.

The 1968 novel ''[[The Goblin Reservation]]'' by [[Clifford D. Simak]] features an intelligent alien race that uses biological wheels.{{r|Simak}}

''[[Chorlton and the Wheelies]]'', a British [[stop motion|stop-motion]]-animated television series that aired from 1976 to 1979, was set in "Wheelie World", which was inhabited by three-wheeled creatures called "wheelies".{{r|Toonhound}}

[[Piers Anthony]]'s 1977 book ''[[Cluster (novels)|Cluster]]'' and its sequels feature aliens called Polarians, which locomote by gripping and balancing atop a large ball. The ball is a living, though temporarily separable, portion of the Polarian's body.{{r|anthony}}

[[David Brin]]'s [[Uplift Universe|''Uplift'' Universe]] includes a wheeled species called the g'Kek, which are described in some detail in the 1995 novel ''[[Brightness Reef]]''.{{r|Brin95}} In 1996's ''[[Infinity's Shore]]'', a g'Kek is described as looking like "a squid in a wheelchair." The g'Kek suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles in their old age, particularly when living in a [[gravitational biology|high gravity environment]].{{r|Brin95}}{{r|Brin96}}

A 1997 novel in the ''[[Animorphs]]'' series, ''[[The Andalite Chronicles]]'', includes an alien called a Mortron, composed of two separate entities: a yellow and black bottom half with four wheels, and a red, elongated head with razor-sharp teeth and concealed wings.{{r|Applegate}}

The 2000 novel ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]'', by English author [[Philip Pullman]], features an alien race known as the [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]], which have diamond-shaped bodies with one leg at the front and back and one on each side. The Mulefa use large, disk-shaped seed pods as wheels. They mount the pods on bone axles on their front and back legs, while propelling themselves with their side legs. The Mulefa have a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with the seed pod trees, which depend on the rolling action to crack open the pods and allow the seeds to [[Seed dispersal|disperse]].{{r|Pullman}}

In the 2000 novel [[Wheelers (novel)|''Wheelers'']], by English mathematician [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and reproductive biologist [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], a [[Jupiter|Jovian]] species called "blimps" has developed the ability to biologically produce machines called "wheelers", which use wheels for locomotion.{{r|Stewart}}{{r|kirkus}}

The children's television series ''[[Jungle Junction]]'', which premiered in 2009, features hybrid jungle animals with wheels rather than legs;{{r|BBC-Jungle}} one such animal, Ellyvan, is a hybrid of an [[elephant]] and a [[van]].{{r|junglejunction}} These animals traverse their habitat on elevated [[highway]]s.{{r|disney}}

===Finnish Eurovision Song Contest selections (2011, 2016, 2018)===
Saara Aalto took part on two separate occasions in the selection process in a bid to represent Finland in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. She participated in the qualifying rounds in Finland for [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|Eurovision 2011]] with her self-penned song "[[:fi:Blessed with Love|Blessed with Love]]", placing second to [[Paradise Oskar]] who went on to represent Finland with his song "[[Da Da Dam]]". She received 40.7% of the public televotes, compared to 46.7% for Oskar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finland sends Paradise Oskar to Düsseldorf!|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=25203&amp;_t=finland_sends_paradise_oskar_to_duesseldorf|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aalto's recording was released as a single by Yume Records, a self-release record label she founded together with Teemu Roivainen in 2011.

Her second bid to represent Finland was for [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]] through the competition ''[[Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu]]'' where she sang another of her own compositions titled "No Fear", again placing second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/ensimmaiset_umk-finalistit_valittu__onko_joku_heista_suomen_euroviisuedustaja/8654646|title=Ensimmäiset UMK-finalistit valittu – onko joku heistä Suomen euroviisuedustaja?|publisher=Yle |date=6 February 2016 |accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although winning the public vote, she was disadvantaged with the judging vote going to the eventual winner [[Sandhja]] who went on to represent Finland with the song "[[Sing It Away]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UMK 2016: FINLAND REVEALS FULL RESULTS OF TELEVOTE AND JURIES|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2016/03/02/umk-2016-full-results-revealed/129687/|publisher=wiwibloggs.com |accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview Aalto described her music.&lt;ref name=Rojas/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I call my music Epic Love Pop! I love dramatic and emotional music with a show feeling. I also want to bring love, joy and encouragement for everybody; be yourself and inspire others! I’ve studied piano since I was a little kid and through music schools, singing competitions, my career and concerts (in Finland and all over the world) I’ve gotten lots of experience and confidence to be who I am as an artist. (...) I’ve performed in musicals and big shows in Finland. (...) I’m happy to be versatile performer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Saara Aalto represented Finland in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]]. The decision was made by the Finnish national broadcaster [[Yleisradio|Yle]].

Finding great reception from Chinese audiences, in July 2013 Aalto went on to release a full album destined for [[Mainland China]] and other Chinese markets also titled ''Ai De Zhu Fu''. On the album she performed nine of the album's 13 tracks in [[Mandarin language]].

===''The Voice of Finland'' (2012)===
Aalto participated in [[The Voice of Finland (season 1)|season one]] of ''[[The Voice of Finland]]''. In the blind auditions, broadcast on 6 February 2012 on the Finnish commercial television channel [[Nelonen]], she performed "[[Taking Chances (song)|Taking Chances]]" from [[Celine Dion]] with all four coaches, [[Elastinen]], [[Lauri Tähkä]], [[Paula Koivuniemi]] and [[Michael Monroe]] turning their chairs. She opted to be part of Team Monroe.

In the Battle Round on 17 February, she was confronted with team competitor Anna Inginmaa, both singing "[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]". Coach Monroe opted for Aalto to go to the next round. In the live show on 23 March, she sang "[[Barracuda (song)|Barracuda]]" and was saved by Monroe after failing to get enough votes from the public. She followed it up with the French language "Je suis malade" from [[Serge Lama]] and was safe after the public vote. In the semifinals with her rendition of "[[Over the Rainbow]]", she qualified for the finals held on 20 April where she sang "[[I'm Gonna Be Strong]]" from [[Frankie Laine]] and an original song titled "My Love". She placed second to winner Mikko Sipola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/viihde/2012020315152992_vi.shtml |title=Voice of Finland: Riitaa laulajista! &amp;#124; Viihde |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The X Factor UK'', Eurovision Song Contest and ''Wild Wild Wonderland''===
Aalto auditioned for the [[The X Factor (UK series 13)|thirteenth UK series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2016, singing a cover of [[Sia Furler|Sia]]'s "[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]", which earned her three yeses from the attending judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2016/08/28/finlands-saara-aalto-nails-x-factor-uk-audition/149412/|title="That's How You Do It!" Finland's Saara Aalto Nails X Factor UK Audition|date=29 August 2016|publisher=Wiwibloggs|website=wiwibloggs.com|last=Rahn|first=Florian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the bootcamp, she performed "[[On the Radio (Donna Summer song)|On the Radio]]" by [[Donna Summer]] and was sent through as part of the over-25s category with [[Sharon Osbourne]] as her mentor. At the six-chair challenge, she performed "[[I See Fire]]" by [[Ed Sheeran]] and was sent home by Osbourne who stated a lack of connection. However, after the crowd chanted to bring her back, Aalto was given a chance to perform [[Serge Lama]]'s "[[Je suis malade (song)|Je suis malade]]", which caused the crowd to turn on her, while [[Nicole Scherzinger]] criticized her song choice, stating "we ain't in France". Osbourne then asked Aalto to leave. 

Aalto was brought back as Scherzinger's wildcard pick for the over-25s category and therefore went to judges' houses. She was chosen to proceed to the live shows after performing [[ABBA]]'s "[[The Winner Takes It All]]". In week 1 of the live shows, Aalto finished in the bottom three after performing "[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]" and faced a sing-off against the duo Bratavio, where she performed "[[Alive (Sia song)|Alive]]" by Sia. Aalto was saved with only [[Louis Walsh]] voting to eliminate her, though praising her performance. The following week, she sang "[[River Deep – Mountain High]]" and finished again in the bottom three, performing "[[Run (Snow Patrol song)|Run]]" by [[Snow Patrol]] in a sing-off against Freddy Parker. The result went to deadlock and Aalto was saved as she had the greater public vote. In week 3 she performed "[[It's Oh So Quiet]]" coming 2nd in the public vote, and in week 4 Aalto sang "[[Bad Romance]]", placing 3rd in the public vote. In week 5, Aalto finished in the bottom three for the third time after her rendition of "[[Sound of the Underground (song)|Sound of the Underground]]", but was saved by majority vote after performing "[[Who You Are (Jessie J song)|Who You Are]]" in a sing-off against the group Four of Diamonds. Her following performances were "[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]" in week 6 placing 2nd and "[[My Heart Will Go On]]" in week 7 again placing 2nd. In week 8, she sang "The Winner Takes It All" and a medley of "[[Diamonds Are Forever (soundtrack)|Diamonds Are Forever]]" and "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]", topping the public vote for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting stats 2016 revealed |url=http://www.itv.com/xfactor/news/voting-stats-2016|website=[[Itv.com|ITV]]|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the eliminations of Relley C in week 3 and Honey G in week 8, Aalto became Osbourne's last remaining act in the competition.

In the semifinals on 3 December, she sang a medley of "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" and "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]", and "Chandelier" as 2nd song, topping the vote again reaching the Final 3, where on 10 December she performed "[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]" and "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", the latter as a duet with [[Adam Lambert]], again topping the public vote. With the elimination of the group [[5 After Midnight]] she was in the Final 2 facing [[Matt Terry]]. In the Final on 11 December, she performed "It's Oh So Quiet" and "[[I Didn't Know My Own Strength (Whitney Houston song)|I Didn't Know My Own Strength]]". In the ensuing public vote, she placed as the runner-up to eventual winner Matt Terry with 40.4% of the votes.

      <comment>I added a reference to a book that discusses the concept of fulfillment.</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5553">In philosophy and psychology, '''self-fulfillment''' is the realizing of one's deepest desires and capacities. The history of this concept can be traced to [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers and it still remains a notable concept in modern philosophy.

==Definition and history==
Philosopher [[Alan Gewirth]] in his book ''Self-Fulfillment'' defined self-fulfillment as "carrying to fruition one's deepest desires or one's worthiest capacities."&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Another definition states that self-fulfillment is "the attainment of a satisfying and worthwhile life well lived."&lt;ref name="Kerr2009"/&gt; It is an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] that can be traced to [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers, and one that has been common and popular in both Western and non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Self-fulfillment is often seen as superior to other values and goals.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;

Gewirth notes that "to seek for a good human life is to seek for self-fulfillment".&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; However, in modern philosophy, the ideal of self-fulfillment has become less popular, criticized by thinkers such as [[Hobbes]] and [[Freud]], who feel there are conceptual and moral problems associated with it.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; It has been called an [[Egotism|egoistic]] concept, impossible to achieve, with some suggesting that it is an obsolete concept that should be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;  Moral philosophers focus less on obtaining a good life, and more on interpersonal relations and duties owed to others.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;  Similarly, whereas [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw the goal of the [[polis]] in providing a means of self-fulfillment to citizens, modern governments have given up on that, focusing rather on maintaining [[civic order]].&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Despite the criticism, the concept of self-fulfillment still persists in modern philosophy, its usefulness defended by thinkers such as Gewirth himself.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;

Gewirth noted that the term self-fulfillment has two near [[synonyms]]: [[self-realization]] and [[self-actualization]], used respectively by philosophers and humanist psychologists, whereas the term self-fulfillment is more commonly used outside those expert fields.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-6-8"/&gt; Gewirth however argues that this concept is sufficiently different from those others to merit not being used as a synonym.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-6-8"/&gt; Self-actualization in particular, often discussed in the context of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], is frequently defined as the "need for self-fulfillment".&lt;ref name="ReeceBrandt2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PastorinoDoyle-Portillo2012"/&gt;

Dr. Ben Carvosso in his book ''Life CEO - Take Charge, and start doing your life's work, not your busy work'' discussed the prevalence of individuals who's lives are busy, full but unfulfilled. Individuals who's lives are unfulfilled because something is missing and who come to the mistaken conclusion (driven by cleaver marketing by big corporations) that the solution is work harder and make more money to somehow make more time. Self-fulfillment comes from knowing what you really want, not what society says you should want.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1041112060|title=Life CEO : take charge and start doing your life's work not your busy work|last=Ben,|first=Carvosso,|isbn=9780648216704|location=[place of publication not identified]|oclc=1041112060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its only when we connect with what we really want that we experience true joy or [[Eudaimonia]].

Self-fulfillment has been positively connected to [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="Kerr2009"/&gt;

'''Sentientism''' is an ethical philosophy that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Linzey|first1=A|title=Sentientism|journal=Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare|date=1998|page=311|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/LINS-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sentientism extends [[humanism]] by showing compassion for non-human animals as well as potential artificial and alien intelligences.  In common with humanism, sentientism rejects supernatural beliefs in favour of critical, evidence-based thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Woodhouse |first1=Jamie |title=Humanism needs an upgrade |url=https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/07/humanism-needs-an-upgrade-the-philosophy-that-could-save-the-world/ |website=Areo |accessdate=21 November 2018|date=2018-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sentientism proposes that sentience, the ability to experience suffering or flourishing, should determine whether we grant moral consideration to an entity&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Sentientism|journal=The Great Ape Project|pages=220–222|date=1993|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/RYDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Non-sentient entities do not warrant direct moral consideration because they can not experience the implications of our decisions.

Sentientist thinking has a long history, from [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book
|last = Bentham
|first = Jeremy
|authorlink = 
|title = An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation
|publisher = Methuen
|series =  
|year = 1780
|doi = 
|isbn = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; through to contemporary philosophers such as [[Richard D. Ryder]] and [[Peter Singer]].

Sentientism differs from [[Speciesism]] in that it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species boundaries, to grant degrees of moral consideration.

Sentientism differs from [[painism]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Painism versus utilitarianism|journal=Think|date=2009|volume=8|issue=21|page=85|doi=10.1017/S1477175608000420|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/think/article/painism-versus-utilitarianism/8C7F06412FC4DC9305BAA3D6E5871109}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it acknowledges the full range of experience, not just that of pain, in warranting moral consideration. 

Sentientism agrees with [[Animalism (philosophy)|Animalism]] that humans are animals so both warrant moral consideration. However, sentientism argues that non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences, would also warrant moral consideration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1173">[[Image:Bathsheba solomon david.jpg|thumb|right| [[Abishag]] the Shunamite tends to aging David, c. 1435]]

'''Shunamitism''' is the practice of an old man sleeping with, but not necessarily having sex with, a young [[virgin]] to preserve his youth.  The rationale was that the heat and moisture of the young woman would transfer to the old man and revitalize him.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Shapin and Christopher Martyn, “How to live forever: lessons of history”, [[British Medical Journal]], BMJ 2000;321;1580-1582]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is based on the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[David|King David]] and [[Abishag]], a young woman from [[Shunem]].  When King David was old and could not stay warm, his servants found Abishag to sleep with him, though he had no intimate relations with her: therefore, she was still a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Among scientific physicians, both [[Thomas Sydenham]] (17th century) and [[Herman Boerhaave]] (18th century) prescribed shunamitism for their patients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7295">'''Thanatosensitivity''' describes an [[epistemological]]-[[methodological]] approach into [[technological]] research and design that actively seeks to integrate the facts of mortality, [[dying]], and [[death]] into traditional [[user-centered design]]. First coined by Michael Massimi and Andrea Charise from the [[University of Toronto]] in a joint paper presented at [[CHI (conference)|CHI]] 2009, ''thanatosensitivity'' refers to a [[humanistic]]ally grounded approach to [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI) research and design that recognizes and engages with the conceptual and [[practical]] issues surrounding death in the creation of interactive systems.&lt;ref name=ddm&gt;{{Cite book|last=Massimi|first=Michael|author2=Andrea Charise |title=Dying, death, and mortality: towards thanatosensitivity in HCI|journal=CHI EA '09: Proceedings of the 27th International Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|year=2009|pages=2459–2468|doi=10.1145/1520340.1520349|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1520349|isbn=9781605582474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term thanatosensitive is derived from the [[ancient Greek]] [[mythological]] [[personification]] of death, [[Thanatos]] (Greek: Θάνατος (Thánatos), "Death"), which is itself a term associated with the notion of the [[death drive]] common to 20th-century post-[[Freudian]] thought. This [[Interdisciplinarity|inter]]- or [[Multidisciplinarity|multi-disciplinarity]] is crucial to thanatosensitive investigation because, unlike many areas of HCI research, studies of death and mortality are rarely amenable to [[laboratory]] study or traditional [[fieldwork]] approaches. As Massimi and Charise argue, the critical [[Humanism|humanist]] aspect of thanatosensitivity effectively offers "a non-invasive strategy for better understanding the conceptual and practical issues surrounding death, computing, and human experience".&lt;ref name=ddm /&gt;

== Conceptual and practical applications ==

Historically, design and research in the [[computer sciences]] has rarely considered the issues pursuant to the death of the [[user (computing)|user]]. However, Lindley et al. note, "[s]hifts in the field of HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) coupled with the growing maturity of interactive technologies is leading researchers and designers to consider issues relating to mortality."&lt;ref name=xant&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindley|first=Siân E.|author2=Eduardo H.

A 2004 news story describes how [[Yahoo!]] denied the family of Justin Ellsworth, a deceased [[US marine]], access to his [[email]], preventing them from accessing information necessary for handling the aftermath of the account owner's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo denies family access to dead marine's e-mail |publisher=CNET News |date=December 21, 2004 |url=http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo-denies-family-access-to-dead-marines-e-mail/2100-1038_3-5500057.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining how digital information and artefacts "can be bequeathed, inherited, and appropriately repurposed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dundee.academia.edu/WendyMoncur/Papers/449465/Digital_Inheritance |author=Wendy Moncur |author2=Annalu Waller |year=2010|title=Digital Inheritance |at=RCUK Digital Futures 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while accounting for the complexity of [[Digital privacy|privacy concerns]] presents a new horizon of human-computer interaction research. "At a fundamental level, such issues are becoming increasingly prominent as technology companies decide how to handle email accounts or webpages belonging to people who are now deceased."&lt;ref name=xant /&gt; Recent scholarship in this area has called for the development of more purposive applications for facilitating the inheritance of digital materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiley|first=Cyndi|title=HCI International 2011 – Posters' Extended Abstracts|year=2011|publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-22098-2|pages=474–478|author2=Wang, Yun |author3=Musselman, Ryan |author4=Krumm, Beverly |author5= Stephanidis, Constantine |editor=Constantine Stephanidis|chapter=Connecting Generations: Preserving Memories with Thanatosensitive Technologies|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-22098-2_95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the ways in which people use technology in practices concerning mortality, dying, and death are areas of HCI research that have historically received little attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmrussell.net/CHI2010/docs/p4477.pdf |title=HCI at the end of life: Understanding death, dying, and the digital |at=Proc.

Such "thanatechnologies"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carla Sofka|author2=Kathleen Gilbert |author3=Illene Noppe  |title=Thanatechnology: Dying, Death, and Grief in an Online Universe|publisher=Springer Publishing Company |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-8261-0732-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; seek to meet numerous needs, including [[memorial]]isation, [[Grief|bereavement]] support and communication, [[archiving]], access to information and resources, and so on. While many thanatechnologies exist, relatively few are the product of a thanatosensitive design process; rather, they are appropriations of general purpose technologies. For example, forum management software is not explicitly concerned with the mortality of its users; however, online forums are a common place for the bereaved to communicate regarding loss in the form of formal and (more commonly) informal online memorials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uci.academia.edu/JedBrubaker/Papers/368823/Death_and_the_Social_Network |author=Jed Brubaker|author2=Janet Vertesi  |title=Death and the Social Network |at=Paper presented at the CHI 2010 workshop HCI at the End of Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 3D virtual worlds are beginning to be explored as spaces for informal memorialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Death, Social Networks and Virtual Worlds: A Look into the Digital Afterlife |last1=Braman |first1=James |last2=Dudley |first2=Alfreda |last3=Vincenti |first3=Giovanni |date=2011 |journal= 9th International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications (SERA), 2011 IEEE |pages=186–192 |doi=10.1109/SERA.2011.35|isbn=978-1-4577-1028-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timo Antero Aaltonen''' (born 11 April 1969 in [[Vehmaa]], [[Southwest Finland]]) is a 189-cm tall [[Finland|Finnish]] [[shot putter]] who weighs 130&amp;nbsp;kg and competes for [[Turun Urheiluliitto]], which is the same club that [[Paavo Nurmi]] ran for. He competed and won a [[gold medal]] at the [[2000 European Indoor Athletics Championships]] with a qualifying put of 20.57&amp;nbsp;m and a final put of 20.62&amp;nbsp;m.

Aaltonen was the 13th member to be inducted into the [[20 meter club]] after he putted the shot 20.12&amp;nbsp;m in a competition on 20 June 1998 in [[Kuortane]], [[Finland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1351">"'''What the Dead Men Say'''" is a [[science fiction]] [[novella]] by American writer [[Philip K. Dick]], first published in ''[[Worlds of Tomorrow (magazine)|Worlds of Tomorrow]]'' magazine in June 1964. The manuscript, originally titled "Man With a Broken Match", was received by Dick's agent on 15 April 1963.

==Plot summary==
[[Death]] is followed by a period of '[[half-life]]', a short amount of time which can be rationed out over long periods in which the dead can be revived—so that, potentially, they can 'live' on for a long time. When attempts to bring back important businessman Louis Sarapis fail, it's clearly more than mere negligence. Sure enough, Sarapis starts speaking from beyond the grave. From [[outer space]], in fact. Yet no-one seems terribly bothered, other than those directly concerned in the plot mechanics. Eventually entire [[communications networks]] (phones, TV, radio) are blocked by Sarapis' broadcasts.

The concept of 'half-life' was used again and developed in Dick's 1969 novel ''[[Ubik]]'', which even re-uses a page of the novella verbatim.

'''Xenotransplantation''' (''xenos-'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning "foreign" or strange&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dooldeniya |first1=M D , |last2=Warrens |first2=AN |title=Xenotransplantation: where are we today? |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539416/ |website=NCBI |publisher=NCBI |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mitchell |first1=C Ben |title=Xenotransplanation and Transgenics: The Need to Discuss Limits |url=https://cbhd.org/content/xenotransplanation-and-transgenics-need-discuss-limits |website=Cbhd |publisher=Cbhd |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or '''heterologous transplant''' is the [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] of living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[biological tissue|tissue]]s or [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s from one [[species]] to another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/transplantation/xeno/en/ Xenotransplantation]. Definition by the World Health Organization&lt;/ref&gt; Such cells, tissues or organs are called '''xenografts''' or '''xenotransplants'''. It is contrasted with [[allotransplantation]] (from other individual of same species), [[Syngenic|syngeneic]] transplantation or isotransplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and [[autotransplantation]] (from one part of the body to another in the same person).

Xenotransplantation of human [[tumor]] cells into [[immunocompromised]] mice is a research technique frequently used in pre-clinical [[oncology]] research.

Human xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for end-stage [[organ failure]], a significant health problem in parts of the [[industrialized world]].  It also raises many novel medical, legal and ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kress | first1 = J. M. | title = Xenotransplantation: Ethics and economics | journal = Food and drug law journal | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 353–384 | year = 1998 | pmid = 10346691}}&lt;/ref&gt; A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have a shorter lifespan than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate. Disease transmission ([[xenozoonosis]]) and permanent alteration to the genetic code of animals are also causes for concern. Similarly to objections to [[animal testing]], animal rights activists have also objected to xenotransplantation on ethical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/organfarm/interviews/lyons.html |title=Interviews - Dan Lyons |publisher=PBS |access-date=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few temporarily successful cases of xenotransplantation are published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/596_xeno.html  |title=Organ Transplants from Animals: Examining the Possibilities |publisher=Internet Archive |work=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071210031618/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/596_xeno.html |archivedate = 2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for patients and physicians to use the term "allograft" imprecisely to refer to either allograft (human-to-human) or xenograft (animal-to-human), but it is helpful scientifically (for those searching or reading the [[scientific literature]]) to maintain the more precise distinction in [[usage]].

==History==

The first serious attempts at xenotransplantation (then called heterotransplantation) appeared in the scientific literature in 1905, when slices of rabbit kidney were transplanted into a child with [[renal insufficiency]].&lt;ref name=History1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reemtsma|first1=K|title=Xenotransplantation: A Historical Perspective.|journal=ILAR journal|date=1995|volume=37|issue=1|pages=9–12|pmid=11528018|url=https://academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article/37/1/9/760596/Xenotransplantation-A-Historical-Perspective|doi=10.1093/ilar.37.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two decades of the 20th century, several subsequent efforts attempts to use organs from lambs, pigs and primates were published.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

Scientific interest in xenotransplantation declined when the [[immunological]] basis of the organ rejection process was described. The next waves of studies on the topic came with the discovery of [[immunosuppressive drug]]s.  Even more studies followed Dr. [[Joseph Murray]]'s first successful [[kidney transplantation|renal transplantation]] in 1954 and scientists, facing the ethical questions of organ donation for the first time, accelerated their effort in looking for alternatives to human organs.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

In 1963, doctors at [[Tulane University]] attempted [[chimpanzee]]-to-human renal transplantations in six people who were near death; after this and several subsequent unsuccessful attempts to use primates as organ donors and the development of a working cadaver organ procuring program, interest in xenotransplantation for kidney failure dissipated.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

An American infant girl known as "[[Baby Fae]]" with [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]] was the first infant recipient of a xenotransplantation, when she received a [[baboon]] heart in 1983. The procedure was performed by [[Leonard L. Bailey]] at [[Loma Linda University Medical Center]] in [[Loma Linda, California]]. Fae died 21 days later due to a [[Humoral immunity|humoral-based]] [[graft rejection]] thought to be caused mainly by an ABO [[blood type]] mismatch, considered unavoidable due to the rarity of type O baboons. The graft was meant to be temporary, but unfortunately a suitable [[allograft]] replacement could not be found in time. While the procedure itself did not advance the progress on xenotransplantation, it did shed a light on the insufficient amount of organs for infants. The story grew so big that it made such an impact that the crisis of infant organ shortage improved for that time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.1985.03360230053022 | last1 = Bailey | first1 = L.

''JAX® NOTES'' Issue 508, Winter 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Human organs have been transplanted into animals as a powerful research technique for studying [[human biology]] without harming human patients. This technique has also been proposed as an alternative source of human organs for future transplantation into human patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis |first=Tanya |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/growing-human-kidneys-in-rats-sparks-ethical-debate/ |title=Growing human kidneys in rats sparks ethical debate |publisher=CBS News |date=2015-01-21 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, researchers from the [[Ganogen Research Institute]] transplanted [[human]] [[fetal]] [[kidneys]] into rats which demonstrated life supporting function and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/ajt.13149 |pmid=25645705|title=Arterial Flow Regulator Enables Transplantation and Growth of Human Fetal Kidneys in Rats|journal=American Journal of Transplantation|volume=15|issue=6|pages=1692–700|year=2015|last1=Chang|first1=N.

==Potential uses==
A worldwide shortage of organs for clinical implantation causes about 20–35% of patients who need replacement organs to die on the waiting list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Healy | first1 = D. G. | last2 = Lawler | first2 = Z. | last3 = McEvoy | first3 = O. | last4 = Parlon | first4 = B. | last5 = Baktiari | first5 = N. | last6 = Egan | first6 = J.

If [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] can be perfected, it could allow for long-term storage of xenogenic cells, tissues and organs so that they would be more readily available for transplant.

Xenotransplants could save thousands of patients waiting for donated organs. The animal organ, probably from a pig or baboon could be genetically altered with human genes to trick a patient’s immune system into accepting it as a part of its own body. They have re-emerged because of the lack of organs available and the constant battle to keep immune systems from [[Transplant rejection|rejecting]] allotransplants. Xenotransplants are thus potentially a more effective alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Platt JL, Cascalho M |title= New and old technologies for organ replacement|journal= Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages= 179–85|pmid=23449347|year= 2013|doi= 10.1097/MOT.0b013e32835f0887|pmc=4911019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3501885 |pmid= 23172951|year= 2012|author1= Van Der Windt|first1= D.

== Potential animal organ donors ==

Since they are the closest relatives to humans, non-human primates were first considered as a potential organ source for xenotransplantation to humans. Chimpanzees were originally considered the best option since their organs are of similar size, and they have good blood type compatibility with humans, which makes them potential candidates for [[xenotransfusion]]s. However, since chimpanzees are listed as an endangered species, other potential donors were sought. Baboons are more readily available, but impractical as potential donors. Problems include their smaller body size, the infrequency of blood group O (the universal donor), their long gestation period, and their typically small number of offspring. In addition, a major problem with the use of nonhuman primates is the increased risk of disease transmission, since they are so closely related to humans.&lt;ref name=michler1996&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Michler | first1 = R. | title = Xenotransplantation: Risks, Clinical Potential, and Future Prospects | doi = 10.3201/eid0201.960111 | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–70 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8903201 | pmc =2639801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestic pig|Pig]]s (''Sus scrofa domesticus'') are currently thought to be the best candidates for organ donation. The risk of cross-species disease transmission is decreased because of their increased phylogenetic distance from humans.&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dooldeniya | first1 = M.

In the field of regenerative medicine, pancreatogenesis- or nephrogenesis-disabled pig embryos, unable to form a specific organ, allow experimentation toward the ''in vivo'' generation of functional organs from xenogenic pluripotent stem cells in large animals via compensation for an empty developmental niche (blastocyst complementation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Matsunari Hitomi |author2=Nagashima Hiroshi |author3=Watanabe Masahito | year = | title = and Hiromitsu Nakauchi (2013).

==Barriers and issues==

=== Immunologic barriers ===

To date no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to the many obstacles arising from the response of the recipient’s [[immune system]]. "Xenozoonoses" are one of the biggest threats to rejections, as they are xenogenetic infections. The introduction of these microorganisms are a big issue that lead ti the fatal infections and then rejection of the organs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boneva |first1=RS |last2=Folks |first2=TM |last3=Chapman |first3=LE |title=Infectious disease issues in xenotransplantation. |journal=Clinical microbiology reviews |date=January 2001 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1-14 |doi=10.1128/CMR.14.1.1-14.2001 |pmid=11148000}}&lt;/ref&gt;This response, which is generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and can in some cases result in the immediate death of the recipient. There are several types of rejection organ xenografts are faced with, these include: 
* Hyperacute rejection
* Acute vascular rejection
* Cellular rejection
* Chronic rejection

A rapid, violent, and hyperacute response comes as a result of [[antibodies]] present in the host organism. These antibodies are known as xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNAs).&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003/&gt;

==== Hyperacute rejection ====

This rapid and violent type of rejection occurs within minutes to hours from the time of the transplant. It is mediated by the binding of XNAs (xenoreactive natural antibodies) to the donor endothelium, causing activation of the human [[complement system]], which results in endothelial damage, inflammation, thrombosis and necrosis of the transplant. XNAs are first produced and begin circulating in the blood in neonates, after colonization of the bowel by bacteria with galactose moieties on their cell walls. Most of these antibodies are the [[IgM]] class, but also include [[IgG]], and [[IgA]].&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

The epitope XNAs target is an α-linked galactose moiety, Gal-α-1,3Gal (also called the α-Gal epitope), produced by the enzyme α-galactosyl transferase.&lt;ref name=candinas2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Candinas | first1 = D. | last2 = Adams | first2 = D. H. | title = Xenotransplantation: Postponed by a millennium? | doi = 10.1093/qjmed/93.2.63 | journal = QJM | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 63–66 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10700475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most non-primates contain this enzyme thus, this epitope is present on the organ epithelium and is perceived as a foreign [[antigen]] by primates, which lack the galactosyl transferase enzyme. In pig to primate xenotransplantation, XNAs recognize porcine glycoproteins of the integrin family.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

The binding of XNAs initiate complement activation through the [[classical complement pathway]]. Complement activation causes a cascade of events leading to: destruction of endothelial cells, platelet degranulation, inflammation, coagulation, fibrin deposition, and hemorrhage. The end result is [[thrombosis]] and [[necrosis]] of the xenograft.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

===== Overcoming hyperacute rejection =====

Since hyperacute rejection presents such a barrier to the success of xenografts, several strategies to overcome it are under investigation:

''Interruption of the complement cascade'' 
*The recipient's complement cascade can be inhibited through the use of cobra venom factor (which depletes C3), soluble complement receptor type 1, anti-C5 antibodies, or C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). Disadvantages of this approach include the toxicity of cobra venom factor, and most importantly these treatments would deprive the individual of a functional complement system.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

''Transgenic organs (Genetically engineered pigs)'' 
*1,3 galactosyl transferase gene knockouts – These pigs don’t contain the gene that codes for the enzyme responsible for expression of the immunogeneic gal-α-1,3Gal moiety (the α-Gal epitope).&lt;ref name=latemple&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3089.1998.tb00027.x | last1 = Latemple | first1 = D.

*Increased expression of H-transferase (α 1,2 fucosyltransferase), an enzyme that competes with galactosyl transferase. Experiments have shown this reduces α-Gal expression by 70%.&lt;ref name=sharma&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.14.7190 | last1 = Sharma | first1 = A. | last2 = Okabe | first2 = J. | last3 = Birch | first3 = P. | last4 = McClellan | first4 = S.

*Expression of human complement regulators ([[CD55]], [[CD46]], and [[CD59]]) to inhibit the complement cascade.&lt;ref name=huang&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-695X.2001.tb00521.x | last1 = Huang | first1 = J. | last2 = Gou | first2 = D. | last3 = Zhen | first3 = C. | last4 = Jiang | first4 = D. | last5 = Mao | first5 = X. | last6 = Li | first6 = W. | last7 = Chen | first7 = S. | last8 = Cai | first8 = C. | title = Protection of xenogeneic cells from human complement-mediated lysis by the expression of human DAF, CD59 and MCP | journal = FEMS Immunology and Medical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 203–209 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11720816}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Plasmaphoresis, on humans to remove 1,3 galactosyltransferase, reduces the risk of activation of effector cells such as CTL (CD8 T cells), complement pathway activation and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH).

====Acute vascular rejection====

Also known as delayed xenoactive rejection, this type of rejection occurs in discordant xenografts within 2 to 3 days, if hyperacute rejection is prevented. The process is much more complex than hyperacute rejection and is currently not completely understood. Acute vascular rejection requires de novo protein synthesis and is driven by interactions between the graft endothelial cells and host antibodies, macrophages, and platelets. The response is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of mostly [[macrophages]] and [[natural killer cells]] (with small numbers of [[T cells]]), intravascular thrombosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

Binding of the previously mentioned XNAs to the donor endothelium leads to the activation of host macrophages as well as the endothelium itself. The endothelium activation is considered type II since gene induction and protein synthesis are involved. The binding of XNAs ultimately leads to the development of a procoagulant state, the secretion of inflammatory [[cytokines]] and [[chemokines]], as well as expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules such as [[E-selectin]], intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ([[ICAM-1]]), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ([[VCAM-1]]).&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

This response is further perpetuated as normally binding between regulatory proteins and their ligands aid in the control of coagulation and inflammatory responses. However, due to molecular incompatibilities between the molecules of the donor species and recipient (such as porcine [[major histocompatibility complex]] molecules and human natural killer cells), this may not occur.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

===== Overcoming acute vascular rejection =====
Due to its complexity,  the use of immunosuppressive drugs along with a wide array of approaches are necessary to prevent acute vascular rejection, and include: 
*Administering a synthetic thrombin inhibitor to modulate thrombogenesis
*Depletion of anti-galactose antibodies (XNAs) by techniques such as immunoadsorption, to prevent endothelial cell activation
*Inhibiting activation of macrophages (stimulated by CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells) and NK cells (stimulated by the release of Il-2). Thus, the role of MHC molecules and T cell responses in activation would have to be reassessed for each species combo.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

==== Accommodation ====

If hyperacute and acute vascular rejection are avoided accommodation is possible, which is the survival of the xenograft despite the presence of circulating XNAs. The graft is given a break from humoral rejection&lt;ref name=takahashi&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Takahashi | first1 = T. | last2 = Saadi | first2 = S. | last3 = Platt | first3 = J. L. | doi = 10.1007/BF02786395 | title = Recent advances in the immunology of xenotransplantation | journal = Immunologic Research | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–297 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9379077 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the complement cascade is interrupted, circulating antibodies are removed, or their function is changed, or there is a change in the expression of surface antigens on the graft. This allows the xenograft to up-regulate and express protective genes, which aid in resistance to injury, such as [[heme oxygenase-1]] (an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme).&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

==== Cellular rejection ====
Rejection of the xenograft in hyperactute and acute vascular rejection is due to the response of the [[humoral immune system]], since the response is elicited by the XNAs. Cellular rejection is based on [[cellular immunity]], and is mediated by: 
*Natural killer cells, which accumulate in and damage the xenograft; and
*T-lymphocytes – which are activated by MHC molecules through both direct and indirect xenorecognition.

In direct xenorecognition, antigen presenting cells from the xenograft present peptides to recipient CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells via xenogeneic MHC class II molecules, resulting in the production of [[interleukin 2]] (IL-2). Indirect xenorecognition involves the presentation of antigens from the xenograft by recipient antigen presenting cells to CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Antigens of phagocytosed graft cells can also be presented by the host’s class I MHC molecules to CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells.&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=abbas2005&gt;Abbas, A., Lichtman, A. (2005) ''Cellular and Molecular Immunology'', 5th ed., pp. 81, 330–333, 381, 386. Elsevier Saunders, Pennsylvania,{{ISBN|0-7216-0008-5}}, {{DOI|10.1002/bmb.2004.494032019997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of cellular rejection in xenografts remains uncertain, however it is expected to be stronger than in allografts due to differences in peptides among different animals. This leads to more antigens potentially recognized as foreign, thus eliciting a greater indirect xenogenic response.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

===== Overcoming cellular rejection =====

A proposed strategy to avoid cellular rejection is to induce donor non-responsiveness using hematopoietic chimerism. Donor stem cells are introduced into the bone marrow of the recipient, where they coexist with the recipient’s stem cells. The bone marrow stem cells give rise to cells of all hematopoietic lineages, through the process of [[hematopoiesis]]. Lymphoid progenitor cells are created by this process and move to the thymus where negative selection eliminates T cells found to be reactive to self. The existence of donor stem cells in the recipient’s bone marrow causes donor reactive T cells to be considered self and undergo [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

==== Chronic rejection ====

Chronic rejection is slow and progressive, and usually occurs in transplants that survive the initial rejection phases. Scientists are still unclear how chronic rejection exactly works, research in this area is difficult since xenografts rarely survive past the initial acute rejection phases. Nonetheless, it is known that XNAs and the complement system are not primarily involved.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt; [[Fibrosis]] in the xenograft occurs as a result of immune reactions, cytokines (which stimulate fibroblasts), or healing (following cellular necrosis in acute rejection). Perhaps the major cause of chronic rejection is [[arteriosclerosis]]. Lymphocytes, which were previously activated by antigens in the vessel wall of the graft, activate macrophages to secrete smooth muscle growth factors. This results in a build up of smooth muscle cells on the vessel walls, causing the hardening and narrowing of vessels within the graft. Chronic rejection leads to pathologic changes of the organ, and is why transplants must be replaced after so many years.&lt;ref name="abbas2005"/&gt; It is also anticipated that chronic rejection will be more aggressive in xenotransplants as opposed to allotransplants.&lt;ref name=vanderpool&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vanderpool | first1 = H. Y. | title = Xenotransplantation: Progress and promise | doi = 10.1136/bmj.319.7220.1311 | journal = BMJ | volume = 319 | issue = 7220 | page = 1311 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10559062| pmc =1129087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dysregulated coagulation ====

Successful efforts have been made to create knockout mice without α1,3GT; the resulting reduction in the highly immunogenic αGal epitope has resulted in the reduction of the occurrence of hyperacute rejection, but has not eliminated other barriers to xenotransplantation such as dysregulated coagulation, also known as [[coagulopathy]].&lt;ref name="cowan2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cowan PJ |author2=Robson SC |author3=d’Apice AJF |title=Controlling coagulation dysregulation in xenotransplantation|journal=Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation|volume=16|issue=2|pages=214–21|pmid=21415824|pmc=3094512|year=2011|doi=10.1097/MOT.0b013e3283446c65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different organ xenotransplants result in different responses in clotting. For example, kidney transplants result in a higher degree of [[coagulopathy]], or impaired clotting, than cardiac transplants, whereas liver xenografts result in severe [[thrombocytopenia]], causing recipient death within a few days due to bleeding.&lt;ref name="cowan2011" /&gt; An alternate clotting disorder, [[thrombosis]], may be initiated by preexisting antibodies that affect the protein C anticoagulant system. Due to this effect, porcine donors must be extensively screened before transplantation. Studies have also shown that some porcine transplant cells are able to induce human tissue factor expression, thus stimulating platelet and monocyte aggregation around the xenotransplanted organ, causing severe clotting.&lt;ref name="ekser2010"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ekser B, Cooper DK|title=Overcoming the barriers to xenotransplantation: prospects for the future|journal=Expert review of clinical immunology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=219–30|pmid=20402385|pmc=2857338|year=2010|doi=10.1586/eci.09.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, spontaneous platelet accumulation may be caused by contact with pig von Willebrand factor.&lt;ref name="ekser2010" /&gt;

Just as the α1,3G epitope is a major problem in xenotransplantation, so too is dysregulated coagulation a cause of concern. Transgenic pigs that can control for variable coagulant activity based on the specific organ transplanted would make xenotransplantation a more readily available solution for the 70,000 patients per year who do not receive a human donation of the organ or tissue they need.&lt;ref name="ekser2010" /&gt;

=== Physiology ===
Extensive research is required to determine whether animal organs can replace the physiological functions of human organs. Many issues include:

*Size – Differences in organ size limit the range of potential recipients of xenotransplants.
*Longevity – The lifespan of most pigs is roughly 15 years, currently it is unknown whether or not a xenograft may be able to last longer than that. 
*Hormone and protein differences – Some proteins will be molecularly incompatible, which could cause malfunction of important regulatory processes. These differences also make the prospect of hepatic xenotransplantation less promising, since the liver plays an important role in the production of so many proteins.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;
*Environment – For example, pig hearts work in a different anatomical site and under different hydrostatic pressure than in humans.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;
*Temperature – The body temperature of pigs is 39&amp;nbsp;°C (2&amp;nbsp;°C above the average human body temperature). Implications of this difference, if any, on the activity of important enzymes are currently unknown.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

===Xenozoonosis===
Xenozoonosis,  also known as [[zoonosis]] or xenosis, is the transmission of infectious agents between species via xenograft. Animal to human infection is normally rare, but has occurred in the past. An example of such is the [[avian influenza]], when an influenza A virus was passed from birds to humans.&lt;ref name=who2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beigel | first1 = J. | last2 = Farrar | first2 = J. | last3 = Han | first3 = A. | last4 = Hayden | first4 = F. | last5 = Hyer | first5 = R. | last6 = De Jong | first6 = M. | last7 = Lochindarat | first7 = S. | last8 = Nguyen | first8 = T. | last9 = Nguyen | first9 = T. | last10 = Tran | first10 = T.

*Implantation breaches the physical barrier that normally helps to prevent disease transmission,	
*The recipient of the transplant will be severely immunosuppressed; and
*Human complement regulators (CD46, CD55, and CD59) expressed in transgenic pigs have been shown to serve as virus receptors, and may also help to protect viruses from attack by the complement system.&lt;ref name=takeuchi2000&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0952-7915(00)00128-X | last1 = Takeuchi | first1 = Y. | last2 = Weiss | first2 = R.

Examples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine [[herpesvirus]], [[rotavirus]], [[parvovirus]], and [[circovirus]]. Porcine herpesviruses and rotaviruses can be eliminated from the donor pool by screening, however others (such as parvovirus and circovirus) may contaminate food and footwear then re-infect the herd. Thus, pigs to be used as organ donors must be housed under strict regulations and screened regularly for microbes and pathogens. Unknown viruses, as well as those not harmful in the animal, may also pose risks.&lt;ref name=takeuchi2000 /&gt; Of particular concern are PERVS (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes. The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population. Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.&lt;ref name=FDA2006&gt;FDA. (2006) [http://www.fda.gov/cber/xap/xap.htm Xenotransplantation Action Plan: FDA Approach to the Regulation of Xenotransplantation]. Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baboons and pigs carry myriad transmittable agents that are harmless in their natural host, but extremely toxic and deadly in humans. HIV is an example of a disease believed to have jumped from monkeys to humans. Researchers also do not know if an outbreak of infectious diseases could occur and if they could contain the outbreak even though they have measures for control. Another obstacle facing xenotransplants is that of the body’s rejection of foreign objects by its immune system. These antigens (foreign objects) are often treated with powerful immunosuppressive drugs that could, in turn, make the patient vulnerable to other infections and actually aid the disease. This is the reason the organs would have to be altered to fit the patients' DNA ([[histocompatibility]]).

In 2005, the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) declared an eighteen-year moratorium on all animal-to-human transplantation, concluding that the risks of transmission of animal viruses to patients and the wider community had not been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf |title=The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council's 2005 statement on xenotransplantation |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-11-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080722120810/http://nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf |archivedate = 2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was repealed in 2009 after an NHMRC review stated "... the risks, if appropriately regulated, are minimal and acceptable given the potential benefits.", citing international developments on the management and regulation of xenotransplantation by the World Health Organisation and the European Medicines Agency.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Tim (10 December 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20091215005407/http://www.lifescientist.com.au/article/329402/xenotransplantation_ban_lifted_australia Xenotransplantation ban lifted in Australia]. lifescientist.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Porcine endogenous retroviruses ====
[[Endogenous retroviruses]] are remnants of ancient viral infections, found in the genomes of most, if not all, mammalian species.

===Ethics===
Xenografts have been a controversial procedure since they were first attempted. Many, including animal rights groups, strongly oppose killing animals to harvest their organs for human use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=82 PETA Media Center: Factsheet: Xenotransplantation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626072643/http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=82 |date=June 26, 2010 }}.

Retrieved on 2013-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the major religions object to the use of genetically modified pig organs for life-saving transplantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rothblatt |first=Martine |date=2004 |title=Your Life or Mine |location=Burlington, VT |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Company |pages=109–110 |isbn=978-0754623915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the use of pig and cow tissue in humans has been met with little resistance, save some religious beliefs and a few philosophical objections. Experimentation without consent doctrines are now followed, which was not the case in the past, which may lead to new religious guidelines to further medical research on pronounced ecumenical guidelines.

==== Informed consent of patient ====
[[Autonomy]] and [[informed consent]] are important when considering the future uses of xenotransplantation. A patient undergoing xenotransplantation should be fully aware of the procedure and should have no outside force influencing their choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ellison T. |title=Xenotransplantation—ethics and regulation|journal=Xenotransplantation|volume=13|issue=6|pages=505–9|pmid=17059575|year=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3089.2006.00352_3.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient should understand the risks and benefits of such a transplantation. However, it has been suggested that friends and family members should also give consent, because the repercussions of transplantation are high, with the potential of diseases and viruses crossing over to humans from the transplantation. Close contacts are at risk for such infections. Monitoring of close relations may also be required to ensure that [[xenozoonosis]] is not occurring. The question then becomes: does the autonomy of the patient become limited based on the willingness or unwillingness of friends and family to give consent, and are the [[confidentiality|principles of confidentiality]] broken?

The safety of public health is a factor to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaiser M. |title=Xenotransplantation—ethical considerations based on human and societal perspectives|journal=Acta veterinaria Scandinavica. Supplementum|volume=99|pages=65–73|pmid=15347151|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is any risk to the public at all for an [[outbreak]] from transplantation there must be procedures in place to protect the public. Not only does the recipient of the transplantation have to understand the risks and benefits, but society must also understand and consent to such an agreement.

The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association points out one major ethical issue is the societal response to such a procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sykes M |author2=D’Apice A |author3=Sandrin M |year= 2003|title= Position Paper of the Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association|journal= Xenotransplantation|volume= 10|issue= 3|pages= 194–203|pmid=12694539|doi=10.1034/j.1399-3089.2003.00067.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption is that the recipient of the transplantation will be asked to undergo lifelong monitoring, which would deny the recipient the ability to terminate the monitoring at any time, which is in direct opposition of the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] and the [[Code of Federal Regulations|US Code of Federal Regulations]].
In 2007, xenotransplantation was banned under ethical grounds in all countries but Argentina, Russia and New Zealand. Since then, the practice has only been carried out to treatment for diabetes type 1 to serve as a substitute for penicillin injections. 

==== Xenotransplantion guidelines in the United States ====

The Food and Drug Administration ([[FDA]]) has also stated that if a transplantation takes place the recipient must undergo monitoring for the rest of that recipient's lifetime and waive their right to withdraw. The reason for requiring lifelong monitoring is due to the risk of acute infections that may occur. The FDA suggests that a passive screening program should be implemented and should extend for the life of the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;United States Food and Drug Administration.
