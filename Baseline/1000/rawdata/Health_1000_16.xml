      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9177">The '''10/90 gap''' is the term adopted by the [[Global Forum for Health Research]] to highlight the finding by the [[Commission on Health Research for Development]] in 1990, that less than 10% of worldwide resources devoted to health research were put towards health in [[Developing Countries]], where over 90% of all preventable deaths worldwide occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.globalforumhealth.org/about1090-gap/|title = 10/90 gap|date = 2011|accessdate = April 16, 2015|website = Global Forum for Health Research|publisher = }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, the spread of disease suffered in both rich and poor countries converges. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the most prevalent diseases consist of [[cardiovascular disease]], [[cancer]] and [[diabetes]].  These diseases now{{When|date=June 2016}} account for 45% of the global health burden and is the culprit for up to 85% of deaths in low-income countries. The 10/90 Gap focuses on joining organisations together to reduce these statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Luchetti, M. (2014). Global health and the 10/90 gap. British Journal of Medical Practitioners, 7(4), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease and the 10/90 gap==

A substantial portion of diseases, most prevalent in impoverished or developing countries, are those which are preventable and/or treatable.&lt;ref name=Currat&gt;Currat, L.J., Francisco, A., Al-Tuwaijri, S., Ghaffar, A., &amp; Jupp, S. (2004). 10/90 report on health research 2003-2004. WHO Drug Information, 18(3), 243. Retrieved from http://announcementsfiles.cohred.org/gfhr_pub/assoc/s14789e/s14789e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization (2004) stated in their world health report that an estimated eight million individuals die prematurely, from diseases and conditions that can be cured, every year. These deaths contribute to approximately one third of all human deaths in the world, each year.&lt;ref name=Currat/&gt; Table 1 lists several of these curable diseases.

==Strategies for change==

Global health organisations across the globe have explicitly made research into health their priority. In 2000, World Health Organization established the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, who in their 2001 report, verified the relationship between poverty and disease and discussed the benefit of investment on the economic climates of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hotez P.J. |author2=Ferris M.T. | year = 2006 | title = The antipoverty vaccines | url = | journal = Vaccine | volume = 26 | issue = 24| pages = 31–31 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible strategies that can be implanted to help reduce the 10/90 gap are, policies prioritizing funding for health research, also developing capacities of credible public and private health research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, A., Kuruvilla, S., &amp; Borchert, M. (2004). Bridging the implementation gap between knowledge and action for health. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 82(10), 724–732.&lt;/ref&gt; Also activities of international NGOs to undertake research aimed at resolving the gap, and the setting up of research based mechanisms to ensure access to new effective products for the treatment and prevention of poverty-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kilama W. L. | year = 2009 | title = The 10/90 gap in sub-saharan africa: Resolving inequities in health research | url = | journal = Acta Tropica | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = S8–S15 | doi = 10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.08.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the number of diseases that are preventable, other factors that are blocking the access of patients to these products, such as cost of treatments to the individual, also need to be addressed, rather that just focusing on developing new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Diseases of Poverty and the 10/90 Gap|last = Stevens|first = Philip|publisher = International Policy Network|year = 2004|isbn = |location = London, UK.|pages = 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a need to build the [[primary health care]] sector in developing countries. It has been shown that early detection and effective management of disease can be provided by appropriately-trained, non-physician, healthcare workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global health: Noncommunicable diseases|last = Hunter|first = D.J.|date = 2013|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1109345|pmid = |last2 = Reddy|first2 = K.S.|volume=369|pages=1336–1343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health expenditure==

The gap between financial needs and financial means in low income countries can only be filled by donations. The average health expenditure per capita in western countries is estimated at $947 compared to $20 per capita in low income countries. To assist the worlds poorest, health expenditure between $44–60 per capita is placed as a target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.bjmp.org/content/global-health-and-1090-gap |title=Global Health and the 10/90 gap |last=Luchetti |first=Marco |date=2014 |journal=British journal of medical practitioners |issn=1757-8515 |pmid= |access-date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Y5hRlONj?url=http://www.bjmp.org/content/global-health-and-1090-gap |archivedate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This target is achieved by the contribution of 0.1% of  advanced western countries gross national production (GNP) to fund global health, this recommendation was set by the WHO in 2001 and is estimated to save 8 million lives per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development|last = World Health Organization|publisher = World Health Organization|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Geneva|pages = 7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global research and development ==

Among other efforts to address this issue are recent proposals for a Global Research and Development ([[Research and development|R&amp;D]]) [[treaty]], and the creation of the nonprofit [[Pharmacology|pharmaceutical]] company [[Institute for OneWorld Health|OneWorld Health]] which develops new and affordable medicines for neglected diseases. A treaty creates a system that allows health research to come from contributions by all and therefore the sharing of benefits for all, improving the fairness and sustainability of global research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Innovation and Access to Medicines for Neglected Populations: Could a Treaty Address a Broken Pharmaceutical R&amp;D System?|last = Moon|first = Suerie|date = 15 May 2012|journal = PLOS Medicine|doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001218|pmid = 22615544|pmc=3352855|volume=9|pages=e1001218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a positive development for the closing of the gap, in the 2012 [[London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases]] many parties, including governments, funding organisations and drug companies, agreed to work towards the eradication of [[neglected tropical diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Development assistance for neglected tropical diseases: Progress since 2009|last = Liese|first = Bernhard H|date = 2014|journal = International Health|doi = 10.1093/inthealth/ihu052|pmid = |last2 = Houghton|first2 = Natalia|last3 = Teplitskaya|first3 = Lyubov|issue = 3|volume = 6|pages = 162–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Despite the findings of the World Health Organization, and the disparity of curable diseases throughout developing and developed countries, some people believe the 10/90 gap is a myth.&lt;ref name=Vidyasagar&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vidyasagar|first1=D|title=Global notes: The 10/90 gap disparities in global health research|journal=Journal of Perinatology|date=2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=55–56|doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7211402}}&lt;/ref&gt; They criticise the fact that simple medicines which stop curable and treatable conditions such as diarrhoea and malaria are available to these countries. The issue is not with the medicine, but with the ability for the affected to access it. Access to medicine can be inhibited by many circumstances such as poverty, strict government regime and inadequate healthcare systems and infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Vidyasagar/&gt;

The 5-SPICE framework was developed by clinicians and researchers from [[Partners In Health]], [[Harvard Medical School]], and [[Brigham and Women’s Hospital]] in Boston, MA.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palazuelos|first=Daniel|author2=Kyla Ellis |author3=Dana DeEun Im |author4=Matthew Peckarsky |author5=Daniel Schwartz|title=5-SPICE: the application of an original framework for community health worker program design, quality improvement and research agenda setting|journal=Global Health Action|date=April 3, 2013|volume=6|doi=10.3402/gha.v6i0.19658|pmid=23561023|pmc=3617878|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework lays out a model for integrating community health workers into public health systems, learning from the experiences Partners In Health and partner organizations at their project sites in resource-poor settings around the world.&lt;ref name="pih"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Health Workers|url=http://www.pih.org/priority-programs/community-health-workers/about|publisher=Partners In Health|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5-SPICE draws upon experiences from Haiti, Rwanda, Lesotho, Liberia, Nepal, Mali, and elsewhere, where CHWs have been employed to improve patient outcomes and overcome personnel shortages.&lt;ref name="pih_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Work|url=http://www.pih.org/our-work|publisher=Partners In Health|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework allows for all stakeholders in a community health program to participate in discussions and analyses to strengthen the impact of CHWs.

==Background==
5-SPICE allows for all stakeholders in a community health program to participate in discussions and analyses to strengthen the impact of community health workers.

The name 5-SPICE is derived from Chinese cuisine emphasizing the balance between inputs and elements. The five main elements form an acronym:
*Supervision (especially management plans and structures)
*Partners (especially ownership and stewardship)
*Incentives (part of the larger theme of motivation)
*Choice (how CHWs are recruited to work and why they take the job)
*Education (what CHWs bring to their job and how they are trained) &lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

These elements are not a static list, but a way to holistically analyze how core programmatic elements affect each other in the field. In the [[Freire, Paulo|Freirean]] tradition of awareness, the 5-SPICE model emphasizes facilitated discussion and contemplation among stakeholders, particularly CHWs, to maximize program outputs. Ultimately, the 5-SPICE framework allows program implementers to study the relationship between the health system and the local community.

Other CHW program frameworks exist, such as the CHW Assessment and Improvement Matrix (AIM) developed by the USAID-funded Health Care Improvement (HCI) project.&lt;ref name="hciproject"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Health Worker Assessment and Improvement Matrix (CHW AIM): A Toolkit for Improving CHW Programs and Services|url=http://www.hciproject.org/node/2359|publisher=USAID|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5-SPICE complements these other frameworks by providing an acronym that condenses the many elements discussed in other frameworks into an easy-to-remember heuristic, allowing for more effective and efficient assessments that are exploratory rather than prescriptive.

==Scholarly Dissemination==

The 5-SPICE framework was first formally introduced in an April 2013 publication in [[Global Health Action]], in an article entitled “5-SPICE: the application of an original framework for community health worker program design, quality improvement and research agenda setting.”&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;  The framework was subsequently presented at the 2013 Consortium of Universities for Global Health Conference,&lt;ref name=CUGH&gt;{{cite web|title=5-SPICE: An Original Framework for Community Health Worker Program Design, Quality Improvement and Research Agenda Setting|url=http://cugh.conferencespot.org/APP_TECH.34/APP_TECH.34/1|publisher=Consortium of Universities for Global Health|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the 2013 Swedish Society of Medicine’s annual conference, Global Health—Beyond 2015.&lt;ref name=Sweden&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond 2015|url=http://www.sls.se/GlobalHealth/Om-konferensen/Editorial/|publisher=Swedish Medical Society|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article has also been accepted for presentation at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the  [[American Public Health Association]].&lt;ref name=APHA&gt;{{cite web|title=A unique non-linear chw program framework for quality improvement|url=https://apha.confex.com/apha/141am/webprogram/Paper284734.html|publisher=APHA|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capitation''' is a payment arrangement for [[health care]] service providers such as [[physician]]s, [[physician assistants]] or [[nurse practitioner]]s. It pays a physician or group of physicians a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to them, per period of time, whether or not that person seeks care. These providers generally are [[contract]]ed with a type of [[health maintenance organization]] (HMO) known as an [[independent practice association]] (IPA), which enlists the providers to care for HMO-enrolled [[patient]]s. The amount of remuneration is based on the average expected health care utilization of that patient, with greater payment for patients with significant medical history.

==Types==
Primary capitation is a relationship between a managed care organization (MCO) and primary care physician (PCP), in which the PCP is paid directly by the MCO for those enrolled members who have selected the physician as their provider.&lt;ref&gt;Arrow K, Auerbach A, Bertko J, Brownlee S, Casalino LP, Cooper J, Crosson FJ, Enthoven A, Falcone E, Feldman RC, Fuchs VR, Garber AM, Gold MR, Goldman D, Hadfield GK, Hall MA, Horwitz RI, Hooven M, Jacobson PD, Jost TS, Kotlikoff LJ, Levin J, Levine S, Levy R, Linscott K, Luft HS, Mashal R, McFadden D, Mechanic D, Meltzer D, Newhouse JP, Noll RG, Pietzsch JB, Pizzo P, Reischauer RD, Rosenbaum S, Sage W, Schaeffer LD, Sheen E, Silber BM, Skinner J, Shortell SM, Thier SO, Tunis S, Wulsin L, Yock P, Nun GB, Bryan S, Luxenburg O, van de Ven WP. [[Toward a 21st-century health care system: recommendations for health care reform.]] Ann Intern Med. 2009; 150 (7): 493-5
&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary capitation is a relationship arranged by the MCO between a PCP and a secondary or specialist provider, such as an X-ray facility or ancillary facility such as a durable medical equipment supplier whose secondary provider is also paid capitation based on that PCP’s enrolled membership.

Global capitation is a relationship based on a provider who provides services and is reimbursed per-member per-month (PMPM) for the entire network population.

==Incentives==
Under capitation, physicians are given an incentive to consider the cost of treatment. Pure capitation pays a set fee per patient, regardless of their degree of infirmity, giving physicians an incentive to avoid the most costly patients.&lt;ref name="BetterWays"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Harold D. Miller]] | title = From volume to value: better ways to pay for health care | journal = [[Health Affairs (Project Hope)]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 1418–1428 |date=September–October 2009 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.28.5.1418 | pmid = 19738259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Care==
Providers who work under such plans focus on [[preventive health care]], as there is a greater financial reward in the prevention of illness than in the treatment of the ill. Such plans divert providers from the use of expensive treatment options.

==Insurance==
The financial risks providers accept in capitation are traditional [[insurance]] risks. Provider revenues are fixed, and each enrolled patient makes a claims against the full resources of the provider. In exchange for the fixed payment, physicians essentially become the enrolled clients' insurers, who resolve their patients' claims at the point of care and assume the responsibility for their unknown future health care costs.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2001" /&gt; Large providers tend to manage the risk better than do smaller providers because they are better prepared for variations in service demand and costs, but even large providers are inefficient risk managers in comparison to large insurers. Providers tend to be small in comparison to insurers and so are more like individual consumers, whose annual costs as a percentage of their annual cash flow vary far more than do those of large insurers. For example, a capitated eye care program for 25,000 patients is more viable than a capitated eye program for 10,000 patients. The smaller the roster of patients, the greater the variation in annual costs and the more likely that the costs may exceed the resources of the provider. In very small capitation portfolios, a small number of costly patients can dramatically affect a provider's overall costs and increase the provider's risk of insolvency.

Physicians and other health care providers lack the necessary [[actuarial]], [[underwriting]], [[accounting]] and finance skills for insurance risk management, but their most severe problem is the greater variation in their estimates of the average patient cost, which leaves them at a financial disadvantage as compared to insurers whose estimates are far more accurate.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2010" /&gt; Because their risks are a function of portfolio size, providers can reduce their risks only by increasing the numbers of patients they carry on their rosters, but their inefficiency relative to that of the insurers' is far greater than can be mitigated by these increases. To manage risk as efficiently as an insurer, a provider would have to assume 100% of the insurer's portfolio. HMOs and insurers manage their costs better than risk-assuming healthcare providers and cannot make risk-adjusted capitation payments without sacrificing profitability. Risk-transferring entities will enter into such agreements only if they can maintain the levels of profits they achieve by retaining risks.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2010" /&gt;

===Reinsurance===
Providers cannot afford [[reinsurance]], which would further deplete their inadequate capitation payments, as the reinsurer's expected loss costs, expenses, profits and risk loads must be paid by the providers. The goal of reinsurance is to offload risk and reward to the reinsurer in return for more stable operating results, but the provider's additional costs make that impractical. Reinsurance assumes that the insurance-risk-transferring entities do not create inefficiencies when they shift insurance risks to providers.

Without any induced inefficiencies, providers would be able to pass on a portion of their risk premiums to reinsurers, but the premiums that providers would have to receive would exceed the premiums that risk-transferring entities could charge in competitive insurance markets.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2001" /&gt; Reinsurers are wary of contracting with physicians, as they believe that if providers think they can collect more than they pay in premiums, they would tend to revert to the same excesses encouraged by fee-for-service payment systems.

'''Cardiovascular Endurance''' is  the ability of the heart and lungs to supply oxygen-rich blood to the working [[Muscle|muscle tissues]] and the ability of the muscles to use oxygen to produce energy for movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.qld.gov.au/npag/glossary.asp |title=National Physical Activity Guidelines, Glossary |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The State of Queensland |accessdate=December 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316212430/http://www.health.qld.gov.au/npag/glossary.asp |archivedate=March 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of fitness is a health-related component of physical fitness that is brought about by sustained physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frankmoranfitness.com/fitnessglossary.htm |title=Glossary of Fitness and Health Terms |author=Frank Moran |date= |work= |publisher=Frank Moran |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person's ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is affected by many [[physiological]] parameters, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximal oxygen consumption.

Understanding the relationship between cardiorespiratory endurance [[Fitness training|training]] and other categories of conditioning requires a review of changes that occur with increased aerobic, or anaerobic capacity. As aerobic/anaerobic capacity increases, general [[metabolism]] rises, muscle metabolism is enhanced, [[haemoglobin]] rises, buffers in the bloodstream increase, venous return is improved, stroke volume is improved, and the blood bed becomes more able to adapt readily to varying demands. Each of these results of cardiovascular fitness/cardiorespiratory conditioning will have a direct positive effect on muscular endurance, and an indirect effect on strength and flexibility.

To facilitate optimal delivery of oxygen to the working muscles, the person needs to train or participate in activities that will build up the energy stores needed for sport. This is referred to as metabolic training. Metabolic training is generally divided into two types: [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]]. A 2005 Cochrane review demonstrated that physical activity interventions are effective for increasing cardiovascular fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hillsdon|first=M.|last2=Foster|first2=C.|last3=Thorogood|first3=M.|date=2005-01-25|title=Interventions for promoting physical activity|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=1|pages=CD003180|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003180.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4164373|pmid=15674903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cytotoxic hazard symbol''' is a [[hazard symbol]] consisting of a [[triangle]] with the letter "C" inside it. It is used to label [[biomedical waste]] bags and containers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sterihealth.com.au/services/medical-waste-collection/cytotoxic-waste&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytotoxic waste, the [[by-product]] of [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] [[drug therapy]] administered to patients (such as [[chemotherapy]]), typically includes all drug administrative [[equipment]] (e.g. needles, syringes, dripsets etc.) as well as all gowns and body fluids/waste from patients undergoing such treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12587">'''Euro Health Consumer Index''' ('''EHCI''') is a comparison of [[Healthcare in Europe|European health care system]]s based on waiting times, results, and generosity. The information is presented as a graphic index. EHCI was produced 2005–2009 and 2012–2016 by [[Health Consumer Powerhouse]]. The 2014 ranking included 37 countries measured by 48 indicators.  It claims to measure the "consumer friendliness" of healthcare systems. It does not claim to measure which European state has the best healthcare system, but it does produce specialist Indexes on Diabetes, Cardiac Care, HIV, Headache and Hepatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006 France was the champion with 768 points out of 1000. In the 2015 results the same performance would have given the 13th position among 35 countries because of the widespread improvements in standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EHCI: European healthcare steadily improving|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20160128/EHCI-European-healthcare-steadily-improving.aspx|accessdate=28 January 2016|publisher=News Medical.net|date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas no bias in favour of any health system was alleged, the index was criticised in the [[British Medical Journal]] by [[Martin McKee]] and others from the [[European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies]] in February 2016.  Points they made included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cylus|first1=Jonathan|last2=Nolte|first2=Ellen|last3=Figueras|first3=Josep|last4=McKee|first4=Martin|title=What, if anything, does the EuroHealth Consumer Index actually tell us?|journal=BMJ|date=9 February 2016|url=http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2016/02/09/what-if-anything-does-the-eurohealth-consumer-index-actually-tell-us/|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The index is constructed by scoring performance as good, intermediary or not-so-good, based on arbitrary cut-off points. 
* There is no logic in how many points are allocated to each indicator.  225 points are allocated to accessibility, but only 250 to health outcomes.
* The indicators are a  mix of trends over time and cross-sectional rankings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2044">'''Fitkid''' (also ''FitKid'', ''Fit Kid'' or ''Fit-Kid'') is a type of children's sport combining [[gymnastics]], [[dance]] and [[acrobatics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fitkid.hu/01/index.php/fitkid-tortenete Fitkid története]&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in Europe in the 1990s, and is meant to engage children 8–18 years of age in fun individual and group exercise, free of the extremes of more strenuous [[aerobics]] or traditional gymnastics. International competitions are organized regularly by the ''International FitKid Division'', in addition to national competitions. A routine stands of four types of elements: strength, flexibility, acrobatics, and jumps. All elements are graded by difficulty from A to H. A elements being worth 0.1 points, B 0.2, C 0.3, and so on until H which is worth 0.8. Routines get evaluated in three categories: technique, artistry, and content (execution of elements). Competition is divided by age groups (I. to IX. (or Senior in A category)), and categories ( which are based on knowledge). There three categories (from hardest to easiest) A, B, and C, also called Dance. In each categories there are group and individual routines. In C Category (here group routines are also called Dance Show) team member can go from 4 to 8. In A and B category there are duos, small groups (3-4), and big groups (5-6). In C category, individually 4 elements have to be performed ( one from each type), A or B difficulty, and in groups, two are optional. In B category individually  8 elements need to be performed ( two from each type) A-D difficulty ( but max. two elements can be D), and in groups 4 (same as C category individual). In A category team and individual, 8 elements need to be performed (same as B category) and an acrobatic connection is optional. Skills in A category can be any difficulty. &lt;ref&gt;[http://fitkiddivision.org/?page_id=70 Competitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The American system is a mix of public and private insurance. The government provides insurance coverage for approximately 53 million elderly via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], 62 million lower-income persons via [[Medicaid]], and 15 million military veterans via the [[Veteran's Administration]]. About 178 million employed by companies receive subsidized health insurance through their employer, while 52 million other persons directly purchase insurance either via the subsidized marketplace exchanges developed as part of the [[Affordable Care Act]] or directly from insurers. The private sector delivers healthcare services, with the exception of the Veteran's Administration, where doctors are employed by the government.&lt;ref name="Census2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html|title=Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2016|first=US Census|last=Bureau|website=www.census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centers for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] (CMS) reported that U.S. [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] rose 5.8% to reach $3.2 trillion in 2015, or $9,990 per person. As measured by CMS, the share of the U.S. economy devoted to health care spending was 17.8% GDP in 2015, up from 17.4% in 2014. Increases were driven by the coverage expansion that began in 2014 as a result of the [[Affordable Care Act]] (i.e., more persons demanding healthcare or more healthcare units consumed) as well as higher healthcare prices per unit.&lt;ref name="CMS_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/highlights.pdf|title=CMS-National Health Expenditures 2015 Highlights-Retrieved November 1, 2017|website=cms.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. healthcare costs are considerably higher than other countries as a share of GDP, among other measures. According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], U.S. healthcare costs in 2015 were 16.9% GDP, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD country.&lt;ref name="OECD1"&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA OECD Statistical Database-Health expenditure and financing-Retrieved October 25, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; A gap of 5% GDP represents $1 trillion, about $3,000 per person relative to the next most expensive country. In other words, the U.S. would have to cut healthcare costs by roughly one-third to be competitive with the next most expensive country.&lt;ref name="CDC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/health-expenditures.htm|title=FastStats|date=18 July 2017|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for higher costs than other countries including higher administrative costs, spending more for the same services (i.e., higher prices per unit), receiving more medical care (units) per capita than other countries, cost variation across hospital regions without different results,  higher levels of per-capita income, and less active government intervention to reduce costs. Spending is highly concentrated among sicker patients.&lt;ref name="Dalen1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cutler1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hixon1"/&gt; The [[Institute of Medicine]] reported in September 2012 that approximately $750B per year in U.S. [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] are avoidable or wasted. This included: [[Unnecessary health care|unnecessary services]] ($210 billion annually); inefficient delivery of care ($130 billion); excess administrative costs ($190 billion); inflated prices ($105 billion); prevention failures ($55 billion), and fraud ($75 billion).&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/09/how-the-us-health-care-system-wastes-750-billion-annually/262106/The|title=How the U.S. Health-Care System Wastes $750 Billion Annually|first=Brian|last=Fung|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this spending, the quality of health care overall is low by OECD measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/unitedstates/Briefing-Note-UNITED-STATES-2014.pdf|title=OECD-Briefing Note-OECD Health Statistics 2014 How does the United States compare?-Retrieved January 11, 2016|website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commonwealth Fund]] ranked the United States last in the quality of health care among similar countries.&lt;ref name=Roehr2008&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Roehr | first =  Bob| year = 2008| title = Health care in US ranks lowest among developed countries| journal = BMJ| volume = 337| issue = jul21 1| pages = a889| doi = 10.1136/bmj.a889| pmid = 18644774}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Davis, Karen, Schoen, Cathy, and Stremikis, Kristof|title=Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: How the Performance of the U.S. Health Care System Compares Internationally, 2010 Update|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Publications/Fund-Reports/2010/Jun/Mirror-Mirror-Update.aspx?page=all|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund|date=June 2010|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of persons without health insurance (the "uninsured") fell from 13.3% in 2013 to 8.8% in 2016, due primarily to the [[Affordable Care Act]]. The number uninsured fell from 41.8 million in 2013 to 28.0 million in 2016, a decline of 13.8 million. The number of persons with insurance (public or private) rose from 271.6 million in 2013 to 292.3 million in 2016, an increase of 20.7 million. In 2016, approximately 68% were covered by private plans, while 37% were covered by government plans; these do not add to 100% because some persons have both.&lt;ref name="Census2016"/&gt;

Among those whose employer pays for health insurance, the employee may be required to contribute part of the cost of this insurance, while the employer usually chooses the insurance company and, for large groups, negotiates with the insurance company.  The government subsidizes the employer-based insurance by excluding premiums paid by employers from the employees income. This subsidy [[tax expenditure]] reduced federal tax revenue by $248 billion in 2013, or 1.5% GDP.&lt;ref name="CBO_TaxExp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/43768|title=The Distribution of Major Tax Expenditures in the Individual Income Tax System|date=29 May 2013|website=cbo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-partisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) reported in March 2017 that healthcare cost inflation and an aging population are primary drivers of increasing budget deficits over time, as outlays (spending) continue to rise faster than revenues relative to GDP. CBO forecast that spending on major healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) would rise from 5.5% GDP in 2017 to 9.2% GDP by 2047.&lt;ref name=CBOLT17&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52480|title=The 2017 Long-Term Budget Outlook|date=30 March 2017|website=cbo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spending==
[[File:US healthcare cost panel v1.png|thumb|400px|right|U.S. healthcare cost information, including rate of change, per-capita, and percent of GDP.]]

===As percentage of GDP===
The Centers for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] (CMS) reported that U.S. [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] rose to 17.8% GDP in 2015, up from 17.4% in 2014. Increases were driven by the coverage expansion that began in 2014 as a result of the [[Affordable Care Act]] (i.e., more persons demanding healthcare or more healthcare units consumed) as well as higher healthcare prices per unit.&lt;ref name="CMS_2015"/&gt;

According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], U.S. healthcare costs in 2015 were 16.9% GDP, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD country.&lt;ref name="OECD1"/&gt; A gap of 5% GDP represents $1 trillion, about $3,000 per person relative to the next most expensive country. In other words, the U.S. would have to cut healthcare costs by roughly one-third ($1 trillion or $3,000 per person on average) to be competitive with the next most expensive country.&lt;ref name="CDC1"/&gt;

===Per capita===
The Centers for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] (CMS) reported that U.S. [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] rose 5.8% to reach $3.2 trillion in 2015, or $9,990 per person.&lt;ref name="CMS_2015"/&gt;

The Office of the Actuary (OACT) of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] publishes data on total health care spending in the United States, including both historical levels and future projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/01_Overview.asp|title=Index|date=17 April 2018|website=www.cms.hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the U.S. spent $2.26 trillion on health care, or $7,439 per person, up from $2.1 trillion, or $7,026 per capita, the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/proj2007.pdf "National Health Expenditures, Forecast summary and selected tables"], Office of the Actuary in the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2008.

Growth in spending is projected to average 6.7% annually over the period 2007 through 2017.

In 2009, the United States federal, state and local governments, corporations and individuals, together spent $2.5 trillion, $8,047 per person, on health care.&lt;ref name="Brent2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-02-04-health-care-costs_N.htm|title=Medical expenses have 'very steep rate of growth'|author=Jones, Brent|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=2010-02-04|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount represented 17.3% of the GDP, up from 16.2% in 2008.&lt;ref name="Brent2010"/&gt; Health insurance costs are rising faster than wages or inflation,&lt;ref name="Kaiser2007"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Health Insurance Premiums Rise 6.1 Percent In 2007, Less Rapidly Than In Recent Years But Still Faster Than Wages And Inflation |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=2007-09-11 |url=http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |accessdate=2007-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329111855/http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and medical causes were cited by about half of bankruptcy filers in the United States in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.w5.63/DC1 "Illness And Injury As Contributors To Bankruptcy"], by David U.

===Rate of increase===
{{See|Health care prices in the United States}}
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported in 2013 that the rate of increase in annual healthcare costs has fallen since 2002. However, costs relative to GDP and per capita continue to rise. Per capita cost increases have averaged 5.4% since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical.html|title=NationalHealthAccountsHistorical|date=8 January 2018|website=www.cms.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Federal Reserve data, healthcare annual inflation rates have declined in recent decades:
*1970-1979: 7.8%
*1980-1989: 8.3%
*1990-1999: 5.3%
*2000-2009: 4.1%
*2010-2016: 3.0%&lt;ref name="FRED1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIMEDSL#0|title=Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: Medical Care|date=11 April 2018|website=stlouisfed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this inflation rate has declined, it has generally remained above the rate of economic growth, resulting in a steady increase of health expenditures relative to GDP from 6% in 1970 to nearly 18% in 2015.&lt;ref name="CDC1"/&gt;

[[File:Health care cost rise.svg|thumb|360px|Health care cost rise in the U.S. relative to other countries, as measured by total expenditure on health as percent of [[GDP]].]]

===Relative to other countries===
U.S. healthcare costs in 2015 were 16.9% GDP according to the OECD, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD country.&lt;ref name="OECD1"/&gt; With U.S. GDP of $19 trillion, healthcare costs were about $3.2 trillion, or about $10,000 per person in a country of 320 million people. A gap of 5% GDP represents $1 trillion, about $3,000 per person relative to the next most expensive country. In other words, the U.S. would have to cut healthcare costs by roughly one-third to be competitive with the next most expensive country.&lt;ref name="CDC1"/&gt;

One analysis of international spending levels in the year 2000 found that while the U.S. spends more on health care than other countries in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the use of health care services in the U.S. is below the OECD median by most measures. The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Prices Stupid"&gt;Gerard F. Anderson, Uwe E. Reinhardt, Peter S. Hussey and Varduhi Petrosyan, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/22/3/89 "It's The Prices, Stupid: Why The United States Is So Different From Other Countries"], ''Health Affairs'', Volume 22, Number 3, May/June 2003. Retrieved February 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentration===
Spending is highly concentrated among a relatively few patients. The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] reported that the concentration of health care spending in the U.S. in 2010 was as follows:
*The top 1% of persons accounted for 21% of health care spending;
*The top 5% accounted for 50%; 
*The top 20% accounted for 82%; and
*The bottom 50% of persons accounted for only 3% of spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kff.org/health-costs/slide/concentration-of-health-care-spending-in-the-u-s-population-2010/|title=Concentration of Health Care Spending in the U.S. Population, 2010|date=13 March 2013|website=kff.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found similar results using [[AHRQ]] analysis.&lt;ref name=AHRQ2009&gt;[http://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_files/publications/st354/stat354.pdf [[AHRQ]] Report] (using 2008 and 2009 data)&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to the overall  population, those who remained in the top 10% of spenders between 2008 and 2009 were more likely to be in fair or poor health, elderly, female, non-Hispanic whites and those with public-only  coverage. Those who remained in the bottom half of spenders were more likely to be in excellent health, children and young adults, men, Hispanics, and the uninsured. These patterns were stable through the 1970s and 1980s, and some data suggest that they may have been typical of the mid-to-early 20th century as well.&lt;ref name="berkmonheit"&gt;Marc L. Berk and Alan C. Monheit, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/20/2/9 "The Concentration Of Health Care Expenditures, Revisited"], ''Health Affairs'', Volume 20, Number 2, March/April 2001. Retrieved February 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier study by AHRQ the found significant persistence in the level of health care spending from year to year. Of the 1% of the population with the highest health care spending in 2002, 24.3% maintained their ranking in the top 1% in 2003. Of the 5% with the highest spending in 2002, 34% maintained that ranking in 2003. Individuals over age 45 were disproportionately represented among those who were in the top decile of spending for both years.&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Cohen and William Yu, [http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_files/publications/st124/stat124.pdf "The Persistence in the Level of Health Expenditures over Time: Estimates for the U.S. Population, 2002–2003,"] MEPS Statistical Brief #124, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Seniors spend, on average, far more on health care costs than either working-age adults or children. The pattern of spending by age was stable for most ages from 1987 through 2004, with the exception of spending for seniors age 85 and over. Spending for this group grew less rapidly than that of other groups over this period.&lt;ref&gt;Micah Hartman, Aaron Catlin, David Lassman, Jonathan Cylus and Stephen Heffler, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/1/w1?rss=1 "U.S. Health Spending By Age, Selected Years Through 2004"], ''Health Affairs'' web exclusive, November 6, 2007.

There are significant geographic variations in the level of care provided to chronically ill patients, only 4% of which are explained by differences in the number of severely ill people in an area. Most of the differences are explained by differences in the amount of "supply-sensitive" care available in an area. Acute hospital care accounts for over half (55%) of the spending for Medicare beneficiaries in the last two years of life, and differences in the volume of services provided is more significant than differences in price. The researchers found no evidence of "substitution" of care, where increased use of hospital care would reduce outpatient spending (or vice versa).&lt;ref name=DartmouthAtlas2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=52442 "Coverage &amp; Access | More Aggressive Hospital Care Does Not Lead to Improved Patient Outcomes in All Cases, Study Finds,"] Kaiser Daily Health Policy Report, [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], May 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution of spending by service type===
Healthcare spending in the U.S. was distributed as follows by type of service in 2014: Hospital care 32%; physician and clinical services 20%; prescription drugs 10%; and all other, including many categories individually making up less than 7% of spending. These first three categories accounted for 62% of spending.&lt;ref name="CDC1"/&gt;

This distribution is relatively stable; in 2008, 31% went to hospital care, 21% to [[physician]]/clinical services, 10% to [[pharmaceuticals]], 4% to [[dentistry|dental]], 6% to [[nursing home]]s, 3% to home health care, 3% for other retail products, 3% for government public health activities, 7% to administrative costs, 7% to [[investment]], and 6% to other professional services (physical therapists, optometrists, etc.).&lt;ref name="kaiseredu.org"&gt;[http://www.kaiseredu.org/Issue-Modules/US-Health-Care-Costs/Background-Brief.aspx#How%20is%20the%20U.S.%20health%20care%20dollar%20spent?

===Hospitalization costs===
According to a report from the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ), aggregate U.S. hospital costs in 2011 were $387.3 billion—a 63% increase since 1997 (inflation adjusted). Costs per stay increased 47% since 1997, averaging $10,000 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Pfuntner A., Wier L.M., Elixhauser A. Overview of Hospital Stays in the United States, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #166.

==Insurance markets==
[[File:Health Insurance Coverage in the U.S. 2016 - v1.png|thumb|right|450px|U.S. health insurance coverage by source in 2016.  CBO estimated ACA/Obamacare was responsible for 23 million persons covered via exchanges and Medicaid expansion.&lt;ref name="CBO_Subsidy2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51385|title=Federal Subsidies for Health Insurance Coverage for People Under Age 65|publisher=CBO|date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Employee market===
An estimated 178 million persons under 65 obtain their insurance through their employer.&lt;ref name="Census2016"/&gt; Firms are often "self-insured", meaning they reimburse the insurance companies that pay the medical claims on behalf of their employees. Employers may use a stop-loss, meaning they pay the insurance company a premium to cover very expensive individual claims (e.g., the firm is self-insured up to a threshold for individual workers). Workers pay a share of their costs to their employers for coverage, basically a premium deducted from their paychecks. Workers also have deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. The structure of the insurance plan may also include a [[Health savings account]] or HSA, which enable workers to save money tax-free for health expenses.

The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] reported that employer-based health insurance premiums for a family of four averaged $18,765 in 2017, up 3% from the prior year, although there was considerable variation around this average. For single coverage, the premium costs averaged $6,690, up 4% from the previous year. The typical worker contributed $5,714 on average towards their coverage, with the employer providing the remainder.&lt;ref name="Kaiser17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/2017-employer-health-benefits-survey/|title=2017 Employer Health Benefits Survey|date=19 September 2017|website=kff.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deductibles have been rising much faster than premiums in recent years. For example, deductibles rose 12% in 2016, four times faster than premiums. From 2011 to 2016, deductibles rose 63% for single coverage, versus 19% for single coverage premiums. During that time, worker earnings rose 11%. The average annual deductible is around $1,500. For employers with fewer than 200 employees, 65% of employees are now in "high-deductible plans" which averaged $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kff.org/health-costs/perspective/the-missing-debate-over-rising-health-care-deductibles/|title=The Missing Debate Over Rising Health-Care Deductibles|date=18 September 2016|website=kff.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of employer-based coverage (as opposed to single-payer or government-funded via individual taxes) is that employers facing increasing healthcare costs offset the expense by either paying relatively less or hiring fewer workers. Since health insurance benefits paid by employers are not treated as income to employees, the government foregoes a sizable amount of tax revenue each year. This subsidy or [[tax expenditure]] was estimated by CBO at $281 billion in 2017.&lt;ref name="CBO_Subsidy2016"/&gt; On March 1, 2010, billionaire investor [[Warren Buffett]] said that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees' health care put them at a [[competitive disadvantage]]. He compared the roughly 17% of GDP spent by the U.S. on health care with the 9% of GDP spent by much of the rest of the world, noted that the U.S. has fewer doctors and nurses per person, and said, "[t]hat kind of a cost, compared with the rest of the world, is like a tapeworm eating at our economic body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Funk |first=Josh |title=Buffett says economy recovering but at slow rate |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com) |date=March 1, 2010 |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-01/business/18371919_1_berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-warren-buffett-health-care |accessdate=Apr 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306012352/http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-01/business/18371919_1_berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-warren-buffett-health-care |archivedate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ACA marketplaces===
{{See|Affordable Care Act}}
An estimated 12 million persons obtained their insurance from insurance companies in 2016 via online marketplaces (federal or state) developed as part of the [[Affordable Care Act]], also known as "Obamacare." This insurance is federally subsidized through a premium tax credit, which varies based on the level of income of the individual. The credit is typically applied by the insurance company to lower the monthly premium payment. The post-subsidy premium cost is capped as a percentage of income, meaning as premiums rise the subsidies rise. Approximately 10 million persons on the exchanges are eligible for subsidies.&lt;ref name="CBO_Subsidy2016"/&gt; An estimated 80% of persons obtaining coverage under the ACA can get it for less than $75 per month after subsidies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/opinion/obamacare-vs-the-saboteurs.html|title=Opinion - Obamacare vs. the Saboteurs|date=4 November 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; if they choose the lowest-cost "bronze" plan.

President Trump's decision in November 2017 to end the [[cost sharing reductions subsidy]], a second type of subsidy used to reduce deductibles and co-payments, was expected to increase premiums dramatically, thereby increasing the premium tax credits as well to maintain after-subsidy costs to participants at the same percentage of income. In other words, the after-subsidy cost would not rise for those with premium tax credit subsidies. Those obtaining their insurance via the exchanges without subsidies would pay up to 20 percentage points more for insurance. CBO also estimated a $200 billion increase in the budget deficit over a decade due to Trump's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2017/8/15/16153094/voxcare-cbo-trump-obamacare-sabotage-premiums|title=CBO says Trump's Obamacare sabotage would cost $194 billion, drive up premiums 20%|work=Vox|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBO estimated that ending or not enforcing the individual mandate (which requires those without health insurance to pay a penalty) would increase the uninsured by 13 million by 2027, reducing the budget deficit by $338 billion over 10 years as subsidies fall. CBO also estimated that ending the mandate would encourage healthier people to drop out of the marketplaces, thus raising premiums by up to 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/8/16623154/cbo-obamacare-individual-mandate-new-baseline|title=CBO: 13 million more uninsured if you repeal Obamacare's individual mandate|website=vox.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicaid===
{{See|Medicaid}}
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps with medical costs for about 74 million people (as of 2017) with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers benefits not normally covered by Medicare, like nursing home care and personal care services. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to low-income and disabled people.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://econofact.org/evidence-on-the-value-of-medicaid|title=Evidence on the Value of Medicaid {{!}} Econofact|date=2017-07-02|work=Econofact|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[means test|means-tested]] program that is jointly funded by the state and federal governments and managed by the states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/ |title=Medicaid General Information|publisher=[[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; with each state currently having broad leeway to determine who is eligible for its implementation of the program. States are not required to participate in the program, although all have since 1982. Medicaid recipients must be [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizens]] or legal permanent residents, and may include low-income adults, their children, and people with certain [[Disability|disabilities]]. Poverty alone does not necessarily qualify someone for Medicaid. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), the percent of Medicaid program costs covered by the federal government, ranges from 50% for higher-income states to 75% for states with lower per-capita incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/financing-and-reimbursement/|title=Financial Management|website=www.medicaid.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Affordable Care Act]] ("Obamacare") significantly expanded both eligibility for and federal funding of Medicaid starting in 2014, with an additional 11 million covered by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/15/rand-paul/medicaid-expansion-drove-health-insurance-coverage/|title=Rand Paul goes too far on Obamacare Medicaid growth|website=politifact.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law as written, all U.S. citizens and legal residents with income up to 133% of the [[Poverty line in the United States#Measures of poverty|poverty line]], including adults without dependent children, would qualify for coverage in any state that participated in the Medicaid program. However, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in [[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]] that states do not have to agree to this expansion to continue to receive previously established levels of Medicaid funding, and 19 Republican-controlled states have chosen to continue with pre-ACA funding levels and [https://www.medicaid.gov/affordable-care-act/eligibility/index.html eligibility standards]. Expanding Medicaid in these 19 states would expand coverage for up to four million people.

The CBO reported in October 2017 that the federal government spent $375 billion on Medicaid in fiscal year 2017, an increase of $7 billion or 2% over 2016. The increase was primarily driven by more persons covered due to the ACA.&lt;ref name="CBO_MBR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53181|title=Monthly Budget Review for September 2017|date=6 October 2017|website=cbo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBO reported in October 2017 that adjusted for timing differences, Medicare spending rose by $22 billion (4%) in fiscal year 2017 to $595 billion, reflecting growth in both the number of beneficiaries and in the average benefit payment.&lt;ref name="CBO_MBR1"/&gt; Medicare average spending per-enrollee was $10,986 in 2014 across the U.S., with states ranging from $8,238 in Montana to $12,614 in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kff.org/medicare/state-indicator/per-enrollee-spending-by-residence/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D|title=Medicare Spending Per Enrollee, by State|date=19 June 2017|website=kff.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for higher costs==
The reasons for higher U.S. healthcare costs relative to other countries and over time are debated by experts.

===Relative to other countries===
[[File:Healthcare costs to GDP OECD 2015 v1.png|thumb|right|400px|Bar chart comparing healthcare costs as percentage of GDP across OECD countries]]
There are many reasons why U.S. healthcare costs are higher than other OECD countries:
*''Administrative costs''. About 25% of U.S. healthcare costs relate to administrative costs (e.g., billing and payment, as opposed to direct provision of services, supplies and medicine) versus 10-15% in other countries. For example, Duke University Hospital had 900 hospital beds but 1,300 billing clerks during 2013.&lt;ref name="Cutler1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/why-does-health-care-cost-so-much-in-america-ask-harvards-david-cutler|title=Why does health care cost so much in America? Ask Harvard's David Cutler|website=PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/beyondaca|title=Support the Physicians' Proposal for Single-Payer Health Care Reform - Physicians for a National Health Program|website=pnhp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming $3.2 trillion is spent on healthcare per year, a 10% savings would be $320 billion per year and a 15% savings would be nearly $500 billion per year. For scale, cutting administrative costs to peer country levels would represent roughly one-third to half the gap. A 2009 study from Price Waterhouse Coopers estimated $210 billion in savings from unnecessary billing and administrative costs, a figure that would be considerably higher in 2015 dollars.&lt;ref name="Dalen1"&gt;[http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(09)01115-2/fulltext Dr. James E. Dalen-The American Journal of Medicine-March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Cost variation across hospital regions''. Harvard economist [[David Cutler]] reported in 2013 that roughly 33% of healthcare spending, or about $1 trillion per year, is not associated with improved outcomes.&lt;ref name="Cutler1"/&gt; Medicare reimbursements per enrollee vary significantly across the country. In 2012, average Medicare reimbursements per enrollee ranged from an adjusted (for health status, income, and ethnicity) $6,724 in the lowest spending region to $13,596 in the highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/economic_facts_about_health_care_insurance_markets_after_aca|title=Six Economic Facts about Health Care and Health Insurance Markets - The Hamilton Project|website=www.hamiltonproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The U.S. spends more than other countries for the same things''. Drugs are more expensive, doctors are paid more, and suppliers charge more for medical equipment than other countries.&lt;ref name="Cutler1"/&gt; Journalist Todd Hixon reported on a study that U.S. spending on physicians per person is about five times higher than peer countries, $1,600 versus $310, as much as 37% of the gap with other countries. This was driven by a greater use of specialist doctors, who charge 3-6 times more in the U.S. than in peer countries.&lt;ref name="Hixon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddhixon/2012/03/01/why-are-u-s-health-care-costs-so-high/#54d1076d1dae|title=Why Are U.S. Health Care Costs So High?|first=Todd|last=Hixon|website=forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD reported that in 2013 the U.S. spent $1,026 per capita on pharmaceuticals (drugs) versus an OECD average of around $515.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/health-at-a-glance-19991312.htm|title=Health at a Glance 2017 - OECD Indicators - en - OECD|website=www.oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of an MRI in Canada is approximately $300, versus $1,000 in the U.S.&lt;ref name="CutlerQC14"/&gt;
*''Higher level of per-capita income'', which is correlated with higher healthcare spending in the U.S. and other countries. Hixon reported a study by Princeton Professor [[Uwe Reinhardt]] that concluded about $1,200 per person (in 2008 dollars) or about a third of the gap with peer countries in healthcare spending was due to higher levels of per-capita income. Higher income per-capita is correlated with using more units of healthcare.&lt;ref name="Hixon1"/&gt; 
*''Americans receive more medical care'' than people in other countries.  The U.S. consumes 3 times as many mammograms, 2.5x the number of MRI scans, and 31% more C-sections per-capita than peer countries. This is a blend of higher per-capita income and higher use of specialists, among other factors.&lt;ref name="Atlantic1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/why-do-other-rich-nations-spend-so-much-less-on-healthcare/374576/|title=Why Do Other Rich Nations Spend So Much Less on Healthcare?|first=Victor R.|last=Fuchs|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The U.S. government intervenes less actively to force down prices'' in the United States than in other countries. In the U.S., government accounts for 48% of healthcare spending, versus 76% in Europe; this ratio of spending can be viewed as a proxy for bargaining power.&lt;ref name="CutlerQC14"/&gt; Stanford economist Victor Fuchs wrote in 2014: "If we turn the question around and ask why healthcare costs so much less in other high-income countries, the answer nearly always points to a larger, stronger role for government. Governments usually eliminate much of the high administrative costs of insurance, obtain lower prices for inputs, and influence the mix of healthcare outputs by arranging for large supplies of primary-care physicians and hospital beds while keeping tight control on the number of specialist physicians and expensive technology. In the United States, the political system creates many "choke points" for diverse interest groups to block or modify government's role in these areas."&lt;ref name="Atlantic1"/&gt; Contrary to this view, economist [[Hans Sennholz]] has argued that the Medicare and Medicaid programs may be the main reason for rising health care costs in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Sennholz, Hans. [http://mises.org/daily/2285 Why is Medical Care so Expensive?]. August 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, Dr. [[Donald Berwick]], asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity of the health care system, (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Pear | first = Robert | title = Health Official Takes Parting Shot at 'Waste' | newspaper = New York Times | date = Dec 3, 2011 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/health/policy/parting-shot-at-waste-by-key-obama-health-official.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1

The [[Institute of Medicine]] reported in September 2012 that approximately $750B per year in U.S. [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] are avoidable or wasted. This included: unnecessary services ($210 billion annually); inefficient delivery of care ($130 billion); excess administrative costs ($190 billion); inflated prices ($105 billion); prevention failures ($55 billion), and fraud ($75 billion).&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt;

===Relative to prior years===
The [[Congressional Budget Office]] analyzed the reasons for healthcare cost inflation over time, reporting in 2008 that: "Although many factors contributed to the growth, most analysts have concluded that the bulk of the long-term rise resulted from the health care system's use of new medical services that were made possible by technological advances..." In summarizing several studies, CBO reported the following drove the indicated share of the increase (shown as a range across three studies) from 1940 to 1990:
*Technology changes: 38-65%. CBO defined this as "any changes in clinical practice that enhance the ability of providers to diagnose, treat, or prevent health problems."
*Personal income growth: 5-23%. Persons with more income tend to spend a greater share of it on healthcare.
*Administrative costs: 3-13%. 
*Aging of the population: 2%. As the country ages, more persons require more expensive treatments, as the aged tend to be sicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41665|title=Technological Change and the Growth of Health Care Spending|date=31 January 2008|website=cbo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have attempted to explain the reduction in the rate of annual increase following the [[Great Recession]] of 2007-2009. Reasons include, among others:
* Higher [[unemployment]] due to the recession, which has limited the ability of consumers to purchase healthcare;
* Rising out-of-pocket payments;
* [[Deductible]]s (the amount a person pays before insurance begins to cover claims) have risen sharply. Workers must pay a larger share of their own health costs, and generally forces them to spend less; and
* The proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006.&lt;ref name="NYTLowrey1"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Annie Lowrey |date=May 2013 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/business/slowdown-in-rise-of-health-care-costs-may-persist.html| title = Slowdown in Rise of Healthcare Costs May Persist | journal = [[The New York Times]]| accessdate = June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NROLevin1"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Yuval Levin |date=May 2013 | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/349295/health-costs-and-budget| title = Healthcare Costs and Budget | journal = [[National Review Online]]| accessdate = June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that consumers were reducing their health care spending in response to the current economic slow-down. Both the number of prescriptions filled and the number of office visits dropped between 2007 and 2008. In one survey, 22% of consumers reported going to the doctor less often, and 11% reported buying fewer prescription drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Fuhrmans, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122204987056661845?mod=dist_smartbrief "Consumers Cut Health Spending, As Economic Downturn Takes Toll,"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', September 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost forecasts==
[[File:CBO 2014 LTBO Spending Under Ext Baseline.png|thumb|right|350px|Spending for government healthcare programs is projected to rise significantly relative to GDP in the upcoming decades.]]
The Health and Human Services Department expects that the health share of GDP will continue its historical upward trend, reaching 19.6% of GDP by 2024.&lt;ref name="NHE Fact Sheet"&gt;[https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet.html  "National Health Expenditure Data: NHE Fact Sheet,"] [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], referenced September 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sean Keehan 2008"&gt;Sean Keehan, Andrea Sisko, Christopher Truffer, Sheila Smith, Cathy Cowan, John Poisal, M. Kent Clemens, and the National Health Expenditure Accounts Projections Team, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/hlthaff.27.2.w145v1 "Health Spending Projections Through 2017: The Baby-Boom Generation Is Coming To Medicare"], ''Health Affairs'' Web Exclusive, February 26, 2008. Retrieved February 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-partisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) reported in March 2017 that healthcare cost inflation and an aging population are primary drivers of increasing budget deficits over time, as outlays (spending) continue to rise faster than revenues relative to GDP. CBO forecast that spending on major healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) would rise from 5.5% GDP in 2017 to 9.2% GDP by 2047.&lt;ref name=CBOLT17/&gt;

The Medicare Trustees provide an annual report of the program's finances. The forecasts from 2009 and 2015 differ materially, mainly due to changes in the projected rate of healthcare cost increases, which have moderated considerably. Rather than rising to nearly 12% GDP over the forecast period (through 2080) as forecast in 2009, the 2015 forecast has Medicare costs rising to 6% GDP, comparable to the Social Security program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/ReportsTrustFunds/TrusteesReports.html?DLSort=0&amp;DLEntries=10&amp;DLPage=1&amp;DLSortDir=descending|title=TrusteesReports|date=11 July 2016|website=www.cms.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in healthcare costs is one of the primary drivers of long-term budget deficits. The long-term budget situation has considerably improved in the 2015 forecast versus the 2009 forecast per the Trustees Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/the-disappearing-entitlements-crisis/|title=The Disappearing Entitlements Crisis|date=26 July 2015|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Payment systems==
{{See also|Bundled payment|Capitation (healthcare)|Fee-for-service}}
Doctors and hospitals are generally funded by payments from patients and insurance plans in return for services rendered ([[fee-for-service]] or FFS). In the FFS payment model, each service provided is billed as an individual item, which creates an incentive to provide more services (e.g., more tests, more expensive procedures, and more medicines). This is in contrast to bundled payments, in which the amount the insurer will pay to the service providers is bundled per episode (e.g., for a heart attack patient, a total amount will be paid to the network providing the care for say 180 days). Bundling on a per patient basis (rather than per-episode) was referred to in the 1990s as a "capitated payment" but is now described as an [[accountable care organization]]. Bundling provides an incentive to lower costs, which requires offsetting measures and incentives for quality of care. Several best-practice [[healthcare systems]], such as the [[Kaiser Permanente|Kaiser]] and [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo]] health systems, use bundled payments.&lt;ref name="CutlerQC14"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cutler|year=2014 |title=[[The Quality Cure]]|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-28200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those whose employer pays for health insurance, the employee may be required to contribute part of the cost of this insurance, while the employer usually chooses the insurance company and, for large groups, negotiates with the insurance company. In 2004, private insurance paid for 36% of personal health expenditures, private out-of-pocket 15%, federal government 34%, state and local governments 11%, and other private funds 4%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus07.pdf Health, United States, 2007]. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to "a dishonest and inefficient system" that sometimes inflates bills to ten times the actual cost, even insured patients can be billed more than the real cost of their care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lopez22-2009nov22,0,7367540.column?page=1 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=The emergency room bill is enough to make you sick | first=Steve | last=Lopez | date=November 22, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurance for dental and vision care (except for visits to [[ophthalmologists]], which are covered by regular health insurance) is usually sold separately. Prescription drugs are often handled differently from medical services, including by the government programs. Major federal laws regulating the insurance industry include [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]] and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]].

Individuals with private or government insurance are limited to medical facilities which accept the particular type of medical insurance they carry. Visits to facilities outside the insurance program's "network" are usually either not covered or the patient must bear more of the cost. Hospitals negotiate with insurance programs to set reimbursement rates; some rates for government insurance programs are set by law. The sum paid to a doctor for a service rendered to an insured patient is generally less than that paid "out of pocket" by an uninsured patient. In return for this discount, the insurance company includes the doctor as part of their "network", which means more patients are eligible for lowest-cost treatment there. The negotiated rate may not cover the cost of the service, but providers (hospitals and doctors) can refuse to accept a given type of insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid. Low reimbursement rates have generated complaints from providers, and some patients with government insurance have difficulty finding nearby providers for certain types of medical services.

[[Charity care]] for those who cannot pay is sometimes available, and is usually funded by non-profit foundations, religious orders, government subsidies, or services donated by the employees. Massachusetts and New Jersey have programs where the state will pay for health care when the patient cannot afford to do so.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Massachusetts health care reform]] for Massachusetts and [[charity care]] for New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt; The City and County of San Francisco is also implementing a [[Healthy San Francisco|citywide health care program]] for all uninsured residents, limited to those whose incomes and net worth are below an eligibility threshold. Some cities and counties operate or provide subsidies to private facilities open to all regardless of the ability to pay. Means testing is applied, and some patients of limited means may be charged for the services they use.

The [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] requires virtually all hospitals to accept all patients, regardless of the ability to pay, for [[emergency room]] care. The act does not provide access to non-emergency room care for patients who cannot afford to pay for health care, nor does it provide the benefit of preventive care and the [[Health care continuity|continuity]] of a [[primary care physician]]. Emergency health care is generally more expensive than an [[urgent care]] clinic or a doctor's office visit, especially if a condition has worsened due to putting off needed care. Emergency rooms are typically at, near, or over capacity. Long wait times have become a problem nationally, and in urban areas some ERs are put on "diversion" on a regular basis, meaning that ambulances are directed to bring patients elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;See [[emergency department]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2009}}
Most Americans under age 65 (59.3%) receive their health insurance coverage through an employer (which includes both private as well as civilian public-sector employers) under [[group insurance|group coverage]], although this percentage is declining. Costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising rapidly: since 2001, premiums for family coverage have increased 78%, while wages have risen 19% and inflation has risen 17%, according to a 2007 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;ref name="Kaiser2007"/&gt; Workers with employer-sponsored insurance also contribute; in 2007, the average percentage of premium paid by covered workers is 16% for single coverage and 28% for family coverage.&lt;ref name="Kaiser2007"/&gt; In addition to their premium contributions, most covered workers face additional payments when they use health care services, in the form of deductibles and copayments.

Just less than 9% of the population purchases individual health care insurance.&lt;ref name="Census 2007"&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf "Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2007."] U.S. Census Bureau. Issued August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Insurance payments are a form of cost-sharing and risk management where each individual or their employer pays predictable monthly premiums. This cost-spreading mechanism often picks up much of the cost of health care, but individuals must often pay up-front a minimum part of the total cost (a ''deductible''), or a small part of the cost of every procedure (a [[copayment]]). Private insurance accounts for 35% of total health spending in the United States, by far the largest share among OECD countries. Beside the United States, Canada and France are the two other OECD countries where private insurance represents more than 10% of total health spending.&lt;ref name="OECD 2009"&gt;{{cite web

Provider networks can be used to reduce costs by negotiating favorable fees from providers, selecting cost effective providers, and creating financial incentives for providers to practice more efficiently.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Managed Care: Integrating the Delivery and Financing of Health Care - Part A, Health Insurance Association of America, 1995, p. 9 {{ISBN|978-1-879143-26-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A survey issued in 2009 by [[America's Health Insurance Plans]] found that patients going to out-of-network providers are sometimes charged extremely high fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahipresearch.org/PDFs/ValueSurvey/AllStatesReport.pdf ''THE VALUE OF PROVIDER NETWORKS AND THE ROLE OF OUT-OF-NETWORK CHARGES IN RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS: A SURVEY OF CHARGES BILLED BY OUT-OF-NETWORK PHYSICIANS''], [[America's Health Insurance Plans]], August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gina Kolata, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/12/health/policy/12insure.html "Survey Finds High Fees Common in Medical Care"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Defying many analysts' expectations, PPOs have gained market share at the expense of HMOs over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hurley RE, Strunk BC, White JS |title=The puzzling popularity of the PPO |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=56–68 |year=2004 |pmid=15046131 |doi= 10.1377/hlthaff.23.2.56 |url= http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15046131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the more loosely managed PPOs have edged out HMOs, HMOs themselves have also evolved towards less tightly managed models. The first HMOs in the U.S., such as [[Kaiser Permanente]] in Oakland, California, and the Health Insurance Plan (HIP) in New York, were "staff-model" HMOs, which owned their own health care facilities and employed the doctors and other health care professionals who staffed them. The name health maintenance organization stems from the idea that the HMO would make it its job to maintain the enrollee's health, rather than merely to treat illnesses. In accordance with this mission, managed care organizations typically cover preventive health care. Within the tightly integrated staff-model HMO, the HMO can develop and disseminate guidelines on cost-effective care, while the enrollee's primary care doctor can act as patient advocate and care coordinator, helping the patient negotiate the complex health care system. Despite a substantial body of research demonstrating that many staff-model HMOs deliver high-quality and cost-effective care, they have steadily lost market share. They have been replaced by more loosely managed networks of providers with whom health plans have negotiated discounted fees. It is common today for a physician or hospital to have contracts with a dozen or more health plans, each with different referral networks, contracts with different diagnostic facilities, and different practice guidelines.

===Public===
Government programs directly cover 27.8% of the population (83&amp;nbsp;million),&lt;ref name="Census 2007"/&gt; including the elderly, disabled, children, veterans, and some of the poor, and federal law mandates public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay. Public spending accounts for between 45% and 56.1% of U.S. health care spending.&lt;ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"&gt;Thomas M. Selden and Merrile Sing, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/hlthaff.27.5.w349v1 "The Distribution Of Public Spending For Health Care In The United States, 2002,"] [[Health Affairs]] 27, no. 5 (2008): w349-w359 (published online 29 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Per-capita spending on health care by the U.S. government placed it among the top ten highest spenders among United Nations member countries in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select_process.cfm?strISO3_select=ALL&amp;strIndicator_select=nha&amp;intYear_select=latest&amp;fixed=indicator&amp;language=english Core Health Indicators: Per capita government expenditure on health at average exchange rate] World Health Organization. Retrieved 2007-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, all government-funded healthcare programs exist only in the form of [[statute|statutory]] law, and accordingly can be amended or revoked like any other statute. There is no constitutional right to healthcare. The U.S. Supreme Court explained in 1977 that "the Constitution imposes no obligation on the States to pay ... any of the medical expenses of indigents."&lt;ref&gt;''Maher v. Roe'', {{ussc|432|464|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Government funded programs include:
* [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], generally covering citizens and long-term residents 65 years and older and the disabled.
* [[Medicaid]], generally covering low income people in certain categories, including children, pregnant women, and the disabled. (Administered by the states.)
* [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], which provides health insurance for low-income children who do not qualify for Medicaid. (Administered by the states, with matching state funds.)
* Various programs for federal employees, including [[TRICARE]] for military personnel (for use in civilian facilities)
* The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], which provides care to veterans, their families, and survivors through medical centers and clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/home/medicare.asp|title=Medicare|date=25 April 2017|website=www.cms.hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Title X]] which funds reproductive health care
* State and local health department clinics
* [[Indian health service]]
* [[National Institutes of Health]] treats patients who enroll in research for free.
* Medical Corps of various branches of the military.
* Certain county and state hospitals
* Government run community clinics

The exemption of employer-sponsored health benefits from federal income and payroll taxes distorts the health care market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/tbb/tbb-0505-23.pdf How the Tax Code Distorts Health Care] Cato Institute&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government, unlike some other countries, does not treat employer funded health care benefits as a taxable benefit in kind to the employee. The value of the lost tax revenue from a benefits in kind tax is an estimated $150&amp;nbsp;billion a year.&lt;ref name="Krugman"&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"]
By Paul Krugman, Robin Wells, New York Review of Books, March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some regard this as being disadvantageous to people who have to buy insurance in the individual market which must be paid from income received after tax.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setaxequity.org/ Equity for Our Nation's Self-Employed&lt;/ref&gt;

Health insurance benefits are an attractive way for employers to increase the salary of employees as they are nontaxable. As a result, 65% of the non-elderly population and over 90% of the privately insured non-elderly population receives health insurance at the workplace.&lt;ref name="nafe.net"&gt;[http://www.nafe.net/JFE/j15_2_05.pdf Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance: Past, Present and Future] Journal of Forensic Economics&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, most economists agree that this tax shelter increases individual demand for health insurance, leading some to claim that it is largely responsible for the rise in health care spending.&lt;ref name="nafe.net"/&gt;

In addition the government allows full tax shelter at the highest marginal rate to investors in [[health savings account]]s (HSAs). Some have argued that this tax incentive adds little value to national health care as a whole because the most wealthy in society tend also to be the most healthy. Also it has been argued, HSAs segregate the insurance pools into those for the wealthy and those for the less wealthy which thereby makes equivalent insurance cheaper for the rich and more expensive for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.senate.gov/Testimony%20of%20Robert%20Greenstein.pdf|title=LATEST ENROLLMENT DATA STILL FAIL TO DISPEL CONCERNS ABOUT HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS: The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|website=senate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, one advantage of health insurance accounts is that funds can only be used towards certain HSA qualified expenses, including medicine, doctor's fees, and Medicare Parts A and B. Funds cannot be used towards expenses such as cosmetic surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health401k.com/2011/09/health-savings-accounts-faq/|title=Health Savings Accounts FAQ|publisher=Health 401k|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also various state and local programs for the poor. In 2007, Medicaid provided health care coverage for 39.6&amp;nbsp;million low-income Americans (although Medicaid covers approximately 40% of America's poor),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.citizen.org/hrg/medicaid/assets/reports/2007UnsettlingScores.pdf|title=Unsettling Scores: A Ranking of State Medicaid Programs, P. 15|website=citizen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Medicare provided health care coverage for 41.4&amp;nbsp;million elderly and disabled Americans.&lt;ref name="Census 2007"/&gt; Enrollment in Medicare is expected to reach 77&amp;nbsp;million by 2031, when the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] generation is fully enrolled.&lt;ref name="CMS Stats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/CapMarketUpdates/Downloads/2006CMSstat.pdf |title=Health and Human Services Statistics 2006 | accessdate=2007-07-03 |format=PDF |work=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628214810/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/CapMarketUpdates/Downloads/2006CMSstat.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that the number of physicians accepting [[Medicaid]] has decreased in recent years due to relatively high administrative costs and low reimbursements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16918046 | issue=16 | title=Medicaid patients increasingly concentrated among physicians |date=August 2006 |vauthors=Cunningham P, May J | journal=Track Rep | pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the federal government also created the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP), a joint federal-state program to insure children in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/LowCostHealthInsFamChild/ |title=SCHIP Overview |accessdate=2007-07-03 |format= |work=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627155715/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/LowCostHealthInsFamChild/ |archivedate=2007-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SCHIP covered 6.6&amp;nbsp;million children in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalSCHIPPolicy/downloads/SCHIPEverEnrolledYearGraph.pdf |title=SCHIP Ever Enrolled in Year |accessdate=2007-09-02 |format=PDF |work=U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the program is already facing funding shortfalls in many states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/7635.pdf |title=President's FY 2008 Budget and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) |accessdate=2007-07-03 |format=PDF |work=Henry J.

==The uninsured==
{{Main|Health insurance coverage in the United States}}

===Number of uninsured===
[[File:U.S. Uninsured by Reason 2016 v1.png|thumb|right|450px|Number U.S. uninsured by reason in 2016 (non-elderly/under 65 years of age). An estimated 43% of the uninsured were eligible for financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/estimates-of-eligibility-for-aca-coverage-among-the-uninsured-in-2016/|title=Estimates of Eligibility for ACA Coverage among the Uninsured in 2016|date=25 October 2017|website=kff.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The percentage of persons without health insurance (the "uninsured") fell from 13.3% in 2013 to 8.8% in 2016, due primarily to the [[Affordable Care Act]]. The number uninsured fell from 41.8 million in 2013 to 28.0 million in 2016, a decline of 13.8 million. The number of persons with insurance (public or private) rose from 271.6 million in 2013 to 292.3 million in 2016, an increase of 20.7 million. In 2016, approximately 68% were covered by private plans, while 37% were covered by government plans; these do not add to 100% because some persons have both.&lt;ref name="Census2016"/&gt;

===Impact on costs===
Some Americans do not qualify for government-provided health insurance, are not provided health insurance by an employer, and are unable to afford, cannot qualify for, or choose not to purchase, private health insurance. When charity or "uncompensated" care is not available, they sometimes simply go without needed medical treatment. This problem has become a source of considerable political controversy on a national level. The uninsured still receive emergency care and thus if they are unable to afford it, they impose costs on others who pay higher premiums and deductibles to cover these expenses indirectly. Estimates for 2008 reported that the uninsured would spend $30 billion for healthcare and receive $56 billion in uncompensated care, and that if everyone were covered by insurance then overall costs would increase by $123 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kff.org/uninsured/kcmu082508pkg.cfm|title=New Study Examines the Current Spending on Health Care for the Uninsured and Projects the Cost of Additional Medical Care if the Population Were Insured|date=2 August 2008|website=kff.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2003 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report estimated total cost of health care provided to the uninsured at $98.9 billion in 2001, including $26.4 billion in out-of-pocket spending by the uninsured, with $34.5 billion in "free" "uncompensated" care covered by government subsidies of $30.6 billion to hospitals and clinics and $5.1 billion in donated services by physicians.&lt;ref name="IOM 2003b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Institute of Medicine. Committee on the Consequences of Uninsurance|date=June 17, 2003|title=Hidden costs, value lost: uninsurance in America|location=Washington, DC|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-08931-9|pages=47–55|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study in ''Health Affairs'' estimated that uninsured people in the U.S. received approximately $35&amp;nbsp;billion in uncompensated care in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Hadley and John Holahan,[http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/hlthaff.w3.66 How Much Medical Care Do the Uninsured Use and Who Pays for It?], Health Affairs Web Exclusive, 2003-02-13. Retrieved 2007-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted that this amount per capita was half what the average insured person received. The study found that various levels of government finance most uncompensated care, spending about $30.6&amp;nbsp;billion on payments and programs to serve the uninsured and covering as much as 80–85% of uncompensated care costs through grants and other direct payments, tax appropriations, and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and Medicaid payment add-ons. Most of this money comes from the federal government, followed by state and local tax appropriations for hospitals. Another study by the same authors in the same year estimated the additional annual cost of covering the [[uninsured]] (in 2001&amp;nbsp;dollars) at $34&amp;nbsp;billion (for public coverage) and $69&amp;nbsp;billion (for private coverage). These estimates represent an increase in total health care spending of 3–6% and would raise health care's share of GDP by less than one percentage point, the study concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Hadley and John Holahan, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.w3.250v1/DC1 Covering The Uninsured: How Much Would It Cost?], Health Affairs Web Exclusive, 2003-06-04. Retrieved 2007-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study published in the same journal in 2004 estimated that the value of health forgone each year because of uninsurance was $65–$130&amp;nbsp;billion and concluded that this figure constituted "a lower-bound estimate of economic losses resulting from the present level of uninsurance nationally."&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelmine Miller, Elizabeth Richardson Vigdor, and Willard G.

==Role of government in health care market==
Numerous [[publicly funded health care]] programs help to provide for the elderly, disabled, military service families and veterans, children, and the poor,&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. [http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ CMS Programs &amp; Information.].

[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EMTALA/ Emergency Medical Treatment &amp; Labor Act.]. Retrieved August 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; however, a system of [[universal health care]] has not been implemented nationwide. However, as the OECD has pointed out, the total U.S. public expenditure for this limited population would, in most other OECD countries, be enough for the government to provide primary health insurance for the entire population.&lt;ref name="OECD 2009"/&gt; Although the federal Medicare program and the federal-state Medicaid programs possess some [[monopsony|monopsonistic]] purchasing power, the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S. health system is relatively weak by international standards, and in some areas, some suppliers such as large hospital groups have a virtual monopoly on the supply side.&lt;ref name="prices stupid"&gt;

[[Massachusetts]] has adopted a universal health care system through the [[Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute]]. It mandates that all residents who can afford to do so purchase health insurance, provides subsidized insurance plans so that nearly everyone can afford health insurance, and provides a "Health Safety Net Fund" to pay for necessary treatment for those who cannot find affordable health insurance or are not eligible.&lt;ref&gt;Fahrenthold DA. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/04/AR2006040401937.html "Mass. Bill Requires Health Coverage."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, [[Connecticut]] passed into law a plan called [[SustiNet]], with the goal of achieving health care coverage of 98% of its residents by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html|title=AARP States - Connecticut Archives|website=AARP States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed solutions==
{{Further|Health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration|Single-payer healthcare}}
Primary cost reduction opportunities correspond to the causes described above.&lt;ref name="Dalen1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cutler1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hixon1"/&gt;  These include:
*Eliminating administrative overhead through a single-payer, "Medicare for All" approach, to reduce overhead from the current 25% of expenditures to the 10-15% level of best practice countries.
*Granting the government additional power to reduce the compensation of doctors and hospitals, as it does with Medicare and Medicaid. This would likely occur with a single-payer solution.
*Shifting from expensive intervention at the end-of-life to more low-cost palliative care, to address healthcare cost concentration among those in the last years of life.
*Allowing the government to negotiate more forcefully to reduce the costs of prescription drugs, which are roughly twice the cost per-capita in other countries.
*Using more [[bundled payment]] strategies, to limit costs while maintaining quality.
*Reducing Medicare and Medicaid fraud, with stronger controls (auditors and processes) and legal penalties.
*Improved use of healthcare technology, to improve efficiency and eliminate errors.&lt;ref name="CutlerQC14"/&gt;

Increased spending on disease prevention is often suggested as a way of reducing health care spending.&lt;ref name="Brown 2008"/&gt; Whether prevention saves or costs money depends on the intervention. Childhood [[vaccination]]s,&lt;ref name="Brown 2008"/&gt; or [[birth control|contraceptives]]&lt;ref name=Tsui&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsui AO, McDonald-Mosley R, Burke AE |title=Family planning and the burden of unintended pregnancies |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=152–74 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20570955 |pmc=3115338 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxq012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; save much more than they cost. Research suggests that in many cases prevention does not produce significant long-term cost savings.&lt;ref name="Brown 2008"/&gt; Some interventions may be cost-effective by providing health benefits, while others are not cost-effective.&lt;ref name="Brown 2008"/&gt;  Preventive care is typically provided to many people who would never become ill, and for those who would have become ill is partially offset by the health care costs during additional years of life.&lt;ref name="Brown 2008"&gt;David Brown, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/04/AR2008040403803.html?hpid=smartliving&amp;sid=ST2008040601449 "In the Balance: Some Candidates Disagree, but Studies Show It's Often Cheaper To Let People Get Sick,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, research conducted by Novartis argues that the countries that have excelled in getting the highest value for healthcare spending are the ones who have invested more in prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. The trick is to avoid getting patients to hospital, which is where highest healthcare dollars are being consumed. Not all preventive measures have good ROI (EG. Global vaccination campaign for a rare infectious diseases). However, preventive measures such as diet, exercises and reduction of tobacco intake would have broad impact on many diseases and will offer good return of investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7mnJBWb-rE|title=The biggest myth in healthcare: Dr. Joshi Venugopal at TEDxPuntaPaitilla|first=|last=TEDx Talks|date=24 July 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention and control ==
* Using the '''health warning systems'''. A health system responsive to the needs of the population is required to refine the instruments to ensure adequate preparation before their hatching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/HAN/|title=Health Alert Network (HAN). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Atlanta. 2011/08/29.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912180424/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/HAN/|archivedate=2011-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valencia R, Román E, García-León FJ, et al.

Rev Adm Sanit. 2006; 4:425–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Transparency of the institutions''' public or private. The perception of crisis can escape the control of experts or health institutions, and be determined by stakeholders to provide solutions propagate or concerned. This requires a difficult balancing of the need to articulate clear answers and the little-founded fears.&lt;ref&gt;Abouzhr C, Adjei S, Kanchanachitra C. From data to policy: good practices and cautionary tales. Lancet. 2007; 369:1039–46.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adequate '''information policy'''. Irrationality arise when information is distorted, or hidden. Face a health crisis involves: respect for society, coordination of organizations and an institution with scientific weight to the people and to the media, who acted as spokesman in situations of public health risk, to get confidence citizens. The technical capacity of health professionals is more proven than the public officials, which suggests a greater share of the former and better training of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/Risks/|title=Risk Communication- Gateway to Health Communication - CDC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcs.es/publicaciones/sistema_sanitario_situaciones_crisis.html|title=El Sistema Sanitario ante situaciones de crisis|first=Quodem Consultores S.L.|last=www.quodem.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamata F. Crisis sanitaria y respuesta política. Rev Adm Sanit. 2006; 4:401–6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Evaluate the previous crisis''' or others experiences. Crises are challenges that must be learned from both the mistakes and successes, since they serve to bring about to the devices and improve the response to other crises. It is important to perform analysis of previous responses, audit risk and vulnerability, research and testing, and drills to prepare themselves against future crises.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel PB, Le P, Ververs MT, et al.

* Having '''objectives''': "first, to reduce the impact of illness and death, and second, to avoid social fracture".&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein RA. Planning for epidemics--the lessons of SARS. N Engl J Med. 2004; 350(23):2332-4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preparing '''contingency plans'''. Preparation is key to the crisis because it allows a strong response, organized, and scientifically based. Action plans must meet the professional early enough and properly trained, and politicians must be consistent in their actions and coordinate all available resources. It is essential to invest in public health resources to prepare preventive measures and reducing health inequalities to minimize the impact of health crises, as they generally always the poorest suffer most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/mar/23/the-health-care-crisis-and-what-to-do-about-it/|title=The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It|first=Paul Krugman and Robin|last=Wells|date=23 March 2006|publisher=|via=The New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equipocesca.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/crisis-2007-05-22-el-pais-el-eterno-retorno-de-las-crisis-sanitarias.pdf|title=Gérvas J, Hernández I.

Thus, if one population dies younger than another because of genetic differences, a non-remediable/controllable factor, we tend to say that there is a health inequality.

Poor socioeconomic status has the capacity to profoundly limit the [[Capability approach#Capabilities|capabilities]] of an individual or population, manifesting itself through deficiencies in both [[Financial capital|financial]] and [[social capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ben-Shlomo Yoav, White Ian R., Marmot Michael | year = 1996 | title = Does the Variation in the Socioeconomic Characteristics of an Area Affect Mortality? | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 312 | issue = 7037| pages = 1013–1014 | doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7037.1013| pmc = 2350820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear how a lack of financial capital can compromise the capacity to maintain good health.

In China, for instance, the collapse of the [[Healthcare reform in China|Cooperative Medical System]] left many of the rural poor uninsured and unable to access the resources necessary to maintain good health&lt;ref&gt;Sun, X., Jackson, S., Carmichael, G. and Sleigh, A.C., 2009. Catastrophic medical payment and financial protection in rural China: evidence from the New Cooperative Medical Scheme in Shandong Province. Health economics, 18(1), pp.103-119.&lt;/ref&gt;. Increases in the cost of medical treatment made healthcare increasingly unaffordable for these populations. This issue was further perpetuated by the rising [[income inequality]] in the Chinese population. Poor Chinese were often unable to undergo necessary hospitalization and failed to complete treatment regimens, resulting in poorer health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Zhao, Zhongwei 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhao Zhongwei | year = 2006 | title = Income Inequality, Unequal Health Care Access, and Mortality in China | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 461–483 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00133.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in Tanzania, it was demonstrated that wealthier families were far more likely to bring their children to a healthcare provider: a significant step towards stronger healthcare.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some scholars have noted that unequal income distribution itself can be a cause of poorer health for a society as a result of "underinvestment in social goods, such as public education and health care; disruption of social cohesion and the erosion of social capital".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The role of socioeconomic status in health equity extends beyond simple monetary restrictions on an individual's purchasing power. In fact, [[social capital]] plays a significant role in the health of individuals and their communities. It has been shown that those who are better connected to the resources provided by the individuals and communities around them (those with more social capital) live longer lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = House J.

Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty used by some programs in the developing world appear to lead to a reduction in the likelihood of being sick.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities: effect on use of health services and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |pages=CD011135 |year=2017 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2 |pmid=29139110 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Liu |first2=Sze |last3=Walter |first3=Stefan  |last4=Pabayo |first4=Roman |last5=Saith |first5=Ruhi |last6=Lhachimi |first6=Stefan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such evidence can guide resource allocations to effective interventions.

=== Education ===
Education is an important factor in healthcare utilization, though it is closely intertwined with economic status. An individual may not go to a medical professional or seek care if they don’t know the ills of their failure to do so, or the value of proper treatment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Tajikistan, since the nation gained its independence, the likelihood of giving birth at home has increased rapidly among women with lower educational status. Education also has a significant impact on the quality of prenatal and maternal healthcare. Mothers with primary education consulted a doctor during pregnancy at significantly lower rates (72%) when compared to those with a secondary education (77%), technical training (88%) or a higher education (100%).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Falkingham Jane | year = 2003 | title = Inequality and Changes in Women's Use of Maternal Health-Care Services in Tajikistan | url = | journal = Studies in Family Planning | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 32–43 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2003.00032.x| pmid = 12772444 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence for a correlation between socioeconomic status and health literacy; one study showed that wealthier Tanzanian families were more likely to recognize disease in their children than those that were coming from lower income backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schellenberg J.

== Spatial disparities in health ==
{{see also|Healthcare reform in China}}

For some populations, access to healthcare and health resources is physically limited, resulting in health inequities. For instance, an individual might be physically incapable of traveling the distances required to reach healthcare services, or long distances can make seeking regular care unappealing despite the potential benefits.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Banerjee, A., Banerjee, A. V., &amp; Duflo, E. (2011).

Inequity has decreased in some areas of the nation as a result of the work of healthcare reform programs, however those regions not served by the programs have experienced a slight increase in inequity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rosero-Bixby L | year = 2004 | title = Spatial access to health care in Costa Rica and its equity: a GIS-based study | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 58 | issue = 7| pages = 1271–1284 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(03)00322-8 | pmid = 14759675 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

China experienced a serious decrease in spatial health equity following the Chinese economic revolution in the 1980s as a result of the degradation of the [[Healthcare reform in China|Cooperative Medical System]] (CMS). The CMS provided an infrastructure for the delivery of healthcare to rural locations, as well as a framework to provide funding based upon communal contributions and government subsidies. In its absence, there was a significant decrease in the quantity of healthcare professionals (35.9%), as well as functioning clinics (from 71% to 55% of villages over 14 years) in rural areas, resulting in inequitable healthcare for rural populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liu Y. |author2=Hsiao W.

Similarly, populations in rural Tajikistan experience spatial health inequities. A study by [[Jane Falkingham]] noted that physical access to healthcare was one of the primary factors influencing quality of maternal healthcare. Further, many women in rural areas of the country did not have adequate access to healthcare resources, resulting in poor maternal and neonatal care. These rural women were, for instance, far more likely to give birth in their homes without medical oversight.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Ethnic and racial disparities==
{{see also|Race and health}}

Along with the socioeconomic factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities in health and access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that [[Race and health in the United States|these racially centered disparities continue to exist]] and are a significant social health issue.&lt;ref name="Weinick"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weinick R. M. |author2=Zuvekas S. H. |author3=Cohen J. W. | year = 2000 | title = Racial and ethnic differences in access to and use of health care services, 1977 to 1996. Medical care research and review | url = | journal = MCRR | volume = 57 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 36–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences in the quality of care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. A 2002 study in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with blacks receiving lower quality care than their white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Eric C.|date=2002-03-13|title=Racial Disparities in the Quality of Care for Enrollees in Medicare Managed Care|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/194724|journal=JAMA|language=en|volume=287|issue=10|doi=10.1001/jama.287.10.1288|issn=0098-7484|page=1288}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes, or living below the poverty line. In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while their white counterparts made an average of $54,920.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=pcc&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=4&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX1838000217&amp;&amp;docId=GALE&amp;#124;CX1838000217&amp;docType=GALE|title = African American Poverty Leads to Health Disparities|date = 2010|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher = UXL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Also African American women were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

There are also considerable racial disparities in access to insurance coverage, with ethnic minorities generally having less insurance coverage than non-ethnic minorities. For example, Hispanic Americans tend to have less insurance coverage than white Americans and as a result receive less regular medical care. The level of insurance coverage is directly correlated with access to healthcare including preventative and [[ambulatory]] care.&lt;ref name="Weinick" /&gt; A 2010 study on racial and ethnic disparities in health done by the [[Institute of Medicine]] has shown that the aforementioned disparities cannot solely be accounted for in terms of certain demographic characteristics like: insurance status, household income, education, age, geographic location and quality of living conditions. Even when the researchers corrected for these factors, the disparities persist.&lt;ref name="unequal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nelson A | year = 2002 | title = Unequal treatment: confronting racial and ethnic disparities in health care | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2594273/pdf/jnma00325-0024.pdf | journal = Journal of the National Medical Association | volume = 94 | issue = | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery has contributed to [[Race and health in the United States#African-Americans|disparate health outcomes for generations of African Americans in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaskins|first1=Darrell J.|title=RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AND WEALTH: THE EFFECTS OF SLAVERY AND PAST DISCRIMINATION|journal=Review of Black Political Economy|date=Spring 2005|volume=32|issue=America: History &amp; Life, EBSCOhost|page=95|accessdate=|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12114-005-1007-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic health inequities also appear in nations across the African continent. A survey of the child mortality of major ethnic groups across 11 African nations (Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia) was published in 2000 by the WHO. The study described the presence of significant ethnic parities in the child mortality rates among children younger than 5 years old, as well as in education and vaccine use.&lt;ref name=pmid10686731&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10686731 |pmc=2560588 |year=2000 |author1=Brockerhoff |first1=M |title=Inequality of child mortality among ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=30–41 |last2=Hewett |first2=P }}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, the legacy of apartheid still manifests itself as a differential access to social services, including healthcare based upon race and social class, and the resultant health inequities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bloom G. |author2=McIntyre D. | year = 1998 | title = Towards equity in health in an unequal society | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 10| pages = 1529–1538 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(98)00233-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McIntyre D. |author2=Gilson L. | year = 2002 | title = Putting equity in health back onto the social policy agenda: experience from South Africa | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 11| pages = 1637–1656 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00332-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, evidence suggests systematic disregard of indigenous populations in a number of countries. The Pygmys of Congo, for instance, are excluded from government health programs, discriminated against during public health campaigns, and receive poorer overall healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ohenjo N. |author2=Willis R. |author3=Jackson D. |author4=Nettleton C. |author5=Good K. |author6=Mugarura B. | year = 2006 | title = Health of Indigenous people in Africa | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 367 | issue = 9526| pages = 1937–1946 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68849-1 |pmid=16765763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of five European countries (Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Italy, and France), a 1995 survey noted that only Sweden provided access to translators for 100% of those who needed it, while the other countries lacked this service potentially compromising healthcare to non-native populations. Given that non-natives composed a considerable section of these nations (6%, 17%, 3%, 1%, and 6% respectively), this could have significant detrimental effects on the health equity of the nation. In France, an older study noted significant differences in access to healthcare between native French populations, and non-French/migrant populations based upon health expenditure; however this was not fully independent of poorer economic and working conditions experienced by these populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bollini P. |author2=Siem H. | year = 1995 | title = No real progress towards equity: Health of migrants and ethnic minorities on the eve of the year 2000 | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 41 | issue = 6| pages = 819–828 | doi = 10.1016/0277-9536(94)00386-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study of race-based health inequity in Australia revealed that [[Indigenous health in Australia|Aborigines experienced higher rates of mortality]] than non-Aborigine populations. Aborigine populations experienced 10 times greater mortality in the 30–40 age range; 2.5 times greater infant mortality rate, and 3 times greater age standardized mortality rate. Rates of diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis are also significantly greater in this population (16 and 15 times greater respectively), which is indicative of the poor healthcare of this ethnic group. At this point in time, the parities in life expectancy at birth between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples were highest in Australia, when compared to the US, Canada and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mooney G | year = 1996 | title = And now for vertical equity?

Recognizing the need for LGBT healthcare research, the Director of the [[National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities]] (NIMHD) at the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] designated sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) as a health disparity population for NIH research in October 2016.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Meads, C.; Pennant, M.; McManus, J.; Bayliss, S.

Additionally, members of the LGBT community contend with health care disparities due, in part, to lack of provider training and awareness of the population’s healthcare needs.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; Studies regarding patient-provider communication in the LGBT patient community show that providers themselves report a significant lack of awareness regarding the health issues LGBT-identifying patients face.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; As a component of this fact, medical schools do not focus much attention on LGBT health issues in their curriculum; the LGBT-related topics that are discussed tend to be limited to HIV/AIDS, sexual orientation, and gender identity.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;

Among LGBT-identifying individuals, transgender individuals face especially significant barriers to treatment.

LGBT health issues have received disproportionately low levels of medical research, leading to difficulties in assessing appropriate strategies for LGBT treatment.

A June 2017 review sponsored by the European commission as part of a larger project to identify and diminish health inequities, found that LGB are at higher risk of some cancers and that LGBTI were at higher risk of mental illness, and that these risks were not adequately addressed.  The causes of health inequities were, according to the review, "i) cultural and social norms that preference and prioritise heterosexuality; ii) minority stress associated with sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics; iii) victimisation; iv) discrimination (individual and institutional), and; v) stigma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Health4LGBTI |title=State-of-the-art study focusing on the health inequalities faced by LGBTI people D1.1 State-of-the-Art Synthesis Report (SSR) June, 2017 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/social_determinants/docs/stateofart_report_en.pdf |date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex and gender in medicine ===
Both gender and sex are significant factors that influence health. '''[[Sex]]''' is characterized by female and male biological differences in regards to gene expression, hormonal concentration, and anatomical characteristics.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Regitz-Zagrosek|first=Vera|date=July 2012|title=Sex and gender differences in health|journal=EMBO Reports|volume=13|issue=7|pages=596–603|doi=10.1038/embor.2012.87|issn=1469-221X|pmc=3388783|pmid=22699937}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Gender]]''' is an expression of behavior and lifestyle choices. Both sex and gender inform each other, and it is important to note that differences between the two genders influence disease manifestation and associated healthcare approaches.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Understanding how the interaction of sex and gender contributes to disparity in the context of health allows providers to ensure quality outcomes for patients. This interaction is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing between sex and gender given their intertwined nature; sex modifies gender, and gender can modify sex, thereby impacting health.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Sex and gender can both be considered sources of health disparity; both contribute to men and women’s susceptibility to various health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and autoimmune disorders.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Health disparities in the male population ===
As sex and gender are inextricably linked in day-to-day life, their union is apparent in medicine. Gender and sex are both components of health disparity in the male population. In non-Western regions, males tend to have a health advantage over women due to gender discrimination, evidenced by infanticide, early marriage, and domestic abuse for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fikree|first=FF|last2=Pasha|first2=O|date=2004|title=Role of gender in health disparity: the South Asian context|url=|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=328 | issue = 7443 |pages=823–826|via=|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7443.823|pmid=15070642|pmc=383384}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most regions of the world, the mortality rate is higher for adult men than for adult women; for example, adult men suffer from fatal illnesses with more frequency than females.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/child-adolescenthealth/New_Publications/ADH/WHO_FCH_CAH_00.7.pdf|title=What about boys?

=== Health disparities in the female population ===
Gender and sex are also components of health disparity in the female population. The 2012 [[World Development Report]] (WDR) noted that women in [[Developing country|developing nations]] experience greater [[mortality rate]]s than men in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. (2012). World Development Report on Gender Equality and Development.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, women in developing countries have a much higher risk of [[maternal death]] than those in developed countries. The highest risk of dying during childbirth is 1 in 6 in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, compared to nearly 1 in 30,000 in Sweden—a disparity that is much greater than that for neonatal or [[child mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronsmans|first=Carine|last2=Graham|first2=Wendy J|title=Maternal mortality: who, when, where, and why |journal=The Lancet|volume=368|issue=9542|pages=1189–1200|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69380-x|pmid=17011946|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural factors ===
Health disparities are also due in part to cultural factors that involve practices based not only on sex, but also gender status. For example, in [[China]], health disparities have distinguished medical treatment for men and women due to the cultural phenomenon of preference for male children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mu|first=Ren|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiaobo|date=2011-01-01|title=Why does the Great Chinese Famine affect the male and female survivors differently?

Additionally, the cultural practice of [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) is known to impact women's health, though is difficult to know the worldwide extent of this practice.

Individuals living in rural areas, especially poor rural areas, have access to fewer health care resources. Although 20 percent of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, only 9 percent of physicians practice in rural settings. Individuals in rural areas typically must travel longer distances for care, experience long waiting times at clinics, or are unable to obtain the necessary health care they need in a timely manner. Rural areas characterized by a largely Hispanic population average 5.3 physicians per 10,000 residents compared with 8.7 physicians per 10,000 residents in nonrural areas. Financial barriers to access, including lack of health insurance, are also common among the urban poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/field-based-outreach-workers-facilitate-access-health-care-and-social-services-underserved |title=Field-Based Outreach Workers Facilitate Access to Health Care and Social Services for Underserved Individuals in Rural Areas |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disparities in access to health care==

Reasons for disparities in access to health care are many, but can include the following:

* '''Lack of [[universal health care]] or [[health insurance]] coverage'''. Without health insurance, patients are more likely to postpone medical care, go without needed medical care, go without prescription medicines, and be denied access to care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tikkanen|first1=Roosa Sofia|last2=Woolhandler|first2=Steffie|last3=Himmelstein|first3=David U.|last4=Kressin|first4=Nancy R.|last5=Hanchate|first5=Amresh|last6=Lin|first6=Meng-Yun|last7=McCormick|first7=Danny|last8=Lasser|first8=Karen E.|title=Hospital Payer and Racial/Ethnic Mix at Private Academic Medical Centers in Boston and New York City|journal=International Journal of Health Services|volume=47|issue=3|date=2 February 2017|pages=460–476|doi=10.1177/0020731416689549|pmid=28152644|pmc=6090544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minority groups in the United States lack insurance coverage at higher rates than whites.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured (KCMU), "The Uninsured and Their Access to Health Care" (December 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This problem does not exist in countries with fully funded public health systems, such as the examplar of the [[National Health Service|NHS]].
* '''Lack of a regular source of care'''. Without access to a regular source of care, patients have greater difficulty obtaining care, fewer doctor visits, and more difficulty obtaining prescription drugs. Compared to whites, minority groups in the United States are less likely to have a doctor they go to on a regular basis and are more likely to use [[emergency rooms]] and [[clinics]] as their regular source of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fryer G. E. |author2=Dovey S. M. |author3=Green L. A. | year = 2000 | title = The Importance of Having a Usual Source of Health Care | url = | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 62 | issue = | page = 477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, which is much more racially harmonious, this issue arises for a different reason; since 2004, NHS [[General practitioners|GPs]] have not been responsible for care out of normal GP surgery opening hours, leading to significantly higher attendances in [[Emergency department|A+E]]
* '''Lack of financial resources'''. Although the lack of financial resources is a barrier to health care access for many Americans, the impact on access appears to be greater for minority populations.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth Fund (CMWF), [http://www.commonwealthfund.org/News/News-Releases/1999/May/Analysis-Of-Minority-Health-Reveals-Persistent--Widespread-Disparities.aspx "Analysis of Minority Health Reveals Persistent, Widespread Disparities,"] press release (May 14, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Legal]] barriers'''. Access to medical care by low-income immigrant minorities can be hindered by legal barriers to public insurance programs.  For example, in the United States federal law bars states from providing [[Medicaid]] coverage to [[immigrants]] who have been in the country fewer than five years.&lt;ref name="Goldberg, J. 2004 page 10"&gt;Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J. "Understanding Health Disparities." Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example could be when a non-English speaking person attends a clinic where the receptionist does not speak the person's language. This is mostly seen in Hispanic people who do not speak English. 
* '''Structural barriers'''. These barriers include poor transportation, an inability to schedule appointments quickly or during convenient hours, and excessive time spent in the waiting room, all of which affect a person's ability and willingness to obtain needed care.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), "National Healthcare Disparities Report," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (July 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The health care financing system'''. The [[Institute of Medicine]] in the United States says fragmentation of the U.S. health care delivery and financing system is a barrier to accessing care. Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be enrolled in health insurance plans which place limits on covered services and offer a limited number of health care providers.&lt;ref name="Goldberg, J. 2004 page 10"/&gt;
* '''Scarcity of providers'''. In inner cities, rural areas, and communities with high concentrations of minority populations, access to medical care can be limited due to the scarcity of primary care practitioners, specialists, and diagnostic facilities.&lt;ref name="K. Collins, D. Hughes 2002"&gt;[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Fund-Reports/2002/Mar/Diverse-Communities--Common-Concerns--Assessing-Health-Care-Quality-for-Minority-Americans.aspx K. Collins, D. Hughes, M. Doty, B. Ives, J. Edwards, and K. Tenney, "Diverse Communities, Common Concerns: Assessing Health Care Quality for Minority Americans]," Commonwealth Fund (March 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] (a [[quango]]) has a legal obligation to ensure that sufficient provision exists in all parts of the nation.
* '''Linguistic barriers'''. Language differences restrict access to medical care for minorities in the United States who are not [[English language|English]]-proficient.&lt;ref&gt;National Health Law Program and the Access Project (NHeLP), Language Services Action Kit: Interpreter Services in Health Care Settings for People With Limited English Proficiency (February 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Health [[literacy]].''' This is where patients have problems obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. For example, patients with a poor understanding of good health may not know when it is necessary to seek care for certain symptoms. While problems with health literacy are not limited to minority groups, the problem can be more pronounced in these groups than in whites due to socioeconomic and educational factors.&lt;ref name="K. Collins, D. Hughes 2002"/&gt; A study conducted in Mdantsane, South Africa depicts the correlation of maternal education and the antenatal visits for pregnancy. As patients have a greater education, they tend to use maternal health care services more than those with a lesser maternal education background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Determinants of access to and use of maternal health care services in the Eastern Cape, South Africa- a quantitative and qualitative investigation|last = Mluleki Tsawe|first = Appunni Sathiya Susuman|date = 2014|journal = BMC Research Notes|doi = 10.1186/1756-0500-7-723|pmid = 25315012|pmc = 4203863|access-date =|volume=7|pages=723}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lack of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in the health care workforce'''. A major reason for disparities in access to care are the [[cultural]] differences between predominantly white health care providers and minority patients. Only 4% of physicians in the United States are African American, and Hispanics represent just 5%, even though these percentages are much less than their groups' proportion of the United States population.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J. "Understanding Health Disparities." Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Age.''' Age can also be a factor in health disparities for a number of reasons. As many older Americans exist on fixed incomes which may make paying for health care expenses difficult. Additionally, they may face other barriers such as impaired mobility or lack of transportation which make accessing health care services challenging for them physically. Also, they may not have the opportunity to access health information via the internet as less than 15% of Americans over the age of 65 have access to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brodie M, Flournoy RE, Altman DE | year = 2000 | title = Health information, the Internet, and the digital divide | url = | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 255–65 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.19.6.255| pmid = 11192412 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could put older individuals at a disadvantage in terms of accessing valuable information about their health and how to protect it. On the other hand, older individuals in the US (65 or above) are provided with medical care via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].

==Disparities in quality of health care==

Health disparities in the quality of care exist and are based on language and ethnicity/race which includes:

=== Problems with patient-provider communication ===
Communication is critical for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patient’s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and failure to receive follow-up care.   The patient provider relationship is dependent on the ability of both individuals to effectively communicate.  Language and culture both play a significant role in communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians.  Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask.&lt;ref name="Health Care Quality Survey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Care Quality Survey|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Surveys/2001/2001-Health-Care-Quality-Survey.aspx|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time.&lt;ref name="Health Care Quality Survey" /&gt; Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Betancourt|first=J. R.|title=Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care|year=2002|publisher=Institute of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers.  Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater.  Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one.  The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ku|first=L.|author2=Flores, G.|title=Pay Now or Pay Later: Providing Interpreter Services in Health Care|journal=Health Affairs|date=Mar–Apr 2005|volume=24|issue=2|pages=435–444|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.2.435|pmid=15757928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor communication contributes to poor medical compliance and health outcomes.  Many health-related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients. This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient.  However, there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and be satisfied with the care experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez|title=Physician Language Ability and Cultural Competence|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|date=Feb 2004|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167–174|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.30266.x|pmc=1492135|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flores|title=Errors in Medical Interpretation and their Potential Clinical Consequences in Pediatric Encounters|journal=Pediatrics|date=Jan 2003|volume=111|issue=1|pages=6–14|doi=10.1542/peds.111.1.6|pmid=12509547|display-authors=etal|citeseerx=10.1.1.488.9277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish-speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamers|author2=McNulty|title=Professional Interpreters and Bilingual Physicians in a Pediatric Emergency Department|journal=Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine|date=Nov 2002|volume=156|issue=11|pages=1108–1113|doi=10.1001/archpedi.156.11.1108}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers.   It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients’ health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting.  Understanding a patients’ view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment.  So providers need to assess patients’ health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleinman|first=A.|author2=Eisenberg, L. |title=Culture, Illness and Care: Clinical Lessons for Anthropologic and Cross Culture Research|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|year=1978|volume=88|issue=2|pages=251–258|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-88-2-251|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs, mistrust of Western medicine, and familial and hierarchical roles, all of which a white provider may not be familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J. "Understanding Health Disparities." Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Other type of communication problems are seen in LGBT health care with the spoken heterosexist (conscious or unconscious) attitude on LGBT patients, lack of understanding on issues like having no sex with men (lesbians, gynecologic examinations) and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VA2roY9wVq0C&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=Heterosexism+in+Health+and+Social+Care&amp;ei=SF1fSq6DDJbyzQSX4JnBBQ&amp;hl=en Handbook of health behavior research, David S. Gochman]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Provider discrimination ===
Provider [[discrimination]] occurs when health care providers either unconsciously or consciously treat certain racial and ethnic patients differently from other patients. This may be due to stereotypes that providers may have towards ethnic/racial groups. Doctors are more likely to ascribe negative racial stereotypes to their minority patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Ryn|first=M.|author2=Burke, J.|title=The effect of Patient Race and Socio-economic Status on Physicians' Perceptions on Patients|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2000|volume=50|issue=6|pages=813–828|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00338-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur regardless of consideration for education, income, and personality characteristics. Two types of stereotypes may be involved, [[Implicit stereotype|automatic stereotypes]] or goal modified stereotypes.  Automated stereotyping is when stereotypes are automatically activated and influence judgments/behaviors outside of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Burgess 2006 119–134"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=D.

Critics question this research and say further studies are needed to determine how doctors and patients make their treatment decisions. Others argue that certain diseases cluster by ethnicity and that clinical decision making does not always reflect these differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smedley B. |author2=Stith A. |author3=Nelson A. | year = 2002 | title = Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2594273/pdf/jnma00325-0024.pdf | journal = Institute of Medicine | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of preventive care ===
According to the 2009 National Healthcare Disparities Report, uninsured Americans are less likely to receive preventive services in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Habib JL | year = 2010 | title = Progress lags in infection prevention and health disparities | url = http://www.patientcareonline.com/drug-benefit-trends/progress-lags-infection-prevention-and-health-disparities | journal = Drug Benefit Trends | volume = 22 | issue = 4| page = 112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, minorities are not regularly screened for [[colon cancer]] and the death rate for colon cancer has increased among African Americans and Hispanic populations. Furthermore, limited English proficient patients are also less likely to receive preventive health services such as mammograms.&lt;ref name=pmid9276652&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9276652 |pmc=1497155 |year=1997 |author1=Woloshin |first1=S |title=Is language a barrier to the use of preventive services? |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=472–7 |last2=Schwartz |first2=L.

==Plans for achieving health equity==
There are a multitude of strategies for achieving health equity and reducing disparities outlined in scholarly texts, some examples include:

* '''Advocacy'''. Advocacy for health equity has been identified as a key means of promoting favourable policy change.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Social Determinants of Health. Closing the gap in a generation: health equity through action on the social determinants of health. Final Report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. 2008. Available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563703_eng.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; EuroHealthNet carried out a systematic review of the academic and grey literature. It found, amongst other things, that certain kinds of evidence may be more persuasive in advocacy efforts, that practices associated with knowledge transfer and translation can increase the uptake of knowledge, that there are many different potential advocates and targets of advocacy and that advocacy efforts need to be tailored according to context and target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farrer L. |author2=Marinetti C. |author3=Cavaco Y. K. |author4=Costongs C. | year = 2015 | title = Advocacy for Health Equity: A Synthesis Review | url = | journal = Milbank Quarterly | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 392–437 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0009.12112 |pmid=26044634 |pmc=4462882 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of its work, it produced an online advocacy for health equity toolkit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://health-gradient.eu/health-advocacy-toolkit/ | title=Health Gradient &amp;#124; EuroHealthNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Provider based incentives to improve healthcare for ethnic populations'''. One source of health inequity stems from unequal treatment of non-white patients in comparison with white patients. Creating provider based incentives to create greater parity between treatment of white and non-white patients is one proposed solution to eliminate provider bias.&lt;ref&gt;http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These incentives typically are monetary because of its effectiveness in influencing physician behavior. 
* '''Using Evidence Based Medicine (EBM)'''. Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) shows promise in reducing healthcare provider bias in turn promoting health equity.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, J. R., &amp; Maina, A. (2007). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-59745-485-8_5 Barriers to Eliminating Disparities in Clinical Practice]. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (83-98). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory EBM can reduce disparities however other research suggests that it might exacerbate them instead. Some cited shortcomings include EBM’s injection of clinical inflexibility in decision making and its origins as a purely cost driven measure.&lt;ref&gt;Maxey, R. W., &amp; Williams, R. A. (2007). Second Class Medicine: Implications of Evidence-Based Medicine for Improving Minority Access to the Correct Pharmaceutical Therapy. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (99-120). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Increasing awareness'''. The most cited measure to improving health equity relates to increasing public awareness. A lack of public awareness is a key reason why there has not been significant gains in reducing health disparities in ethnic and minority populations. Increased public awareness would lead to increased congressional awareness, greater availability of disparity data, and further research into the issue of health disparities.
* '''The Gradient Evaluation Framework'''. The evidence base defining which policies and interventions are most effective in reducing health inequalities is extremely weak. It is important therefore that policies and interventions which seek to influence health inequity be more adequately evaluated. Gradient Evaluation Framework (GEF) is an action-oriented policy tool that can be applied to assess whether policies will contribute to greater health equity amongst children and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://health-gradient.eu/gef-the-gradient-evaluation-framework/ | title=Health Gradient &amp;#124; EuroHealthNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The AIM framework'''. In a pilot study, researchers examined the role of AIM—ability, incentives, and management feedback—in reducing care disparity in pressure-ulcer detection between African American and Caucasian residents. The results showed that while the program was implemented, the provision of (1) training to enhance ability, (2) monetary incentives to enhance motivation, and (3) management feedback to enhance accountability led to successful reduction in pressure ulcers. Specifically, the detection gap between the two groups decreased. The researchers suggested additional replications with longer duration to assess the effectiveness of the AIM framework.
* '''Monitoring actions on the social determinants of health'''. In 2017, citing the need for accounatbility for the pledges made by countries in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Detereminants of Health, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund called for the monitoring of intersectoral interventions on the social detereminants of health that improve health equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |pmid=29147060 |pmc=5677605 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784–787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health inequalities==
Health inequality is the term used in a number of countries to refer to those instances whereby the health of two demographic groups (not necessarily ethnic or racial groups) differs despite comparative access to health care services. Such examples include higher rates of [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] for those in lower occupational classes than those in higher occupational classes, and the increased likelihood of those from ethnic minorities being diagnosed with a mental health disorder. In [[Canada]], the issue was brought to public attention by the [[LaLonde report]].

In [[UK]], the [[Black Report]] was produced in 1980 to highlight inequalities. On 11 February 2010, Sir [[Michael Marmot]], an epidemiologist at University College London, published the ''Fair Society, Healthy Lives'' report on the relationship between health and poverty. Marmot described his findings as illustrating a "social gradient in health": the life expectancy for the poorest is seven years shorter than for the most wealthy, and the poor are more likely to have a disability. In its report on this study, ''The Economist'' argued that the material causes of this contextual health inequality include unhealthful lifestyles - smoking remains more common, and obesity is increasing fastest, amongst the poor in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displayStory.cfm?story_id=15501633|title=In sickness and in health|journal=The Economist|date=11 February 2010|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, the [[European Commission]] launched the Joint Action Health Equity in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/chafea/news/news599.html|title=IA new Joint Action to tackle health inequalities in Europe|date= 21–22 June 2018|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-nine participants from 25 [[European Union]] Member States will work together to address health inequalities and the underlying [[social determinants of health]] across Europe. Under the coordination of the [[Istituto Superiore di Sanità|Italian Institute of Public Health]], the Joint Action aims to achieve greater equity in health in Europe across all social groups while reducing the inter-country heterogeneity in tackling health inequalities.

==Poor health and economic inequality==
[[Economic inequality#Health|Poor health outcomes appear to be an effect of economic inequality]] across a population. Nations and regions with greater economic inequality show poorer outcomes in life expectancy,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 1.1. Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=WJbtCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger]. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; mental health,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 5.1. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; drug abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 5.3.Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; obesity,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 7.1. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; educational performance, teenage birthrates, and ill health due to violence. On an international level, there is a positive correlation between developed countries with high economic equality and longevity. This is unrelated to average income per capita in wealthy nations.&lt;ref&gt;Figure 1.3. Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic gain only impacts life expectancy to a great degree in countries in which the mean per capita annual income is less than approximately $25,000.
The United States shows exceptionally low health outcomes for a developed country, despite having the highest national healthcare expenditure in the world. The US ranks 31st in life expectancy. Americans have a lower life expectancy than their European counterparts, even when factors such as race, income, diet, smoking, and education are controlled for.&lt;ref&gt;In Woolf, S. H., In Aron, L. Y., National Academies (U.S.)., &amp; Institute of Medicine (U.S.). (2013). U.S. health in international perspective: Shorter lives, poorer health.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relative inequality negatively affects health on an international, national, and institutional levels. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States, that is, more equal states show more desirable health outcomes. Importantly, inequality can have a negative health impact on members of lower echelons of institutions. The [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall I and II]] studies looked at the rates of cardiovascular disease and other health risks in British civil servants and found that, even when lifestyle factors were controlled for, members of lower status in the institution showed increased mortality and morbidity on a sliding downward scale from their higher status counterparts.
The negative aspects of inequality are spread across the population. For example, when comparing the United States (a more unequal nation) to England (a less unequal nation), the US shows higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, lung disease, and heart disease across all income levels.&lt;ref&gt;Figure 13.2. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true of the difference between mortality across all occupational classes in highly equal Sweden as compared to less-equal England.&lt;ref&gt;Figure 13.3. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health psychology''' is the study of psychological and behavioral processes in health, illness, and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M. (1994). Current trends in Health Psychology. ''The Psychologist, 7,'' 114-118.&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with understanding how [[psychological]], [[behavior]]al, and [[culture|cultural]] factors contribute to physical health and illness. Psychological factors can affect health directly&lt;ref name="Simandan"&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. For example, chronically occurring environmental stressors affecting the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]], cumulatively, can harm health. Behavioral factors can also affect a person's health. For example, certain behaviors  can, over time, harm (smoking or consuming excessive amounts of alcohol) or enhance health (engaging in exercise).&lt;ref name="Ogden, J. 2012"&gt;Ogden, J. (2012). ''Health Psychology: A Textbook (5th ed.).'' Maidenhead, UK: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists take a [[Biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial]] approach. In other words, health psychologists understand health to be the product not only of biological processes (e.g., a virus, tumor, etc.) but also of psychological (e.g., thoughts and beliefs), behavioral (e.g., habits), and social processes (e.g., [[socioeconomic status]] and [[ethnicity]]).&lt;ref name="Ogden, J. 2012"/&gt;

By understanding psychological factors that influence health, and constructively applying that knowledge, health psychologists can improve health by working directly with individual patients or indirectly in large-scale public health programs. In addition, health psychologists can help train other healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians and nurses) to take advantage of the knowledge the discipline has generated, when treating patients. Health psychologists work in a variety of settings: alongside other medical professionals in hospitals and clinics, in [[public health]] departments working on large-scale behavior change and health promotion programs, and in universities and medical schools where they teach and conduct [[research]].

Although its early beginnings can be traced to the field of [[clinical psychology]],&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;Rogers, R. W. (1983). Preventive health psychology: An interface of social and clinical psychology. ''Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 1''(2), 120-127. {{doi|10.1521/jscp.1983.1.2.120}}&lt;/ref&gt; four different divisions within health psychology and one related field, [[occupational health psychology]] (OHP),&lt;ref&gt;Everly, G.

Sarasota, FL: Professional Resource Exchange.&lt;/ref&gt; have developed over time.

==Overview==
Recent advances in psychological, medical, and physiological research have led to a new way of thinking about health and illness. This conceptualization, which has been labeled the [[biopsychosocial model]], views health and illness as the product of a combination of factors including biological characteristics (e.g., genetic predisposition), behavioral factors (e.g., lifestyle, stress, health beliefs), and social conditions (e.g., cultural influences, family relationships, [[social support]]).

[[Psychologists]] who strive to understand how biological, behavioral, and social factors influence health and illness are called health psychologists. Health psychologists use their knowledge of psychology and health to promote general well-being and understand physical illness.&lt;ref name='BPS'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). What is health psychology? A guide for the public.&lt;/ref&gt; They are specially trained to help people deal with the psychological and emotional aspects of health and illness. Health psychologists work with many different health care professionals (e.g., physicians, dentists, nurses, physician's assistants, dietitians, social workers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, and chaplains) to conduct research and provide clinical assessments and treatment services. Many health psychologists focus on prevention research and interventions designed to promote healthier lifestyles and try to find ways to encourage people to improve their health. For example, they may help people to lose weight or stop smoking.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Health psychologists also use their skills to try to improve the healthcare system. For example, they may advise doctors about better ways to communicate with their patients.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; 
Health psychologists work in many different settings including the UK's [[National Health Service]] (NHS), private practice, universities, communities, schools and organizations. While many health psychologists provide clinical services as part of their duties, others function in non-clinical roles, primarily involving teaching and research. Leading journals include ''[[Health Psychology (journal)|Health Psychology]]'', the ''[[Journal of Health Psychology]]'', the ''British Journal of Health Psychology'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)2044-8287 The ''British Journal of Health Psychology'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=1758-0846&amp;site=1 ''Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being'']&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists can work with people on a one-to-one basis, in groups, as a family, or at a larger population level.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

;Clinical health psychology (ClHP)
:ClHP is the application of scientific knowledge, derived from the field of health psychology, to clinical questions that may arise across the spectrum of health care.  ClHP is one of many specialty practice areas for clinical psychologists. It is also a major contributor to the prevention-focused field of [[behavioral health]] and the treatment-oriented field of [[behavioral medicine]]. Clinical practice includes education, the techniques of [[behavior modification|behavior change]], and psychotherapy. In some countries, a clinical health psychologist, with additional training, can become a [[medical psychologist]] and, thereby, obtain prescription privileges.

;Public health psychology (PHP)
:PHP is population oriented. A major aim of PHP is to investigate potential causal links between psychosocial factors and health at the population level. Public health psychologists present research results to educators, policy makers, and health care providers in order to promote better public health. PHP is allied to other public health disciplines including [[epidemiology]], [[nutrition]], [[genetics]] and [[biostatistics]]. Some PHP interventions are targeted toward at-risk population groups (e.g., undereducated, single pregnant women who smoke) and not the population as a whole (e.g., all pregnant women).

;Community health psychology (CoHP)
:CoHP investigates community factors that contribute to the health and well-being of individuals who live in communities. CoHP also develops community-level interventions that are designed to combat disease and promote physical and mental health. The community often serves as the level of analysis, and is frequently sought as a partner in health-related interventions.

;Critical health psychology (CrHP)
:CrHP is concerned with the distribution of power and the impact of power differentials on health experience and behavior, health care systems, and health policy. CrHP prioritizes social justice and the universal right to health for people of all races, genders, ages, and socioeconomic positions. A major concern is health inequalities. The critical health psychologist is an agent of change, not simply an analyst or cataloger. A leading organization in this area is the [[International Society of Critical Health Psychology]].

Health psychology, like other areas of applied psychology, is both a theoretical and applied field. Health psychologists employ diverse research methods. These methods include controlled randomized [[experiment]]s, [[quasi-experiments]], [[longitudinal studies]], [[time-series]] designs, [[cross-sectional studies]], [[case-control]] studies, qualitative research as well as [[action research]]. Health psychologists study a broad range of variables including [[heart disease|cardiovascular disease]], ([[cardiac psychology]]), [[smoking]] habits, the relation of [[religious beliefs]] to health, [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]] use, social support, living conditions, emotional state, social class, and more. Some health psychologists treat individuals with sleep problems, headaches, alcohol problems, etc. Other health psychologists work to empower community members by helping community members gain control over their health and improve quality of life of entire communities.

==Origins and development==

Psychological factors in health had been studied since the early 20th century by disciplines such as [[psychosomatic medicine]] and later [[behavioral medicine]], but these were primarily branches of medicine, not psychology. Health psychology began to emerge as a distinct discipline of psychology in the United States in the 1970s. In the mid-20th century there was a growing understanding in medicine of the effect of behavior on health. For example, the [[Alameda County Study]], which began in the 1960s, showed that people who ate regular meals (e.g., breakfast), maintained a healthy weight, received adequate sleep, did not smoke, drank little alcohol, and exercised regularly were in better health and lived longer.&lt;ref&gt;Belloc, N., &amp; Breslow, L. (1972). Relationship of physical health status and health practices. ''Preventive Medicine, 1''(3), 409-421.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, psychologists and other scientists were discovering relationships between psychological processes and physiological ones.&lt;ref name = "Sterling and Eyer"&gt;Sterling, P., &amp; Eyer, J. (1981). Biological basis of stress-related mortality. ''Social Science &amp; Medicine. Part E, Medical Psychology, 15''(1), 3-42.&lt;/ref&gt; These discoveries include a better understanding of the impact of psychosocial stress on the cardiovascular and immune systems,&lt;ref name = "Sterling and Eyer"/&gt; and the early finding that the functioning of the immune system could be altered by learning.&lt;ref&gt;Ader, R. &amp; Cohen, N. (1975). Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 37''(4), 333–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have been working in medical settings for many years (in the UK sometimes the field was termed [[medical psychology]]). Medical psychology, however, was a relatively small field, primarily aimed at helping patients adjust to illness. In 1969, William Schofield prepared a report for the APA entitled ''The Role of Psychology in the Delivery of Health Services''.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, W. (1969). The role of psychology in the delivery of health services. ''American Psychologist, 24(6),'' 565-584.&lt;/ref&gt; While there were exceptions, he found that the psychological research of the time frequently regarded mental health and physical health as separate, and devoted very little attention to psychology's impact upon physical health. One of the few psychologists working in this area at the time, Schofield proposed new forms of education and training for future psychologists. The APA, responding to his proposal, in 1973 established a task force to consider how psychologists could (a) help people to manage their health-related behaviors, (b) help patients manage their physical health problems, and (c) train healthcare staff to work more effectively with patients.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M., Weinman, J. &amp; Chater, A. (2011). A healthy contribution. ''The Psychologist, 24''(12), 890-892.&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by [[Joseph Matarazzo]], in 1977, APA added a division devoted to health psychology. At the first divisional conference, Matarazzo delivered a speech that played an important role in defining health psychology. He defined the new field in this way, "Health psychology is the aggregate of the specific educational, scientific and professional contributions of the discipline of psychology to the promotion and maintenance of health, the prevention and treatment of illness, the identification of diagnostic and etiologic correlates of health, illness and related dysfunction, and the analysis and improvement of the healthcare system and health policy formation."&lt;ref&gt;Matarazzo, J. D.  (1980). Behavioral health and behavioral medicine:  Frontiers for a new health psychology. ''American Psychologist, 35,'' 807-818.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, similar organizations were established elsewhere. In 1986, the BPS established a Division of Health Psychology. The European Health Psychology Society was also established in 1986. Similar organizations were established in other countries, including Australia and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Belar, C. D., Mendonca McIntyre, T. &amp; Matarazzo, J. D. (2003). Health psychology. In D. K. Freedheim &amp; I. Weiner (Eds.), ''Handbook of Psychology. Vol.1: History of Psychology.'' New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Universities began to develop doctoral level training programs in health psychology. In the US, post-doctoral level health psychology training programs were established for individuals who completed a doctoral degree in clinical psychology.

A number of relevant trends coincided with the emergence of health psychology, including:
*Epidemiological evidence  linking behavior and health.&lt;ref name='BPS3'&gt;Johnson, M., Weinman, J., &amp; Chater, A. (2011) A healthy Contribution. Health Psychology, 24 (12) 890-902&lt;/ref&gt;
*The addition of behavioral science to medical school curricula, with courses often taught by psychologists.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*The training of health professionals in communication skills, with the aim of improving patient satisfaction and adherence to medical treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;
*Increasing numbers of interventions based on psychological theory (e.g., [[behavior modification]]).&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*An increased understanding of  the interaction between psychological and physiological factors leading to the emergence of [[psychophysiology]] and [[psychoneuroimmunology]] (PNI).&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*The health domain having become a target of research by social psychologists interested in testing theoretical models linking beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, M., &amp; Ajzen, I. (1975). ''Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research.'' Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The emergence of [[AIDS/HIV]], and the increase in funding for behavioral research the epidemic provoked.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;

In the UK, the BPS’s reconsideration of the role of the Medical Section prompted the emergence of health psychology as a distinct field. Marie Johnston and John Weinman argued in a letter to the ''BPS Bulletin'' that there was a great need for a Health Psychology Section. In December 1986 the section was established at the BPS London Conference, with Marie Johnston as chair.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; At the Annual BPS Conference in 1993 a review of "Current Trends in Health Psychology" was organized, and a definition of health psychology as "the study of psychological and behavioural processes in health, illness and healthcare" was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M. (1994). Health psychology:Current trends. The Psychologist, 7,114–118.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Health Psychology Section  became a Special Group in 1993 and was awarded divisional status within the UK  in 1997. The awarding of divisional status meant that the individual training needs and professional practice of health psychologists were recognized, and  members were able to obtain chartered status with the BPS. The BPS went on to regulate training and practice in health psychology until  the regulation of professional standards and qualifications was taken over by statutory registration with the [[Health Professions Council]] in 2010.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;

==Objectives==

===Understanding behavioral and contextual factors===
Health psychologists conduct research to identify behaviors and experiences that promote health, give rise to illness, and influence the effectiveness of health care. They also recommend ways to improve health care policy.&lt;ref&gt;Sharman, S.J.; Garry, M.; Jacobsen, J.A.; Loftus, E.F.; &amp; Ditto, P.H. (2008). False memories for end-of-life decisions. ''Health Psychology'', 27, 291–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists have worked on developing ways to reduce smoking&lt;ref&gt;Dusseldorp, E.; van Elderen, T.; &amp; Maes, S.; [[Jacqueline Meulman|Meulman, J.]] &amp; Kraaij, V. (1999). A meta-analysis of psychoeducational programs for coronary heart disease patients. ''Health Psychology'', 18, 506–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and improve daily nutrition&lt;ref&gt;Resnicow, K.; Jackson, A.; Blissett, D.; Wang, T.; McCarty, F.; Rahotep, S.; &amp; Periasamy, S. (2005). Results of the Healthy Body Healthy Spirit Trial. ''Health Psychology'', 24, 339–48.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to promote health and prevent illness. They have also studied the association between illness and individual characteristics. For example, health psychology has found a relation between the personality characteristics of thrill seeking, impulsiveness, hostility/anger, emotional instability, and depression, on one hand, and high-risk driving, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Beirness, D.J. (1993). Do we really drive as we live? The role of personality factors in road crashes. ''Alcohol, Drugs &amp; Driving'', 9, 129–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychology is also concerned with contextual factors, including economic, cultural, community, social, and lifestyle factors that influence health&lt;ref name = "Simandan"/&gt;. The [[biopsychosocial model]] can help in understanding the relation between contextual factors and biology in affecting health&lt;ref name = "Martire"&gt;Martire, L.M. and Franks, M.M., 2014. The role of social networks in adult health: Introduction to the special issue. Health Psychology, 33(6), pp.501-504.&lt;/ref&gt;. Physical addiction impedes smoking cessation. Some research suggests that seductive advertising also contributes to psychological dependency on tobacco,&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, J.P.; &amp; Gilpin, E.A. (1995). A historical analysis of tobacco marketing and the uptake of smoking by youth in the United States: 1890–1977. ''Health Psychology'', 14, 500–508.&lt;/ref&gt; although other research has found no relationship between media exposure and smoking in youth.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson C.J. &amp; Meehan, D.C. (2011). With friends like these...: Peer delinquency influences across age cohorts on smoking, alcohol and illegal substance use. ''European Psychiatry'', 26(1), 6–12.&lt;/ref&gt; OHP research indicates that people in jobs that combine little decision latitude with a high psychological workload are at increased risk for [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenström, T., Hintsanen, M., Jokela, M., Keltikangas-Järvinen, L., Kivimäki, M., Juonala, M., &amp; ... Viikari, J. S. (2011). Change in job strain and progression of atherosclerosis: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study.

Long-term psychosocial work environment and cardiovascular mortality among Swedish men. ''American Journal of Public Health, 86''(3), 324–31. {{doi|10.2105/AJPH.86.3.324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other OHP research reveals a relation between unemployment and elevations in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Ilies, R., Dimotakis, N., &amp; Watson, D. (2010). Mood, blood pressure, and heart rate at work: An experience-sampling study. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 15''(2), 120-130. {{doi|10.1037/a0018350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasl, S.V. &amp; Cobb, S. (1970). Blood pressure changes in men undergoing job loss: A preliminary report. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 32''(1), 19–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemiologic research documents a relation between social class and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;Marmot, M.G. &amp; Theorell, T. (1988). Social class and cardiovascular disease: The contribution of work. ''International Journal of Health Services, 18'', 659–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychologists also aim to change health behaviors for the dual purpose of helping people stay healthy and helping patients adhere to disease treatment regimens (also see [[health action process approach]]). Health psychologists employ [[cognitive behavior therapy]] and [[applied behavior analysis]] (also see [[behavior modification]]) for that purpose.

===Preventing illness===
Health psychologists promote health through behavioral change, as mentioned above; however, they attempt to prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people to make changes in their lives such as stopping smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol they consume, eating more healthily, and exercising regularly.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive [[emotional]] states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, C.K.; Jamner, L.D.; Henker, B. &amp; Delfino, R.J. (2001). Smoking and moods in adolescents with depressive and aggressive dispositions: Evidence from surveys and electronic diaries. ''Health Psychology'', 20, 99–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because many people do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is [[anti-smoking campaign]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, J.C.; Niederdeppe, J. &amp; Evans, W.D. (2005). The theory of 'truth': How counterindustry campaigns affect smoking behavior among teens. ''Health Psychology'', 24, 22–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychologists help to promote health and well-being by preventing illness.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Some illnesses can be more effectively treated if caught early. Health psychologists have worked to understand why some people do not seek early screenings or immunizations, and have used that knowledge to develop ways to encourage people to have early health checks for illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Health psychologists are also finding ways to help people to avoid risky behaviors (e.g., engaging in unprotected sex) and encourage health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., regular tooth brushing or hand washing).&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

Health psychologists also aim at educating health professionals, including physicians and nurses, in communicating effectively with patients in ways that overcome barriers to understanding, remembering, and implementing effective strategies for reducing exposures to risk factors and making health-enhancing behavior changes.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, J.; Bavalia, K.; Bull, M.; Frankum, S.; Goldie, C.; Gosslau, M.; et al. (2004) 'I want more time with my doctor': A quantitative study of time and the consultation. ''Family Practice'', 21, 479–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence from OHP that stress-reduction interventions at the workplace can be effective. For example, Kompier and his colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Kompier, M.A.J.; Aust, B.; van den Berg, A.-M. &amp; Siegrist, J. (2000). Stress prevention in bus drivers: Evaluation of 13 natural experiments. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology'', 5, 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that a number of interventions aimed at reducing stress in bus drivers has had beneficial effects for employees and bus companies.

===The effects of disease===
Health psychologists investigate how disease affects individuals' psychological well-being. An individual who becomes seriously ill or injured faces many different practical stressors. These stressors include problems meeting medical and other bills, problems obtaining proper care when home from the hospital, obstacles to caring for dependents, the experience of having one's sense of self-reliance compromised, gaining a new, unwanted identity as that of a sick person, and so on. These stressors can lead to depression, reduced self-esteem, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cassileth, B.R.; Lusk, E.J.; Strouse, T.B.; Miller, D.S.; Brown, L.L.; Cross, P.A. &amp; Tenaglia, A.N. (1984). Psychosocial status in chronic illness. ''New England Journal of Medicine, 311'', 506–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychology also concerns itself with bettering the lives of individuals with [[terminal illness]]. When there is little hope of recovery, health psychologist therapists can improve the quality of life of the patient by helping the patient recover at least some of his or her psychological well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Lander, D.A. &amp; Graham-Pole, J.R. (2008). Love medicine for the dying and their caregivers: The body of evidence. ''Journal of Health Psychology, 13'', 201–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists are also concerned with providing therapeutic services for the bereaved.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J.M.; Forrest, L.M. &amp; Austin, A.E. (2002). Death of a partner: Perspectives of heterosexual and gay men. ''Journal of Health Psychology, 7'', 317–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical analysis of health policy===
Critical health psychologists explore how health policy can influence inequities, inequalities and social injustice &lt;ref name = "Martire"/&gt;. These avenues of research expand the scope of health psychology beyond the level of individual health to an examination of the social and economic determinants of health both within and between regions and nations. The individualism of mainstream health psychology has been critiqued and deconstructed by critical health psychologists using qualitative methods that zero in on the health experience.&lt;ref name="Marks, D.F. 2011"&gt;Marks, D.F., Murray, M., Evans, B., &amp; Estacio, E.V. (2011). [http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book233714?contribId=516262&amp; ''Health psychology. Theory-research-practice''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006160053/http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book233714?contribId=516262&amp; |date=2011-10-06 }} (3rd Ed.) Thousand Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conducting research===
Like psychologists in the other main psychology disciplines, health psychologists have advanced knowledge of research methods. Health psychologists apply this knowledge to conduct research on a variety of questions.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; For example, health psychologists carry out research to answer questions such as: 
* What influences healthy eating?
* How is stress linked to heart disease? 
* What are the emotional effects of genetic testing?
* How can we change people’s health behavior to improve their health?&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

===Teaching and communication===
{{main|Health communication}}

Health psychologists can also be responsible for training other health professionals on how to deliver interventions to help promote healthy eating, stopping smoking, weight loss, etc. Health psychologists also train other health professionals in communication skills such as how to break bad news or support behavior change for the purpose of improving adherence to treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;

==Applications==

===Improving doctor–patient communication===
Health psychologists aid the process of communication between physicians and patients during medical consultations. There are many problems in this process, with patients showing a considerable lack of understanding of many medical terms, particularly anatomical terms (e.g., intestines).&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, C.M. (1970). Difference between patients' and doctors' interpretation of some common medical terms. ''British Medical Journal, 2'', 286–89.&lt;/ref&gt; One area of research on this topic involves "doctor-centered" or "patient-centered" consultations. Doctor-centered consultations are generally directive, with the patient answering questions and playing less of a role in decision-making. Although this style is preferred by elderly people and others, many people dislike the sense of hierarchy or ignorance that it inspires. They prefer patient-centered consultations, which focus on the patient's needs, involve the doctor listening to the patient completely before making a decision, and involving the patient in the process of choosing treatment and finding a diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Dowsett, S.M., Saul, J.L., Butow, P.N., Dunn, S.M., Boyer, M.J., Findlow, R., &amp; Dunsmore, J. (2000). Communication styles in the cancer consultation: Preferences for a patient-centred approach. ''Psycho-Oncology, 9'', 147–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improving adherence to medical advice===
Health psychologists engage in research and practice aimed at getting people to follow medical advice and adhere to their treatment regimens. Patients often forget to take their pills or consciously opt not to take their prescribed medications because of side effects. Failing to take prescribed medication is costly and wastes millions of usable medicines that could otherwise help other people. Estimated adherence rates are difficult to measure (see below); there is, however, evidence that adherence could be improved by tailoring treatment programs to individuals' daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, M.; Hampson, S.E.; Avery, L. &amp; Simpson, R. (2004). Effects of a tailored lifestyle self-management intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes. ''British Journal of Health Psychology'', 9 (Pt 3), 365–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, traditional cognitive-behavioural therapies have been adapted for people suffering from chronic illnesses and comorbid psychological distress to include modules that encourage, support and reinforce adherence to medical advice as part of the larger treatment approach.&lt;ref&gt;Safren, S., Gonzalez, J., Wexler, D., Psaros, C., Delahanty, L., Blashill, A., . . . Cagliero, E. (2014). A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adherence and Depression (CBT-AD) in Patients With Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes. Diabetes Care, 37 (3): 625-633. {{doi|10.2337/dc13-0816}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ways of measuring adherence====
Health psychologists have identified a number of ways of measuring patients' adherence to medical regimens:
* Counting the number of pills in the medicine bottle
* Using self-reports
* Using "Trackcap" bottles, which track the number of times the bottle is opened.&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, P. (2002). ''Psychology in practice: Health''. London, England: Hodder &amp; Stoughton Educational.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managing pain===
Health psychology attempts to find treatments to reduce or eliminate pain, as well as understand pain anomalies such as episodic [[analgesia]], [[causalgia]], [[neuralgia]], and [[phantom limb pain]]. Although the task of measuring and describing pain has been problematic, the development of the [[McGill Pain Questionnaire]]&lt;ref&gt;Melzack, R. (1975). The McGill Pain Questionnaire: Major properties and scoring methods. ''Pain, 1''(3), 277–299.&lt;/ref&gt; has helped make progress in this area. Treatments for pain involve patient-administered [[analgesia]], [[acupuncture]] (found to be effective in reducing pain for [[osteoarthritis]] of the knee&lt;ref&gt;Berman, B.; Singh B.B.; Lao, L.; Langenberg, P.; Li, H.; Hadhazy, V.; Bareta, J. &amp; Hochberg, M. (1999). A randomized trial of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy in osteoarthritis of the knee. ''Rheumatology, 38''(4), 346–54.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[biofeedback]], and [[cognitive behavior therapy]].

===Health psychologist roles===
Below are some examples of the types of positions held by health psychologists within applied settings such as the UK's NHS and private practice.
*'''Consultant health psychologist''': A consultant health psychologist will take a lead for health psychology within public health, including managing tobacco control and smoking cessation services and providing professional leadership in the management of health trainers.&lt;ref name='BPS1'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). Health psychology: A guide for employees.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Principal health psychologist''': A principal  health psychologist could, for example lead the health psychology service within one of the UK’s leading heart and lung hospitals, providing a clinical service to patients and advising all members of the multidisciplinary team.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Health psychologist''': An example of a health psychologist's role would be to provide health psychology input to a center for weight management. Psychological assessment of treatment, development and delivery of a tailored weight management program, and advising on approaches to improve adherence to health advice and medical treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Research psychologist''': Research health psychologists carry out health psychology research, for example, exploring the psychological impact of receiving a diagnosis of dementia, or evaluating ways of providing psychological support for people with burn injuries. Research can also be in the area of health promotion, for example investigating the determinants of healthy eating or physical activity or understanding why people misuse substances.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Health psychologist in training/assistant health psychologist''': As an assistant/in training, a health psychologist will gain experience assessing patients, delivering psychological interventions to change health behaviors, and conducting research, whilst being supervised by a qualified health psychologist.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;

==Training==
{{See also|List of universities with health psychology programs}}

In the UK, health psychologists are registered by the [[Health Professions Council]] (HPC) and have trained to a level to be eligible for full membership of the Division of Health Psychology within the BPS.&lt;ref name='BPS2'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). ''Health Psychology in applied settings: A guide for employers''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Registered health psychologists who are chartered with the BPS will have undertaken a minimum of six years of training and will have specialized in health psychology for a minimum of three years.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; Health psychologists in training must have completed BPS stage 1 training and be registered with the BPS Stage 2 training route or with a BPS-accredited university doctoral health psychology program. Once qualified, health psychologists can work in a range of settings, for example the NHS, universities, schools, private healthcare, and research and charitable organizations.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; A health psychologist in training might be working within applied settings while working towards registration and chartered status.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; A health psychologist will have demonstrated competencies in all of the following areas:
* professional skills (including implementing ethical and legal standards, communication, and teamwork),
* research skills (including designing, conducting, and analyzing psychological research in numerous areas),
* consultancy skills (including planning and evaluation),
* teaching and training skills (including knowledge of designing, delivering, and evaluating large and small scale training program),
* intervention skills (including delivery and evaluation of behavior change interventions).&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
All qualified health psychologists must also engage in and record their [[continuing professional development]] (CPD) for psychology each year throughout their career.&lt;ref name= 'BPS2' /&gt;

'''''Hermaphrodites with Attitude''''' was a newsletter edited by [[Cheryl Chase (activist)|Cheryl Chase]] and published by the [[Intersex Society of North America]] (ISNA) between 1994 and 2005.&lt;ref name="isnahwa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hermaphrodites with Attitude|url=http://www.isna.org/library/hwa|publisher=[[Intersex Society of North America]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full archives are available online. In 2008, ISNA transferred its remaining funds, assets, and copyrights to [[Accord Alliance]] and then closed.

==History==
''Hermaphrodites with Attitude'' was published on thirteen occasions over an eleven-year period. The first issue appeared in Winter 1994, comprising 6 pages of articles, analysis and case studies, including articles by people with lived experience, activists, physicianss, and academics. It was distributed to subscribers in five countries and 14 States of the United States.&lt;ref name="hwa1"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Hermaphrodites with Attitude |title=Hermaphrodites with Attitude |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=1994 |url = http://www.isna.org/files/hwa/winter1995.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newsletter provided a voice for intersex activists for the first time, becoming a resource for intersex people and academics.&lt;ref name=QS2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Valocchi |first1=Stephen |title=Queer studies : an interdisciplinary reader |year=2003 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |isbn=0631229167 |last2=Corber |first2=Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drege1999r&gt;{{cite book |last=Dreger |first=Alice Domurat |title=Intersex in the age of ethics |year=1999 |publisher=Univ. Publ. Group |location=Hagerstown, MD. |isbn=1555721001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the newsletter appears in the title of multiple articles describing the intersex movement,&lt;ref name=Duke&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chase |first=Cheryl |journal=GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies |year=1998 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=189–211 |doi=10.1215/10642684-4-2-189 |url=http://glq.dukejournals.org/content/4/2/189.citation |title=Hermaphrodites with Attitude: Mapping the Emergence of Intersex Political Activism |authorlink=Cheryl Chase (activist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Preves |first=Sharon |title=Hermaphrodites With Attitude: The Intersex Patients’ Rights Movement and Clinical Reform |date=August 16, 2003 |publisher=[[American Sociological Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Valentine |first=David |first2=Riki Anne |last2=Wilchins |author2-link=Riki Wilchins |title=One Percent on the Burn Chart: Gender, Genitals, and Hermaphrodites with Attitude |issue=52/53 |date=1997 |pages=215–222 |doi=10.2307/466740 |jstor=466740 |journal=Social Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also displayed on banners at the first public demonstration by intersex people and allies, outside a pediatric conference in Boston, on October 26, 1996.&lt;ref name="beck1997"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Beck |first=Max |title=Hermaphrodites with Attitude Take to the Streets |work=[[Intersex Society of North America]] |url=http://www.isna.org/books/chrysalis/beck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chrysalis1997"&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=2 |issue=5 |title=Intersex Awakening| journal = Chrysalis, The Journal of Transgressive Gender Identities| date = 1997| url = http://www.isna.org/books/chrysalis/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early part of the 21st-century, [[Intersex Society of North America|Intersex Society of North America (ISNA)]] took on staff for the first time and began to engage closely with the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, establishing a North American Task Force on Intersex.&lt;ref name="isnafeb2001" /&gt; These developments were stated in the newsletter's first issue of the 21st-century, in February 2001, which also marked a change in name to "ISNA News".&lt;ref name="isnafeb2001"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = ISNA News | title = ISNA News | date = February 2001 | url = http://www.isna.org/files/hwa/feb2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shifting attitudes==
This shift in name of the newsletter reflected a significant shift in the goals of ISNA. Initially, Emi Koyama states that "not only did intersex activists appropriate the medical label "intersex" as part of their identities, they also liberally used the word "hermaphrodite", which is now considered offensive, for example by naming the newsletter of Intersex Society of North America "Hermaphrodites With Attitude" and demonstrating under that name." Koyama argues that the intersex movement could not succeed with that label in addressing peer support needs, while identity politics drew in a different set of goals and interests.&lt;ref name="koyama2006"&gt;{{Cite paper| last = Koyama| first = Emi| title = From "Intersex" to "DSD": Toward a Queer Disability Politics of Gender| location = University of Vermont| date = February 2006| url = http://www.intersexinitiative.org/articles/intersextodsd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISNA goals shifted to eradicate nomenclature based on [[hermaphroditism]] that was stated to be stigmatizing&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/hermaphrodite |title=Is a person who is intersex a hermaphrodite? |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; to intersex individuals, as well as potentially panic-inducing to parents of intersex children.

The suggested solution put forth by ISNA was to restructure the system of intersex taxonomy and nomenclature to not include the words 'hermaphrodite', 'hermaphroditism', 'sex reversal', or other similar terms.&lt;ref name="http://www.isna.org/node/979"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/node/979 |title=Getting Rid of "Hermaphroditism" Once and For All |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "standard division of many intersex types into true hermaphroditism, male pseudohermaphroditism, and female pseudohermaphroditism" was described by ISNA and its advocates as confusing and clinically problematic,&lt;ref name="http://www.isna.org/node/979"/&gt; and a replacement term, [[disorders of sex development]] was proposed by [[Alice Dreger]], [[Cheryl Chase (activist)|Cheryl Chase]] and others in 2005.&lt;ref name="Dreger2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dreger | first1 = AD | last2 = Chase | first2 = C | last3 = Sousa | first3 = A | last4 = Gruppuso | first4 = PA | last5 = Frader | first5 =J |title=Changing the nomenclature/taxonomy for intersex: a scientific and clinical rationale |journal=Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=729–33 |date=August 2005  |pmid=16200837 |doi=10.1515/jpem.2005.18.8.729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISNA itself folded in 2008, following publication of a clinical paper and new clinical standards that adopted the term [[disorders of sex development]] to replace not only hermaphroditism and associated terms, but also the term intersex, in medical settings. ISNA gave a statement saying that "at present, the new standard of care exists as little more than ideals on paper, thus falling short of its aim[s]" to fulfill its goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/farewell_message |title=Dear ISNA Friends and Supporters |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISNA decided its best course of action was to "support a new organization with a mission to promote integrated, comprehensive approaches to care that enhance the overall health and well-being of persons [who are intersex] and their families." The ISNA transferred all of its remaining funds, assets, and copyrights to [[Accord Alliance]] and then closed.

ISNA has been survived or succeeded by several [[intersex civil society organizations]], including the [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome|AIS]] Support Group USA (now called AISDSD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aisdsd.org/who-we-are/history/brief-history/ |title=A Brief History |work=AISDSD |accessdate=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Intersex Initiative,&lt;ref name="karkazis2008" /&gt; Bodies Like Ours,&lt;ref name="karkazis2008"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8223-4318-9 |last=Karkazis |first=Katrina |title=[[Fixing Sex|Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]] |date=2008 |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organisation Intersex International]],&lt;ref name="karkazis2008" /&gt; (now the [[Intersex Campaign for Equality]]) and Advocates for Informed Choice (now [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]]).

[[File:Automation of foundry with robot.jpg|thumb|Articulated industrial robot operating in a foundry.]]
An '''industrial robot''' is a [[robot]] system used for [[manufacturing]]. Industrial robots are automated, programmable and capable of movement on two or more axes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:8373:ed-2:v1:en {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617031837/https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/ |date=2016-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical applications of robots include [[robot welding|welding]], painting, assembly, [[Automated storage and retrieval system|pick and place]] for [[printed circuit board]]s, [[packaging and labeling]], [[Palletizer|palletizing]], product inspection, and testing; all accomplished with high endurance, speed, and precision. They can assist in [[material handling]].

In the year 2015, an estimated 1.64 million industrial robots were in operation worldwide according to [[International Federation of Robotics|International Federation of Robotics (IFR)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21729864-automation-less-threat-workers-emerging-world-it-made-out|title=Worries about premature industrialisation|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021014710/https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21729864-automation-less-threat-workers-emerging-world-it-made-out|archivedate=2017-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly used robot configurations are [[articulated robot]]s, [[SCARA]] robots, [[delta robot]]s and [[cartesian coordinate robot]]s, ([[gantry cranes|gantry]] robots or x-y-z robots). In the context of general robotics, most types of robots would fall into the category of [[robotic arm]]s (inherent in the use of the word ''manipulator'' in ISO standard 1738).
Robots exhibit varying degrees of [[autonomous robot|autonomy]]: 
* Some robots are programmed to faithfully carry out specific actions over and over again (repetitive actions) without variation and with a high degree of accuracy. These actions are determined by programmed routines that specify the direction, acceleration, velocity, deceleration, and distance of a series of coordinated motions.
* Other robots are much more flexible as to the orientation of the object on which they are operating or even the task that has to be performed on the object itself, which the robot may even need to identify. For example, for more precise guidance, robots often contain [[machine vision]] sub-systems acting as their visual sensors, linked to powerful computers or controllers.&lt;ref name=NASAarticle&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[NASA Tech Briefs]] |volume= 35 |issue= 6 |date= June 2011 |title= Machine Vision Fundamentals, How to Make Robots See |author= Turek, Fred D. |pages= 60–62 |url= http://www.techbriefs.com/privacy-footer-69/10531 |accessdate= 2011-11-29 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120127043340/http://www.techbriefs.com/privacy-footer-69/10531 |archivedate= 2012-01-27 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Artificial intelligence]], or what passes for it,{{clarify|date=November 2016}} is becoming an increasingly important factor in the modern industrial robot.

==History of industrial robotics ==
The earliest known industrial robot, conforming to the ISO definition was completed by 
"Bill" Griffith P. Taylor in 1937 and published in [[Meccano Magazine]], March 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Automatic Block-Setting Crane|journal=Meccano Magazine|date=March 1938|volume=23|issue=3|page=172|publisher=Meccano|location=Liverpool UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Griffith P.|title=The Robot Gargantua|year=1995|publisher=Constructor Quarterly|location=Gargantua|editor=Robin Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crane-like device was built almost entirely using [[Meccano]] parts, and powered by a single electric motor.  Five axes of movement were possible, including ''grab'' and ''grab rotation''. Automation was achieved using punched paper tape to energise solenoids, which would facilitate the movement of the crane's control levers. The [[robot]] could stack wooden blocks in pre-programmed patterns. The number of motor revolutions required for each desired movement was first plotted on graph paper. This information was then transferred to the paper tape, which was also driven by the robot's single motor. Chris Shute built a complete replica of the robot in 1997.

[[Image:George C Devol Color Photo.jpg|thumb|left|George Devol, c. 1982]]
[[George Devol]] applied for the first robotics [[patent]]s in 1954 (granted in 1961).  The first company to produce a robot was [[Unimation]], founded by Devol and [[Joseph Engelberger|Joseph F. Engelberger]] in 1956. Unimation robots were also called ''programmable transfer machines'' since their main use at first was to transfer objects from one point to another, less than a dozen feet or so apart. They used [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[actuator]]s and were programmed in ''[[joint]] [[coordinate system|coordinates]]'', i.e. the angles of the various joints were stored during a teaching phase and replayed in operation.  They were accurate to within 1/10,000 of an inch{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} (note: although accuracy is not an appropriate measure for robots, usually evaluated in terms of repeatability - see later).  Unimation later licensed their technology to [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] and [[GKN]], manufacturing [[Unimate]]s in Japan and England respectively.  For some time Unimation's only competitor was [[Cincinnati Milacron]] Inc. of [[Ohio]]. This changed radically in the late 1970s when several big Japanese conglomerates began producing similar industrial robots.

In 1969 [[Victor Scheinman]] at [[Stanford University]] invented the [[Stanford arm]], an all-electric, 6-axis articulated robot designed to permit an [[arm solution]]. This allowed it accurately to follow arbitrary paths in space and widened the potential use of the robot to more sophisticated applications such as assembly and welding. Scheinman then designed a second arm for the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] Lab, called the "MIT arm." Scheinman, after receiving a fellowship from Unimation to develop his designs, sold those designs to Unimation who further developed them with support from [[General Motors]] and later marketed it as the [[Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly]] (PUMA).

Industrial robotics took off quite quickly in Europe, with both [[ABB Group|ABB Robotics]] and [[KUKA|KUKA Robotics]] bringing robots to the market in 1973. ABB Robotics (formerly ASEA) introduced IRB 6, among the world's first ''commercially available'' all electric micro-processor controlled robot. The first two IRB 6 robots were sold to Magnusson in Sweden for grinding and polishing pipe bends and were installed in production in January 1974. Also in 1973 KUKA Robotics built its first robot, known as [[FAMULUS]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuka-robotics.com/en/company/group/milestones/1973.htm KUKA-Roboter.de: 1973 The First KUKA Robot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220193437/http://www.kuka-robotics.com/en/company/group/milestones/1973.htm |date=2009-02-20 }} English, 28th of March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifr.org/uploads/media/History_of_Industrial_Robots_online_brochure_by_IFR_2012.pdf |title=History of Industrial Robots |accessdate=2012-10-27 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224213437/http://www.ifr.org/uploads/media/History_of_Industrial_Robots_online_brochure_by_IFR_2012.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also one of the first articulated robots to have six electromechanically driven axes.

Interest in robotics increased in the late 1970s and many US companies entered the field, including large firms like [[General Electric]], and [[General Motors]] (which formed [[joint venture]] [[FANUC Robotics]] with [[FANUC]] LTD of Japan). U.S. [[startup companies]] included [[Automatix]] and [[Adept Technology]], Inc. At the height of the robot boom in 1984, Unimation was acquired by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] for 107 million U.S. dollars. Westinghouse sold Unimation to [[Stäubli Faverges SCA]] of [[France]] in 1988, which is still making articulated robots for general industrial and [[cleanroom]] applications and even bought the robotic division of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] in late 2004.

Only a few non-Japanese companies ultimately managed to survive in this market, the major ones being: [[Adept Technology]], [[Stäub]], the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] company [[ABB Asea Brown Boveri]], the [[Germany|German]] company [[KUKA|KUKA Robotics]] and the [[Italy|Italian]] company [[Comau]].

==Technical description==

===Defining parameters===
*''Number of axes'' – two axes are required to reach any point in a plane; three axes are required to reach any point in space. To fully control the orientation of the end of the arm(i.e. the ''wrist'') three more axes ([[yaw, pitch, and roll]]) are required. Some designs (e.g. the SCARA robot) trade limitations in motion possibilities for cost, speed, and accuracy.
*''[[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|Degrees of freedom]]'' – this is usually the same as the number of axes.
*''[[Working envelope]]'' – the region of space a robot can reach.
*''[[robot kinematics|Kinematics]]'' – the actual arrangement of rigid members and [[joint]]s in the robot, which determines the robot's possible motions. Classes of robot kinematics include articulated, cartesian, [[Parallel robot|parallel]] and SCARA.
*''Carrying capacity or [[Cargo|payload]]'' – how much weight a robot can lift.
*''Speed'' – how fast the robot can position the end of its arm. This may be defined in terms of the angular or linear speed of each axis or as a compound speed i.e. the speed of the end of the arm when all axes are moving.
*''Acceleration'' – how quickly an axis can accelerate. Since this is a limiting factor a robot may not be able to reach its specified maximum speed for movements over a short distance or a complex path requiring frequent changes of direction.
*''Accuracy'' – how closely a robot can reach a commanded position. When the absolute position of the robot is measured and compared to the commanded position the error is a measure of accuracy. Accuracy can be improved with external sensing for example a vision system or Infra-Red. See [[robot calibration]]. Accuracy can vary with speed and position within the working envelope and with payload (see compliance).
*''Repeatability'' – how well the robot will return to a programmed position. This is not the same as accuracy. It may be that when told to go to a certain X-Y-Z position that it gets only to within 1&amp;nbsp;mm of that position. This would be its accuracy which may be improved by calibration. But if that position is taught into controller memory and each time it is sent there it returns to within 0.1mm of the taught position then the repeatability will be within 0.1mm.
Accuracy and repeatability are different measures. Repeatability is usually the most important criterion for a robot and is similar to the concept of 'precision' in measurement—see [[accuracy and precision]]. ISO 9283 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evs.ee/Checkout/tabid/36/screen/freedownload/productid/159968/doclang/en/preview/1/EVS_EN_ISO_9283;2001_en_preview.aspx|title=EVS-EN ISO 9283:2001|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310123210/https://www.evs.ee/Checkout/tabid/36/screen/freedownload/productid/159968/doclang/en/preview/1/EVS_EN_ISO_9283;2001_en_preview.aspx|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets out a method whereby both accuracy and repeatability can be measured. Typically a robot is sent to a taught position a number of times and the error is measured at each return to the position after visiting 4 other positions. Repeatability is then quantified using the [[standard deviation]] of those samples in all three dimensions. A typical robot can, of course make a positional error exceeding that and that could be a problem for the process. Moreover, the repeatability is different in different parts of the working envelope and also changes with speed and payload. ISO 9283 specifies that accuracy and repeatability should be measured at maximum speed and at maximum payload. But this results in pessimistic values whereas the robot could be much more accurate and repeatable at light loads and speeds.
Repeatability in an industrial process is also subject to the accuracy of the end effector, for example a gripper, and even to the design of the 'fingers' that match the gripper to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw could be at a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.
*''Motion control'' – for some applications, such as simple pick-and-place assembly, the robot need merely return repeatably to a limited number of pre-taught positions. For more sophisticated applications, such as welding and finishing ([[spray painting]]), motion must be continuously controlled to follow a path in space, with controlled orientation and velocity.
*''Power source'' – some robots use [[electric motor]]s, others use [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] actuators. The former are faster, the latter are stronger and advantageous in applications such as spray painting, where a spark could set off an [[explosion]]; however, low internal air-pressurisation of the arm can prevent ingress of flammable vapours as well as other contaminants.
*''Drive'' – some robots connect electric motors to the joints via [[gear]]s; others connect the motor to the joint directly (''direct drive''). Using gears results in measurable 'backlash' which is free movement in an axis. Smaller robot arms frequently employ high speed, low torque DC motors, which generally require high gearing ratios; this has the disadvantage of backlash. In such cases the [[harmonic drive]] is often used.
*''Compliance'' - this is a measure of the amount in angle or distance that a robot axis will move when a force is applied to it. Because of compliance when a robot goes to a position carrying its maximum payload it will be at a position slightly lower than when it is carrying no payload. Compliance can also be responsible for overshoot when carrying high payloads in which case acceleration would need to be reduced.

===Robot programming and interfaces===
[[Image:Offline teaching welding 001.png|thumb|Offline programming]]
[[Image:Teach pendant.JPG|thumb|A typical well-used teach pendant with optional [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]]]

The setup or [[Computer programming|programming]] of motions and sequences for an industrial robot is typically taught by linking the robot controller to a [[laptop]], desktop [[computer]] or (internal or Internet) [[computer network|network]].

A robot and a collection of machines or peripherals is referred to as a [[workcell]], or cell. A typical cell might contain a parts feeder, a [[injection molding machine|molding machine]] and a robot. The various machines are 'integrated' and controlled by a single computer or [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]]. How the robot interacts with other machines in the cell must be programmed, both with regard to their positions in the cell and synchronizing with them.

''Software:'' The computer is installed with corresponding [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] software. The use of a computer greatly simplifies the programming process. Specialized [[robot software]] is run either in the robot controller or in the computer or both depending on the system design.

There are two basic entities that need to be taught (or programmed): positional data and procedure. For example, in a task to move a screw from a feeder to a hole the positions of the feeder and the hole must first be taught or programmed. Secondly the procedure to get the screw from the feeder to the hole must be programmed along with any I/O involved, for example a signal to indicate when the screw is in the feeder ready to be picked up. The purpose of the robot software is to facilitate both these programming tasks.

Teaching the robot positions may be achieved a number of ways:

''Positional commands'' The robot can be directed to the required position using a [[GUI]] or text based commands in which the required X-Y-Z position may be specified and edited.

''Teach pendant:'' Robot positions can be taught via a [[teach pendant]]. This is a handheld control and programming unit. The common features of such units are the ability to manually send the robot to a desired position, or "inch" or "jog" to adjust a position. They also have a means to change the speed since a low speed is usually required for careful positioning, or while test-running through a new or modified routine. A large [[emergency stop]] button is usually included as well. Typically once the robot has been programmed there is no more use for the teach pendant.

''Lead-by-the-nose:'' this is a technique offered by many robot manufacturers. In this method, one user holds the robot's manipulator, while another person enters a command which de-energizes the robot causing it to go into limp. The user then moves the robot by hand to the required positions and/or along a required path while the software logs these positions into memory. The program can later run the robot to these positions or along the taught path. This technique is popular for tasks such as [[spray painting|paint spraying]].

''Offline programming'' is where the entire cell, the robot and all the machines or instruments in the workspace are mapped graphically. The robot can then be moved on screen and the process simulated. A robotics simulator is used to create embedded applications for a robot, without depending on the physical operation of the robot arm and end effector. The advantages of robotics simulation is that it saves time in the design of robotics applications. It can also increase the level of safety associated with robotic equipment since various "what if" scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.[8] Robot simulation software provides a platform to teach, test, run, and debug programs that have been written in a variety of programming languages.  [[Image:RoboLogix Work Envelope.jpg|Robotics Simulator|thumb|right]]

''Robot simulation'' tools allow for robotics programs to be conveniently written and debugged off-line with the final version of the program tested on an actual robot. The ability to preview the behavior of a robotic system in a virtual world allows for a variety of mechanisms, devices, configurations and controllers to be tried and tested before being applied to a "real world" system. Robotics simulators have the ability to provide real-time computing of the simulated motion of an industrial robot using both geometric modeling and kinematics modeling.

''Others'' In addition, machine operators often use [[user interface]] devices, typically [[touchscreen]] units, which serve as the operator control panel. The operator can switch from program to program, make adjustments within a program and also operate a host of [[peripheral]] devices that may be integrated within the same robotic system. These include [[Industrial robot end effector|end effector]]s, feeders that supply components to the robot, [[conveyor belt]]s, emergency stop controls, machine vision systems, safety [[interlock (engineering)|interlock]] systems, [[barcode|bar code]] printers and an almost infinite array of other industrial devices which are accessed and controlled via the operator control panel.

The teach pendant or PC is usually disconnected after programming and the robot then runs on the program that has been installed in its [[controller (computing)|controller]]. However a computer is often used to 'supervise' the robot and any peripherals, or to provide additional storage for access to numerous complex paths and routines.

===End-of-arm tooling===
The most essential robot peripheral is the [[Robot end effector|end effector]], or end-of-arm-tooling (EOT). Common examples of end effectors include welding devices (such as MIG-welding guns, spot-welders, etc.), spray guns and also grinding and deburring devices (such as pneumatic disk or belt grinders, burrs, etc.), and grippers (devices that can grasp an object, usually [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] or [[pneumatics|pneumatic]]). Other common means of picking up objects is by [[vacuum]] or [[Magnet|magnets]]. End effectors are frequently highly complex, made to match the handled product and often capable of picking up an array of products at one time.  They may utilize various sensors to aid the robot system in locating, handling, and positioning products.

===Controlling movement===
For a given robot the only parameters necessary to completely locate the end effector (gripper, welding torch, etc.) of the robot are the angles of each of the joints or displacements of the linear axes (or combinations of the two for robot formats such as SCARA). However, there are many different ways to define the points. The most common and most convenient way of defining a point is to specify a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate]] for it, i.e. the position of the 'end effector' in mm in the X, Y and Z directions relative to the robot's origin. In addition, depending on the types of joints a particular robot may have, the orientation of the end effector in yaw, pitch, and roll and the location of the tool point relative to the robot's faceplate must also be specified. For a [[Robotic arm|jointed arm]] these coordinates must be converted to joint angles by the robot controller and such conversions are known as Cartesian Transformations which may need to be performed iteratively or recursively for a multiple axis robot. The mathematics of the relationship between joint angles and actual spatial coordinates is called kinematics. See [[robot control]]

Positioning by Cartesian coordinates may be done by entering the coordinates into the system or by using a teach pendant which moves the robot in X-Y-Z directions. It is much easier for a human operator to visualize motions up/down, left/right, etc. than to move each joint one at a time. When the desired position is reached it is then defined in some way particular to the robot software in use, e.g. P1 - P5 below.

===Typical programming===
Most articulated robots perform by storing a series of positions in memory, and moving to them at various times in their programming sequence. For example, a robot which is moving items from one place to another might have a simple 'pick and place' program similar to the following:

''Define points P1–P5:''

# Safely above workpiece (defined as P1)
# 10&amp;nbsp;cm Above bin A (defined as P2)
# At position to take part from bin A (defined as P3)
# 10&amp;nbsp;cm Above bin B (defined as P4)
# At position to take part from bin B. (defined as P5)

''Define program:''

# Move to P1
# Move to P2
# Move to P3
# Close gripper
# Move to P2
# Move to P4
# Move to P5
# Open gripper
# Move to P4
# Move to P1 and finish

For examples of how this would look in popular robot languages see [[Robot software#Examples of programming languages for Industrial Robots|industrial robot programming]].

===Singularities===
The American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems — Safety Requirements (ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999) defines a singularity as “a condition caused by the collinear alignment of two or more robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities.” It is most common in robot arms that utilize a “triple-roll wrist”. This is a wrist about which the three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point. An example of a wrist singularity is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot’s wrist (i.e. robot's axes 4 and 6) to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the end effector. Another common term for this singularity is a “wrist flip”. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, the end effector, and the process. Some industrial robot manufacturers have attempted to side-step the situation by slightly altering the robot’s path to prevent this condition. Another method is to slow the robot’s travel speed, thus reducing the speed required for the wrist to make the transition. The ANSI/RIA has mandated that robot manufacturers shall make the user aware of singularities if they occur while the system is being manually manipulated.

A second type of singularity in wrist-partitioned vertically articulated six-axis robots occurs when the wrist center lies on a cylinder that is centered about axis 1 and with radius equal to the distance between axes 1 and 4. This is called a shoulder singularity. Some robot manufacturers also mention alignment singularities, where axes 1 and 6 become coincident. This is simply a sub-case of shoulder singularities. When the robot passes close to a shoulder singularity, joint 1 spins very fast.

The third and last type of singularity in wrist-partitioned vertically articulated six-axis robots occurs when the wrist's center lies in the same plane as axes 2 and 3.

Singularities are closely related to the phenomena of [[gimbal lock]], which has a similar root cause of axes becoming lined up.

A video illustrating these three types of singular configurations is available here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coro.etsmtl.ca/blog/?p=107|title=Singularities in six-axis vertically-articulated industrial robots|work=CoRo Blog|accessdate=17 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417191430/http://coro.etsmtl.ca/blog/?p=107|archivedate=17 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Federation of Robotics]] has predicted a worldwide increase in adoption of industrial robots and they estimated 1.7 million new robot installations in factories worldwide by 2020 [https://ifr.org/industrial-robots/statistics/ &amp;#91;IFR 2017&amp;#93;]. Rapid advances in automation technologies (e.g. fixed robots, collaborative and mobile robots, and exoskeletons) have the potential to improve work conditions but also to introduce workplace hazards in manufacturing workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24649|title=Information Technology and the U.S. Workforce: Where Are We and Where Do We Go from Here?|last=Technology|first=Committee on Information|last2=Automation|last3=Workforce|first3=and the U.S.|last4=Board|first4=Computer Science and Telecommunications|last5=Sciences|first5=Division on Engineering and Physical|last6=Sciences|first6=National Academies of|last7=Engineering|last8=Medicine|first8=and|date=2017-03-16|isbn=9780309454025|language=en|doi=10.17226/24649}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://oshwiki.eu/wiki/A_review_on_the_future_of_work:_robotics]   Despite the lack of occupational surveillance data on injuries associated specifically with robots, researchers from the US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) identified 61 robot-related deaths between 1992 and 2015 using keyword searches of the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries research database (see info from [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/robotics/aboutthecenter.html Center for Occupational Robotics Research]). Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, NIOSH and its state partners have investigated 4 robot-related fatalities under the [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/face/brochure.html Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation Program].  In addition the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has investigated dozens of robot-related deaths and injuries, which can be reviewed at [https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/AccidentSearch.search?acc_keyword=%22Robot%22&amp;keyword_list=on OSHA Accident Search page]. Injuries and fatalities could  increase over time because of the increasing number of collaborative and co-existing robots, powered exoskeletons, and autonomous vehicles into the work environment.

Safety standards are being developed by the [https://www.robotics.org/ Robotic Industries Association] (RIA) in conjunction with the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI).[https://www.robotics.org/robotic-standards] On October 5, 2017, OSHA, NIOSH and RIA signed an [https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/alliances/ria/ria.html alliance] to work together to enhance technical expertise, identify and help address potential workplace hazards associated with traditional industrial robots and the emerging technology of human-robot collaboration installations and systems, and help identify needed research to reduce workplace hazards. On October 16 NIOSH launched the [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/robotics/default.html Center for Occupational Robotics Research] to "provide scientific leadership to guide the development and use of occupational robots that enhance worker safety, health, and wellbeing."  So far, the research needs identified by NIOSH and its partners include: tracking and preventing injuries and fatalities, intervention and dissemination strategies to promote safe machine control and maintenance procedures, and on translating effective evidence-based interventions into workplace practice.

'''Late preterm infants''' are [[infants]] born at a [[gestational age]] between {{frac|34|0|7}} weeks and {{frac|36|6|7}} weeks.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt; They have higher morbidity and mortality rates than term infants (gestational age ≥37 weeks) due to their relative physiologic and metabolic immaturity, even though they are often the size and weight of some term infants.&lt;ref name="Late preterm infants"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barfield|first1=Wanda|title=Late preterm infants|website=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-preterm-infants|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Late preterm" has replaced "near term" to describe this group of infants, since near term incorrectly implies that these infants are "almost term" and only require routine neonatal care.&lt;ref name="Late preterm infants"/&gt;

In 2005, late-preterm births accounted for more than 70% of all preterm births (&lt;37 weeks’ gestation), or approximately 377,000 infants. In fact, much of the increase in the preterm birth rate in recent years can be attributed to increases in late-preterm births.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

== Risk Factors ==
Several important factors that may predispose late-preterm infants to medical conditions associated with immaturity:&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;
* [[respiratory distress]]
* [[apnea]]
* temperature instability
* hypoglycemia
* [[hyperbilirubinemia]]
* poor feeding

At 34–35 weeks, the brain weight is only about {{frac|2|3}} that of a full-term baby.  This may lead to an increased risk of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moster|first1=Dag|last2=Lie|first2=Rolv|last3=Markestad|first3=Trond|title=Long Term Medical and Social Consequences of Preterm Birth|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=July 17, 2008|volume=359|pages=262–273|doi=10.1056/nejmoa0706475|pmid=18635431}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Early School-Age Outcomes of Late Preterm Infants|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 15, 2008|volume=123|issue=4|page=e622-e629|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-1405}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mental retardation
* Developmental delay/disability
* Special needs – education
* Retention in kindergarten
* Cerebral palsy

==Neonatal Nutrition==
Late preterm infants have immature gastrointestinal function and feeding difficulties that predispose them to in increase in enterohepatic circulation, decreased stool frequency, dehydration, and hyperbilirubinemia. Feeding during the birth hospitalization may be transiently successful, but not sustained after discharge. Feeding difficulties are associated with relatively low oromotor tone, function, and neural maturation also predispose these infants to dehydration and hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;ref name=Engle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engle|first1=William|last2=Tomashek|first2=Kay|last3=Wallman|first3=Carol|title="Late-Preterm" Infants: A Population at Risk|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 2007|volume=120|issue=6|pages=1390–1401|doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2952}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Late Preterm Infants have an increased risk of being underweight and stunted at 12 and 24 months of age versus term infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santos|first1=Ina|title=Late preterm birth is a risk factor for growth faltering in early childhood: a cohort study|journal=BMC Pediatrics|date=November 16, 2009|volume=9|issue=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper nutrition is essential for normal growth, optimal neurologic and cognitive development, immune protection, and long term health.

==Feeding==
The last trimester of pregnancy the fetus is expressing active amino acid transport, calcium, lipid transfer, and glucose facilitated diffusion.  Delivery of the premature infant requires higher energy expenditure, but with inadequate intake the infant will have negative nitrogen balance.  There are higher needs for Calcium, Phosphorus, and Vitamin D.

==Early Nutrition and Cognitive Outcome==
For every 10 kcal/kg increase in energy intake in the first week of life, there is a 4.6 points increase in MDI (Mental Development Index) at 18 months. For every 1 g/kg increase in protein intake in the first week of life, 8.2 point increase in MDI at 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Bonnie|title=First-Week Protein and Energy Intakes Are Associated With 18-Month Developmental Outcomes in Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 22, 2008|volume=123|issue=5|pages=1337–1343|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-0211|pmid=19403500}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to Feeding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meier|first1=Paula|title=Increased lactation risk for late preterm infants and mothers: evidence and management strategies to protect breastfeeding.|journal=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women’s Health|date=2007|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radtke|first1=Jill|title=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women’s Health|journal=Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, &amp; Neonatal Nursing|date=January 2011|volume=40|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
* Small mouth and immature oral muscle
* Weak suck and poor latch
* Easily tire with feeding
* Maternal delayed milk production

==When To Start Feeding==

Factors such as hemodynamic stability, severe IUGR, respiratory, abdominal exam, whether feeding cues are present, and stable glucose could all effect the timing of nutrition.  Some preterm infants will be NPO (nil per os).  If infants are unable to start oral or enteral intake intravenous fluids may begin with amino acids or total parenteral nutrition.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics section on breastfeeding recommendations are all infants should receive human milk.

==Fortifiers==
Use caution when fortifying single nutrients to prevent alteration of protein/energy ratio.  [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) recommends that sterile formulas and fortifiers be used when mom is not available.  Powdered formula and HMF may be contaminants. Start with the mom's diet during breastfeeding.  Mom should be eating adequate calories, protein, B vitamins and DHA.

* Direct Breast Feeding
* Feeding tube at breast
* Cup/Finger feeding
* Bottle Feeding
* Gavage Tube (bolus feeding)

==Strategies to Improve Outcome==

===Early Nutrition===

* Colostrum Diet; Mother's own milk [Contains: [[Lactoferrin]], [[Secretory IgA]], Lysozyme, contains [[oligosaccharides]] (beneficial growth of good gut bacteria), and hormones]

'''Life satisfaction''' (LS) is the way in which people show their emotions, feelings (moods) and how they feel about their directions and options for the [[future]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anand|first1=Paul|title=Happiness Explained|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198735458}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}  It is a measure of [[Quality of life|well-being]] assessed in terms of mood, satisfaction with relationships, achieved goals, [[self-concepts]], and self-perceived ability to cope with one's daily life. Life satisfaction involves a favorable [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards one's life rather than an assessment of current feelings. Life satisfaction has been measured in relation to economic standing, degree of [[education]], experiences, residence, among many other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life satisfaction|url=http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/life-satisfaction/|publisher=OECD Better Life Index|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Review of Life Satisfaction Research with Children and Adolescents|pages=196|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/spq/18/2/192.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Work-Family Conflict, Policies, and the Job-Life Satisfaction Relationship: A Review and Directions for Organizational Behavior-Human Resources Research|pages=145|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/83/2/139.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Life Review Therapy Using Autobiographical Retrieval Practice for Older Adults With Depressive Symptomatology|pages=274|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pag/19/2/272.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life satisfaction is a key part of [[Tripartite model of subjective well-being|subjective wellbeing]].

==Factors affecting life satisfaction==

===Personality===

One of the primary concepts of [[personality]] is the Big Five factor model. This model illustrates what some researchers believe to be the building blocks of every individual's personality.  This model considers the dimensions of [[openness to experience]], [[conscientiousness]], [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], and [[neuroticism]]. In a study carried out by Deneve and Cooper in 1998, multiple studies were analyzed with certain personality questionnaires that linked subjective well-being and personality measures. They found that neuroticism was the strongest predictor of life satisfaction{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=describes specific research without citing it directly}}. Neuroticism is also linked to people who have difficulty making up their mind, and is common in people who suffer from mental illness. The personality factor "openness to experience" is positively correlated with life satisfaction. Apart from the personality dimensions studied in the Big Five model, the trait [[chronotype]] has been related to life satisfaction; morning-oriented people ("larks") showed higher life satisfaction than evening-oriented individuals ("owls").&lt;ref&gt;[http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07420528.2012.685671?journalCode=cbi Jankowski, K.S. (2012). Morningness/Eveningness and Satisfaction With Life in a Polish Sample. ''Chronobiology International, 29,''780-785.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07420528.2013.840786 Díaz-Morales, J.F., Jankowski, K.S., Vollmer, C., Randler, C. (2013). Morningness and life satisfaction: further evidence from Spain. ''Chronobiology International, 30,''1283-1285.]&lt;/ref&gt;

More frequent socialization can also contribute to overall well-being. Social support via others has been shown to affect the well-being of adults and the overall health of those individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guindon|first=Sophie|last2=Cappeliez|first2=Philippe|date=2010-03-01|title=Contributions of Psychological Well-Being and Social Support to an Integrative Model of Subjective Health in Later Adulthood|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12126-009-9050-7|journal=Ageing International|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=38–60|doi=10.1007/s12126-009-9050-7|issn=0163-5158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, people who tend to communicate, and who are considered to be more open to others would have a higher-level of life satisfaction.

Heritability has been shown to have an effect on how one is ranked in terms of life satisfaction. Heritability plays a role in both personality and individual experiences. Research suggests that heritability can influence life satisfaction to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stubbe|first=J. H.|last2=Posthuma|first2=D.|last3=Boomsma|first3=D. I.|last4=Geus|first4=E. J. C. De|date=November 2005|title=Heritability of life satisfaction in adults: a twin-family study|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/heritability-of-life-satisfaction-in-adults-a-twinfamily-study/558C8A4355B220F6A6EF69EEB93B3C99|journal=Psychological Medicine|language=en|volume=35|issue=11|pages=1581–1588|doi=10.1017/s0033291705005374|issn=1469-8978}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study found that there were no individual differences between males and females in terms of the heritability of life-satisfaction, however the personality elements that were affected by heritability did seem to have an effect on their overall life-satisfaction.

It has been further suggested that being able to independently deal with negative emotions can influence long-term life-satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lightsey|first=Owen Richard|last2=McGhee|first2=Richelle|last3=Ervin|first3=Audrey|last4=Gharghani|first4=George Gharibian|last5=Rarey|first5=Eli Benjamin|last6=Daigle|first6=Rosaire Patrick|last7=Wright|first7=Katherine Frances|last8=Constantin|first8=Donnalin|last9=Powell|first9=Kevin|date=2013-03-01|title=Self-Efficacy for Affect Regulation as a Predictor of Future Life Satisfaction and Moderator of the Negative Affect—Life Satisfaction Relationship|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-011-9312-4|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1007/s10902-011-9312-4|issn=1389-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a personality capable of properly dealing with emotions like anger, angst, or hate can be beneficial when dealing with similar things later in life. People who are more easy-going tend to deal with their negative emotions differently than someone who is up-tight. These individual differences can influence the way people deal with problems in the present and how they deal with similar situations in the future.

===Self-esteem===
The [[Satisfaction with Life Index|Satisfaction with Life Scale]] (SWLS) is a single scale that is used by [[UNESCO]], the [[CIA]], the [[New Economics Foundation]], the [[World Health Organization|WHO]], the Veenhoven Database, the Latinbarometer, the [[Afrobarometer]], and the UNHDR to measure how one views his or her [[self-esteem]], well-being and overall happiness with life.&lt;ref&gt;Subjective well-being: Three decades of progress. Diener, Ed; Suh, Eunkook M.; Lucas, Richard E.; Smith, Heidi L. Psychological Bulletin, Vol 125(2), Mar 1999, 276-302. doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276&lt;/ref&gt; Previous modeling showed that positive views and life satisfaction were completely mediated by the concept of self-esteem, together with the different ways in which ideas and events are perceived by people. Several studies found that self-esteem plays a definite role in influencing life satisfaction. By knowing yourself and your worth, you are driven to think in a positive way. There is also a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] model that supports these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last=Cummins|first=Robert|date=October 8, 2002|title=Normative Life Satisfaction: Measurement Issues and a Homeostatic Model|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p64850x664r20q06/fulltext.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outlook on life===
A person's mood and outlook on life can also influence his or her perception of his or her own life satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Frisch"&gt;Bailey, T., Eng, W., Frisch, M., &amp; Snyder, C. R. (2007), "Hope and optimism as related to life satisfaction." ''Journal of Positive Psychology'', 2(3), 168-69.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of [[emotion]]s that may influence how people perceive their lives. [[Hope]] and [[optimism]] both consist of cognitive processes that are usually oriented towards the reaching of goals and the perception of those goals. Additionally, optimism is linked to higher life satisfaction, whereas pessimism is related to symptoms in depression.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, E. C., &amp; Sanna, L. J. (2001). Optimism, pessimism, and positive and negcative affectivity in middle-aged adults: a test of a cognitive-affective model of psychological adjustment. Psychology and Aging, 16(3), 524-531. [http://positiveemotions.gr/library_files/C/Chang_Sanna_Optimism_2001.pdf doi: 10.1037/08827974163524]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Seligman, the happier people are, the less they focus on the negative aspects of their lives. Happier people also have a greater tendency to like other people, which promotes a happier environment. This correlates to a higher level of the person's satisfaction with his or her life, due to the notion that constructiveness with others can positively influence life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. (2002), "Positive emotions undo negative ones". ''Authentic Happiness''. New York, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have found that life satisfaction is compatible with profoundly negative emotional states like depression.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, T. (1981), "Happiness, Contentment and the Good Life". ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Life-review therapy using [[Autobiographical Retrieval Practice]] for older adults with depressive symptoms, in a study carried out by Serrano JP, Latorre JM, Gatz M, and Montanes J, Department of Psychology at Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, demonstrated that, with increased specificity of memories, individuals show decreased depression and hopelessness and increased life satisfaction. The test was designed to measure participants' ability to recall a specific memory in response to a cue word, while being timed.
Thirty cue words; including five words classified as 'positive' (e.g., ''funny, lucky, passionate, happy, hopeful),'' five as 'negative' ''(unsuccessful, unhappy, sad, abandoned, gloomy),'' and five as 'neutral' ''(work, city, home, shoes, family);'' were presented orally in a fixed, alternating order to each member of a focus group. To ensure that the participants understood the instructions, examples were provided of both 'general' memories (e.g., summers in the city) and 'specific' memories (e.g., the day I got married). For each cue word, participants were asked to share a memory evoked by that word.  The memory had to be of an event that should have occurred only once, at a particular time and place, and lasted no longer than a day. 
If the person could not recall a memory within 30 seconds, then that cue instance was not counted. Two psychologists served as raters and independently scored the responses of each participant.  Each memory was tagged either as 'specific' – if the recalled event lasted no more than one day – or, otherwise, as 'general'. The raters were not informed regarding the hypotheses of the study, the experimental (control) group's membership, nor the content of the pretest or post-test.

===Age===

The psychologists Yuval Palgi and [[Dov Shmotkin]] (2009) studied people who were primarily in their nineties. This subject group was found to have thought highly of their past and present. But generally, the group thought lower of their future. These people were very satisfied with their life up until the point they were surveyed but knew that the end was near and so were not quite as hopeful for the future.  Intelligence is also a factor because life satisfaction grows as people become older; as they grow older, they become wiser and more knowledgeable, so they begin to see that life will be better and understand the important things in life more.&lt;ref&gt;Palgi, Y., &amp; Shmotkin, D. (2010), "The predicament of time near the end of life: Time perspective trajectories of life satisfaction among the old-old." ''Aging &amp; Mental Health'', 14(5), 577- 86. {{doi|10.1080/13607860903483086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been recorded that adolescents seem to have a lower level of life satisfaction than their older counterparts. This could be because many decisions are imminent, and an adolescent could be facing them for the first time in his or her life. Although many adolescents have insecurities about many aspects of their lives, satisfaction with friends stayed at a consistent level. This is hypothesized to be due to the amount one can identify with those in one's age group over other age groups. In this same study, researchers found that satisfaction with family decreased. This could be because more rules and regulations are typically implemented by parental figures, and adolescents tend to demonize those in control of them. Also, it was found that life satisfaction in terms of sexuality increased. This is because at this age many adolescents reach sexual maturation, which can encourage them to find verification and satisfaction in the idea of a sexual partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldbeck|first=Lutz|last2=Schmitz|first2=Tim G.|last3=Besier|first3=Tanja|last4=Herschbach|first4=Peter|last5=Henrich|first5=Gerhard|date=2007-08-01|title=Life satisfaction decreases during adolescence|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-007-9205-5|journal=Quality of Life Research|language=en|volume=16|issue=6|pages=969–979|doi=10.1007/s11136-007-9205-5|issn=0962-9343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life events and experiences===

It has been suggested that there are several factors that contribute towards our level of life satisfaction. Experiences that are both acute events (e.g., death of
a loved one) and chronic, daily experiences (e.g., ongoing family discord) influence self-reports of life satisfaction. The book “Happier” by Harvard lecturer Tal Ben-Shahar argues that happiness should be one's ultimate goal, the primary factor in evaluating alternative choices. As the subtitle implies, Happier recommends for us to pursue immediate joyful experience in ways that contributes to more long-term, meaningful satisfaction. Furthermore, Ben-Shahar argues that pursuing genuine self-motivated goals, rather than just instant pleasure or selflessness in service of long-delayed enjoyment, results in an optimal combination of short- and long-term happiness.

Differences in experience can greatly shape the way that we observe and engage with the world around us. It can influence the way we speak to people, the way we act in public, and our general outlook. These experiences which shape the way we think about our surroundings affect our life-satisfaction. Someone who has the tendency to see the world in a more negative light, may have a completely different level of satisfaction than someone who is constantly admiring the beauty of his or her surroundings. People who engage with more stress on average tend to have higher levels of stress can contribute to higher levels of self-report life satisfaction, as long as those who understand how to deal with their stress in a positive way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burger|first=Kaspar|last2=Samuel|first2=Robin|date=2017-01-01|title=The Role of Perceived Stress and Self-Efficacy in Young People’s Life Satisfaction: A Longitudinal Study|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-016-0608-x|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=78–90|doi=10.1007/s10964-016-0608-x|issn=0047-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasonal effects===

A recent study analyzes time-dependent rhythms in happiness comparing life satisfaction by weekdays (weekend neurosis), days of the month (negative effects towards the end of the month) and year with gender and education and outlining the differences observed.&lt;ref&gt;Maennig, W., Steenbeck, M., Wilhelm, M. (2013), Rhythms and Cycles in Happiness, http://www.uni-hamburg.de/economicpolicy/publications.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily within the winter months of the year, an onset of depression can affect us, which is called seasonal affective disorder (SAD). It is recurrent, beginning in the fall or winter months, and remitting in the spring or summer.&lt;ref name="Seasonal affective disorder"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1998-10-24|title=Seasonal affective disorder|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673698010150|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=352|issue=9137|pages=1369–1374|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)01015-0|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that those who experience this disorder usually have a history of major depressive or bipolar disorder, which may be hereditary, having a family member affected as well.

Seasonal affective disorder is hypothesized to be caused by the diminishing of the exposure to environmental light which can lead to changes in levels of the neurotransmitter chemical seratonin. Diminishing active seratonin levels increases depressive symptoms. There are currently a few treatment therapies in order to help with seasonal affective disorder. The first line of therapy is light therapy. Light therapy involves exposure to bright, white light that mimics outdoor light, counteracting the presumed cause of SAD. Due to the shifts in one's neurochemical levels, antidepressants are another form of therapy. Other than light therapy and antidepressants, there are several alternatives which involve agomelatine, melatonin, psychological interventions, as well as diet and lifestyle changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.boisestate.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&amp;sid=43aaf03c-f3c6-4676-b8fe-016f02564714@sessionmgr4007|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.boisestate.edu|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that the onset of SAD typically occurs between the ages of 20–30 years, but most affected people do not seek medical help.&lt;ref name="Seasonal affective disorder"/&gt; This could be due to the stigma of mental health issues. Many are afraid to state they are suffering and would rather hide it. As a society we should push forward towards greater acceptance and gain knowledge in order to solve these issues.

===Values===

It is proposed that overall life satisfaction comes from within an individual based on the individual's personal values and what he or she holds important. For some it is family, for others it is love, and for others it is money or other material items; either way, it varies from one person to another. [[Economic materialism]] can be considered a value. Previous research found that materialistic individuals were predominantly male, and that materialistic people also reported a lower life satisfaction level than their non-materialistic counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Influence of Materialistic Inclination on Values, Life Satisfaction and Aspirations: An Empirical Analysis | journal = Springer | year = 2000 | first =  Ah Kau | last =  Keng |author2=Kwon Jung |author3=Tan Soo Jiuan |author4=Jochen Wirtz | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 317–33|doi=10.1023/A:1006956602509 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/qg25274527610p64/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true of people who value money over helping other people; this is because the money they have can buy them the assets they deem valuable.&lt;ref name="GeorgellisYannis"&gt;Georgellis, Yannis; Tsitsianis, Nicholas; Yin, Ya Ping, "Personal Values as Mitigating Factors in Link Between Income and Life Satisfaction: Evidence from the European Social Survey". ''Social Indicators Research'', Vol 91(3), May, 2009. pp. 329-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Materialistic people are less satisfied with life because they constantly want more and more belongings, and once those belongings are obtained they lose value, which in turn causes these people to want more belongings and the cycle continues. If these materialistic individuals do not have enough money to satisfy their craving for more items, they become more dissatisfied. This has been referred to as a [[hedonic treadmill]]. Individuals reporting a high value on traditions and religion reported a higher level of life satisfaction. This is also true for reported routine churchgoers and people who pray frequently. Other individuals that reported higher levels of life satisfaction were people who valued creativity, and people who valued respect for and from others – two more qualities seemingly not related to material goods.&lt;ref name="GeorgellisYannis" /&gt; Because hard times come around and often people count on their peers and family to help them through, it is no surprise that a higher life satisfaction level was reported of people who had social support, whether it be friends, family, or church. The people who personally valued material items were found to be less satisfied overall in life as opposed to people who attached a higher amount of value with interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, C., Mei, T., &amp; Chen, L. (2009), "How do positive views maintain life satisfaction". Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; accordance with the findings above, it is also fair to say that the notion of how one values themselves plays a part in how someone considers their own life. People who take pride in themselves by staying mentally and physically fit have higher levels of life satisfaction purely due to the content of their day. These values come together in determining how somebody sees themselves in light of others.

===Culture===

Defining culture by reference to deeply engrained societal values and beliefs. Culture affects the [[subjective well-being]]. Well-being includes both general life satisfaction, and the relative balance of positive affect verses negative affect in daily life. Culture directs the attention to different sources of information for making the life satisfaction judgments, thus affecting subjective well-being appraisal.

Individualistic cultures direct attention to inner states and feelings (such as positive or negative affects), while in collectivistic cultures the attention is directed to outer sources (i.e. adhering to social norms or fulfilling one's duties). Indeed, Suh et al. (1998) found that the correlation between life satisfaction and the prevalence of positive affect is higher in individualistic cultures, whereas in collectivistic cultures affect and adhering to norms are equally important for life satisfaction. Most of modern western societies, such as the United States and European countries are directed towards individualism, while the eastern societies like China and Japan, are directed towards collectivism. Those of a collectivistic culture emphasize deeply on the unity one has with their families. They put others' needs before their individual desires. An individualistic culture is geared towards one's own personal achievements and it signals a strong sense of competition. They are expected to carry their own weight and rely on themselves. The United States is said to be one of the most individualistic countries, and on the other hand Korea and Japan are some of the most collectivistic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Ken I.|last2=Park|first2=Hun-Joon|last3=Suzuki|first3=Nori|date=1990|title=Reward Allocations in the United States, Japan, and Korea: A Comparison of Individualistic and Collectivistic Cultures|jstor=256358|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=33|issue=1|pages=188–198|doi=10.2307/256358}}&lt;/ref&gt; However both groups have their flaws. With an individualistic approach, one is inclined in possibly experiencing loneliness. Meanwhile, those in a collectivist culture, may be prone to having a dismay of rejection.

===Family===

Life satisfaction can also be looked at in a new one as influenced by a family. Family life satisfaction is a pertinent topic as everyone's family influences them in some way and most strive to have high levels of satisfaction in life as well as within their own family. As discussed by Gary L. Bowen in his article, "Family Life Satisfaction: A Value Based Approach" he examines how family life satisfaction is enhanced by the ability of family members to jointly realize their family-related values in behavior (459). It is important to examine family life satisfaction from all members of the family from a "perceived" perspective and an "ideal" perspective. Greater life satisfaction within a family increases through communication and understanding each member's attitudes and perceptions. A family can make all the difference for someone's life satisfaction.

In the article "Family System Characteristics, Parental Behaviors, and Adolescent Life Satisfaction" by Carolyn S. Henry, adolescent life satisfaction has much different origins than the life satisfaction of adults. An adolescent's life satisfaction is heavily influenced by his or her family's dynamic and characteristics. Family bonding, family flexibility, parental support are all huge factors into the adolescent's life satisfaction. The more bonding, flexibility, and support there is within a family the higher the adolescent's life satisfaction. Results of this study also revealed that adolescents living in a single-parent family home had significantly lower life satisfaction that adolescents in a two-parent home. An adolescent's age is extremely important in terms of life satisfaction coming from their family (Henry).

Family also relates to life satisfaction in a very different way: a woman's decision to have children or not. In the "Relationship between Information Search in the Childbearing Decision and Life Satisfaction for Parents and Nonparents" article by Carole K. Holahan, reveals that childless women have much higher life satisfaction than women with children. Women who consciously decided not to have children overall had very high life satisfaction. It was found that most of the life satisfaction came from careers instead of children. On the other hand, women who did have children had high life satisfaction which depended on the reasons and decision making for having children. These are just generalizations and life satisfaction comes from many different sources which are unique and different for every person. Life satisfaction can shift all the time from events, situations, family and friend implications and many different things that all must be taken into consideration.

On the other hand, life satisfaction is also affected by parenthood and couples introducing children into their relationship. Research has shown that adults with children are less happy (McLanahan &amp; Adams 1987) due to less life satisfaction, less marital satisfaction, more anxiety and more depression.

===Career===
A satisfying career is an important component of life satisfaction.  Doing something meaningful in a productive capacity contributes to one's feeling of life satisfaction. This notion of accomplishment is related to a person’s drive. Need for accomplishment is an essential part of becoming a fully functional person, and if someone feels accomplished they would be more able to see bright sides in their life; thus improving their life satisfaction

Internationally, the salary one earns is important – income levels show a moderate correlation with individual evaluations of life satisfaction. However, in developed nations, the connection is weak and disappears for the most part when individuals earn enough money to meet basic needs (Kahneman &amp; Deaton 2010; Diener et al., 2010; Myers and Diener, 1995).

In [[human reproduction]], a '''live birth''' occurs when a [[fetus]], whatever its [[gestational age]], exits the [[maternal]] body and subsequently shows any sign of life, such as [[voluntary muscle|voluntary movement]], [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]], or pulsation of the [[umbilical cord]], for however brief a time and regardless of whether the umbilical cord or [[placenta]] are intact.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems. Tenth Revision. Vol 2. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization, 1993:129.&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition of the term "live birth" was created by the [[World Health Organization]] in 1950 and is chiefly used for public health and [[statistics|statistical]] purposes. Whether the [[childbirth|birth]] is [[vagina]]l or by [[Caesarean section]], and whether the [[neonate]] is ultimately viable, is not relevant to this statistical definition.  However, the term "live birth" was in common use long before 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?num=100&amp;q=%22live+birth%22+date%3A1500-1950&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=1 Search full view Google Books for "live birth" prior to the year 1950].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the term "born alive" is defined by federal statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/01/8-|title=1 U.S. Code § 8 - "Person", "human being", "child", and "individual" as including born-alive infant|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, live births are recorded on a U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, also known as a [[birth certificate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/revisions-of-the-us-standard-certificates-and-reports.htm|title=NVSS - Revisions of the U.S. Standard Certificates and Reports|date=2017-08-30|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States recorded 3.95 million live births in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Martin JA, Hamilton BE, Osterman MJK, Driscoll AK, Drake P.

Bradley |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=e1000316 |pmid=20668659 |pmc=2910600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[loneliness]] is associated with increased risk for [[cardiovascular disease]], and all-cause mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12160-010-9210-8 |title=Loneliness Matters: A Theoretical and Empirical Review of Consequences and Mechanisms |year=2010 |last1=Hawkley |first1=Louise C. |last2=Cacioppo |first2=John T. |journal=Annals of Behavioral Medicine |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=218–27 |pmid=20652462 |pmc=3874845}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little work has directly compared the health impacts of marriage compared to those of non-romantic relationships, such as connections with friends or colleagues.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt; However, there are several reasons why marriage may exert a greater health impact than other relationships, even other cohabiting relationships: married couples spend time together during a wide variety of activities, such as eating, leisure, housekeeping, child-care and sleep.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt; Spouses also share resources and investments such as joint finances or home-ownership. Relative to other relationships, the increased [[interdependence]] of marriage serves as a source for more intense support.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt;

Romantic couples who live together, but are unmarried, may represent a middle ground in health benefits between those who are married, and those who self-identify as single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2012.00983.x |id={{INIST|26172825}} |first1=Hui |last1=Liu |first2=Corinne |last2=Reczek | date=August  2012 |title=Cohabitation and U.S. Adult Mortality: An Examination by Gender and Race |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=794–811 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=0022-2445&amp;volume=74&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=794&amp;epage=811}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, people live together without getting married for many different reasons; [[cohabitation]] may serve as a prelude to marriage. Selection factors of race, ethnicity, and social-economic status predispose certain groups to cohabit unmarried, and these factors also affect the health benefits of marriage and cohabitation.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt;

==Same-sex marriage==
Most research on marriage and health has studied heterosexual couples. Same-sex and opposite-sex couples share many similarities. Both begin marriage with high levels of relationship satisfaction, followed by later declines, and both argue with similar frequency about similar issues.&lt;ref name=kurdek2004&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0022-2445.2004.00060.x |title=Are Gay and Lesbian cohabiting couples really different from heterosexual married couples? |year=2004 |last1=Kurdek |first1=Lawrence A. |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=880–900 |jstor=3600164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kurdek2005&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00375.x |title=What Do We Know About Gay and Lesbian Couples? |year=2005 |last1=Kurdek |first1=Lawrence A. |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=251–4 |jstor=20183038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, same-sex couples resolve conflicts more effectively, and distribute household labor more fairly compared to their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref name=kurdek2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kurdek2005 /&gt; [[Same-sex marriage]] remains illegal in many countries, and in many parts of the [[United States]] (where much research on marriage and health has been conducted).&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt; In these regions same-sex couples are not granted the institutional protections of marriage or its accompanying legal barriers to relationship dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lawrence A. |last1=Kurdek |date=August 1998 |title=Relationship Outcomes and Their Predictors: Longitudinal Evidence from Heterosexual Married, Gay Cohabiting, and Lesbian Cohabiting Couples |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=553–68 |jstor=353528 |doi=10.2307/353528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, same-sex couples are more likely to experience discrimination against their sexual orientation, contributing to problems with mental health and relationship quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085701 |title=The Close Relationships of Lesbians and Gay Men |year=2007 |last1=Peplau |first1=Letitia Anne |last2=Fingerhut |first2=Adam W. |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=58 |pages=405–24 |pmid=16903800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==
The health-protective effect of marriage is stronger for men than women.&lt;ref name=KiecoltGlaser2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=wanic2011 /&gt; Marital status — the simple fact of being married — confers more health benefits to men than women.&lt;ref name=KiecoltGlaser2001 /&gt; Women's health is more strongly impacted than men's by marital conflict or satisfaction, such that unhappily married women do not enjoy better health relative to their single counterparts.&lt;ref name=KiecoltGlaser2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=wanic2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=saxbe2008&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.27.1.15 |title=Marital satisfaction, recovery from work, and diurnal cortisol among men and women |year=2008 |last1=Saxbe |first1=Darby E. |last2=Repetti |first2=Rena L. |last3=Nishina |first3=Adrienne |journal=Health Psychology |volume=27 |pages=15–25 |pmid=18230009 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory studies indicate that women have stronger physiological reactions than men in response to marital conflict.&lt;ref name=KiecoltGlaser2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=wanic2011 /&gt;

These gender differences may be partially due to men's and women's relative status in a relationship.&lt;ref name=wanic2011 /&gt; Research in humans and animals suggests subordinate status is linked to greater physiological reactions to [[social stress]].&lt;ref name=wanic2011 /&gt; Indeed, subordinate spouses show greater physiological reactions to arguments with their partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0022-2445.2004.00040.x |title=Stress Hormone Changes and Marital Conflict: Spouses' Relative Power Makes a Difference |year=2004 |last1=Loving |first1=Timothy J. |last2=Heffner |first2=Kathi L. |last3=Kiecolt-Glaser |first3=Janice K. |last4=Glaser |first4=Ronald |last5=Malarkey |first5=William B. |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=595–612 |jstor=3600215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both husbands and wives show stronger physiological reactions to arguments when making demands for change from their partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1012278209577 |year=2001 |last1=Denton |first1=Wayne H. |last2=Burleson |first2=Brant R. |last3=Hobbs |first3=Barbara V. |last4=Von Stein |first4=Margaret |last5=Rodriguez |first5=Christopher P. |journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=401–21 |pmid=11702357 |title=Cardiovascular reactivity and initiate/avoid patterns of marital communication: A test of Gottman's psychophysiologic model of marital interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.22.3.270 |title=Conflict structure moderates associations between cardiovascular reactivity and negative marital interaction |year=2003 |last1=Newton |first1=Tamara L. |last2=Sanford |first2=Janine M. |journal=Health Psychology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=270–8 |pmid=12790254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's heightened physiological reactions to marital conflict may be due to their relative subordinate position in marriage.&lt;ref name=wanic2011 /&gt;

==Measuring health==
Research on the links between marriage and health has measured diverse outcomes. These are broadly categorized as [[clinical endpoint]]s, [[clinical endpoint|surrogate endpoint]]s, and biological mediators.&lt;ref name=biodef&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1067/mcp.2001.113989 |title=Biomarkers and surrogate endpoints: Preferred definitions and conceptual framework |year=2001 |journal=Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=89–95 |pmid=11240971|author1=Biomarkers Definitions Working Group. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical endpoints are variables which affect how people feel, function, and survive.&lt;ref name=biodef /&gt; They are recognized as important outcomes by health care providers and patients, for instance being hospitalized, or having a heart-attack.&lt;ref name=biodef /&gt;

Surrogate endpoints and biological mediators are types of [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]]—objective indicators of normal or [[Pathology|pathological]] [[Physiology|physiological]] processes.&lt;ref name=biodef /&gt; Surrogate endpoints serve to substitute for clinical endpoints. They are expected to predict clinical endpoints, based on [[scientific evidence]].&lt;ref name=biodef /&gt; For example, elevated blood pressure has been found to predict cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=treiber2003&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12554815 |year=2003 |last1=Treiber |first1=FA |last2=Kamarck |first2=T |last3=Schneiderman |first3=N |last4=Sheffield |first4=D |last5=Kapuku |first5=G |last6=Taylor |first6=T |title=Cardiovascular reactivity and development of preclinical and clinical disease states |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=46–62 |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12554815 |doi=10.1097/00006842-200301000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological mediators reflect short-term sources of stress which affect health outcomes through repeated or persistent activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S095457941100040X |title=Allostatic processes in the family |year=2011 |last1=Repetti |first1=Rena L. |last2=Robles |first2=Theodore F. |last3=Reynolds |first3=Bridget |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=921–38 |pmid=21756442}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes do not have a sufficient evidence base linking them to clinical endpoints in order be elevated to the class of surrogate endpoints.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt; Examples include changes in [[hormone]] levels, or [[Immune system|immune]] measures.

==Links to health==

===Selection and protection===
The health benefits of marriage are a result of both selection and protection effects.&lt;ref name=Umberson1992&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(92)90259-S |title=Gender, marital status and the social control of health behavior |year=1992 |last1=Umberson |first1=Debra |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=907–17 |pmid=1604380}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with better health, more resources, and less stress are more likely to marry, and marriage brings resources, and social support.&lt;ref name=Umberson1992 /&gt; The health benefits of marriage persist even after controlling for selection effects, indicating that being married is protective of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0192513X03254519 |title='In Sickness and in Health': Does Cohabitation Count? |year=2003 |last1=Wu |first1=Zheng |last2=Penning |first2=Margaret J. |last3=Pollard |first3=Michael S. |last4=Hart |first4=Randy |journal=Journal of Family Issues |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=811–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social support: two models===
Research on marriage and health is part of the broader study of the benefits of social relationships. Social ties provide people with a sense of identity, purpose, belonging and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0022146510395592 |title=Mechanisms Linking Social Ties and Support to Physical and Mental Health |year=2011 |last1=Thoits |first1=P. A. |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=145–61 |pmid=21673143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main models describe how [[social support]] influences health.

The main-effects model proposes that social support is good for one's health, regardless of whether or not one is under stress.&lt;ref name=cohen2004&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.8.676 |title=Social Relationships and Health |year=2004 |last1=Cohen |first1=Sheldon |journal=American Psychologist |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=676–84 |pmid=15554821}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stress-buffering model proposes that social support acts as a buffer against the negative effects of stress occurring outside the relationship.&lt;ref name=cohen2004 /&gt; Both models have received empirical support, depending on how social support is conceptualized and measured.&lt;ref name=cohen2004 /&gt; Marriage should be a strong source of social support in both models.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt;

=== Observed social dynamics of couples ===
There are several interesting social norms between couples that are relevant towards forming health-related habits. Couples have a higher chance of accomplishing a goal when they collaborate, as opposed to achieving the same goal as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace JP, Raglin JS, Jastremski CA (1995). Twelve month adherence of adults who joined a fitness program with a spouse vs. without a spouse. In ''Journal of Sports Medicine and Physocal Fitness''. 1995 Sep;35(3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/how-to-get-your-spouse-to-exercise|title=How to Get Your Spouse to Exercise|last=Reynolds|first=Gretchen|work=Well|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, couples' habits play an important role in influencing the health habits of their children. As a result, shared activities among couples can help develop stronger relationships that can lead to other health and long-term benefits.&amp;nbsp;There are several interesting social norms between couples that are relevant towards forming health-related habits. Examples include:
* '''Eating Dynamics''': Couples like to eat together, and although they perform divergent activities during the day, they often 'come together and look forward to dinner'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Craig, P. L. and Truswell, A. S. (1988a) Dynamics of food habits of newly married couples: food related activities and attitudes towards food. In ''Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, couples have an affinity to grocery-shop together, which is an important opportunity to make household decisions towards healthy eating.
* '''Reduced Exercise Patterns''': Time constraints and other obligations often deter couples from regularly exercising. In particular, their stable relationships often propel them to "let go" and be less concerned about their physique.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery R. W., Rick A.M. (2002). Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between body mass index and marriage-related factors. In ''Obesity Research '02''; 8/10.&lt;/ref&gt; In societies with strong conformist dynamics, some partners are less likely to exercise unless they go with a companion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Burke, V., Mori, T. A., Giangiulio, N., Gillam, H. F., Beilin, L. J., Houghton, S., Cutt, H. E., Mansour, J., &amp; Wilson, A. (2002). An innovative program for changing health behaviours. In Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 11, S586- S597.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Re-evaluation of Attitudes Towards Health''': As couples adopt to new lifestyles, they concurrently re-assess their current attitudes towards health. In this crucial phase, partners are more likely to integrate new knowledge and practical skills towards a health-related lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, V., Giangiulio, N., Gillam, H. F., Beilin, L. J., Houghton, S., Milligan, R. A. K. (1999). Health promotion in couples adapting to a shared lifestyle. In ''Health Education Research, Theory &amp; Practice''. Vol. 14 no. 2, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Encouragement and Praise vs. Criticism and Nagging:''' Verbal support from a spouse, such as encouragement and praise, helps improve physical activity achievement,&lt;ref&gt;Beverly, E., &amp; Wray, L. (2010). The role of collective efficacy in exercise adherence: A qualitative study of spousal support and Type 2 diabetes management. In ''Health Education Research'', 25(2).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas support disguised as "criticism" and nagging are often detrimental.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Comparison Anxiety''': Anecdotal accounts provide hints on the detrimental effects of comparing exercise progress. Couples may have different rates of progress, and for some partners, comparisons could lead to discouragement. A more collaborative approach towards a unified goal has been found to be more beneficial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Spousal adherence to fitness programs ===
There exists several studies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wallace JP, Raglin JS, Jastremski CA (1995). Twelve month adherence of adults who joined a fitness program with a spouse vs. without a spouse. In ''Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness''. 1995 Sep;35(3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Craig, P. L. and Truswell, A. S. (1990) Dynamics of food habits of newly married couples: weight and exercise patterns. In ''Australian Journal of Nutrition and Dietetics, 47''&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; specifically examining the effect of spousal engagement on exercise program adherence. For example, one study examined healthy couples' behavior based on a 12-month fitness program where researchers tracked the behaviors between 30 married-singles vs. 32 married pairs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Their results reveal statistically significant differences: &amp;nbsp;at the end of the study, 6.3% of the married-pairs had dropped out of the program, compared to 43% of the married singles. These findings are consistent with previous research,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and they point to the notion that social support in the form of "spousal participation" exerts beneficial effect on adherence towards fitness programs, or in general, most types of health-related joint endeavor.

==Marital quality==
While simply being married is associated on average with better health, the health impacts of marriage are affected by marital quality.&lt;ref name=KiecoltGlaser2001 /&gt; High marital quality is typically characterized as high [[Self-report study|self-reported]] satisfaction with the relationship, generally positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] toward one's spouse, and low levels of hostile and negative behavior.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt; Conversely, low marital quality is characterized as low self-reported satisfaction with the relationship, generally negative attitudes toward one's spouse, and high levels of hostile and negative behavior.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt; A troubled marriage is a significant source of stress, and limits one's ability to seek support from other relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.54.4.454 |title=Going beyond social support: The role of social relationships in adaptation |year=1986 |last1=Coyne |first1=James C. |last2=Delongis |first2=Anita |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=454–60 |pmid=3745597}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unmarried people are, on average, happier than those unhappily married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Norval D. |last1=Glenn |first2=Charles N. |last2=Weaver |date=February 1981 |title=The Contribution of Marital Happiness to Global Happiness |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=161–8 |jstor=351426 |doi=10.2307/351426}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of 126 studies found that greater marital quality is related to better health, with effect sizes comparable to those of health behaviors such as diet and exercise.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt; Explanations for the links between marital quality and health focus on social-cognitive and emotional processes, health behaviors, and a bidirectional association with mental illness.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt;

===Social-cognitive processes===
People in happy marriages may think about their relationship differently from people in troubled marriages. Unhappily married people often hold their partner responsible for negative behaviors, but attribute positive behavior to other factors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2011.00655.x |id={{INIST|24541838}} |title=Dyadic Processes in Early Marriage: Attributions, Behavior, and Marital Quality |year=2011 |last1=Durtschi |first1=Jared A. |last2=Fincham |first2=Frank D. |last3=Cui |first3=Ming |last4=Lorenz |first4=Frederick O. |last5=Conger |first5=Rand D. |journal=Family Relations |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=421–34|pmc=4830127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—for example, "she came home late because she doesn't want to spend time with me; she came home early because her boss told her to." Blaming one's partner for their negative behavior  is associated with prolonged elevations of the stress hormone cortisol after an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0265407506065991 |title=Social-cognitive predictors of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal reactivity to interpersonal conflict in emerging adult couples |year=2006 |last1=Laurent |first1=H. K. |last2=Powers |first2=S. I. |journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=703–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spouses in troubled marriages are also likely to misattribute their partners' communication as criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2009.02.012 |title=Explication of interspousal criticality bias |year=2009 |last1=Peterson |first1=Kristina M. |last2=Smith |first2=David A. |last3=Windle |first3=Chaunce R. |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=478–86 |pmid=19286167 |pmc=2688957}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the links between these social-cognitive processes and health remain understudied.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt;

===Emotional processes===
Higher levels of negative emotions and less effective emotional disclosure may be involved in linking marital quality and health. People in troubled marriages experience more negative emotions, particularly hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1040-3590.13.1.5 |title=Observation of couple conflicts: Clinical assessment applications, stubborn truths, and shaky foundations |year=2001 |last1=Heyman |first1=Richard E. |journal=Psychological Assessment |volume=13 |pages=5–35 |pmid=11281039 |issue=1 |pmc=1435728}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative emotions have been linked to elevated blood pressure and heart rate, and to increased levels of [[stress hormone]]s, which may lead to ill health.&lt;ref name=robles2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0031-9384(03)00160-4 |title=The physiology of marriage: Pathways to health |year=2003 |last1=Robles |first1=Theodore F |last2=Kiecolt-Glaser |first2=Janice K |journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=409–16 |pmid=12954435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional disclosure often occurs in well-functioning marriages, and is linked to a host of health benefits, including fewer physician visits and missed work days.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt; However, people in troubled marriages are less skillful in emotional disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/jscp.24.2.218.62270 |id={{INIST|16722763}} |title=Emotional Skillfulness in Marriage: Intimacy As a Mediator of the Relationship Between Emotional Skillfulness and Marital Satisfaction |year=2005 |last1=Cordova |first1=James V. |last2=Gee |first2=Christina B. |last3=Warren |first3=Lisa Z. |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=218–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health behaviors===
Health behaviors such as diet, exercise and substance use, may also affect the interplay of marital quality and health. The health behaviors of married couples converge over time, such that couples who have been married many years have similar behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5993/AJHB.32.6.19 |title=Spousal Influence on General Health Behaviors in a Community Sample |year=2008 |last1=Homish |first1=Gregory |journal=American Journal of Health Behavior |volume=32 |issue=6 |pmid=18442354 |last2=Leonard |first2=KE |pages=754–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation is that spouses influence or control one another's health behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.11.011 |title=Gender, health behavior, and intimate relationships: Lesbian, gay, and straight contexts |year=2012 |last1=Reczek |first1=Corinne |last2=Umberson |first2=Debra |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1783–90 |pmid=22227238 |pmc=3337964}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spouse's positive control techniques, such as modeling a healthy behavior, increase their partner's intentions to improve health behaviors, whereas negative control techniques, such as inducing fear, do not affect intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0021-9029.2007.00161.x |title=Social Control in Marital Relationships: Effect of One's Partner on Health Behaviors |year=2007 |last1=Lewis |first1=Megan A. |last2=Butterfield |first2=Rita M. |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=298–319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marital support may increase the psychological resources—such as self-efficacy, and self-regulation—needed to improve one's health behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.23.2.207 |title=Social Support and Patient Adherence to Medical Treatment: A Meta-Analysis |year=2004 |last1=Dimatteo |first1=M. Robin |journal=Health Psychology |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=207–18 |pmid=15008666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological pathways===
Dysregulation of the cardiovascular, neuroendocrine and immune systems is implicated in the links between marital quality and health.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt;

====Cardiovascular reactivity====
Marital conflict, and seeking change from one's spouse evokes a cardiovascular reaction, increasing heart rate and blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.10.3.155 |title=High blood pressure and marital discord: Not being nasty matters more than being nice |year=1991 |last1=Ewart |first1=Craig K. |last2=Taylor |first2=C.

====Neuroendocrine system====
Hormones produced by the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis (SAM) and [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA) have wide-ranging effects across the body.&lt;ref name=mcewen1998&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199801153380307 |title=Protective and Damaging Effects of Stress Mediators |year=1998 |last1=Flier |first1=Jeffrey S. |last2=Underhill |first2=Lisa H. |last3=McEwen |first3=Bruce S. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=338 |issue=3 |pages=171–9 |pmid=9428819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both axes have been implicated in the links between psychological factors and physical health.&lt;ref name=mcewen1998 /&gt; SAM activity can be measured by levels of circulating [[catecholamine]]s—[[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]]. Negative interactions with one's spouse have been linked to elevated catecholamine levels, both during and after conflict.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt;

Daily fluctuations in the level of [[cortisol]]—a stress hormone—are an important marker of health; flatter slopes of cortisol change throughout the day are strongly associated with [[cardiovascular disease]] and related mortality.&lt;ref name=whitehall&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.2010-2137 |title=Association of Diurnal Patterns in Salivary Cortisol with All-Cause and Cardiovascular Mortality: Findings from the Whitehall II Study |year=2011 |last1=Kumari |first1=M. |last2=Shipley |first2=M. |last3=Stafford |first3=M. |last4=Kivimaki |first4=M. |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=1478|pmc=3085201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower marital satisfaction has been linked with flatter cortisol slopes across the day,&lt;ref name=saxbe2008 /&gt; lower waking levels of cortisol,&lt;ref name=saxbe2008 /&gt; and higher overall cortisol levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e318185c4fc |title=Positive Couple Interactions and Daily Cortisol: On the Stress-Protecting Role of Intimacy |year=2008 |last1=Ditzen |first1=B. |last2=Hoppmann |first2=C. |last3=Klumb |first3=P. |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine |volume=70 |issue=8 |pages=883–9 |pmid=18842747}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a meta-analysis found no relationship between marital quality and cortisol slopes.&lt;ref name=Robles2013 /&gt;

====Immune pathways====
Low marital satisfaction, and hostility during arguments with one's spouse are associated with increased [[inflammation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026902 |title=Marital adjustment and interleukin-6 (IL-6) |year=2012 |last1=Whisman |first1=Mark A. |last2=Sbarra |first2=David A. |journal=Journal of Family Psychology |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=290–5 |pmid=22229879 |pmc=4034464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=robles2005&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00345.x |title=Out of Balance.

[[File:Medical alert bracelet 2.jpg|alt=A metal bracelet, engraved with a short list of important medical information, and decorated with a red symbol representing medicine|thumb|400x400px|A medical alert bracelet]]
A '''medical identification tag''' is a small [[emblem]] or tag worn on a [[bracelet]], [[neck chain]], or on the clothing bearing a message that the wearer has an important [[medical condition]] that might require immediate attention. The tag is often made out of [[stainless steel]] or [[sterling silver]]. The intention is to alert a [[paramedic]], physician, [[emergency department]] personnel or other [[certified first responder|first responders]] ([[emergency medical services]], [[community first responder]], [[Emergency medical responder]]) of the condition even if the wearer is not conscious enough, old enough, or too injured to explain. A wallet [[Identity document|card]] with the same information may be used instead of or along with a tag, and a stick-on medical ID tag may be added or used alone.

A type of medic identification alert is the USB medical alert tag, essentially a USB flash drive with capacity to store a great deal of emergency information, including contacts and medical conditions. This information is accessible by any computer with a USB port. However, the practical effectiveness of such a system is limited in many cases by medical computer systems that restrict the use of USB devices which may carry malware. It is also possible that a device carried by an unconscious person may not be their own, or not be up to date, with concomitant risks to health and legal liability of medical personnel.

Another new type of medic identification alert is [[QR code]] based medical alert stickers. The QR code on the sticker links to a [[web service]] that contains the individual's emergency information. The information is accessed by any first responder or emergency personnel by scanning the QR code by using a [[smartphone]]. Since a web service is used to store the information there is normally no limitation of how much information that can be stored.

==Conditions for use==
Typical conditions warranting wearing of such a tag are:

{{div col end}}

==Information provided==
{{Main article|In case of emergency}}
In addition to mention of the relevant medical condition(s), the tag may have a telephone number that medical personnel can call for more information, for example that of physician, care-giver or [[next of kin]]. Where applicable and provided, the wearer's national health service user number can enable access to a more detailed case history. Basically, the medical information tag, engraved with the wearer's personal medical problem or history, speak for the wearer when the wearer can't. Incidentally and where the symptoms can mislead, such a tag may also be useful as evidence of such a condition to law enforcement personnel.

==Types==
[[File:Star of life2.svg|thumb|The emblem for medical emergency services in some countries, the [[Star of Life]], features a [[rod of Asclepius]].]]
There are various types of medical ID&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Medical ID That Comes With a Free Medical Profile|url=https://shop.getmyid.com|accessdate=10 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; available. The most common form of medical ID is jewelry which provides a logo or inscription indicating a particular medical condition. These medical identification tags can be made out of stainless steel (usually classified as 316L and known as [[Stainless steel#Stainless steel grades|surgical stainless steel]]), sterling silver or gold. If found by emergency personnel the inscription provides an indication of your special medical needs. Tags are available with pre-engraved conditions or can be custom engraved with your specific medical histories and have the benefit of that all information is self-contained and does not require any form of technology to view in case of an emergency.

Another type of medical ID jewelry indicates membership in a medical information organization such as the [[MedicAlert]] Foundation, and American Medical ID. Such medical ID jewelry includes a member identification number and a toll-free number for medical emergency personnel to contact the organization and obtain full information about the wearer's medical conditions, treatment, and history. These organizations maintain a database of medical information on their members and can provide it to medical personnel when requested.

The newest technology allows the user to carry stickers with an [[NFC Tag]]. A similar technology allows the user to carry stickers with a [[QR code]]. By scanning the NFC Tag or the QR code with a smartphone, you will reach the stored medical alert information. Apple's IOS 8 operating system includes the facility for a mobile phone to contain the owner's medical emergency information.

Silicone bracelets, preprinted with a general medical condition or allergy, are also popular. The lack of personalization may be a deterrent. Recently patients have begun to "tattoo" their medical condition on their wrist or arm. Although a permanent tattoo might be considered, a temporary tattoo works as well. Other items include stick on tags that stick onto a driver's license, wallet, or cell phone which are practical for the person who does not want to carry something extra advertising their medical condition.

Another type of medical jewelry is a pendant or wrist strap containing a wireless alert button, also known as a panic button, worn in the home as part of a wireless medical alert system. This type of medical jewelry sends a signal to a dialing console which contacts a [[medical alarm]] monitoring service or directly dials first responders when an emergency occurs.

===Machine-readable devices===
Devices marked "ICE" which can hold a significant amount of data and are readable by a computer are sold, typically [[USB]] [[USB flash drive|flash drives]] with password-protected data entry providing [[File system permissions|read-only]] access to emergency medical data. However, it has been pointed out by a staff nurse with experience in trauma and critical care that such devices are worse than useless, at least in most situations in the UK, as medical computer systems are designed not to accept USB storage devices due to the risk of [[computer virus]]es. Additionally, there is no guarantee that ICE information even pertains to an unconscious person carrying it; using incorrect information can lead to patient harm and legal liability.

'''Medical transcription''', also known as '''MT''', is an [[allied health professions|allied health profession]] dealing with the process of transcribing voice-recorded medical reports that are dictated by physicians, nurses and other healthcare practitioners. Medical reports can be voice files, notes taken during a lecture, or other spoken material. These are dictated over the phone or uploaded digitally via the Internet or through smart phone apps.

== History ==
Medical records have been kept since humans began writing, as attested by ancient cave writings. Medical transcription as it is currently known has existed since the beginning of the 20th century, when standardization of medical data became critical to research.&lt;ref&gt;"From papyrus to the electronic tablet: a brief history of the clinical medical record with lessons for the digital age" Am J Med. 2013 Oct;126(10):853-7. do: 10.1016/j.amjmed.2013.03.024&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Kassell (ed.), with Michael Hawkins, Robert Alley and John Young, "History of medical record-keeping", Casebooks Project, http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/on-astrological-medicine/further-reading/history-of-medical-record-keeping, accessed 2015-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, medical stenographers replaced physicians as the recorders of medical information, taking doctors' dictation in shorthand. With the creation of audio recording devices, it became possible for physicians and their transcriptions to work asynchronously, thus beginning the profession of healthcare documentation as we currently know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahdionline.org/VisitorCenter/MTsPartnersInMedicalCommunication/tabid/242/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006143848/http://www.ahdionline.org/VisitorCenter/MTsPartnersInMedicalCommunication/tabid/242/Default.aspx |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, transcription equipment has changed from manual [[typewriter]]s to [[electric typewriter]]s to word processors to computers and from plastic disks and magnetic belts to cassettes and endless loops and digital recordings. Today, speech recognition (SR), also known as continuous speech recognition (CSR), is increasingly being used, with medical transcriptions and or "editors" providing supplemental editorial services, although there are occasional instances where SR fully replaces the MT. Natural-language processing takes "automatic" transcription a step further, providing an interpretive function that speech recognition alone does not provide (although Ms do).

In the past, these medical reports consisted of very abbreviated handwritten notes that were added in the patient's file for interpretation by the primary physician responsible for the treatment. Ultimately, this mess of handwritten notes and typed reports were consolidated into a single patient file and physically stored along with thousands of other patient records in a wall of filing cabinets in the medical records department. Whenever the need arose to review the records of a specific patient, the patient's file would be retrieved from the filing cabinet and delivered to the requesting physician. To enhance this manual process, many medical record documents were produced in duplicate or triplicate by means of carbon copy.

In recent years, medical records have changed considerably. Although many physicians and hospitals still maintain paper records, there is a drive for electronic records.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Feste, L., "Electronic Signature – As it is Today", Journal of AHIMA (Chicago: AHIMA 1993), Vol. 64, No. 4, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Filing cabinets are giving way to desktop computers connected to powerful servers, where patient records are processed and archived digitally. This digital format allows for immediate remote access by any physician who is authorized to review the patient information. Reports are stored electronically and printed selectively as the need arises. Many MTs now utilize personal computers with electronic references and use the Internet not only for web resources but also as a working platform. Technology has gotten so sophisticated that MT services and MT departments work closely with programmers and information systems (IS) staff to stream in voice and accomplish seamless data transfers through network interfaces. In fact, many healthcare providers today are enjoying the benefits of handheld PCs or personal data assistants (PDAs) and are now utilizing software on them.

== Overview ==

Medical transcription is part of the healthcare industry that renders and edits doctor dictated reports, procedures, and notes in an electronic format in order to create files representing the treatment history of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.totalmedtranscription.net/how-it-works/|title=How Medical Transcription Works|website=www.totalmedtranscription.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health practitioners dictate what they have done after performing procedures on patients and MT’s transcribe the oral dictation and/or edit reports that have gone through speech recognition software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Transcription FAQ|url=https://www.canscribe.com/courses/medical-transcription-healthcare-documentation-course/#1501109162126-4e502843-3822708b-54b9f1e3-4d23}} by CanScribe Online Career College&lt;/ref&gt;

Pertinent up-to-date, confidential patient information is converted to a written text document by a medical transcriptionist (MT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Medical Transcription?|url=http://www.accesstranscription.com.au/what-is-medical-transcription/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text may be printed and placed in the patient's record and/or retained only in its electronic format. Medical transcription can be performed by MTs who are employees in a [[hospital]] or who work at home as telecommuting employees for the [[hospital]]; by MTs working as telecommuting employees or independent contractors for an outsourced service that performs the work offsite under contract to a [[hospital]], clinic, physician group or other healthcare provider; or by MTs working directly for the providers of service (doctors or their group practices) either onsite or telecommuting as employees or contractors. Hospital facilities often prefer electronic storage of medical records due to the sheer volume of hospital patients and the accompanying paperwork. The electronic storage in their [[database]] gives immediate access to subsequent departments or providers regarding the patient's care to date, notation of previous or present medications, notification of [[allergy|allergies]], and establishes a history on the patient to facilitate [[healthcare]] delivery regardless of geographical distance or location.

The term transcript or "report" as it is more commonly called, is used as the name of the document (electronic or physical hard copy) which results from the medical transcription process, normally in reference to the healthcare professional's specific encounter with a patient on a specific date of service. This report is referred to by many as a "medical record". Each specific transcribed record or report, with its own specific date of service, is then merged and becomes part of the larger patient record commonly known as the patient's medical history. This record is often called the patient's chart in a hospital setting.

Medical transcription encompasses the MT, performing document typing and formatting functions according to an established criterion or format, transcribing the spoken word of the patient's care information into a written, easily readable form. MT requires correct spelling of all terms and words, (occasionally) correcting medical terminology or dictation errors. MTs also edit the transcribed documents, print or return the completed documents in a timely fashion. All transcription reports must comply with medico-legal concerns, policies and procedures, and laws under patient confidentiality.

In transcribing directly for a [[Physician|doctor]] or a group of [[physician]]s, there are specific formats and report types used, dependent on that doctor's speciality of practice, although history and physical exams or consults are mainly utilized. In most of the off-hospital sites, independent medical practices perform consultations as a second opinion, pre-surgical exams, and as IMEs (Independent Medical Examinations) for liability [[insurance]] or [[disability]] claims. Some private practice family doctors choose not to utilize a medical transcriptionist, preferring to keep their patient's records in a handwritten format, although this is not true of all family practitioners.

Currently, a growing number of medical providers send their dictation by digital voice files, utilizing a method of transcription called speech or voice recognition. Speech recognition is still a nascent technology that loses much in translation.&lt;ref&gt;"The Human Touch", by Elizabeth S. Roop, For the Record, Great Valley Publ. Co. Inc., July, 2015, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; For dictators to utilize the software, they must first train the program to recognize their spoken words. Dictation is read into the database and the program continuously "learns" the spoken words and phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicaltranscriptionist.org/job-description/|title=Medical Transcriptionist Job Description|work=The Medical Transcriptionist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor speech habits and other problems such as heavy foreign accents and mumbling complicate the process for both the MT and the recognition software. An MT can "flag" such a report as unintelligible, but the recognition software will transcribe the unintelligible word(s) from the existing database of "learned" language. The result is often a "word salad" or missing text. Thresholds can be set to reject a bad report and return it for standard dictation, but these settings are arbitrary. Below a set percentage rate, the word salad passes for actual dictation. The MT simultaneously listens, reads and "edits" the correct version. Every word must be confirmed in this process. The downside of the technology is when the time spent in this process cancels out the benefits. The quality of recognition can range from excellent to poor, with whole words and sentences missing from the report. Not infrequently, negative contractions and the word "not" is dropped altogether. These flaws trigger concerns that the present technology could have adverse effects on patient care. Control over quality can also be reduced when providers choose a server-based program from a vendor [[Application Service Provider]] (ASP).

Downward adjustments in MT pay rates for voice recognition are controversial. Understandably, a client will seek optimum savings to offset any net costs. Yet vendors that overstate the gains in productivity do harm to MTs paid by the line. Despite the new editing skills required of MTs, significant reductions in compensation for voice recognition have been reported. Reputable industry sources put the field average for increased productivity in the range of 30%-50%; yet this is still dependent on several other factors involved in the methodology. Metrics supplied by vendors that can be "used" in compensation decisions should be scientifically supported.

Operationally, speech recognition technology (SRT) is an interdependent, collaborative effort. It is a mistake to treat it as compatible with the same organizational paradigm as standard [[Dictation (exercise)|dictation]], a largely "[[:wikt:stand-alone|stand-alone]]" system. The new [[software]] supplants an MT's former ability to realize immediate time-savings from programming tools such as macros and other word/format expanders. Requests for client/vendor format corrections delay those savings. If remote MTs cancel each other out with disparate style choices, they and the recognition engine may be trapped in a seesaw battle over control. Voice recognition managers should take care to ensure that the impositions on MT autonomy are not so onerous as to outweigh its benefits.

Medical transcription is still the primary mechanism for a physician to clearly communicate with other healthcare providers who access the patient record, to advise them on the state of the patient's health and past/current treatment, and to assure continuity of care. More recently, following Federal and State Disability Act changes, a written report (IME) became a requirement for documentation of a medical bill or an application for Workers' Compensation (or continuation thereof) insurance benefits based on requirements of Federal and State agencies.

== As a profession ==

An individual who performs medical transcription is known as a ''medical transcriber'' (''MT'') or a ''Medical Language Specialist'' (''MLS''). The equipment used is called a ''medical transcriber,'' e.g., a cassette player with foot controls operated by the MT for report playback and transcription.

Education and training can be obtained through certificate or diploma programs, distance learning, and/or on-the-job training offered in some hospitals, although there are countries currently employing transcriptionists that require 18 months to 2 years of specialized MT training. Working in medical transcription leads to a mastery in medical terminology and editing, ability to listen and type simultaneously, utilization of playback controls on the transcriber (machine), and use of foot [[wikt: pedal|pedal]] to play and adjust dictations – all while maintaining a steady rhythm of execution. Medical transcription training normally includes coursework in medical terminology, anatomy, editing, grammar and punctuation, typing, medical record types and formats, and healthcare documentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestmedicaltranscriptiontraining.com/medical-transcription-training.html Medical Transcription Training Requirements], by Best Medical Transcription Training.com&lt;/ref&gt;

While medical transcription does not mandate registration or [[certification]], individual MTs may seek out registration/certification for personal or professional reasons. Obtaining a certificate from a medical transcription training program does not entitle an MT to use the title of Certified Medical Transcriptionist. A Certified Healthcare Documentation Specialist (CHDS) credential can be earned by passing a certification examination conducted solely by the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity (AHDI), formerly the American Association for Medical Transcription (AAMT), as the credentialing designation they created. AHDI also offers the credential of Registered Healthcare Documentation Specialist (RHDS). According to AHDI, RHDS is an entry-level credential while the CHDS is an advanced level. AHDI maintains a list of approved medical transcription schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090718204932/http://www.ahdionline.org/EducationTraining/Training/ApprovedMedicalTranscriptionEducationPrograms/tabid/251/Default.aspx Approved Medical Transcription Education Programs], by the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, certified medical transcriptionists earn more than their non-certified counterparts. It is also notable that training through an educational program that is approved by AHDI will increase the chances of an MT getting certified and getting hired.

There is a great degree of internal debate about which training program best prepares an MT for industry work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtexchange.com/medical-transcription-exchange/mt-school-wars/ The MT school wars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617191300/http://www.mtexchange.com/medical-transcription-exchange/mt-school-wars/ |date=2011-06-17 }}, by the  MT Exchange&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, whether one has learned medical transcription from an online course,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canscribe.com/ozescribe-answer-all-your-medical-transcription-questions/|title=Medical Transcription Training FAQ|work=CanScribe}}&lt;/ref&gt; community college, high school night course, or on-the-job training in a doctor's office or hospital, a knowledgeable MT is highly valued. In lieu of these AHDI certification credentials, MTs who can consistently and accurately transcribe multiple document work-types and return reports within a reasonable turnaround-time (TAT) are sought after. TATs set by the service provider or agreed to by the transcriptionist should be reasonable but consistent with the need to return the document to the patient's record in a timely manner.

While most medical transcription agencies prefer candidates with a minimum of one year experience, formal instruction is not a requirement, and there is no mandatory test. Some hospitals require nothing more than a diploma for employment as a medical transcriptionist. The average pay range for an in-house MT in a hospital setting is $8/hr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcriptionology.com/?page_id=253 |title=Entry level medical transcription jobs « |publisher=Transcriptionology.com |date=2012-04-05 |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, MT/HDS can expect to receive anywhere from $12-$19 an hour, depending if they are working in a union or non-union environment. This large gap is because the job is based on production, so the more an MT can produce, the more they can make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canscribe.com/ozescribe-answer-all-your-medical-transcription-questions/ |title=CanScribe Career College FAQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2006, the MT occupation became an eligible [[U.S. Department of Labor]] Apprenticeship, a 2-year program focusing on acute care facility (hospital) work. In May 2004, a pilot program for [[Vermont]] residents was initiated, with 737 applicants for only 20 classroom pilot-program openings. The objective was to train the applicants as MTs in a shorter time period. (See Vermont HITECH for pilot program established by the Federal Government Health and Human Services Commission).

== The medical transcription process ==

When the patient visits a doctor, the latter spends time with the former discussing his medical problems, including history and/or problems. The doctor performs a physical examination and may request various laboratory or diagnostic studies; will make a diagnosis or differential diagnoses, then decides on a plan of treatment for the patient, which is discussed and explained to the patient, with instructions provided. After the patient leaves the office, the doctor uses a voice-recording device to record the information about the patient encounter. This information may be recorded into a hand-held cassette recorder or into a regular telephone, dialed into a central server located in the hospital or transcription service office, which will 'hold' the report for the transcriptionist. This report is then accessed by a medical transcriptionist, it is clearly received as a voice file or cassette recording, who then listens to the dictation and transcribes it into the required format for the medical record, and of which this medical record is considered a legal document. The next time the patient visits the doctor, the doctor will call for the medical record or the patient's entire chart, which will contain all reports from previous encounters. The doctor can on occasion refill the patient's medications after seeing only the medical record, although doctors prefer to not refill prescriptions without seeing the patient to establish if anything has changed.

It is very important to have a properly formatted, edited, and reviewed medical transcription document. If a medical transcriptionist accidentally typed a wrong medication or the wrong diagnosis, the patient could be at risk if the doctor (or his designee) did not review the document for accuracy. Both the doctor and the medical transcriptionist play an important role to make sure the transcribed dictation is correct and accurate. The doctor should speak slowly and concisely, especially when dictating medications or details of diseases and conditions. The medical transcriptionist must possess hearing acuity, medical knowledge, and good reading comprehension in addition to checking references when in doubt.

However, some doctors do not review their transcribed reports for accuracy, and the computer attaches an electronic signature with the disclaimer that a report is "[[dictated but not read]]". This electronic signature is readily acceptable in a legal sense.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Executive Message", JAAMT, Vol. 12, No. 6, November–December 1993. pp. 4-5. Modesto, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcriptionist is bound to transcribe verbatim (exactly what is said) and make no changes, but has the option to flag any report inconsistencies. On some occasions, the doctors do not speak clearly, or voice files are garbled. Some doctors are, unfortunately, time-challenged and need to dictate their reports quickly (as in ER Reports). In addition, there are many regional or national accents and (mis)pronunciations of words the MT must contend with. It is imperative and a large part of the job of the Transcriptionist to look up the correct spelling of complex medical terms, medications, obvious dosage or dictation errors, and when in doubt should "flag" a report. A "flag" on a report requires the dictator (or his designee) to fill in a blank on a finished report, which has been returned to him, before it is considered complete. Transcriptionists are never, ever permitted to guess, or 'just put in anything' in a report transcription. Furthermore, medicine is constantly changing. New equipment, new medical devices, and new medications come on the market on a daily basis, and the Medical Transcriptionist needs to be creative and  to tenaciously research (quickly) to find these new words. An MT needs to have access to, or keep on memory, an up-to-date library to quickly facilitate the insertion of a correctly spelled device.

==Medical Transcription Editing==
Medical transcription editing is the process of listening to a voice-recorded file and comparing that to the transcribed report of that audio file, correcting errors as needed. Although speech recognition technology has become better at understanding human language, editing is still needed to ensure better accuracy. Medical transcription editing is also performed on medical reports transcribed by medical transcriptionists.

===Medical transcription editors===
Recent advances in speech recognition technology have shifted the job responsibilities of medical transcriptionists from not only transcribing but also editing. Editing has always been a part of the medical transcriptionist job, however now editing is a larger requirement as reports are more often being transcribed electronically. With different accents, articulations, and pronunciations, speech recognition technology can still have problems deciphering words. This is where the medical transcriptionist editor steps in. Medical transcription editors will compare and correct the transcribed file to the voice-recorded audio file. The job is similar to medical transcription as editing will use a foot pedal and the education and training requirements are mostly the same.

===Training/Education===
Education and training requirements for medical transcription editors is very similar to that of medical transcriptionists. Many medical transcription editors start out as medical transcriptionists and transition to editing. Several of the AHDI-approved medical transcription schools have seen the need for medical transcription editing training and have incorporated editing in their training programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestmedicaltranscriptiontraining.com/school-chart.html|title=Medical Transcription Schools|work=bestmedicaltranscriptiontraining.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality training will be the key to your success as a  Medical Transcription / Healthcare Documentation Specialist. It is also very important to get work experience while training to ensure employers will be willing to hire freshly graduated students. Students who receive 'real world' training are much better suited for the medical transcription industry, than those who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canscribe.com/courses/medical-transcription-healthcare-documentation-course/#1501109162126-4e502843-3822708b-54b9f1e3-4d23|title=CanScribe Career College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outsourcing of medical transcription ==
Due to the increasing demand to document medical records, countries have started to outsource the services of medical transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthworkscollective.com/reimbursementmd/71961/future-medical-transcription|title=The Future of Medical Transcription|work=healthworkscollective.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The global medical transcription services market was valued at USD 41.4&amp;nbsp;Billion in 2012 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6% from 2013 to 2019, to reach an estimated value of USD 60.6&amp;nbsp;Billion in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{url|http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pressrelease/medical-transcription-services-market.htm|Medical Transcription Services PRNewswire}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for outsourcing is stated to be the cost advantage due to cheap labor in developing countries, and their currency rates as compared to the U.S. dollar. Drivers that Influence Outsourcing to Medical Transcription Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitechtranscriptionservices.com/newsroom/drivers-influence-outsourcing-medical-transcription.php|title=Drivers that Influence Outsourcing of Medical Transcription|author=Champak Pol|date=13 December 2013|work=Newsroom – Hi-Tech Transcription Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a volatile controversy on whether medical transcription work should be outsourced, mainly due to three reasons:

# The greater majority of MTs presently work from home offices rather than in hospitals, working off-site for "national" transcription services. It is predominantly those nationals located in the United States who are striving to outsource work to other-than-US-based transcriptionists. In outsourcing work to sometimes lesser-qualified and lower-paid non-US MTs, the nationals unfortunately can force US transcriptionists to accept lower rates, at the risk of losing business altogether to the cheaper outsourcing providers.&lt;ref&gt;The Toronto Star " How did we create such bleak job prospects for Canada’s youth?" By: Neil Sandell Special to the Star, Published on Fri Nov 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the low line rates forced on US transcriptionists, US MTs are often paid as ICs ([[independent contractors]]); thus, the nationals save on employee insurance and benefits offered, etc.&lt;ref&gt;"Number Cruncher – Pawnshop chain emerges as small-cap gem", Shirley Won, The Globe and Mail, Thursday, Sep. 22, 2011 7:15 p.m. EDT&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, for the state of healthcare-related administrative costs in the United States, in outsourcing, the nationals still charge the hospitals the same rate as they did in the past for highly qualified US transcriptionists but subcontract the work to non-US MTs, keeping the difference as profit.
# There are concerns about patient privacy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/hospital-record-outsourcing-raises-privacy-safety-fears-1.1160193 Hospital-record outsourcing raises privacy, safety fears.

A professional in midwifery is known as a [[midwife]].

A 2013 [[Cochrane review]] concluded that "most women should be offered midwifery-led continuity models of care and women should be encouraged to ask for this option although caution should be exercised in applying this advice to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications."&lt;ref name="Sandall2013"/&gt;  The review found that midwifery-led care was associated with a reduction in the use of [[epidurals]], with fewer [[episiotomies]] or instrumental births, and a decreased risk of losing the baby before 24 weeks' gestation. However, midwifery-led care was also associated with a longer mean length of labor as measured in hours.&lt;ref name="Sandall2013"/&gt;

==Main areas of midwifery==
=== Pregnancy ===
{{Main article|Pregnancy|Prenatal care}}

==== First trimester ====
Trimester means "3 months." A normal pregnancy lasts about 9 months and has 3 trimesters.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus" /&gt;

First trimester screening varies by country. Women are typically offered a [[Pap smear]] and [[urine analysis]] (UA), and blood tests including a [[complete blood count]] (CBC), [[blood group|blood typing]] (including Rh screen), [[syphilis]], [[hepatitis]], [[HIV]], and [[rubella]] testing.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus" /&gt; Additionally, women may have [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] testing via a urine sample, and women considered at high risk are screened for [[Sickle Cell disease]] and [[Thalassemia]].&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus" /&gt; Women must consent to all tests before they are carried out. The woman's [[blood pressure]], height and weight are measured.  Her past pregnancies and family, social, and medical history are discussed.  Women may have an [[ultrasound]] scan during the first trimester which may be used to help find the [[Estimated date of confinement|estimated due date]].  Some women may have genetic testing, such as screening for [[Down's Syndrome]].  Diet, exercise, and discomforts such as [[morning sickness]] are discussed.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000544.htm | title=Prenatal care in your first trimester | publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | date=1 July 1015 | accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pregnancy trimesters.jpg|thumb|This image shows the progression of pregnancy over the three trimesters.]]

====Second trimester====
The mother visits the [[midwife]] monthly or more often during the second trimester.  The mother's partner and/or the labor coach may accompany her.  The [[midwife]] will discuss pregnancy issues such as fatigue, heartburn, varicose veins, and other common problems such as back pain.
Blood pressure and weight are monitored and the [[midwife]] measures the mother's abdomen to see if the baby is growing as expected.  Lab tests such as a UA, CBC, and [[glucose tolerance test]] are done if the [[midwife]] feels they are necessary.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000557.htm | title=Prenatal care in your second trimester | publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | date=1 July 2015 | accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third trimester====
In the third trimester the [[midwife]] will see the mother every two weeks until week 36 and every week after that.  Weight, blood pressure, and abdominal measurements will continue to be done.  Lab tests such as a CDC and UA may be done with additional testing done for at-risk pregnancies.  The [[midwife]] palpates the woman's abdomen to establish the lie, presentation and position of the fetus and later, the engagement. A pelvic exam may be done to see if the mother's cervix is dilating.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus3"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000558.htm | title=Prenatal care in your third trimester | publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | date=6 November 2014 | accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[midwife]] and the mother discuss birthing options and write a birth care plan.

=== Childbirth ===
==== Labor and delivery ====
[[File:Cephalicpre.JPG|thumb|An illustration of normal head-first presentation.  The membranes have ruptured and the cervix is fully dilated.]]
[[File:Geburt 01.jpg|thumb|Geburt 01|Newborn rests as caregiver checks breath sounds]]
{{Main article|Childbirth}}

Midwives are qualified to assist with a normal vaginal delivery while more complicated deliveries are handled by a health care provider who has had further training.  Childbirth is divided into four stages. 
 
:'''First stage of labor''' The first stage of labour involves the opening of the cervix.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewomens.org.au/health-information/pregnancy-and-birth/labour-birth/stages-of-labour/|title=Stages of Labour|last=|first=|date=|website=The women's: The Royal Women's Hospital|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early parts of this stage the cervix will become soft and thin thus preparing for the delivery of the baby.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first stage of labour is complete when the cervix has dilated the full 10cm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the first stage of labor the mother begins to feel strong and regular contractions that come every 5 to 20 minutes and last 30 to 60 seconds.  Contractions gradually become stronger, more frequent, and longer lasting.

:'''Second stage of labor''' During the second stage the baby begins to move down the birth canal.  As the baby moves to the opening of the vagina it "crowns", meaning the top of the head can be seen at the vaginal entrance. At one time an "episiotomy", (an incision in the tissue at the opening of the vagina) was done routinely because it was believed that it prevented excessive tearing and healed more readily than a natural tear.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic" /&gt;   However, more recent research shows that a surgical incision may be more extensive than a natural tear, and is more likely to contribute to later incontinence and pain during sex than a natural tear would have.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/episiotomy/ART-20047282?p=1 | title=Labor and delivery, postpartum care | publisher=Mayo Clinic | date=30 July 2015 | accessdate=15 August 2015 | author=Mayo Clinic staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The [[midwife]] assists the baby as needed and when fully emerged, cuts the umbilical cord.  If desired, the baby's father may cut the cord.  In the past the cord was cut shortly after birth, but there is growing evidence that delayed cord-cutting may benefit the infant.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus4"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://consumer.healthday.com/women-s-health-information-34/birth-health-news-61/delaying-umbilical-cord-clamping-might-boost-child-development-699710.html | title=Delaying Umbilical Cord Clamping Might Boost Child Development | last=Mozes | first= Alan | date=26 May 2015 | accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Third stage of labor'''   The third stage of labour is where the mother must deliver the [[placenta]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order for the mother to do this they may need to push. Just like the contractions in the first stage of labour they may experience one or two of these.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The midwife may assist the mother in delivering the placenta by gently pulling on the umbilical cord.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

:'''Fourth stage of labor'''  The fourth stage of labor is the period beginning immediately after the birth and extending for about six weeks.  The [[World Health Organization]] describes this period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/postnatal-care-recommendations/en/ | title=WHO recommendations on postnatal care of the mother and newborn | publisher=WHO | accessdate=22 December 2014 | author=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until recently babies were routinely removed from their mothers following birth, however beginning around 2000, some authorities began to suggest that early skin-to-skin contact (placing the naked baby on the mother's chest) is of benefit to both mother and infant. As of 2014, early skin-to-skin contact is endorsed by all major organizations that are responsible for the well-being of infants.&lt;ref name="Medscape"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/806325_9 | title=Uninterrupted Skin-to-Skin Contact Immediately After Birth | publisher=Medscape | accessdate=21 December 2014 | author=Phillips, Raylene}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, to help establish bonding and successful breastfeeding, the midwife carries out immediate mother and infant assessments as the infant lies on the mother's chest and removes the infant for further observations only after they have had their first breastfeed.

Following the birth, if the mother had an [[episiotomy]] or a tearing of the [[perineum]], it is stitched. The [[midwife]] does regular assessments for uterine contraction, [[fundal height]],&lt;ref name="Maternal-Newborn Care"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atitesting.com/ati_next_gen/skillsmodules/content/maternal-newborn/equipment/postpart_assessment.html | title=Postpartum Assessment | publisher=ATI Nursing Education | accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vaginal bleeding.&lt;ref name="Labor and Delivery:  Postpartum Care"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/labor-and-delivery/in-depth/postpartum-care/art-20047233 | title=Postpartum care: What to expect after a vaginal delivery | publisher=Mayo Clinic | accessdate=23 December 2014 | author=Mayo clinic staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout labor and delivery the mother's [[vital signs]] (temperature, blood pressure, and pulse) are closely monitored and her fluid intake and output are measured. The [[midwife]] also monitors the baby's pulse rate, palpates the mother's abdomen to monitor the baby's position, and does vaginal checks as needed.  If the birth deviates from the norm at any stage, the [[midwife]] requests assist from a more highly trained health care provider.

==== Birthing positions ====
{{Main article|Childbirth positions}}

Until the last century most women have used both the upright position and alternative positions to give birth.  The [[lithotomy position]] was not used until the advent of forceps in the seventeenth century and since then childbirth has progressively moved from a woman supported experience in the home to a medical intervention within the hospital.
There are significant advantages to assuming an upright position in labor and birth, such as stronger and more efficient uterine contractions aiding cervical dilatation, increased pelvic inlet and outlet diameters and improved uterine contractility.&lt;ref name="Factors influencing maternal positions during labor"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.instituteofmidwifery.org/MSFinalProj.nsf/a9ee58d7a82396768525684f0056be8d/45f9de25c6ca395e85257715003dad3f?OpenDocument | title=Factors influencing maternal positions during labor | date=April 2010 | accessdate=10 August 2015 | author=Searle, Lorraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upright positions in the second stage include sitting, squatting, kneeling, and being on hands and knees.&lt;ref name="Gelis122-134"&gt;Gelis, Jacues. History of Childbirth. Boston: Northern University Press, 1991: 122-134&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postpartum period===
{{Main article|Postpartum period}}

For women who have a hospital birth, the minimum hospital stay is six hours. Women who leave before this do so against medical advice. Women may choose when to leave the hospital. Full postnatal assessments are conducted daily whilst inpatient, or more frequently if needed. A postnatal assessment includes the woman's observations, general well being, breasts (either a discussion and assistance with breastfeeding or a discussion about lactation suppression), abdominal palpation (if she has not had a caesarean section) to check for involution of the uterus, or a check of her caesarean wound (the dressing doesn't need to be removed for this), a check of her perineum, particularly if she tore or had stitches, reviewing her lochia, ensuring she has passed urine and had her bowels open and checking for signs and symptoms of a DVT. The baby is also checked for jaundice, signs of adequate feeding, or other concerns. The baby has a nursery exam between six and seventy two hours of birth to check for conditions such as heart defects, hip problems, or eye problems.

In the community, the community midwife sees the woman at least until day ten. This does not mean she sees the woman and baby daily, but she cannot discharge them from her care until day ten at the earliest. Postnatal checks include neonatal screening test (NST, or heel prick test) around day five. The baby is weighed and the [[midwife]] plans visits according to the health and needs of mother and baby. They are discharged to the care of the health visitor.

===Care of the newborn===
{{Further information|Newborn}}

At birth, the baby receives an [[Apgar score]] at, at the least, one minute and five minutes of age. This is a score out of 10 that assesses the baby on five different areas—each worth between 0 and 2 points. These areas are: colour, respiratory effort, tone, heart rate, and response to stimuli. The [[midwife]] checks the baby for any obvious problems, weighs the baby, and measure head circumference. The [[midwife]] ensures the cord has been clamped securely and the baby has the appropriate name tags on (if in hospital). Babies lengths are not routinely measured. The [[midwife]] performs these checks as close to the mother as possible and returns the baby to the mother quickly. Skin-to-skin is encouraged, as this regulates the baby's heart rate, breathing, oxygen saturation, and temperature—and promotes bonding and breastfeeding.

In some countries, such as Chile, the midwife is the professional who can direct neonatal intensive care units. This is an advantage for these professionals, because this professionals can use the knowledge in perinatology to bring a high quality care of the newborn, with medical or surgical conditions.

Midwifery-led continuity of care is where one or more midwives have the primary responsibility for the [[continuity of care]] for childbearing women, with a multidisciplinary network of consultation and referral with other health care providers. This is different from "medical-led care" where an obstetrician or family physician is primarily responsible. In "shared-care" models, responsibility may be shared between a [[midwife]], an obstetrician and/or a family physician.&lt;ref name=Sandall2013&gt;Sandall J et al.  Midwife-led continuity models versus other models of care for childbearing women. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Aug 21;8:CD004667. {{doi|10.1002/14651858.CD004667.pub3}}. {{PMID|23963739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The midwife plays a very unique role is part of very intimate situations with the mother. For this reason, many say that the most important thing to look for in a midwife is comfortability with them, as one will go to them with every question or problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20101005/30273|title=The midwife: Your best friend in natal care|date=2010-10-05|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Cochrane review]] of public health systems in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, "most women should be offered midwifery-led continuity models of care and women should be encouraged to ask for this option although caution should be exercised in applying this advice to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications."  Midwifery-led care has effects including the following:&lt;ref name=Sandall2013/&gt;
*a reduction in the use of epidurals, with fewer episiotomies or instrumental births. 
*a longer mean length of labour as measured in hours
*increased chances of being cared for in labour by a [[midwife]] known by the childbearing woman
*increased chances of having a spontaneous vaginal birth 
*decreased risk of preterm birth
*decreased risk of losing the baby before 24 weeks' gestation, although there appears to be no differences in the risk of losing the baby after 24 weeks or overall
There was no difference in the number of [[Caesarean section]]s. All trials in the Cochrane review included licensed midwives, and none included lay or traditional midwives. Also, no trial included out of hospital birth.&lt;ref name=Sandall2013/&gt;

==History==
===Ancient history===
[[File:Eucharius Rößlin Rosgarten Childbirth.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A woman giving birth on a birth chair, from a work by German physician [[Eucharius Rößlin]]]]
[[File:Рождество-Богородицы-Ростов-XVII crop.jpg|thumbnail|Icon Birth of Mary (detail). Russia, 17th century]]

In [[ancient Egypt]], midwifery was a recognized female occupation, as attested by the [[Ebers Papyrus]] which dates from 1900 to 1550 BCE. Five columns of this papyrus deal with [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics and gynecology]], especially concerning the acceleration of parturition (the action or process of giving birth to offspring) and the birth prognosis of the newborn. The [[Westcar Papyrus|Westcar papyrus]], dated to 1700 BCE, includes instructions for calculating the expected date of confinement and describes different styles of birth chairs. Bas reliefs in the royal birth rooms at Luxor and other temples also attest to the heavy presence of midwifery in this culture.&lt;ref name="TowlerBramall-9"&gt;Jean Towler and Joan Bramall, ''Midwives in History and Society'' (London: Croom Helm, 1986), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwifery in [[Greco-Roman]] antiquity covered a wide range of women, including old women who continued folk medical traditions in the villages of the [[Roman Empire]], trained midwives who garnered their knowledge from a variety of sources, and highly trained women who were considered physicians.&lt;ref name="Flemming-359"&gt;Rebecca Flemming, ''Medicine and the Making of Roman Women'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2000), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were certain characteristics desired in a “good” [[midwife]], as described by the physician [[Soranus of Ephesus]] in the 2nd century. He states in his work, ''Gynecology'', that “a suitable person will be literate, with her wits about her, possessed of a good memory, loving work, respectable and generally not unduly handicapped as regards her senses [i.e., sight, smell, hearing], sound of limb, robust, and, according to some people, endowed with long slim fingers and short nails at her fingertips.” Soranus also recommends that the [[midwife]] be of sympathetic disposition (although she need not have borne a child herself) and that she keep her hands soft for the comfort of both mother and child.&lt;ref name="French-69-84"&gt;Valerie French, “Midwives and Maternity Care in the Roman World” (Helios, New Series 12(2), 1986), pp. 69-84&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], another physician from this time, valued nobility and a quiet and inconspicuous disposition in a [[midwife]].&lt;ref name="Jackson-97"&gt;Ralph Jackson, ''Doctors and Diseases in the Roman Empire'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1988), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;  There appears to have been three “grades” of midwives present:   The first was technically proficient; the second may have read some of the texts on obstetrics and gynecology; but the third was highly trained and reasonably considered a [[medical specialist]] with a concentration in midwifery.&lt;ref name="Jackson-97" /&gt;

[[Agnodice]] or Agnodike (Gr. Ἀγνοδίκη) was the earliest historical, and likely apocryphal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/antiqua/women.cfm |title=Women in Medicine |publisher=www.hsl.virginia.edu |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[midwife]] mentioned among the ancient Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Greenhill  | first = William Alexander  | author-link =   | contribution = Agnodice  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | page = 74  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0083.html  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwives were known by many different titles in antiquity, ranging from ''iatrinē'' (Gr. [[nurse]]), ''maia'' (Gr., midwife), ''obstetrix'' (Lat., [[obstetrician]]), and ''medica'' (Lat., [[physician|doctor]]).&lt;ref name="Flemming-421-424"&gt;Rebecca Flemming, Medicine and the Making of Roman Women (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 421-424&lt;/ref&gt; It appears as though midwifery was treated differently in the Eastern end of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]] as opposed to the West. In the East, some women advanced beyond the profession of [[midwife]] (''maia'') to that of gynaecologist (''iatros gynaikeios'', translated as ''women's doctor''), for which formal training was required. Also, there were some gynecological tracts circulating in the medical and educated circles of the East that were written by women with Greek names, although these women were few in number. Based on these facts, it would appear that midwifery in the East was a respectable profession in which respectable women could earn their livelihoods and enough esteem to publish works read and cited by male physicians. In fact, a number of Roman legal provisions strongly suggest that midwives enjoyed status and remuneration comparable to that of male doctors.&lt;ref name="French-69-84" /&gt; One example of such a [[midwife]] is [[Salpe|Salpe of Lemnos]], who wrote on women’s diseases and was mentioned several times in the works of Pliny.&lt;ref name="Jackson-97" /&gt;

[[File:Ancient Roman relief carving of a midwife Wellcome M0003964.jpg|thumb|Ancient Roman relief carving of a [[midwife]]]]

However, in the Roman West, information about practicing midwives comes mainly from funerary epitaphs. Two hypotheses are suggested by looking at a small sample of these epitaphs. The first is the midwifery was not a profession to which freeborn women of families that had enjoyed free status of several generations were attracted; therefore it seems that most midwives were of servile origin. Second, since most of these funeral epitaphs describe the women as freed, it can be proposed that midwives were generally valued enough, and earned enough income, to be able to gain their freedom. It is not known from these epitaphs how certain slave women were selected for training as midwives. [[Slave]] girls may have been apprenticed, and it is most likely that mothers taught their daughters.&lt;ref name="French-69-84" /&gt;

The actual duties of the [[midwife]] in antiquity consisted mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the [[midwife]] would call for the assistance of a [[physician]] when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the [[midwife]] brought along two or three assistants.&lt;ref name="Towler-Bramall-12"&gt;Towler and Bramall, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the baby would be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her.&lt;ref name="French-69-84" /&gt; The [[midwife]] sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards on the top of the mother's abdomen.

Finally, the [[midwife]] received the infant, placed it in pieces of cloth, cut the [[umbilical cord]], and cleansed the baby.&lt;ref name="Jackson-97" /&gt; The child was sprinkled with “fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre” to soak up the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put [[olive oil]] in the baby’s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the [[midwife]] made the initial call on whether or not an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for [[Congenital disorder|congenital deformities]] and testing its cry to hear whether or not it was robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant’s survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.&lt;ref name="French-69-84" /&gt;

A 2nd-century terracotta relief from the Ostian tomb of Scribonia Attice, wife of physician-surgeon M. Ulpius Amerimnus, details a childbirth scene. Scribonia was a [[midwife]] and the relief shows her in the midst of a delivery. A patient sits in the birth chair, gripping the handles and the [[midwife]]’s assistant stands behind her providing support. Scribonia sits on a low stool in front of the woman, modestly looking away while also assisting the delivery by dilating and massaging the vagina, as encouraged by Soranus.&lt;ref name="Jackson-97" /&gt;

The services of a [[midwife]] were not inexpensive; this fact that suggests poorer women who could not afford the services of a professional [[midwife]] often had to make do with female relatives. Many wealthier families had their own midwives. However, the vast majority of women in the Greco-Roman world very likely received their maternity care from hired midwives. They may have been highly trained or possessed only a rudimentary knowledge of obstetrics. Also, many families had a choice of whether or not they wanted to employ a [[midwife]] who practiced the [[traditional medicine|traditional folk medicine]] or the newer methods of professional parturition.&lt;ref name="French-69-84" /&gt; Like a lot of other factors in antiquity, quality gynecological care often depended heavily on the socioeconomic status of the patient.

&lt;ref&gt;Medical practitioners were subjected to more regulation in the Middle Ages, especially women that had not received proper schooling in their desired medical fields. Although the medical field was becoming a male monopoly with these regulations, midwifery was still dominated by women, as men had not had schooling or education in obstetrics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minkowski"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=W L|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=February 1992|volume=82|issue=2|pages=292–293|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288|pmc=1694293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
From the 18th century, a conflict between [[surgeon]]s and midwives arose, as medical men began to assert that their modern scientific techniques were better for mothers and infants than the [[folk medicine]] practiced by midwives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Van Teijlingen | first1 = Edwin R. | last2 = Lowis | first2 = George W. |last3 = McCaffery |first3 = Peter G. | title = Midwifery and the Medicalization of Childbirth: Comparative Perspectives | location = | publisher = Nova Publishers | pages = | date = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2DHrH08bl5YC | isbn = 9781594540318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Borst | first1 = Charlotte G. | title = Catching Babies: The Professionalization of Childbirth, 1870-1920 | location = | publisher = Harvard University Press | pages = | date = 1995 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=35q762L0IzMC | isbn = 9780674102620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Europe and Russia the situation was a little easier - in Imperial Russia at the Duchy of Estonia, Professor Christian Friedrich Deutsch established a midwifery school for women at the [[University of Dorpat]] in 1811, which existed until World War I. It was the predecessor for the [[Tartu Health Care College]]. Training lasted for 7 months and in the end a certificate for practice was issued to the female students.

Women began to feel safer in the setting of the hospitals with the amount of aid and the ease of birth that they experienced with doctors. “Physicians trained in the new century found a great contrast between their hospital and obstetrics practice in women’s homes where they could not maintain sterile conditions or have trained help.”&lt;ref name="Brought to Bed"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leavitt|first=Judith W.|title=Brought to Bed: Childbearing in America, 1750-1950|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Book|isbn=978-0195056907|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; German [[Social sciences|social scientists]] [[Gunnar Heinsohn]] and Otto Steiger theorize that midwifery became a target of persecution and repression by public authorities because midwives possessed highly specialized knowledge and skills regarding not only assisting birth, but also contraception and abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Heinsohn/Otto Steiger: "Witchcraft, Population Catastrophe and Economic Crisis in Renaissance Europe: An Alternative Macroeconomic Explanation.", [[University of Bremen]] 2004 [https://www.scribd.com/doc/54474527 (download)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; {{cite journal |first=Gunnar |last=Heinsohn |first2=Otto |last2=Steiger |title=The Elimination of Medieval Birth Control and the [[Witch trial|Witch Trials]] of Modern Times |journal=International Journal of Women's Studies |volume=3 |date=May 1982 |issue= |pages=193–214 |doi= }} {{cite journal |first=Gunnar |last=Heinsohn |first2=Otto |last2=Steiger |title=Birth Control: The Political-Economic Rationale Behind Jean Bodin's 'Démonomanie' |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=423–448 |doi=10.1215/00182702-31-3-423 |pmid=21275210 |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary====
At late 20th century, midwives were already recognized as highly trained and specialized professionals in obstetrics. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, the medical perception of pregnancy and childbirth as potentially pathological and dangerous still dominates Western culture. Midwives who work in hospital settings also have been influenced by this view, although by and large they are trained to view birth as a normal and healthy process. While midwives play a much larger role in the care of pregnant mothers in Europe than in America, the medicalized model of birth still has influence in those countries, even though the World Health Organization recommends a natural, normal and humanized birth.&lt;ref name="Fortaleza declaration"&gt;{{cite web|title= Fortaleza Declaration: Appropriate Use of Technology for Birth |url=http://www.weikert.de/alexandra/who1.html |publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The midwifery model of pregnancy and childbirth as a normal and healthy process plays a much larger role in Sweden and the Netherlands than the rest of Europe, however. Swedish midwives stand out, since they administer 80 percent of prenatal care and more than 80 percent of family planning services in Sweden. Midwives in Sweden attend all normal births in public hospitals and Swedish women tend to have fewer interventions in hospitals than American women. The Dutch infant mortality rate in 1992 was the tenth-lowest rate in the world, at 6.3 deaths per thousand births, while the United States ranked twenty-second. Midwives in the Netherlands and Sweden owe a great deal of their success to supportive government policies.&lt;ref name="Lingo 2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3402800303.html	|last= Lingo |first=Alison Klairmont |authorlink=Alison Klairmont	|title=Obstetrics and Midwifery § Midwifery from 1900 to the Present	|work=Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society	|date=2004	|publisher=Gale	|place=Farmington Hills, MI	|accessdate=June 28, 2015|postscript=none}}, from ''Encyclopedia.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4889">The '''Multi-barrier approach''' is a key paradigm for ensuring safe [[drinking water]] in jurisdictions such as [[Ontario]], elsewhere in Canada, and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;Ministry for the Environment, [http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/rma/nes-draft-sources-human-drinking-water/html/page1.html Draft Users' Guide: National Environmental Standard for Sources of Human Drinking Water], Accessed 11-Aug-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as,&lt;ref&gt;Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Drinking Water &amp; Water Quality Task Group (2002), [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/water-eau/tap-source-robinet/tap-source-robinet-eng.pdf From Source To Tap - The Multi-Barrier Approach To Safe Drinking Water], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;An integrated system of procedures, processes and tools that collectively prevent or reduce the contamination of drinking water from source to tap in order to reduce risks to public health.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Part 2 of his report on the [[Walkerton Tragedy]], Justice [[Dennis O'Connor (judge)|Dennis O'Connor]] discusses five elements of the multi-barrier approach:&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Hon. Dennis R. (2002), [http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/about/pubs/walkerton/part2/ ''Part 2: Report of the Walkerton Inquiry: Strategy for Safe Drinking Water''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122020206/http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/about/pubs/walkerton/part2/ |date=2010-01-22 }}, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[Source water protection]]—Taking action to minimize adverse impacts on source waters reduces the risk from pathogens and chemical pollutants in that water, and can also reduce the degree of treatment required.
# Robust [[water treatment]]—Having treatment trains with more than one step provides redundancy against treatment failure.
# A secure [[water supply network]]—Providing a disinfectant residual to the extreme points of the distribution system protects against water quality degradation and microbial intrusion.
# Monitoring programs—Monitoring water quality at each of the above points (source, treatment plant, and tap) allows the treatment process to be adjusted to deal with fluctuations in water quality and ensures that the drinking water is safe at the point of human consumption.
# Prepared responses to adverse conditions—Having response plans (for example, issuing a [[boil-water advisory]]) in place provides a final barrier to protect the public if harmful contaminants should make it through the other barriers.

The holistic perspective of the multi-barrier approach also incorporates many players into the goal of keeping drinking water safe. These include managers, researchers, regulators, legislators, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment |url=http://www.ccme.ca/sourcetotap/mba.html |title=Multi-Barrier Approach |accessdate=10 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716030951/http://www.ccme.ca/sourcetotap/mba.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natural childbirth''' is [[childbirth]] without routine medical interventions, particularly [[anesthesia]]. Natural childbirth arose in opposition to the techno-medical model of childbirth that has recently gained popularity in industrialized societies. Natural childbirth attempts to minimize medical intervention, particularly the use of anesthetic medications and surgical interventions such as [[episiotomies]], forceps and [[ventouse]] deliveries and [[caesarean section]]s. Natural childbirth may occur during a physician or midwife attended [[hospital birth]], a midwife attended homebirth, or an unassisted birth. The term "natural childbirth" was coined by obstetrician [[Grantly Dick-Read]] upon publication of his book ''Natural Childbirth'' in the 1930s, which was followed by the 1942 ''Childbirth Without Fear''.

==History==
Historically, most women gave birth at home without emergency medical care available. The "natural" rate of maternal mortality—meaning without surgical or pharmaceutical intervention—has been estimated at 1,500 per 100,000 births. In the United States circa 1900, before the introduction and improvement of modern medical technologies, there were about 700 maternal deaths per 100,000 births (.7%).&lt;ref name="vanlerberghe"&gt;Van Lerberghe W, De Brouwere V. ''Of blind alleys and things that have worked: history’s lessons on reducing maternal mortality.'' In: De Brouwere V, Van Lerberghe W, eds. ''Safe motherhood strategies: a review of the evidence''. Antwerp, ITG Press, 2001 (Studies in Health Services Organisation and Policy, 17:7–33).  "Where nothing effective is done to avert maternal death, “natural” mortality is probably of the order of magnitude of 1,500/100,000...In the USA of 1900, for example, there were about 700 maternal deaths for 100,000 births"&lt;/ref&gt;

At the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], giving birth at home became more difficult due to congested living spaces and dirty living conditions. This drove urban and lower class women to newly available hospitals, while wealthy and middle-class women continued to labor at home.&lt;ref name=Cassidy&gt;{{cite book|last = Cassidy|first = Tina|title =  Birth|publisher= Atlantic Monthly Press|location= New York|year= 2006|pages = 54–55 |isbn = 0-87113-938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s there was an increasing availability of hospitals, and more women began going into the hospital for labor and delivery. In the United States, the middle classes were especially receptive to the medicalization of childbirth, which promised a safer and less painful labor.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite journal |year = 2005 |title =  Consumer Risk Perceptions in a Community of Reflexive Doubt |journal = Journal of Consumer Research|volume = 32|pages = 235–248 |doi =  10.1086/432233 |author =  Thompson, Craig J. |authormask = Thompson, C.J. |issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to birth without pain was part of the early feminist movement.{{ref|Cassidy}} The use of childbirth drugs began in 1847 when Scottish obstetrician [[James Young Simpson]] introduced chloroform as an anesthetic during labor, but only the most rich and powerful women (such as [[Queen Victoria]]) had access. In the late 1800s, feminists in the United States and United Kingdom began to demand drugs for pain relief during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Downe2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Downe|title=Normal Childbirth: Evidence and Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1F0tPKzgSAC&amp;pg=PA37|date=30 May 2008|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-7020-3792-3|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "natural childbirth" was coined by obstetrician [[Grantly Dick-Read]] upon publication of his book ''Natural Childbirth'' in the 1930s. In 1942 [[Grantly Dick-Read]] published ''Revelation of Childbirth'' (which was later retitled ''Childbirth without Fear''), advocating natural childbirth, which became an international bestseller. The [[Lamaze method]] of natural childbirth gained popularity in the United States after Marjorie Karmel wrote about her experiences in her 1959 book ''Thank You, Dr. Lamaze'', and with the formation of the American Society for Psychoprophylaxis in Obstetrics (currently [[Lamaze International]]) by Marjorie Karmel and [[Elisabeth Bing]]. Later, physicians [[Michel Odent]] and [[Frederick Leboyer]] and midwives such as [[Ina May Gaskin]] promoted [[birthing center]]s, [[water birth]], and [[homebirth]] as alternatives to the hospital model. The [[Bradley method of natural childbirth]] (also known as "husband-coached childbirth"), a method of natural childbirth developed in 1947 by Robert A. Bradley, M.D., was popularized by his book ''Husband-Coached Childbirth'', first published in 1965.

==Psychological aspects==
Many women consider natural birth empowering.&lt;ref&gt;''Having a Great Birth in Australia'', [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], Australian College of Midwives, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn immediately after birth is beneficial for both mother and baby.  A review done by the [[World Health Organization]] found that skin-to-skin contact between mothers and babies after birth reduces crying, improves mother-infant interaction, and helps mothers to breastfeed successfully. They recommend that [[neonates]] be allowed to bond with the mother during their first two hours after birth, the period that they tend to be more alert than in the following hours of early life.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.who.int/rhl/newborn/gpcom/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives to intervention==
Instead of medical interventions, a variety of non-invasive methods are employed during natural childbirth to ease the mother's pain. Many of these techniques stress the importance of "a mind-body connection," which the techno-medical model of birth does not. These techniques include [[hydrotherapy]], [[massage]], [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]] therapy, [[hypnosis]], [[breath]]ing exercises, acupressure for labor, [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] (TENS), [[Speech production|vocalization]], [[Mental image|visualization]], [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] and [[water birth]]. Other approaches include movement, walking, and different positions (for example, using a [[birthing ball]]), hot and cold therapy (for example, using hot compresses and/or cold packs), and receiving one-on-one labor support like that provided by a [[midwife]] or [[doula]]. However, natural childbirth proponents maintain that pain is a natural and necessary part of the labor process, and should not automatically be regarded as entirely negative. In contrast to the pain of injury and disease, they believe that the pain of childbirth is a sign that the female body is functioning as it is meant to.

Birth positions favored in natural childbirth—including [[Squatting position|squatting]], hands and knees, or suspension in water—contrast with the [[lithotomy position]] (woman in hospital bed on her back with legs in stirrups), which has consistently been shown to slow and complicate labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis-Floyd|first=Robbie|title=Birth as an American Rite of Passage|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-22932-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to reduce tearing during natural childbirth (instead of an [[episiotomy]]) include managing the [[perineum]] with counter-pressure,&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web |author = World Health Organization|year =1997 |title = Care in normal birth: A practical guide|url = http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/MSM_96_24/MSM_96_24_chapter4.en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; hot compresses, and pushing the baby out slowly.

==Preparation==
Some women take birth education classes such as [[Lamaze]] or the [[Bradley method of natural childbirth|Bradley Method]] to prepare for a natural childbirth. Several books are also available with information to help women prepare. A midwife or [[doula]] may include preparation for a natural birth as part of the prenatal care services. However, a  study published in 2009 suggests that preparation alone is not enough to ensure an intervention-free outcome.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122394587/HTMLSTART?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence of medical intervention in the U.S.==
In the U.S in 2007: 93% of mothers used [[cardiotocography|electronic fetal monitoring]]; 63% used
[[epidural]]s; 55% had their [[rupture of membranes|membranes ruptured]]; 53% received [[oxytocin]] to stimulate labor progress; and 52% received [[episiotomy|episiotomies]].&lt;ref name=Gissespie&gt;{{cite web |author=Gissespie, M., Strauss, M |year = 2007 |title = What Women Aren’t Told about Childbirth |url = http://www.alternet.org/story/65608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Some studies argue that the push towards 'natural childbirth' in [[Developed countries|Western countries]] is exaggerated, and can harm women.&lt;ref&gt;''Articles'':

{{about|Nutrients|Nutrition in humans|Human nutrition|Nutrition in animals|Animal nutrition|Nutrition in plants|Plant nutrition}}
A '''nutrient''' is a [[Chemical substance|substance]] used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [[metabolism|metabolic purposes]] or [[excretion|excreted]] by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [[hair]], [[scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[feather]]s, or [[exoskeleton]]s. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and [[fermentation]] products ([[ethanol]] or [[vinegar]]), leading to end-products of water and [[carbon dioxide]]. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [[amino acid]]s that are combined to create [[protein]]s, a subset of [[fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and certain [[mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. [[fungus|Fungi]] live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.

Different types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([[vitamin C]]) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [[organic compound|organic]] or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [[iron]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]], while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.

A classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] and [[micronutrient]]s. Consumed in relatively large amounts ([[gram]]s or [[ounce]]s), macronutrients ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([[milligram]]s or [[microgram]]s); they have subtle [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] roles in cellular processes, like [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular functions]] or [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes, such as the United States [[Dietary Reference Intake]], are based on deficiency outcomes{{clarify|date=January 2018}} and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and [[Tolerable upper intake levels|upper limits]] of intake. In many countries, macronutrients and micronutrients in significant content{{clarify|date=January 2018}} are required by regulations to be displayed on food product labels. Nutrients in larger quantities than the body needs may have harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Audrey H. Ensminger|title=Foods &amp; nutrition encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XMA9gYIj-C4C&amp;pg=PA527|accessdate=12 October 2010|year=1994|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-8980-1|pages=527–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edible plants also contain thousands of compounds generally called [[phytochemical]]s which have unknown effects on disease or health, including a diverse class with non-nutrient status called [[polyphenol]]s, which remain poorly understood as of 2017.

Plant nutrients consist of more than a dozen minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed or released through leaves. All organisms obtain all their nutrients from the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=WhitneyRolfes2005&gt;Whitney, Elanor and Sharon Rolfes. 2005. ''Understanding Nutrition, 10th edition'', p. 6.

==Plant nutrition==
{{main|Plant nutrition|Fertilizer}}
Plants absorb carbon, hydrogen and oxygen from air. These three, in the form of water and [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Jones1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

Counting these, there are 17 important nutrients for plants:&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Allen V. Barker|author2=D. J.

In addition to carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulfur]] are also needed in relatively large quantities. Together, the "Big Six" are the elemental '''macronutrients''' for all [[biological life|organisms]].&lt;ref name=wsj20101203&gt;
[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703377504575650840897300342?mod=ITP_pageone_1#printMode New Link in Chain of Life], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 2010-12-03, accessed 2010-12-05. "Until now, however, they were all thought to share the same biochemistry, based on the Big Six, to build proteins, fats and DNA."&lt;/ref&gt;
They are sourced from inorganic matter (for example, [[carbon dioxide]], [[water]], [[nitrate]]s, [[phosphate]]s, [[sulfate]]s, and [[diatomic molecule]]s of nitrogen and, especially, oxygen) and organic matter ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s).

==Types of nutrients==
{{main|Nutrition}}

===Macronutrients===
Macronutrients are defined in several ways.&lt;ref name="Kern2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Kern|title=CRC desk reference on sports  nutrition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOYqeeXWomwC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=12 October 2010|date=12 May 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-2273-0|pages=117–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[chemical element]]s humans consume in the largest quantities are [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulphur]], summarized as [[CHNOPS]].
* The chemical compounds that humans consume in the largest quantities and provide bulk energy are classified as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[fat]]s. Water must be also consumed in large quantities.
* [[Calcium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[chloride]] ions, along with phosphorus and sulfur, are listed with [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] because they are required in large quantities compared to [[micronutrient]]s, i.e., vitamins and other minerals, the latter often described as trace or ultratrace minerals.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Macronutrients provide energy:

* [[Carbohydrate]]s are compounds made up of types of [[sugar]]. Carbohydrates are classified according to their number of sugar units: [[monosaccharide]]s (such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]), [[disaccharide]]s (such as [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]), [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s (such as [[starch]], [[glycogen]], and [[cellulose]]).
* [[Protein]]s are [[organic compound]]s that consist of [[amino acid]]s joined by [[peptide bond]]s. Since the body cannot manufacture some of the [[amino acid]]s (termed [[essential amino acid]]s), the diet must supply them. Through digestion, [[protein]]s are [[protein catabolism|broken down]] by [[protease]]s back into free amino acids.
* [[Fat]]s consist of a [[glycerin]] molecule with three [[fatty acid]]s attached. Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched [[hydrocarbon]] chains connected by single bonds alone ([[Saturated fat|saturated fatty acids]]) or by both double and single bonds ([[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]]). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of [[cell membrane]]s, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed [[essential fatty acid]]s), they must be obtained through one's diet.

Fat has an [[energy]] content of 9{{nbsp}}[[kcal]]/g (~37.7 kJ/g) and proteins and carbohydrates 4{{nbsp}}kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Micronutrients===
Micronutrients support metabolism.

* [[Dietary mineral]]s are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron. Some of these minerals are essential to human metabolism.
* [[Vitamin]]s are organic compounds essential to the body. They usually act as [[coenzyme]]s or [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for various proteins in the body.

== Essentiality ==

=== Essential nutrients ===
An '''essential nutrient''' is a nutrient required for normal physiological function that cannot be synthesized in the body&amp;nbsp;– either at all or in sufficient quantities&amp;nbsp;– and thus must be obtained from a [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://library.med.utah.edu/NetBiochem/nutrition/lect1/2_1.html | title = What is an essential nutrient? | publisher = NetBiochem Nutrition, [[University of Utah]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VaughanGeissler2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Griffith Vaughan|author2=Catherine Geissler|author3=Barbara Nicholson |author4=Elisabeth Dowle |author5=Elizabeth Rice|title=The new Oxford book of food plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdKxFcen8zgC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=13 October 2010|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-954946-7|pages=212–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[water]], which is universally required for the maintenance of [[homeostasis]] in mammals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jéquier|first1=E|last2=Constant|first2=F|title=Water as an essential nutrient: the physiological basis of hydration|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=2 September 2009|volume=64|issue=2|pages=115–123|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.111|url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v64/n2/pdf/ejcn2009111a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; essential nutrients are indispensable for various cellular [[metabolic process]]es and maintaining tissue and organ function.&lt;ref name="AJCN"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chipponi|first1=JX|last2=Bleier|first2=JC|last3=Santi|first3=MT|last4=Rudman|first4=D|title=Deficiencies of essential and conditionally essential nutrients.|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=May 1982|volume=35|issue=5 Suppl|pages=1112–1116|pmid=6805293|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/35/5/1112.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of humans, there are nine [[amino acid]]s, two [[fatty acid]]s, thirteen [[vitamin]]s and fifteen [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] that are considered essential nutrients.&lt;ref name="AJCN" /&gt; In addition, there are several molecules that are considered conditionally essential nutrients since they are indispensable in certain developmental and pathological states.&lt;ref name="AJCN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carver|first1=Jane|title=Neonatal Nutrition and Metabolism|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=299–311|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511544712.020|chapter=Conditionally essential nutrients: choline, inositol, taurine, arginine, glutamine and nucleotides}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kendler|first1=BS|title=Supplemental conditionally essential nutrients in cardiovascular disease therapy|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing|date=2006|volume=21|issue=1|pages=9–16|pmid=16407731|doi=10.1097/00005082-200601000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amino acids====
{{Main|Essential amino acid}}
An essential amino acid is an [[amino acid]] that is required by an organism but cannot be synthesized ''[[de novo synthesis|de novo]]'' by it, and therefore must be supplied in its diet. Out of the twenty standard protein-producing amino acids, nine cannot be [[endogenous]]ly synthesized by humans: [[phenylalanine]], [[valine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], [[methionine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], [[lysine]], and [[histidine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Young VR |title=Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations |journal=J.

====Fatty acids====
{{Main|Essential fatty acid}}
Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are [[fatty acid]]s that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot [[Biosynthesis|synthesize]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | edition = 6th | year = 1980 |author1=Robert S. Goodhart |author2=Maurice E. Shils | publisher = Lea and Febinger | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 0-8121-0645-8 | pages = 134–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans: [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]) and [[linoleic acid]] (an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitney Ellie |author2=Rolfes SR | title = Understanding Nutrition | edition = 11th | location = California | publisher = Thomson Wadsworth | year = 2008 | pages = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vitamins====
{{Main|Vitamin}}
Vitamins are organic molecules essential for an organism that are not classified as [[amino acid]]s or [[fatty acid]]s. They commonly function as [[enzymatic cofactor]]s, metabolic regulators or [[antioxidant]]s. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. [[vitamin E]] includes [[tocopherol]]s and [[tocotrienol]]s):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brigelius-Flohé R, Traber MG | title = Vitamin E: function and metabolism | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1145–1155 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10385606 | last2 = Traber | doi=10.1096/fasebj.13.10.1145}}&lt;/ref&gt; vitamins A, C, D, E, K, [[thiamine]] (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), [[riboflavin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[niacin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pantothenic acid]] (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] (e.g., [[pyridoxine]]), [[biotin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;), [[folate]] (B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[cobalamin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.

====Minerals====
{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)}}
Minerals are the [[exogenous]] [[chemical element]]s indispensable for life. Although the four elements: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.

The essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (expressed as a mass), are [[potassium]], [[chlorine]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as [[boron]] and [[silicon]].

===Conditionally essential nutrients===
Conditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities. In humans, such conditions include [[Preterm birth|premature birth]], limited nutrient intake, rapid growth, and certain disease states.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt; [[Choline]], [[inositol]], [[taurine]], [[arginine]], [[glutamine]] and [[nucleotides]] are classified as conditionally essential and are particularly important in neonatal diet and metabolism.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;

=== Non-essential nutrients ===
Non-essential nutrients are substances within foods that can have a significant impact on health; these substances can be beneficial or toxic.{{mcn|date=January 2018}} For example, [[dietary fiber]] is not absorbed in the human digestive tract, but is important in maintaining the bulk of a [[bowel movement]] to avoid [[constipation]].{{mcn|date=January 2018}} A subset of dietary fiber, [[soluble fiber]], can be metabolized by bacteria residing in the large intestine.&lt;ref name="Butyrate synthesis pathways" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lupton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prebiotic digestion" /&gt; Soluble fiber is marketed as serving a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] function{{snd}}promoting "healthy" intestinal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Bacterial metabolism of soluble fiber also produces [[short-chain fatty acid]]s like [[butyric acid]], which may be absorbed into intestinal cells as a source of calories.&lt;ref name="Butyrate synthesis pathways"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vital M, Howe AC, Tiedje JM | title = Revealing the bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways by analyzing (meta)genomic data | journal = mBio | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e00889 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24757212 | pmc = 3994512 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00889-14 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lupton"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lupton JR | title = Microbial degradation products influence colon cancer risk: the butyrate controversy | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 2 | pages = 479–482 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14747692 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/134/2/479 | doi=10.1093/jn/134.2.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prebiotic digestion"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cummings JH, Macfarlane GT, Englyst HN | title = Prebiotic digestion and fermentation | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 73 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 415S-420S | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11157351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-nutrients===
[[Ethanol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH) supplies calories. For spirits (vodka, gin, rum, etc.) a standard serving in the United States is {{convert|1.5|USfloz|ml}}, which at 40%{{nbsp}}ethanol (80{{nbsp}}proof) would be 14 grams and 98 calories. At 50%{{nbsp}}alcohol, 17.5{{nbsp}}grams and 122.5{{nbsp}}calories. Wine and beer contain a similar amount of ethanol in servings of {{convert|5|USfloz|ml}} and {{convert|12|USfloz|ml}}, respectively, but these beverages also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5-ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories. A 12-ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on [[NHANES]] 2013–2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8{{nbsp}}grams of alcohol per day and men consume on average 15.5 grams per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf "What We Eat in America, NHANES 2013-2014"]&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol calorie contributions are 48 and 108 cal/day, respectively.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Alcoholic beverages are considered [[empty calorie]] foods because, other than calories, they contribute no essential nutrients.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

By definition, [[phytochemical]]s include all nutritional and non-nutritional components of edible plants.&lt;ref name="lpi1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phytochemicals|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included as nutritional constituents are [[provitamin]] A [[carotenoid]]s,&lt;ref name="lpi2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carotenoids|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas those without nutrient status are diverse [[polyphenol]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, [[resveratrol]], and [[lignan]]s &amp;ndash; often claimed to have [[antioxidant]] effects &amp;ndash; that are present in numerous plant foods.&lt;ref name="lpi3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flavonoids|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of phytochemical compounds are under preliminary research for their potential effects on human diseases and health.&lt;ref name="lpi1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lpi2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=lpi3/&gt; However, the qualification for nutrient status of compounds with poorly defined properties ''[[in vivo]]'' is that they must first be defined with a [[Dietary Reference Intake]] level to enable accurate food labeling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrient content claims--general principles; 21CFR101.13|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.13|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condition not established for most phytochemicals that are claimed to be antioxidant nutrients.&lt;ref name="nutra"&gt;{{cite web |title= New Roles for Polyphenols.

==Deficiencies and toxicity==
''See [[Vitamin]], [[Mineral (nutrient)]], [[Protein (nutrient)]]''

An inadequate amount of a nutrient is a deficiency. Deficiencies can be due to a number of causes including an inadequacy in nutrient intake, called a dietary deficiency, or any of several conditions that interfere with the utilization of a nutrient within an organism.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"/&gt; Some of the conditions that can interfere with nutrient utilization include problems with nutrient absorption, substances that cause a greater than normal need for a nutrient, conditions that cause nutrient destruction, and conditions that cause greater nutrient excretion.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"/&gt; Nutrient toxicity occurs when excess consumption of a nutrient does harm to an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Nutrient Toxicity|journal=Nutrition Reviews|volume=39|issue=6|pages=249–256|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1981.tb07453.x|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Canada, recommended dietary intake levels of essential nutrients are based on the minimum level that "will maintain a defined level of nutriture in an individual", a definition somewhat different from that used by the [[World Health Organization]] and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of a "basal requirement to indicate the level of intake needed to prevent pathologically relevant and clinically detectable signs of a dietary inadequacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Dietary Reference Intakes.

In setting human nutrient guidelines, government organizations do not necessarily agree on amounts needed to avoid deficiency or maximum amounts to avoid the risk of toxicity.&lt;ref name=DRITable&gt;[http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRI-Tables/5Summary%20TableTables%2014.pdf?la=en Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)] Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JapanDRI&gt;[http://www.nibiohn.go.jp/eiken/info/pdf/dris2010en.pdf Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese (2010)] National Institute of Health and Nutrition, Japan&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for [[vitamin C]], recommended intakes range from 40&amp;nbsp;mg/day in India&lt;ref name="NIN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icmr.nic.in/final/rda-2010.pdf |title=Nutrient Requirements and Recommended Dietary Allowances for Indians: A Report of the Expert Group of the Indian Council of Medical Research. pp.283-295 (2009) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615094048/http://icmr.nic.in/final/RDA-2010.pdf |archivedate=June 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 155&amp;nbsp;mg/day for the European Union.&lt;ref name=EFSA-Recommended&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies |year=2017 |url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828082247/https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below shows U.S. Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals, PRIs for the European Union (same concept as RDAs), followed by what three government organizations deem to be the safe upper intake. RDAs are set higher than EARs to cover people with higher than average needs. Adequate Intakes (AIs) are set when there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs. Governments are slow to revise information of this nature. For the U.S. values, with the exception of calcium and vitamin D, all of the data date to 1997-2004.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

*For niacin and magnesium there appears to be a contradiction inherent in the information in the table, as the amounts recommended for daily consumption can be more than the amounts identified as the safe upper limits. For both nutrients, the ULs identify the amounts which will not increase risk of adverse effects when the nutrients are consumed as a serving of a dietary supplement. Magnesium above the UL may cause diarrhea. Niacin above the UL may cause flushing of the face and a sensation of body warmth. Each country or regional regulatory agency decides on a safety margin below when symptoms may occur, so the ULs can differ.&lt;ref name=DRITable /&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA /&gt;

'''EAR''' U.S. Estimated Average Requirements.

'''RDA''' U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances; higher for adults than for children, and may be even higher for women who are pregnant or lactating.

'''AI'''  U.S. Adequate Intake; AIs established when there is not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs.

'''PRI''' Population Reference Intake is European Union equivalent of RDA; higher for adults than for children, and may be even higher for women who are pregnant or lactating. For Thiamin and Niacin the PRIs are expressed as amounts per MJ of calories consumed. MJ = megajoule = 239 food calories.

'''Upper Limit'''  Tolerable upper intake levels.

'''ND'''  ULs have not been determined.

'''NE'''  EARs, PRIs or AIs have not yet been established or will not be (EU does not consider chromium an essential nutrient).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32318">Relatively speaking, the [[brain]] consumes an immense amount of energy in comparison to the rest of the body. The mechanisms involved in the transfer of energy from foods to neurons are likely to be fundamental to the control of brain function.&lt;ref name="alpha" /&gt; Human bodily processes, including the brain, all require both [[Nutrient|macronutrients]], as well as [[micronutrients]].&lt;ref name= bravo&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17066209 |year=2006 |last1=Bourre |first1=JM |title=Effects of nutrients (in food) on the structure and function of the nervous system: Update on dietary requirements for brain.

==Nutrients needed for memory development==

===Choline===
[[Choline]] is an [[essential nutrient]] and its primary function within the human body is the synthesis of [[Cell membrane|cellular membranes]],&lt;ref&gt;http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/othernuts/choline Choline (at Linus Paulin Inst){{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it serves other functions as well.  It is a precursor molecule to the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] which serves a wide range of functions including motor control and memory.  Choline itself has also been shown to have additional health benefits in relation to memory and choline deficiencies may be related to some liver and [[neurological disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00246.x |title=Choline: An essential nutrient for public health |year=2009 |last1=Zeisel |first1=Steven H |last2=Da Costa |first2=Kerry-Ann |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=615–23 |pmid=19906248 |pmc=2782876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its role in cellular synthesis, choline is an important nutrient during the prenatal and early postnatal development of offspring as it contributes heavily to the development of the brain. Despite the wide range of foods that choline is found in, studies have shown that the mean choline intake of men, women and children are below the [[Adequate Intake]] levels.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"/&gt; Women, especially pregnant or lactating women, older people, and infants, are especially at risk for choline deficiency.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"/&gt;

==B-Vitamin deficiencies and cognition==
[[B vitamins]], also known as the B-complex, are an interrelated group of nutrients which often co-occur in food. The complex consists of: [[thiamine]] (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), [[riboflavin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[niacin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pantothenic acid]] (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Vitamin B6|pyridoxin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), [[folic acid]] (B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), [[cobalamin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[biotin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/27-40_150.pdf}}{{page needed|was " |page=27 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; B vitamins are not [[Biosynthesis|synthesized]] in the body, and thus need to be obtained from food. B-complex vitamins are water-soluble vitamins, which means that they are not stored within the body. In consequence, the B vitamins need ongoing replenishment.&lt;ref name= charlie/&gt; It is possible to identify broad cognitive effects of certain B vitamins, as they are involved in many significant [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]] within the brain.&lt;ref name="bravo" /&gt;

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (thiamine)===
This vitamin is important for the facilitation of glucose use, thus ensuring the production of energy for the brain,&lt;ref name="bravo"/&gt; and normal functioning of the nervous system, muscles and heart.&lt;ref name= "charlie"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=16245676 |year=2005 |last1=Thompson |first1=J |title=Vitamins, minerals and supplements: Part two |volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=366–8 |journal=Community Practitioner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiamine is found throughout mammalian nervous tissue, including the brain and [[spinal cord]].

Lack of thiamin causes the disease known as [[beriberi]].&lt;ref name= golf&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/58-86_150.pdf }}{{page needed|was " |page=58 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two forms of [[beriberi]]: "wet", and "dry". Dry beriberi is also known as cerebral beriberi and characterized by [[peripheral neuropathy]].&lt;ref name="foxtrot"/&gt; Thiamine deficiency has been reported in up to 80% of alcoholic patients due to inadequate nutritional intake, reduced absorption, and impaired utilization of thiamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1983.tb05403.x |title=Alcohol and Thiamine Metabolism |year=1983 |last1=Hoyumpa |first1=Anastacio M. |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=7 |pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= hotel&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/1566524013363870 |title=Molecular Mechanisms of Thiamine Utilization |year=2001 |last1=Singleton. |first1=C.K. |last2=Martin |first2=P.R. |journal=Current Molecular Medicine |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=197–207 |pmid=11899071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical signs of B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency include mental changes such as apathy, decrease in [[short-term memory]], confusion, and irritability;&lt;ref name="golf"/&gt; also increased rates of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[dementia]], falls, and [[fracture]]s in old age.&lt;ref name="hotel"/&gt;

The lingering symptoms of neuropathy associated with cerebral beriberi are known as [[Korsakoff's syndrome]], or the chronic phase of Wernicke-Korsakoff's.&lt;ref name= india&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.42.3.226 |title=Wernicke's encephalopathy: A more common disease than realised.

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (niacin)===
Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as niacin, includes both [[nicotinamide]] as well as [[nicotinic acid]], both of which function in many biological [[Redox|oxidization and reduction reactions]] within the body. Niacin is involved in the synthesis of [[fatty acids]] and [[cholesterol]], known mediators of brain biochemistry, and in effect, of cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19990615)56:6&lt;565::AID-JNR2&gt;3.0.CO;2-H |title=Essential fatty acids are mediators of brain biochemistry and cognitive functions |year=1999 |last1=Yehuda |first1=Shlomo |last2=Rabinovitz |first2=Sharon |last3=Mostofsky |first3=David I. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Research |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=565–70 |pmid=10374811}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pellagra]] is a niacin deficiency disease. Pellagra is classically characterized by four 4 "D's": diarrhea, [[dermatitis]], dementia, and death. Neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra include headache, irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, hallucinations, stupor, apathy, psychomotor unrest, photophobia, tremor, ataxia, spastic paresis, fatigue, and depression. Symptoms of fatigue and insomnia may progress to encephalophathy characterized by confusion, memory loss, and psychosis. Those afflicted with pellagra may undergo pathological alterations in the nervous system. Findings may include [[Myelin|demylenation]] and degeneration of various affected parts of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral [[nerves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=21433862 |year=1939 |last1=Zimmerman |first1=HM |title=The Pathology of the Nervous System in Vitamin Deficiencies |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–28.7 |pmc=2602501 |journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral nicotinamide has been promoted as an over-the-counter drug for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's dementia]]. Conversely, no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug, as nicotinamide administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimers', vascular, or fronto-temporal types. This evidence suggests that nicotinamide may treat dementia as related to pellegra, but administration does not effectively treat other types of dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s007020070011 |title=No evidence for cognitive improvement from oral nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in dementia |year=2000 |last1=Rainer |first1=M. |last2=Kraxberger |first2=E. |last3=Haushofer |first3=M. |last4=Mucke |first4=H.

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (folic acid)===
Folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; play a vital role in the synthesis of [[S-Adenosyl methionine|S-adenosylmethionine]], which is of key importance in the maintenance and repair of all cells, including neurons.&lt;ref name= oscar&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1865312 |year=1991 |last1=Hauck |first1=MR |title=Cognitive abilities of preschool children: Implications for nurses working with young children |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=230–5 |journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, folate has been linked to the maintenance of adequate brain levels of cofactors necessary for chemicals reactions that lead to the synthesis of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name= november&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/196-305_150.pdf}}{{page needed|was "|page=196 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of blood plasma folate and [[homocysteine]] concentrations are inversely related, such that an increase in dietary folate decreases homocysteine concentration. Thus, dietary intake of folate is a major determinant of homocysteine levels within the body.&lt;ref name= quebec&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=16210710 |year=2005 |author1=Homocysteine Lowering Trialists' Collaboration |title=Dose-dependent effects of folic acid on blood concentrations of homocysteine: A meta-analysis of the randomized trials |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=806–12 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|doi=10.1093/ajcn/82.4.806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between folate and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is so interdependent that deficiency in either vitamin can result in [[megaloblastic anemia]], characterized by organic mental change.&lt;ref name= romeo&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9155210 |year=1996 |last1=Bottiglieri |first1=T |title=Folate, vitamin B12, and neuropsychiatric disorders |volume=54 |issue=12 |pages=382–90 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1996.tb03851.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between levels of folate and altered mental function is not large, but is sufficient enough to suggest a causal association.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Deficiency in folate can cause an elevation of homocysteine within the blood,&lt;ref name="quebec"/&gt; as the clearance of homocysteine requires enzymatic action dependent on folate, and to a lesser extent, vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Elevated homocysteine has been associated with increased risk of [[Stroke|vascular events]], as well as dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=15213037 |year=2004 |last1=Quadri |first1=P |last2=Fragiacomo |first2=C |last3=Pezzati |first3=R |last4=Zanda |first4=E |last5=Forloni |first5=G |last6=Tettamanti |first6=M |last7=Lucca |first7=U |title=Homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B-12 in mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=114–22 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|doi=10.1093/ajcn/80.1.114 |doi-broken-date=2018-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences lie in the presentation of megaloblastic anemia induced by either folate or B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; generally results in peripheral neuropathy, whereas folate-related anemia often results in affective, or mood disorders.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.281.6247.1036 |title=The neuropsychiatry of megaloblastic anaemia |year=1980 |last1=Shorvon |first1=S D |last2=Carney |first2=M W |last3=Chanarin |first3=I |last4=Reynolds |first4=E H |journal=BMJ |volume=281 |issue=6247 |pages=1036–8 |pmid=6253016 |pmc=1714413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurological effects are not often associated with folate-related megaloblastic anemia, although demyelinating disorders may eventually present.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt; In one study, mood disturbances were recorded for the majority of patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; In addition, folate concentrations within blood plasma have been found to be lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups. In addition, depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard [[Antidepressant|antidepressant therapy]] than did those with normal levels within plasma.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; However, replication of these findings are less robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12042457 |year=2002 |last1=Bryan |first1=J |last2=Calvaresi |first2=E |last3=Hughes |first3=D |title=Short-term folate, vitamin B-12 or vitamin B-6 supplementation slightly affects memory performance but not mood in women of various ages |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=1345–56 |journal=The Journal of Nutrition|doi=10.1093/jn/132.6.1345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intake of the vitamin has been linked to deficits in [[learning]] and memory, particularly within the elderly population.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Elderly people deficient in folate may present with deficits in free recall and recognition, which suggests that levels of folate may be related to efficacy of episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.11.3.487 |title=Effects of serum vitamin B-sub-1-sub-2 and folate status on episodic memory performance in very old age: A population-based study |year=1996 |last1=Wahlin |first1=Åke |last2=Hill |first2=Robert D. |last3=Winblad |first3=Bengt |last4=Bäckman |first4=Lars |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=487–96 |pmid=8893317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of adequate folate may produce a form of dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin. Indeed, there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment. In a 3-year longitudinal study of men and women aged 50–70 years with elevated homocysteine plasma concentration, researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800μg resulted in an increase in folate levels and a decrease in homocysteine levels within blood plasma. In addition to these results, improvements of memory, and information-processing speed, as well as slight improvements of [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] speed were observed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60109-3 |title=Effect of 3-year folic acid supplementation on cognitive function in older adults in the FACIT trial: A randomised, double blind, controlled trial |year=2007 |last1=Durga |first1=Jane |last2=Van Boxtel |first2=Martin PJ |last3=Schouten |first3=Evert G |last4=Kok |first4=Frans J |last5=Jolles |first5=Jelle |last6=Katan |first6=Martijn B |last7=Verhoef |first7=Petra |journal=The Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |pages=208–216 |pmid=17240287|url=https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/portal/en/publications/effect-of-3year-folic-acid-supplementation-on-cognitive-function-in-older-adults-in-the-facit-trial-a-randomised-double-blind-controlled-trial(35d288c0-c91e-417c-b2b7-a35a0fbc8361).html |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance. However, while the amount of cognitive improvement after treatment with folate is correlated with the severity of folate deficiency, the severity of cognitive decline is independent of the severity of folate deficiency. This suggests that the dementia observed may not be entirely related to levels folate, as there could be additional factors that were not accounted for which might have an effect.&lt;ref name= "Fioravanti"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18653121 |year=1998 |last1=Fioravanti |first1=M |last2=Ferrario |first2=E |last3=Massaia |first3=M |last4=Cappa |first4=G |last5=Rivolta |first5=G |last6=Grossi |first6=E |last7=Buckley |first7=AE |title=Low folate levels in the cognitive decline of elderly patients and the efficacy of folate as a treatment for improving memory deficits |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |journal=Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics |doi=10.1016/s0167-4943(97)00028-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because neurulation may be completed before pregnancy is recognized, it is recommended that women capable of becoming pregnant take about 400μg of folic acid from fortified foods, supplements, or a combination of the two in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; These major anomalies in the nervous system can be reduced by 85% with systematic folate supplementation occurring before the onset of pregnancy.&lt;ref name= papa&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11475447 |year=2001 |last1=Moyers |first1=S |last2=Bailey |first2=LB |title=Fetal malformations and folate metabolism: Review of recent evidence |volume=59 |issue=7 |pages=215–24 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2001.tb07013.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of Alzheimer's and other cognitive diseases has been loosely connected to deficiencies in folate. It is recommended for the elderly to consume folate through food, fortified or not, and supplements in order to reduce risk of developing the disease.&lt;ref name="oscar"/&gt;

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (cobalamin)===
Also known as cobalamin, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is important for the maintenance of neurological function and psychiatric health.&lt;ref name= sierra&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/306-356_150.pdf }}{{page needed|was "|page=306 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency, also known as [[hypocobalaminemia]], often results from complications involving absorption into the body.&lt;ref name= victor&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17043022 |year=2006 |last1=Hvas |first1=AM |last2=Nexo |first2=E |title=Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency--an update |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1506–12 |journal=Haematologica}}&lt;/ref&gt; An assortment of neurological effects can be observed in 75–90% of individuals of any age with clinically observable B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Cobalamin deficiency manifestations are apparent in the abnormalities of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, optic nerves, and [[cerebrum]]. These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of [[myelin]],&lt;ref name= yankee&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5006.1394 |title=Cerebral Manifestations of Vitamin-B12 Deficiency |year=1956 |last1=Holmes |first1=J. M. |journal=BMJ |volume=2 |issue=5006 |pages=1394–8 |pmid=13374343 |pmc=2035923}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be expressed behaviorally through reports of sensory disturbances in the extremities, or motor disturbances, such as gait ataxia. Combined myelopathy and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases. Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss, disorientation, and dementia. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes. Mental symptoms are extremely variable, and include mild disorders of mood, mental slowness, and memory defect. Memory defect encompasses symptoms of [[Mental confusion|confusion]], severe agitation and depression, [[delusions]] and paranoid behavior, visual and auditory [[hallucinations]], dysphasia, violent maniacal behavior and epilepsy. It has been suggested that mental symptoms could be related to a decrease in cerebral metabolism, as caused by the state of deficiency.&lt;ref name="yankee"/&gt;

Mild to moderate cases of pernicious anemia may show poor [[Attentional control|concentration]]. In severe cases of pernicious anemia, individuals may present with various cognitive problems such as dementia, and memory loss. It is not always easy to determine whether B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is present, especially within older adults.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Patients may present with violent behavior or more subtle personality changes. They may also present with vague complaints, such as fatigue or memory loss, that may be attributed to normative aging processes. Cognitive symptoms may mimic behavior in Alzheimer's and other dementias as well.

Patients deficient in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration of at least 6&amp;nbsp;µg/day of the vitamin in pill form. Patients who suffer from irreversible causes of deficiency, such as pernicious anemia or old age, will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Strategy for treatment is dependent on the patient's level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000&amp;nbsp;µg of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; administered [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]] daily for one week, weekly for one month, then monthly for the rest of the patients life. The progression of neurological manifestations of cobalamin deficiency is generally gradual. As a result, early diagnosis is important or else irreversible damage may occur.&lt;ref name="sierra"/&gt; Patients who become demented usually show little to no cognitive improvement with the administration of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. There is risk that folic acid administered to those with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency may mask anemic symptoms without solving the issue at hand. In this case, patients would still be at risk for neurological deficits associated with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency-related anemia, which are not associated with anemia related to folate deficiency.&lt;ref name= zulu&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malouf|first1=R|title=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=4|pages=CD004514|authorlink2=John Grimley Evans|last2=Grimley Evans|first2=J|last3=Areosa Sastre|first3=A|last4=Malouf|first4=Reem|year=2003|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004514|pmid=14584018|chapter=Folic acid with or without vitamin B12 for cognition and dementia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18843658|date = November 2018}}

==Vitamin A deficiency and impaired memory==
[[Vitamin A]] is an essential [[nutrient]] for mammals which takes form in either [[retinol]] or the [[provitamin]] [[beta-Carotene]]. It helps regulation of cell division, cell function, genetic regulation, helps enhance the immune system, and is required for brain function, chemical balance, growth and development of the [[central nervous system]] and vision.&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3923/ajcn.2009.65.82 |title=Vitamin A: A Review |year=2009 |last1=Edem |first1=D.O. |journal=Asian Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=1 |pages=65–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging and cognitive disease==
Foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease risk of getting Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1159/000310330 |title=Phosphatidylserine Containing ω–3 Fatty Acids May Improve Memory Abilities in Non-Demented Elderly with Memory Complaints: A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial |year=2010 |last1=Vakhapova |first1=Veronika |last2=Cohen |first2=Tzafra |last3=Richter |first3=Yael |last4=Herzog |first4=Yael |last5=Korczyn |first5=Amos D. |journal=Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=467–74 |pmid=20523044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids, primarily [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), which is the most prevalent omega-3 fatty acid found in neurons, have been studied extensively for use in possible prevention and therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Some studies (cross-sectional) suggest that reduced intake or low brain levels of DHA are associated with earlier development of cognitive deficits or development of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Several clinical trials suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation does not have significant effects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease—which in turn may suggest that the protective benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation could depend on the scope of the disease and other confounding factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jicha|first=GA|author2=Markesbery, WR |title=Omega-3 fatty acids: potential role in the management of early Alzheimer's disease.|journal=Clinical Interventions in Aging|date=Apr 7, 2010|volume=5|pages=45–61|pmid=20396634|pmc=2854051|doi=10.2147/cia.s5231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A diet that is rich in antioxidants will also help get rid of free radicals in the body, which could be a cause for Alzheimer's. The buildup of Beta Amyloid plaques, a marker highly associated with Alzheimer's disease, generates cell damaging free radicals. Therefore, the role of antioxidants as protectants against Alzheimer's disease has become a hot topic of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Miranda S, Opazo C, Larrondo LF, Muñoz FJ, Ruiz F, Leighton F, Inestrosa NC  | year =2000| title =The role of oxidative stress in the toxicity induced by amyloid ß-peptide in Alzheimer's disease| journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume =62|issue =6|pages =633–648 | doi =10.1016/S0301-0082(00)00015-0|pmid =  10880853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple dietary modification, towards fewer highly processed carbohydrates and relatively more fats ad cholesterol, is likely a protective measure against Alzheimer's disease.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Additionally, [[folic acid]] has also been found to improve the memory of older people. There is some evidence that deficiency in folic acid may increase the risk of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, but there is debate about whether it lowers risk of cognitive impairment in the older population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=RJ|author2=Carter, HK |author3=Yang, Q |title=Cognitive impairment in older Americans in the age of folic acid fortification.|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=July 2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=265–7; author reply 267–9|pmid=17616791|doi=10.1093/ajcn/86.1.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=EH|title=Folic acid, ageing, depression, and dementia.|journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)|date=Jun 22, 2002|volume=324|issue=7352|pages=1512–5|pmid=12077044|pmc=1123448|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7352.1512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folic acid supplementation is shown to lower blood homocysteine levels, while folic acid deficiency can lead to a condition of high levels of homocysteine (Hcy) in the bloodstream called [[hyperhomocysteinemia]] (HHcy). HHcy is related to several vascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke.

'''Nutritional neuroscience''' is the scientific discipline that studies the effects various components of the diet such as [[minerals]], [[vitamins]], [[protein]], [[carbohydrate]]s, fats, dietary supplements, [[synthetic hormones]], and [[food additives]] have on [[neurochemistry]], [[neurobiology]], [[behavior]], and [[cognition]].

Recent research on nutritional mechanisms and their effect on the brain show they are involved in almost every facet of neurological functioning including alterations in [[neurogenesis]], [[neurotrophic factors]], [[neural pathway]]s and  [[neuroplasticity]], throughout the life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19698201 | doi=10.1017/S0029665109990188 | volume=68 | issue=4 | title=New insights into nutrition and cognitive neuroscience | journal=Proceedings of the Nutrition Society |date=November 2009 | author=Dauncey MJ | pages=408–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively speaking, the [[brain]] consumes an immense amount of energy in comparison to the rest of the body. The human brain is approximately 2% of the human body mass and uses 20–25% of the total energy expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fonseca-Azevedo K., Herculano-Houzel S. | year = 2012 | title = Metabolic constraint imposes tradeoff between body size and number of brain neurons in human evolution | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109 | issue = 45| pages = 18571–18576 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1206390109| last2 = Herculano-Houzel | bibcode = 2012PNAS..10918571F | pmid=23090991 | pmc=3494886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, mechanisms involved in the transfer of energy from foods to neurons are likely to be fundamental to the control of brain function.&lt;ref name="alpha" /&gt; Insufficient intake of selected vitamins, or certain metabolic disorders, affect [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] by disrupting the nutrient-dependent processes within the body that are associated with the management of energy in neurons, which can subsequently affect neurotransmission, [[synaptic plasticity]], and cell survival.&lt;ref name="alpha"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2421 |title=Brain foods: The effects of nutrients on brain function |year=2008 |last1=Gómez-Pinilla |first1=Fernando |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=568–78 |pmid=18568016 |pmc=2805706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zinc===
Zinc is essential for the structure and function of thousands of proteins critical for the function of every cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Hypozincemia is usually a nutritional deficiency, but can also be associated with [[malabsorption]], [[diarrhea]], [[acrodermatitis enteropathica]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[liver disease]], chronic [[renal disease]], [[sickle-cell disease]], [[diabetes]], [[malignancy]], pyroluria, and other chronic [[illness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GPnotebook|886046736|zinc deficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prasad AS |title=Zinc deficiency : Has been known of for 40 years but ignored by global health organisations |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7386 |pages=409–10 |year=2003 |pmid=12595353 |pmc=1125304 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7386.409 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7386/409}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also occur after [[bariatric surgery]], heavy metal exposure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=El-Safty Ibrahim A M |author2=Gadallah Mohsen |author3=Shafik Ahmed |author4=Shouman Ahmed E | year = 2002 | title = Effect of mercury vapour exposure on urinary excretion of calcium, zinc and copper: relationship to alterations in functional and structural integrity of the kidney | url = | journal = Toxicol Ind Health | volume = 18 | issue = 8| pages = 377–388 | pmid = 15119526 | doi=10.1191/0748233702th160oa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Funk Day, Brady  | year = 1987 | title = Displacement of zinc and copper from copper-induced metallothionein by cadmium and by mercury: in vivo and ex vivo studies | url = | journal = Comp Biochem Physiol C | volume = 86 | issue = 1| pages = 1–6 | pmid = 2881702 | doi=10.1016/0742-8413(87)90133-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tartrazine. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Zinc deficiency is typically the result of inadequate dietary intake of zinc, disease states that promote zinc losses, or physiological states that require increased zinc. Populations that consume primarily plant based diets that are low in bioavailable zinc often have zinc deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;Solomons, N.W.

=====Anorexia=====
{{Main|Anorexia (symptom)}}

Zinc deficiency may cause a decrease in [[appetite]] which can degenerate into [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] or [[anorexia nervosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21846317 | volume=3 | issue=3 | title=Zinc as an appetite stimulator - the possible role of zinc in the progression of diseases such as cachexia and sarcopenia | journal=Recent Patents on Food, Nutrition &amp; Agriculture |date=September 2011 | author=Suzuki H, Asakawa A, Li JB | pages=226–31 | doi=10.2174/2212798411103030226| author2=and others | displayauthors=1 | last3=Li | last4=Tsai | last5=Amitani | last6=Ohinata | last7=Komai | last8=Inui }}&lt;/ref&gt; Appetite disorders, in turn, cause [[malnutrition]] and, notably, inadequate zinc intake. Anorexia itself is a cause of zinc deficiency, thus leading to a vicious cycle: the worsening of anorexia worsens the zinc deficiency. A 1994 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that zinc (14&amp;nbsp;mg per day) doubled the rate of body mass increase in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Birmingham C. L. |author2=Goldner E. M. |author3=Bakan R. | year = 1994 | title = Controlled trial of zinc supplementation in anorexia nervosa | doi = 10.1002/1098-108X(199404)15:3&lt;251::AID-EAT2260150308&gt;3.0.CO;2-# | journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 251–255 | pmid = 8199605 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cognitive and motor function impairment=====
Cognitive and motor function may also be impaired in zinc deficient children. Zinc deficiency can interfere with many organ systems especially when it occurs during a time of rapid growth and development when nutritional needs are high, such as during infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sanstead H. H. | year = 2000 | title = Zinc nutriture as related to brain | url = | journal = J. Nutr. | volume = 130 | issue = | pages = 140S–146S  | displayauthors = etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[animal studies]], rats who were deprived of zinc during early fetal development exhibited increased emotionality, poor memory, and abnormal response to stress which interfered with performance in learning situations.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Black MM |title=The Evidence Linking Zinc Deficiency with Children's Cognitive and Motor Functioning, |journal=J.

Low maternal zinc status has been associated with less attention during the neonatal period and worse motor functioning.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Black MM |title=Zinc deficiency and child development |journal=Am.

Nutr. |volume=68 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=464S–9S |year=1998 |pmid=9701161 |doi= |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9701161 |pmc=3137936}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some studies, supplementation has been associated with motor development in very low [[birth weight]] infants and more vigorous and functional activity in infants and toddlers.&lt;ref name="Black" /&gt;

Plasma zinc level has been associated with many psychological disorders. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear in most instances. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that zinc deficiency could play a causal role in the etiology of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nuttall|first=J|author2=Oteiza |title=Zinc and the ERK kinases in the developing brain|journal=Neurotoxicity Research|year=2012|volume=21|issue=1|pages=128–141|doi=10.1007/s12640-011-9291-6|pmid=22095091|pmc=4316815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, zinc supplementation has been reported to improve measures of depression in randomized double blind placebo controlled trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20087376 | doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.158 | volume=64 | issue=3 | title=Effect of zinc supplementation on mood states in young women: a pilot study |date=March 2010 | author=Sawada T, Yokoi K | journal=Eur J Clin Nutr | pages=331–3| last2=Yokoi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper===
Copper is important for the function of many enzymes in the brain. Notably, dopamine β-mono-oxygenase is affected by copper deficiency leading to increased dopamine and decreased norepinephrine levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nelson K. T., Prohaska J. R. | year = 2009 | title = Copper deficiency in rodents alters dopamine b-mono-oxygenase activity, mRNA and protein level | url = | journal = British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 18–28 | pmid = 19079842 | last2 = Prohaska | doi = 10.1017/S0007114508162961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both copper deficiency and toxicity can interfere with brain development and function.

====Deficiency====
The neurodegenerative syndrome of copper deficiency has been recognized for some time in ruminant animals, in which it is commonly known as "[[swayback]]".&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt; The disease involves a nutritional deficiency in the trace element [[copper]].&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jaiser S.

On the other hand, [[Menkes disease]] is a genetic disorder of copper deficiency involving a wide variety of symptoms that is often fatal.&lt;ref name="Kodama"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kodama H. |author2=Fujisawa C. | year = 2009 | title = Copper metabolism and inherited copper transport disorders: molecular mechanisms, screening, and treatment | url = | journal = Metallomics | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 42–52 | doi=10.1039/b816011m}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Neurological presentation=====
Copper deficiency can cause a wide variety of neurological problems including, [[myelopathy]], peripheral [[neuropathy]], and [[optic neuropathy]].&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kumar N | year = 2006 | title = Copper deficiency myelopathy (human swayback) | url = | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 81 | issue = 10| pages = 1371–1384 | pmid = 17036563 | doi = 10.4065/81.10.1371 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Myelopathy=====
Sufferers typically present difficulty walking ([[gait]] difficulty) caused by [[sensory ataxia]] (irregular muscle coordination) due to [[dorsal column]] dysfunction&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; or degeneration of the spinal cord ([[myelopathy]]).&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaiser, similar"&gt;Jaiser, S. R., &amp; Winston, G. P. (2008). Copper deficiency myelopathy and subacute combined degeneration of the cord: why is the phenotype so similar?" ''Journal of Neurology'' 255, P569.&lt;/ref&gt; Patients with ataxic gait have problems balancing and display an unstable wide walk. They often feel tremors in their torso, causing side way jerks and lunges.&lt;ref name="Gait"&gt;Ataxic Gait Demonstration. Online Medical Video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpiEprzObIU&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt;

In brain MRI, there is often an increased [[T2 (MRI)|T2]] signalling at the posterior columns of the spinal cord in patients with [[myelopathy]] caused by copper deficiency.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MRI" /&gt; T2 signalling is often an indicator of some kind of neurodegeneration. There are some changes in the spinal cord MRI involving the thoracic cord, the cervical cord or sometimes both.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; Copper deficiency myelopathy is often compared to [[subacute combined degeneration]] (SCD).&lt;ref name="Jaiser, similar" /&gt; [[Subacute combined degeneration]] is also a degeneration of the spinal cord, but instead [[vitamin B12]] deficiency is the cause of the spinal degeneration.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt; SCD also has the same high T2 signalling intensities in the posterior column as copper deficient patient in MRI imaging.&lt;ref name="MRI"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bolamperti L. |author2=Leone M.

=====Peripheral neuropathy=====
Another common symptom of copper deficiency is [[peripheral neuropathy]], which is numbness or tingling that can start in the extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pineles"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pineles S.

Copper Deficiency Masquerading as Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Cord and Myelodysplastic Syndrome. Advances in clinical neuroscience and rehabilitation, http://www.acnr.co.uk/JA07/ACNR_JA07_abnwinner.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes, sensation to light touch and pin prick was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation was lost in the sternum, and markedly reduced [[proprioception]] or sensation about the self's orientation.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, masquerade" /&gt; Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt; This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral [[neuropathy]] can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest.

=====Optic neuropathy=====
Some patients suffering from copper deficiency have shown signs of vision and color loss.&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt; The vision is usually lost in the peripheral views of the eye.&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt; The bilateral vision loss is usually very gradual.&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spinazzi"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Spinazzi M. |author2=De Lazzari F. |author3=Tavolato B. |author4=Angelini C. |author5=Manara R. |author6=Armani M. | year = 2007 | title = Myelo-optico-neuropathy in copper deficiency occurring after partial gastrectomy.

====Toxicity====
Copper toxicity can occur from excessive supplement use, eating acid foods cooked in uncoated copper cookware, exposure to excess copper in drinking water, or as the result of an inherited metabolic disorder in the case of [[Wilson's disease]]. A significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state. This catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions, such as [[hydroxyl radical]] in a manner similar to [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton chemistry]].&lt;ref name=PubMed&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Radiat Res. | author = Held KD | date = May 1996 | volume = 145 | issue = 5 |pages = 542&amp;ndash;53 | title = Role of Fenton chemistry in thiol-induced toxicity and apoptosis | doi = 10.2307/3579272 | pmid = 8619019 | publisher = Radiation Research Society | jstor = 3579272| last2 = Sylvester | first2 = F. Craig | last3 = Hopcia | first3 = Karen L. | last4 = Biaglow | first4 = John E. | displayauthors = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes with which it is associated, thus is only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. This increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed [[oxidative stress]], and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity.

Some of the effects of aging may be associated with excess copper.&lt;ref name="pmid17259340"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brewer GJ |title=Iron and copper toxicity in diseases of aging, particularly atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease |journal=Exp.

However, it is unknown at this stage whether the copper contributes to the mental illness, whether the body attempts to store more copper in response to the illness, or whether the high levels of copper are the result of the mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wolf T.

===Manganese===
Manganese is a component of some [[enzymes]] and stimulates the development and activity of other enzymes.  Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is the principal [[antioxidant]] in [[mitochondria]].  Several enzymes activated by manganese contribute to the [[metabolism]] of [[carbohydrates]], [[amino acids]], and [[cholesterol]].&lt;ref&gt;Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine.

Deficiency of manganese causes skeletal deformation in animals and inhibits the production of [[collagen]] in wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;Keen CL, Zidenberg-Cherr S. Manganese. In: Ziegler EE, Filer LJ, eds. Present Knowledge in Nutrition. 7th ed. Washington D.C.: ILSI Press; 1996:334-343.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, manganese toxicity is associated with neurological complications.&lt;ref name="pmid16629164"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roth JA |title=Homeostatic and toxic mechanisms regulating manganese uptake, retention, and elimination |journal=Biol.

====Toxicity====
Manganese poisoning is a [[toxic]] condition resulting from chronic exposure to [[manganese]] and first identified in 1837 by [[James Couper (academic)|James Couper]].&lt;ref name="Couper1837"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Couper | first = J. | title = Sur les effets du peroxide de manganèse | journal =  Journal de chimie médicale, de pharmacie et de toxicologie | year= 1837 | volume = 3 | pages= 223–225  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WpQ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Presentation=====
Chronic exposure to excessive Mn levels can lead to a variety of psychiatric and motor disturbances, termed [[manganism]]. Generally, exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of 5&amp;nbsp;mg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms.&lt;ref name="libres.uncg.edu"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06534.x | url = http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/K_Erickson_Ferroportin_2009.pdf | title = Ferroportin is a manganese-responsive protein that decreases manganese cytotoxicity and accumulation | year = 2010 | last1 = Yin | first1 = Zhaobao | last2 = Jiang | first2 = Haiyan | last3 = Lee | first3 = Eun-Sook Y. | last4 = Ni | first4 = Mingwei | last5 = Erikson | first5 = Keith M. | last6 = Milatovic | first6 = Dejan | last7 = Bowman | first7 = Aaron B. | last8 = Aschner | first8 = Michael | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 112 | issue = 5 | pages = 1190–8 | pmid = 20002294 | pmc = 2819584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In initial stages of manganism, neurological symptoms consist of reduced response speed, irritability, mood changes, and compulsive behaviors.&lt;ref name="pmid16629164"/&gt; Upon protracted exposure symptoms are more prominent and resemble those of [[idiopathic]] [[Parkinson's disease]], as which it is often misdiagnosed, although there are particular differences in both the symptoms (nature of tremors, for example), response to drugs such as [[L-DOPA|levodopa]], and affected portion of the [[basal ganglia]]. Symptoms are also similar to [[Motor neurone disease|Lou Gehrig's disease]] and [[multiple sclerosis]].

=====Causes=====
Manganism has become an active issue in [[occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] as it has been the subject of numerous [[product liability]] lawsuits against manufacturers of [[arc welding]] supplies. In these lawsuits, welders have accused the manufacturers of failing to provide adequate warning that their products could cause welding fumes to contain dangerously high manganese concentrations that could lead welders to develop manganism. Companies employing welders are also being sued, for what colloquially is known as "welders' disease". However, studies fail to show any link between employment as a welder and manganism (or other neurological problems).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fryzek JP, Hansen J, Cohen S, Bonde JP, Llambias MT, Kolstad HA, Skytthe A, Lipworth L, Blot WJ, Olsen JH | date = May 2005 | title = A cohort study of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders in Danish welders | url = http://www.weldinginfonetwork.com/studies/05_05_Danish_JOEM.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 5| pages = 466–72 | doi=10.1097/01.jom.0000161730.25913.bf| pmid = 15891525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/oem.2005.022921| pages = 135–40 | title = Parkinson's disease and other basal ganglia or movement disorders in a large nationwide cohort of Swedish welders | year = 2006 | last1 = Fored | first1 = C M | journal = Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pmid = 16421393 | last2 = Fryzek | first2 = JP | last3 = Brandt | first3 = L | last4 = Nise | first4 = G | last5 = Sjögren | first5 = B | last6 = McLaughlin | first6 = JK | last7 = Blot | first7 = WJ | last8 = Ekbom | first8 = A | pmc = 2078076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marsh GM, Gula MJ |date=Oct 2006 | title = Employment as a welder and Parkinson disease among heavy equipment manufacturing workers | url = http://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2006/10000/Employment_as_a_Welder_and_Parkinson_Disease_Among.12.aspx | journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 48 | issue = 10| pages = 1031–46 | doi=10.1097/01.jom.0000232547.74802.d8|pmid=17033503 |last2=Gula }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pathological mechanisms=====
Manganese may affect [[liver]] function, but the threshold of acute toxicity is very high. On the other hand, more than 95% of manganese is eliminated by biliary excretion. Any existing liver damage may slow this process, increasing its concentration in blood plasma.&lt;ref name="Ballatori2000"&gt;Ballatori N. Molecular mechanisms of hepatic metal transport.

Increased [[ferroportin]] protein expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity, characterized by the reversal of Mn-reduced [[glutamate]] uptake and diminished [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH) leakage.&lt;ref name="libres.uncg.edu"/&gt;

=====Locations=====
The [[Red River Delta]] near [[Hanoi]] has high levels of manganese or [[arsenic]] in the water.

===Magnesium===
Magnesium is necessary for the function of many metabolic enzymes and also serves as a key regulator of calcium channels involved in neurotransmission (e.g. NMDA receptor).&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, L., Bregestovski, P., Ascher, P., Herbet, A., &amp; Prochiantz, A.

===Vitamin A===
[[Vitamin A]] is an essential [[nutrient]] for mammals which takes form in either [[retinol]] or the [[provitamin]] [[beta-Carotene]]. It helps regulation of cell division, cell function, genetic regulation, helps enhance the immune system, and is required for brain function, chemical balance, growth and development of the [[central nervous system]] and vision.&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3923/ajcn.2009.65.82 |title=Vitamin A: A Review |year=2009 |last1=Edem |first1=D.O. |journal=Asian Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=1 |pages=65–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Learning memory====
In an experiment by [[Chongqing Medical University]] pregnant rats were either plentiful in vitamin A or were of a [[vitamin A deficiency]] (VAD) due to their diet. The offspring of these rats were then tested in a water maze at 8 weeks old and it was found the VAD offspring had a harder time finishing the maze which helps show that these rats, even while having a deficiency from ''[[in utero]]'', have more problems with learning memory.&lt;ref name="Ting-Yu L et.al. (Pregnancy)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2022NNNNNN |title=Marginal Vitamin a Deficiency in Pregnancy Can Induce Memory Deficit in Adult Offspring |year=2008 |last1=Li |first1=T.-Y. |last2=Huang |first2=H.-M. |last3=Mao |first3=C.-T. |last4=Liu |first4=Y. |last5=Qu |first5=P. |last6=Yang |first6=L. |journal=Pediatrics |volume=121 |pages=S152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young rats in a separate study by the same university also showed impaired [[long-term potentiation]] in the [[hippocampus]] when they were VAD which shows neuronal impairment.&lt;ref name="Ting-Yu L et.al.

====Spatial memory====
Vitamin A affects spatial memory most of the time because the size of the [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] in hippocampal neurons are reduced by approximately 70% when there is a deficiency which affects a person's abilities for higher cognitive function. In a study by the University of Cagliari, Italy, VAD rats had more trouble learning a [[Radial arm maze]] than rats who had normal levels of the [[vitamin]]. The healthy rats were able to correctly solve the maze within the 15-day training period and other rats that were once deficient but had vitamin A restored to normal levels were also able to solve it. Here it was found that the [[retinoid receptors]] which help transport vitamin A were of normal function.&lt;ref name="Cocco S et.al."&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0306-4522(02)00423-2 |title=Vitamin a deficiency produces spatial learning and memory impairment in rats |year=2002 |last1=Cocco |first1=S |last2=Diaz |first2=G |last3=Stancampiano |first3=R |last4=Diana |first4=A |last5=Carta |first5=M |last6=Curreli |first6=R |last7=Sarais |first7=L |last8=Fadda |first8=F |journal=Neuroscience |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=475–82 |pmid=12421614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevention, treatment and symptoms====
Eating foods high in vitamin A or taking [[dietary supplements]], retinol or [[retinal]] will prevent a deficiency. The foods highest in vitamin A are any pigmented fruits and vegetables and leafy green vegetables also provide [[beta-Carotene]].&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"/&gt;
There can be symptoms of fat loss and a reduction of any weight gain that would be considered normal for an individual,&lt;ref name="Cocco S et.al."/&gt; especially developmental weight gains such as in infants which would occur if the infant was deprived of vitamin A [[in utero]] and/or if it was deprived [[postnatal]] for an extensive period of time.&lt;ref name="Ting-Yu L et.al. (Pregnancy)"/&gt; The deficiency can also cause conditions such as [[blindness]] or night blindness, also known as [[nyctalopia]]. Night blindness is due to the inability to regenerate [[rhodopsin]] in the [[Rod cell|rods]] which is needed in dim light in order to see properly.&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"/&gt;
A treatment of supplements of [[retinoic acid]] which is a part of vitamin A can help replenish levels and help bring learning to normal,&lt;ref name="Hermandez-Pinto Puelble-Jimenez and Arilla-Ferreiro"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.04.034 |title= A vitamin A-free diet results in impairment of the rat hippocampal somatostatinergic system |year= 2006 |last1= Hernández-Pinto |first1= A.M. |last2= Puebla-Jiménez |first2= L. |last3= Arilla-Ferreiro |first3= E. |journal= Neuroscience |volume= 141 |issue= 2 |pages= 851–61 |pmid= 16757122}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after 39 weeks this is ineffective even if the treatment is daily because it will not bring the [[retinoid]] hypo-signalling back to normal.&lt;ref name="Etchamendy et.al."/&gt;

====Relationship with zinc====
Zinc is needed to maintain normal vitamin A levels in [[blood plasma]].&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"/&gt; It also helps vitamin A become [[Metabolism|metabolized]] by the [[liver]]. However evidence suggests that when someone is deficient in both vitamin A and zinc, memory is more improved when just vitamin A is increased than when just zinc is increased. Of course [[memory]] has the largest improvement when both are increased. When one of these nutrients is not balanced, the other is most likely to be affected because they rely on each other for proper functioning in learning.&lt;ref name="Kheirvari et al."&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3177/jnsv.52.421 |title=Increased Nerve Growth Factor by Zinc Supplementation with Concurrent Vitamin a Deficiency Does Not Improve Memory Performance in Mice |year=2006 |last1=Kheirvari |first1=Sorayya |last2=Uezu |first2=Kayoko |last3=Sakai |first3=Tohru |last4=Nakamori |first4=Masayo |last5=Alizadeh |first5=Mohammad |last6=Sarukura |first6=Nobuko |last7=Yamamoto |first7=Shigeru |journal=Journal of Nutritional Science and Vitaminology |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=421–7 |pmid=17330505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thiamin (vitamin B1)===
Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as thiamine, is a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|coenzyme]] essential for the metabolism of [[carbohydrates]].&lt;ref name= delta&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ogershok |first1=Paul R. |last2=Rahman |first2=Aamer |last3=Nestor |first3=Scott |last4=Brick |first4=James |title=Wernicke Encephalopathy in Nonalcoholic Patients |journal=American Journal of the Medical Sciences |pmid=11863078 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0002-9629&amp;volume=323&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=107 |year=2002 |volume=323 |issue=2 |pages=107–11 |doi=10.1097/00000441-200202000-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This vitamin is important for the facilitation of glucose use, thus ensuring the production of energy for the brain,&lt;ref name="bravo"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17066209 |year=2006 |last1=Bourre |first1=JM |title=Effects of nutrients (in food) on the structure and function of the nervous system: Update on dietary requirements for brain.

The brain retains its thiamine content in the face of a vitamin-deficient diet with great tenacity, as it is the last of all nervous tissues studied to become depleted. A 50% reduction of thiamine stores in [[rat]]s becomes apparent after only 4 days of being put on a thiamine-deficient diet. However, polyneuritic signs do not begin to appear until about 4 or 5 weeks have passed.&lt;ref name="foxtrot"/&gt; Similar results have been found in human subjects.&lt;ref name="echo" /&gt;

====Deficiencies====
The body has only small stores of B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; accordingly, there is risk of deficiency if the level of intake is reduced only for a few weeks.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt; Thiamin deficiency during critical periods of early development can disrupts neurogenesis in animal models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bâ A | year = 2011 | title = Comparative effects of alcohol and thiamine deficiency on the developing central nervous system | url = | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 225 | issue = 1| pages = 235–242 | doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2011.07.015 | pmid=21784107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of thiamin later in life causes the disease known as beriberi.&lt;ref name= golf&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/58-86_150.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was " |page=58 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two forms of [[beriberi]]: "wet", and "dry". Dry beriberi is also known as cerebral beriberi. Characteristics of wet beriberi include prominent [[edema]] and [[Heart|cardiac involvement]], whereas dry beriberi is mainly characterized by a [[Peripheral neuropathy|polyneuritis]].&lt;ref name="foxtrot"/&gt; Severe thiamin deficiency can also result in acute neurodegeneration leading to peripheral neuropathy and memory loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Richardson S. |author2=Malhotra A. |author3=Cwynarski K. |author4=Hughes D. |author5=Prentice A. |author6=McNamara C. | year = 2010 | title = Patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy for primary CNS lymphoma should receive prophylactic thiamine to prevent Wernike's encephalopathy | url = | journal = British Journal of Haematology | volume = 149 | issue = 6| pages = 899–901 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08112.x|pmid=20151977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiamine deficiency has been reported in up to 80% of alcoholic patients due to inadequate nutritional intake, reduced absorption, and impaired utilization of thiamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1983.tb05403.x |title=Alcohol and Thiamine Metabolism |year=1983 |last1=Hoyumpa |first1=Anastacio M. |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=7 |pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol, in combination with its [[metabolite]] [[acetaldehyde]], interacts with thiamine utilization at the molecular level during transport, diphosphorylation, and modification processes. For this reason, chronic alcoholics may have insufficient thiamine for maintenance of normal brain function, even with seemingly adequate dietary intake.&lt;ref name="hotel"/&gt;

====Symptoms====
Clinical signs of B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency include mental changes such as apathy, decrease in [[short-term memory]], confusion, and irritability.&lt;ref name="golf"/&gt; Moderate deficiency in thiamine may reduce growth in young populations, in increase chronic illness in both young and middle-aged adults. In addition, moderate deficiency of thiamine may increase rates of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[dementia]], falls, and [[fracture]]s in old age.&lt;ref name="hotel"/&gt;

The lingering symptoms of neuropathy associated with cerebral beriberi are known as [[Korsakoff's syndrome]], or the chronic phase of Wernicke-Korsakoff's.&lt;ref name= india&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.42.3.226 |title=Wernicke's encephalopathy: A more common disease than realised.

Korsakoff's syndrome is often characterized by [[confabulation]], disorientation, and profound [[amnesia]].&lt;ref name="india"/&gt; Characteristics of the neuropathology are varied, but generally consist of bilaterally symmetrical midline [[lesion]]s of [[brainstem]] areas, including the [[mammillary bodies]], [[thalamus]], [[Periaqueductal gray|periaqueductal region]], [[hypothalamus]], and the [[cerebellar vermis]].&lt;ref name="hotel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="india"/&gt;

====Treatment====
Immediate treatment of Wernicke encephalopathy involves the administration of [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] thiamine, followed with long-term treatment and prevention of the disorder through oral thiamine supplements, alcohol [[abstinence]], and a balanced diet.&lt;ref name="delta" /&gt; Improvements in brain functioning of chronic alcoholics may occur with abstinence-related treatment, involving the discontinuation of alcohol consumption and improved nutrition.&lt;ref name="hotel"/&gt; Wernicke's encephalopathy is life-threatening if left untreated. However, a rapid reversal of symptoms may result from prompt administration of thiamine.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;

====Prevention====
[[Food fortification|Fortification]] of flour is practiced in some countries to replace the thiamine lost during processing. However, this method has been criticized for missing the target population of chronic alcoholics, who are most at risk for deficiency. Alternative solutions have suggested the fortification of alcoholic beverages with thiamine.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;

Ingesting a diet rich in thiamine may stave off the adverse effects of deficiency. Foods providing rich sources of thiamine include [[Whole foods|unrefined grain products]], ready-to-eat [[Breakfast cereal|cereals]], meat (especially pork), [[Dairy|dairy products]], peanuts, [[legume]]s, fruits and eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vitamin Basics: The facts about Vitamins in Nutrition |year=2007 |publisher=DSM Nutritional Products Ltd. |location=Germany |isbn= |url=http://www.dsm.com/en_US/downloads/dnp/Vitamin_Basics.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=71 |pages=1–97". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niacin (vitamin B3)===
Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as niacin, includes both [[nicotinamide]] as well as [[nicotinic acid]], both of which function in many [[Biological oxidizer|biological oxidization]] and reduction reactions within the body. These functions include the [[Biodegradation|biochemical degradation]] of carbohydrates, [[Lipid|fats]] and [[protein]]s. Niacin is also involved in the synthesis of [[fatty acids]] and [[cholesterol]],&lt;ref name="kilo"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/123-149_150.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=123 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are known mediators of brain biochemistry, and in effect, of cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19990615)56:6&lt;565::AID-JNR2&gt;3.0.CO;2-H |title=Essential fatty acids are mediators of brain biochemistry and cognitive functions |year=1999 |last1=Yehuda |first1=Shlomo |last2=Rabinovitz |first2=Sharon |last3=Mostofsky |first3=David I. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Research |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=565–70 |pmid=10374811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufficient niacin intake is either obtained from diet, or synthesized from the [[amino acid]] [[tryptophan]].&lt;ref name="kilo"/&gt;

====Deficiencies====
[[File:Pellagra2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Pellagra initially presents as dermatitis]]
Severe niacin deficiency typically manifests itself as the disease [[pellagra]].&lt;ref name="kilo"/&gt; Synthesis of B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from tryptophan involves [[Riboflavin|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, so deficiencies in either of these nutrients can lead to niacin deficiency. An excess of [[leucine]], an [[essential amino acid]], in the diet can also interfere with tryptophan conversion and subsequently result in a B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name= lima&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2004.01959.x |title=Pellagra: Dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea |year=2004 |last1=Hegyi |first1=Juraj |last2=Schwartz |first2=Robert A. |last3=Hegyi |first3=Vladimir |journal=International Journal of Dermatology |volume=43 |pages=1–5 |pmid=14693013 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pellagra is most common to populations within developing countries in which [[corn]] is the dietary [[Staple food|staple]]. The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries, yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa.&lt;ref name="kilo"/&gt; This is in part due to the bound form of niacin that unprocessed corn contains, which is not readily absorbed into the human body. The processes involved in making corn [[tortillas]], can release the bound niacin into a more absorbable form. Pellagra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way, but is a problem in other countries where unprocessed corn is main source of caloric intake.&lt;ref name= mike&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1041610205001961 |title=Metabolic and endocrinological causes of dementia |year=2005 |last1=Flicker |first1=Leon |last2=Ames |first2=David |journal=International Psychogeriatrics |volume=17 |pages=S79–92 |pmid=16240485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though pellagra predominantly occurs in [[Developing country|developing countries]], sporadic cases of pellagra may be observed within industrialized nations, primarily in chronic alcoholics and patients living with functional absorption complications.&lt;ref name="lima"/&gt;

====Symptoms====
Pellagra is classically characterized by four 4 "D's": diarrhea, [[dermatitis]], dementia, and death.&lt;ref name="lima"/&gt; Neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra include headache, irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, hallucinations, stupor, apathy, psychomotor unrest, photophobia, tremor, ataxia, spastic paresis, fatigue, and depression. Symptoms of fatigue and insomnia may progress to encephalopathy characterized by confusion, memory loss, and psychosis.&lt;ref name="lima"/&gt;

Those afflicted with pellagra may undergo pathological alterations in the nervous system. Findings may include [[Myelin|demylenation]] and degeneration of various affected parts of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral [[nerves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=21433862 |year=1939 |last1=Zimmerman |first1=HM |title=The Pathology of the Nervous System in Vitamin Deficiencies |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–28.7 |pmc=2602501 |journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Prognosis of deficiency is excellent with treatment. Without, pellagra will gradually progress and lead to death within 4–5 years, often a result of [[malnutrition]] from prolonged diarrhea, or complications as caused by concurrent infections or neurological symptoms. Symptoms of pellagra can be cured with [[Exogeny|exogenous administration]] of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide.&lt;ref name="lima"/&gt;

[[Flushing (physiology)|Flushing]] occurs in many patients treated therapeutically with nicotinic acid,&lt;ref name="kilo_page_b"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/123-149_150.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=123 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result, nicotinamide holds more clinical value as it is not associated with the same uncomfortable flushing. The adult dose of nicotinamide is 100&amp;nbsp;mg taken orally every 6 hours until resolution of major acute symptoms, followed with oral administration of 50&amp;nbsp;mg every 8–12 hours until skin lesions heal. For children, treatment involves oral ingestion of 10–15&amp;nbsp;mg of nicotinamide, depending on weight, every 6 hours until signs and symptoms are resolved. Severe cases require 1&amp;nbsp;gram every 3–4 hours, administered [[parenterally]].&lt;ref name="lima"/&gt;

Oral nicotinamide has been promoted as an over-the-counter drug for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's dementia]]. Conversely, no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug, as nicotinamide administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimer's, vascular, or fronto-temporal types. This evidence suggests that nicotinamide may treat dementia as related to pellagra, but administration does not effectively treat other types of dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s007020070011 |title=No evidence for cognitive improvement from oral nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in dementia |year=2000 |last1=Rainer |first1=M. |last2=Kraxberger |first2=E. |last3=Haushofer |first3=M. |last4=Mucke |first4=H.

====Prevention====
The best method of prevention is to each food rich in B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Generally, this involves the intake of a protein-rich diet. Foods that contain high concentrations of niacin in the free form include beans and organ meat, as well as enriched grain and cereal products.&lt;ref name="kilo"/&gt; While niacin is present in corn and other grains, the [[bioavailability]] of the nutrient is much less than it is in protein-rich sources. Different methods of processing corn may result in a higher degree of bioavailability of the vitamin.&lt;ref name="mike"/&gt;

Though treatment with niacin does little to alter the effects of Alzheimer's dementia, niacin intake from foods is inversely associated with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.025858 |title=Dietary niacin and the risk of incident Alzheimer's disease and of cognitive decline |year=2004 |last1=Morris |first1=M C |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=8 |pages=1093–1099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folate (vitamin B9)===
Folate deficiency can disrupt neurulation and neurogenesis. Maternal folic acid intake around the time of conception prevents neural tube defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Milunsky A. |author2=Jick H. |author3=Jick S. S. |author4=Bruell C.

However the European Union does not have mandatory folic acid fortification. Although the protective effects of folic acid are well documented, there remains legitimate concern that fortification could lead to toxic levels in a subset of the population. For example, elevated levels of folic acid can interact with vitamin B12 deficiency to cause neurodegeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Blasko I. |author2=Hinterberger M. |author3=Kemmler G. |author4=Jungwirth S. |author5=Krampla W. |author6=Leitha T. |author7=Fischer P. | year = 2012 | title = Conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia: influence of folic acid and vitamin B12 use in the VITA cohort | url = | journal = The Journal of Nutrition, Health &amp; Aging | volume = 16 | issue = 8| pages = 687–694 | doi=10.1007/s12603-012-0051-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, folic acid and iron can interact to exacerbate malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Titaley C.

Folic acid is the most oxidized and stable form of folate, and can also be referred to as vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;. It rarely occurs naturally in foods, but it is the form used in vitamin supplements as well as fortified food products.&lt;ref name="november"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/196-305_150.pdf  |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=196 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folate coenzymes are involved in numerous conversion processes within the body, including DNA synthesis and amino acid interconversions.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; play a vital role in the synthesis of [[S-Adenosyl methionine|S-adenosylmethionine]], which is of key importance in the maintenance and repairment of all cells, including neurons.&lt;ref name="oscar p230-5"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1865312 |year=1991 |last1=Hauck |first1=MR |title=Cognitive abilities of preschool children: Implications for nurses working with young children |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=230–5 |journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, folate has been linked to the maintenance of adequate brain levels of cofactors necessary for chemicals reactions that lead to the synthesis of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt;

Folate has a major, but indirect role in activities which help to direct gene expression and [[Cell growth|cell proliferation]]. These activities occur at a greatly increased rate during [[pregnancy]], and depend on adequate levels of folate within [[blood plasma]].&lt;ref name= papa&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11475447 |year=2001 |last1=Moyers |first1=S |last2=Bailey |first2=LB |title=Fetal malformations and folate metabolism: Review of recent evidence |volume=59 |issue=7 |pages=215–24 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2001.tb07013.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentrations of blood plasma folate and [[homocysteine]] concentrations are inversely related, such that an increase in dietary folate decreases homocysteine concentration. Thus, dietary intake of folate is a major determinant of homocysteine levels within the body.&lt;ref name= quebec&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=16210710 |year=2005 |author1=Homocysteine Lowering Trialists' Collaboration |title=Dose-dependent effects of folic acid on blood concentrations of homocysteine: A meta-analysis of the randomized trials |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=806–12 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autoantibodies]] against [[folate receptor alpha]] have been found in up to 75% of children with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frye|first=R. E.|last2=Sequeira|first2=J.

====Deficiencies====
Folate deficiency most commonly arises from insufficient folate intake from the diet, but may also stem from inefficient absorption or metabolic utilization of folate, usually a result of genetic variation.&lt;ref name= zulu&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004514 |chapter=Folic acid with or without vitamin B12 for cognition and dementia |title=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2003 |last1=Malouf |first1=R|authorlink2=John Grimley Evans |last2=Grimley Evans |first2=J |last3=Areosa Sastre |first3=A |editor1-last=Malouf |editor1-first=Reem}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between folate and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is so interdependent that deficiency in either vitamin can result in [[megaloblastic anemia]], characterized by organic mental change.&lt;ref name= romeo&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9155210 |year=1996 |last1=Bottiglieri |first1=T |title=Folate, vitamin B12, and neuropsychiatric disorders |volume=54 |issue=12 |pages=382–90 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1996.tb03851.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of neural tube transformation into structures that will eventually develop into the central nervous system is known as [[neurulation]], the success of which is dependent on the presence of folate within the body. This process begins in the human approximately 21 days after [[fertilisation|conception]], and is completed by 28 days. Thus, a woman may not even be aware of her pregnancy by the time the process of neurulation is complete, potentially causing severe consequences in the development of the fetus.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt;

Functional problems in the absorption and utilization of vitamins may also play a role in folate deficiencies within the elderly.&lt;ref name="oscar p230-5" /&gt;

====Symptoms====
[[File:Anencephaly side.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Anencephaly is the most common presentation of neural tube defects&lt;ref name="dingus"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199911113412006 |title=Neural-Tube Defects |year=1999 |last1=Botto |first1=Lorenzo D. |last2=Moore |first2=Cynthia A. |last3=Khoury |first3=Muin J. |last4=Erickson |first4=J.

The link between levels of folate and altered mental function is not large, but is sufficient enough to suggest a causal association.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Deficiency in folate can cause an elevation of homocysteine within the blood,&lt;ref name="quebec"/&gt; as the clearance of homocysteine requires enzymatic action dependent on folate, and to a lesser extent, vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Elevated homocysteine has been associated with increased risk of [[Stroke|vascular events]], as well as dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=15213037 |year=2004 |last1=Quadri |first1=P |last2=Fragiacomo |first2=C |last3=Pezzati |first3=R |last4=Zanda |first4=E |last5=Forloni |first5=G |last6=Tettamanti |first6=M |last7=Lucca |first7=U |title=Homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B-12 in mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=114–22 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences lie in the presentation of megaloblastic anemia induced by either folate or B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; generally results in peripheral neuropathy, whereas folate-related anemia often results in affective, or mood disorders.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.281.6247.1036 |title=The neuropsychiatry of megaloblastic anaemia |year=1980 |last1=Shorvon |first1=S D |last2=Carney |first2=M W |last3=Chanarin |first3=I |last4=Reynolds |first4=E H |journal=BMJ |volume=281 |issue=6247 |pages=1036–8 |pmid=6253016 |pmc=1714413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurological effects are not often associated with folate-related megaloblastic anemia, although demyelinating disorders may eventually present.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt; In one study, mood disturbances were recorded for the majority of patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; In addition, folate concentrations within blood plasma have been found to be lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups. In addition, depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard [[Antidepressant|antidepressant therapy]] than did those with normal levels within plasma.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; However, replication of these findings are less robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12042457 |year=2002 |last1=Bryan |first1=J |last2=Calvaresi |first2=E |last3=Hughes |first3=D |title=Short-term folate, vitamin B-12 or vitamin B-6 supplementation slightly affects memory performance but not mood in women of various ages |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=1345–56 |journal=The Journal of Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of folic acid during pregnancy is vital to normal development of the nervous system in the fetus. A deficiency in folate levels of a pregnant woman could potentially result in [[Neural tube defects|neural tube disorder]], a debilitating condition in which the tubes of the central nervous system do not fuse entirely.&lt;ref name="papa"/&gt; NTDs are not to be confused with [[spina bifida]], which does not involve neural elements.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Neural tube defects can present in a number of ways as a result of the improper closure at various points of the neural tube. The clinical spectrum of the disorder includes [[encephalocele]], craniorachischisis, and [[anencephaly]]. In addition, these defects can also be classified as open, if neural tissue is exposed or covered only by membrane, or can be classified as closed, if the tissue is covered by normal skin.&lt;ref name="dingus"/&gt;

Intake of the vitamin has been linked to deficits in [[learning]] and memory, particularly within the elderly population.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Elderly people deficient in folate may present with deficits in free recall and recognition, which suggests that levels of folate may be related to efficacy of episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.11.3.487 |title=Effects of serum vitamin B-sub-1-sub-2 and folate status on episodic memory performance in very old age: A population-based study |year=1996 |last1=Wahlin |first1=Åke |last2=Hill |first2=Robert D. |last3=Winblad |first3=Bengt |last4=Bäckman |first4=Lars |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=487–96 |pmid=8893317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Lack of adequate folate may produce a form of dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin. Indeed, there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment. In a 3-year longitudinal study of men and women aged 50–70 years with elevated homocysteine plasma concentration, researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800μg resulted in an increase in folate levels and a decrease in homocysteine levels within blood plasma. In addition to these results, improvements of memory, and information-processing speed, as well as slight improvements of [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] speed were observed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60109-3 |title=Effect of 3-year folic acid supplementation on cognitive function in older adults in the FACIT trial: A randomised, double blind, controlled trial |year=2007 |last1=Durga |first1=Jane |last2=Van Boxtel |first2=Martin PJ |last3=Schouten |first3=Evert G |last4=Kok |first4=Frans J |last5=Jolles |first5=Jelle |last6=Katan |first6=Martijn B |last7=Verhoef |first7=Petra |journal=The Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |pages=208–216 |pmid=17240287}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance.

However, while the amount of cognitive improvement after treatment with folate is correlated with the severity of folate deficiency, the severity of cognitive decline is independent of the severity of folate deficiency. This suggests that the dementia observed may not be entirely related to levels of folate, as there could be additional factors that were not accounted for which might have an effect.&lt;ref name="oscar p1-13"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18653121 |year=1998 |last1=Fioravanti |first1=M |last2=Ferrario |first2=E |last3=Massaia |first3=M |last4=Cappa |first4=G |last5=Rivolta |first5=G |last6=Grossi |first6=E |last7=Buckley |first7=AE |title=Low folate levels in the cognitive decline of elderly patients and the efficacy of folate as a treatment for improving memory deficits |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |journal=Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics |doi=10.1016/s0167-4943(97)00028-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevention====
Because neurulation may be completed before pregnancy is recognized, it is recommended that women capable of becoming pregnant take about 400μg of folic acid from fortified foods, supplements, or a combination of the two in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; These major anomalies in the nervous system can be reduced by 85% with systematic folate supplementation occurring before the onset of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="papa"/&gt;

The incidence of Alzheimer's and other cognitive diseases has been loosely connected to deficiencies in folate. It is recommended for the elderly to consume folate through food, fortified or not, and supplements in order to reduce risk of developing the disease.&lt;ref name="oscar p1-13"/&gt;
Good sources of folate include [[Liver (food)|liver]], ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, beans, asparagus, spinach, broccoli, and orange juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2773830 |year=1989 |last1=Subar |first1=AF |last2=Block |first2=G |last3=James |first3=LD |title=Folate intake and food sources in the US population |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=508–16 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choline===
Choline is an important methyl donor involved in one-carbon metabolism that also becomes incorporated into phospholipids and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Because of its role in cellular synthesis, choline is an important nutrient during the prenatal and early postnatal development of offspring as it contributes heavily to the development of the brain.  A study found that rats that were given supplements of choline in utero or in the weeks following birth had superior memories. The changes appeared to be a result of physical changes to the [[hippocampus]], the area of the brain responsible for memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15640516 |year=2004 |last1=Zeisel |first1=SH |title=Nutritional importance of choline for brain development |volume=23 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=621S–626S |journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition |doi=10.1080/07315724.2004.10719433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zeisel S. H. | year = 2006 | title = The fetal origins of memory: the role of dietary choline in optimal brain development | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 149 | issue = 5| pages = S131–S136 | doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2006.06.065 | pmid=17212955 | pmc=2430654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, choline can reduce some of the deleterious effects of folate deficiency on neurogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Craciunescu C. N. |author2=Johnson A. R. |author3=Zeisel S. H. | year = 2010 | title = Dietary choline reverses some, but not all, effects of folate deficiency on neurogenesis and apoptosis in fetal mouse brain | url = | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 140 | issue = 6| pages = 1162–1166 | doi=10.3945/jn.110.122044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While choline during development is important, adult levels of choline are also important.  Choline has been shown to increase the synthesis and release of acetylcholine from neurons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.6867732 |title=Choline and cholinergic neurons |year=1983 |last1=Blusztajn |first1=J. |last2=Wurtman |first2=R. |journal=Science |volume=221 |issue=4611 |pages=614–20 |pmid=6867732|bibcode=1983Sci...221..614B }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn increases memory.  A [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind study]] was conducted using normal college students (no neurological disorders).  Results showed that twenty-five [[gram]]s of [[phosphatidylcholine]] (another form of choline) created a significant improvement in [[explicit memory]], measured by a [[Serial learning|serial learning task]], however this improvement may be attributed to the improvement of slow learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00002826-199312000-00007 |title=Brief Report |year=1993 |last1=Ladd |first1=Sandra L. |last2=Sommer |first2=Susan A. |last3=Laberge |first3=Stephen |last4=Toscano |first4=William |journal=Clinical Neuropharmacology |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=540–9 |pmid=9377589}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study found that a single ten-gram oral dose of choline, given to normal volunteers (again, without neurological disorders) significantly decreased the number of trials needed to master a serial-learning word test.  This increase in memory is particularly beneficial to memory loss suffered by old age.  A study conducted on rats who, like humans, suffer from an age-related loss of memory were tested on how choline affected memory.  The results showed that rats who had a chronic low-choline diet showed greater memory loss then their same-age control counterparts, while rats who had choline-enriched diets showed a diminished memory loss compared to both the choline-low diet and control rat groups.  Furthermore, young rats who were choline-deficient performed as poorly on memory tasks as older rats while older rats that were given choline supplements performed as well as three-month-old rats.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.26.061505.111156 |title=Choline: Critical Role During Fetal Development and Dietary Requirements in Adults |year=2006 |last1=Zeisel |first1=Steven H. |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=26 |pages=229–50 |pmid=16848706 |pmc=2441939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deficiencies and treatments====
Despite the wide range of foods that choline is found in, studies have shown that the mean choline intake of men, women and children are below the [[Adequate Intake]] levels.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00246.x |title=Choline: An essential nutrient for public health |year=2009 |last1=Zeisel |first1=Steven H |last2=Da Costa |first2=Kerry-Ann |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=615–23 |pmid=19906248 |pmc=2782876}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note that not enough choline is naturally produced by the body, so diet is an important factor.  People who consume a large quantity of alcohol may be at an increased risk for choline deficiency.  [[Sex]] and age also plays a role, with [[Premenopause|premenopausal]] females being less sensitive to choline deficiency than either males or [[Postmenopause|postmenopausal]] females.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH"/&gt;  This has been theorized to be a result of premenopausal women having an increased ability to synthesize choline in some form, which has been confirmed in studies on rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M301982200 |title=A Gender-specific Role for Phosphatidylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase-derived Phosphatidylcholine in the Regulation of Plasma High Density and Very Low Density Lipoproteins in Mice |year=2003 |last1=Noga |first1=A.

Good sources of choline include liver, milk, eggs and peanuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iom.edu/Activities/Nutrition/SummaryDRIs/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/DRI_Vitamins.ashx |title=Dietary Reference Intakes |publisher=[[Institute of Medicine]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419072548/http://www.iom.edu/Activities/Nutrition/SummaryDRIs/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/DRI_Vitamins.ashx |archivedate=19 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is further evidence to suggest that choline supplements can be used to treat people who suffer from neurological disorders as well we memory defects.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"/&gt; Oral doses of [[CDP-choline]] (another form of choline) given to [[Old age|elderly]] subjects with memory deficits, but without dementia, for four weeks showed improved memory in free recall tasks, but not in recognition tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9203170 |year=1997 |last1=Alvarez |first1=XA |last2=Laredo |first2=M |last3=Corzo |first3=D |last4=Fernández-Novoa |first4=L |last5=Mouzo |first5=R |last6=Perea |first6=JE |last7=Daniele |first7=D |last8=Cacabelos |first8=R |title=Citicoline improves memory performance in elderly subjects |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=201–10 |journal=Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a second study, patients with early Alzheimer-type dementia were treated with twenty-give gram doses of phosphatidylcholine every day for six months.  Slightly improvements were shown in memory tests compared to the placebo control group.  It should be noted however that other studies conducted did not find any such improvement.

===Cobalamin (vitamin B12)===
Also known as cobalamin, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is an essential vitamin necessary for normal [[Hematopoiesis|blood formation]]. It is also important for the maintenance of neurological function and psychiatric health.&lt;ref name= sierra&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/306-356_150.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=306 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absorption of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; into the body requires adequate amounts of [[intrinsic factor]], the [[glycoprotein]] produced in the [[parietal cells]] of the stomach lining. A functioning [[small intestine]] is also necessary for the proper metabolism of the vitamin, as absorption occurs within the [[ileum]].&lt;ref name="sierra"/&gt;

B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is produced in the digestive tracts of all animals, including humans.&lt;ref name= tango&gt;{{cite book |title=Vitamin Basics: The facts about Vitamins in Nutrition |year=2007 |publisher=DSM Nutritional Products |url=http://www.dsm.com/en_US/downloads/dnp/Vitamin_Basics.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=65 |pages=1–97". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, animal-origin food is the only natural food source of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name= uniform&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.19.1.357 |title=Vitamin B12 Deficiency in the Elderly |year=1999 |last1=Baik |first1=H.W. |last2=Russell |first2=R.M. |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=19 |pages=357–77 |pmid=10448529}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, synthesis of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in the [[large intestine]], which is past the point of absorption that occurs within the small intestine. As such, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; must be obtained through diet.&lt;ref name="tango"/&gt;

====Deficiencies====
Unlike other B vitamins which are not stored in the body, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is stored in the [[liver]]. Because of this, it may take 5–10 years before a sudden dietary B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency will become apparent in a previously healthy adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.1999.00616.x |title=Atrophic gastritis during long-term omeprazole therapy affects serum vitamin B12 levels |year=1999 |last1=Schenk |last2=Kuipers |last3=Klinkenberg-Knol |last4=Bloemena |last5=Sandell |last6=Nelis |last7=Snel |last8=Festen |last9=Meuwissen |journal=Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=1343–6 |pmid=10540050 |first1=BE |first2=EJ |first3=EC |first4=EC |first5=M |first6=GF |first7=P |first8=HP |first9=SG  }}&lt;/ref&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency, also known as hypocobalaminemia, often results from complications involving absorption into the body.&lt;ref name= victor&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17043022 |year=2006 |last1=Hvas |first1=AM |last2=Nexo |first2=E |title=Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency--an update |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1506–12 |journal=Haematologica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is often associated with [[pernicious anemia]], as it is the most common cause. Pernicious anemia results from an [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune disorder]] which destroys the cells that produce [[intrinsic factor]] within the stomach lining, thereby hindering B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; absorption. B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; absorption is important for the subsequent absorption of iron, thus, people with pernicious anemia often present with typical symptoms of [[anemia]], such as pale skin, dizziness, and fatigue.&lt;ref name= whiskey&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199711133372007 |title=Pernicious Anemia |year=1997 |last1=Epstein |first1=Franklin H. |last2=Toh |first2=Ban-Hock |last3=Van Driel |first3=Ian R. |last4=Gleeson |first4=Paul A. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=337 |issue=20 |pages=1441–8 |pmid=9358143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those at highest risk for B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency are the elderly population, as 10-15% of people aged 60+ may present with some form of hypocobalaminemia. High rates of deficiency in the elderly commonly results from the decrease of functional absorption of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, as production of intrinsic factor declines with age. However, pernicious anemia is the most common cause of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency in North American and European populations.&lt;ref name="uniform"/&gt;

Those afflicted with various [[Digestive disease|gastrointestinal diseases]] may also be at risk for deficiency as a result of malabsorption. These diseases may affect production of intrinsic factor in the stomach, or of pancreatic [[bile]]. Diseases that involve disorders of the small intestine, such as celiac disease, [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ileitis]], may also reduce B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; absorption. For example, people with celiac disease may damage the microvilli within their small intestines through the consumption of gluten, thereby inhibiting absorption of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; as well as other nutrients.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt;

A diet low in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, whether voluntary or not, can also cause symptoms of hypocobalaminemia. Many rich sources of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; come from animal meats and by-products. Populations in developing countries may not have access to these foods on a consistent basis, and as a result may become deficient in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name= xray&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.24.012003.132440 |title=Vitamin B12 Deficiency As a Worldwide Problem |year=2004 |last1=Stabler |first1=Sally P. |last2=Allen |first2=Robert H. |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=24 |pages=299–326 |pmid=15189123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Veganism|vegans]], and to a lesser extent [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|vegetarians]], are at risk for consuming a diet low in cobalamin as they voluntarily abstain from animal sources of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; A combination of these two scenarios may increase prevalence of cobalamin deficit. For instance, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is problematic in India, where the majority of the population is vegetarian and the scarcity of meat consumption is common for omnivores as well.&lt;ref name="xray"/&gt;

====Symptoms====
An assortment of neurological effects can be observed in 75-90% of individuals of any age with clinically observable B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Cobalamin deficiency manifestations are apparent in the abnormalities of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, optic nerves, and [[cerebrum]]. These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of [[myelin]],&lt;ref name= yankee&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5006.1394 |title=Cerebral Manifestations of Vitamin-B12 Deficiency |year=1956 |last1=Holmes |first1=J. M. |journal=BMJ |volume=2 |issue=5006 |pages=1394–8 |pmid=13374343 |pmc=2035923}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be expressed behaviourally through reports of sensory disturbances in the extremities, or motor disturbances, such as gait ataxia. Combined myelopathy and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases. Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss, disorientation, and dementia. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes.&lt;ref name="uniform"/&gt; Mental symptoms are extremely variable, and include mild disorders of mood, mental slowness, and memory defect. Memory defect encompasses symptoms of [[Mental confusion|confusion]], severe agitation and depression, [[delusions]] and paranoid behaviour, visual and auditory [[hallucinations]], [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] and [[fecal incontinence]] in the absence of overt spinal lesions, dysphasia, violent maniacal behaviour, and epilepsy. It has been suggested that mental symptoms could be related to a decrease in cerebral metabolism, as caused by the state of deficiency.&lt;ref name="yankee"/&gt; All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes.&lt;ref name="uniform"/&gt;

Mild to moderate cases of pernicious anemia may show symptoms of bleeding [[gums]], [[headache]], poor [[Attentional control|concentration]], shortness of breath, and weakness. In severe cases of pernicious anemia, individuals may present with various cognitive problems such as dementia, and memory loss.&lt;ref name="whiskey"/&gt;

It is not always easy to determine whether B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is present, especially within older adults.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Patients may present with violent behaviour or more subtle personality changes. They may also present with vague complaints, such as fatigue or memory loss, that may be attributed to normative aging processes. Cognitive symptoms may mimic behaviour in Alzheimer's and other dementias as well.&lt;ref name="uniform"/&gt; Tests must be run on individuals presenting with such signs to confirm or negate cobalamin deficiency within the blood.&lt;ref name="whiskey"/&gt;

====Treatment====
[[File:B vitamin supplement tablets.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Individuals with absorption disorders, or those who abstain from animal products should supplement their diet with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; regularly]]
Patients deficient in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration of at least 6&amp;nbsp;mg of the vitamin in pill form. Patients who suffer from irreversible causes of deficiency, such as pernicious anemia or old age, will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Strategy for treatment is dependent on the patient's level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000&amp;nbsp;mg of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; administered [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]] daily for one week, weekly for one month, then monthly for the rest of the patient's life. Daily oral supplementation of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; mega-doses may be sufficient in reliable patients, but it is imperative that the supplementation be continued on a lifelong basis as relapse may occur otherwise.&lt;ref name="whiskey"/&gt;

The progression of neurological manifestations of cobalamin deficiency is generally gradual. As a result, early diagnosis is important or else irreversible damage may occur.&lt;ref name="sierra"/&gt; Patients who become demented usually show little to no cognitive improvement with the administration of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="whiskey"/&gt;

A deficiency in folate may produce anemia similar to the anemia resulting from B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. There is risk that folic acid administered to those with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency may mask anemic symptoms without solving the issue at hand. In this case, patients would still be at risk for neurological deficits associated with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency-related anemia, which are not associated with anemia related to folate deficiency.&lt;ref name="zulu"/&gt;

====Prevention====
In addition to meeting intake requirements through food consumption, supplementation of diet with vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is seen as a viable preventative measure for deficiency. It has been recommended for the elderly to supplement 50&amp;nbsp;mcg a day in order to prevent deficit from occurring.&lt;ref name="whiskey"/&gt;

Animal protein products are a good source of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, particularly organ meats such as [[Kidney (food)|kidney]] or liver. Other good sources are fish, eggs, and dairy products.&lt;ref name="tango"/&gt; It is suggested that vegans, who consume no animal meat or by-products, supplement their diet with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. While there are foods fortified with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; available, some may be mislabelled in an attempt to boost their nutritional claims. Products of fermentation, such as algae extracts and sea vegetables, may be labelled as sources of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, but actually contain B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; [[Structural analog|analogues]] which compete for the absorption of the nutrient itself.&lt;ref name="xray" /&gt; In order to get adequate amounts of the vitamin, orally administered pills or fortified foods such as cereals and soy milk, are recommended for vegans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1079/BJN19780089 |title=Haematological studies on vegans |year=2007 |last1=Sanders |first1=T. A. B. |last2=Ellis |first2=F. R. |last3=Dickerson |first3=J. W. T. |journal=British Journal of Nutrition |volume=40 |pages=9–15 |pmid=667007 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamin D===
Vitamin D is an essential regulator of the vitamin D receptor that controls gene transcription during development. The vitamin D receptor is strongly expressed in the substantia nigra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eyles D. W. |author2=Smith S. |author3=Kinobe R. |author4=Hewison M. |author5=McGrath J. J. | year = 2005 | title = Distribution of the vitamin D receptor and 1α-hydroxylase in human brain | url = | journal = Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 21–30 | doi=10.1016/j.jchemneu.2004.08.006|pmid=15589699 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, vitamin D deficiency can disrupt neurogenesis leading to altered dopamine signaling and increased exploratory behavior in rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kesby J.

A Finnish study found that vitamin D supplement use is associated with reduced risk of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McGrath J., Saari K., Hakko H., Jokelainen J., Jones P., Järvelin M. R., Isohanni M. | year = 2004 | title = Vitamin D supplementation during the first year of life and risk of schizophrenia: a Finnish birth cohort study | url = | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 237–245 | doi=10.1016/j.schres.2003.08.005 | pmid=14984883| last2 = Saari | last3 = Hakko | last4 = Jokelainen | last5 = Jones | last6 = Järvelin | last7 = Chant | last8 = Isohanni }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lipids==
===Fat===
Fatty acids are necessary for the synthesis of cell membranes neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules. While excessive fat intake can be harmful, deficiency of essential fatty acids can disrupt neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity.&lt;ref name="Lafourcade, M. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lafourcade M. |author2=Larrieu T. |author3=Mato S. |author4=Duffaud A. |author5=Sepers M. |author6=Matias I. |author7=Manzoni O. J. | year = 2011 | title = Nutritional omega-3 deficiency abolishes endocannabinoid-mediated neuronal functions | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 345–350 | doi=10.1038/nn.2736 | pmid=21278728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saturated fat====
Consuming large amounts of saturated fat can negatively affect the  brain.  Eating foods with saturated fats elevates the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in the body.  Studies have shown that high levels of triglycerides strongly link with mood problems such as depression, hostility and aggression.  This may occur because high triglyceride levels decrease the amount of oxygen that blood can carry to the  brain.&lt;ref name="psych"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blaun|first=Randy|author2=Andreas Wiesenack |title=How to Eat Smart|journal=Psychology Today|year=1996|volume=29|issue=3|pages=34|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200301/brain-power-why-proteins-are-smart|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Heart Association recommends that people consume no more than 16g of saturated fat daily.  Common sources of saturated fat are meat and dairy products.

====Essential fatty acids====
There are two kinds of essential fatty acids that people must consume (omega-3 and omega-6). Many academics recommend a balanced amount of omega-3s and omega-6s. However, some estimate that Americans consume twenty times more omega-6s than omega-3s. There is a theory that an imbalance of essential fatty acids may lead to mental disorders such as depression, hyperactivity and schizophrenia, but it still lacking evidences. An omega-3 deficient diet increases omega-6 levels in the brain disrupting endocannabinoid signaling in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens contributing to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice.&lt;ref name="Lafourcade, M. 2011"/&gt; [[Omega-3 fatty acid#Dietary sources|Sources of omega-3]] include flax seeds, chia seeds, walnuts, sea vegetables, green leafy vegetables, and cold water fish.  Sources of omega-6 include walnuts, hazelnuts; sunflower, safflower, corn, and sesame oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Brain-Fats|url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/fats.html|work=The Franklin Institute Online|accessdate=12 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526131629/http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/fats.html#|archive-date=26 May 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cholesterol===
While cholesterol is essential for membranes and steroid hormones, excess cholesterol affects blood flow impairing cognitive function in vascular dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moser D. J. |author2=Boles Ponto L. L. |author3=Miller I. N. |author4=Schultz S. K. |author5=Menda Y. |author6=Arndt S. |author7=Nopoulos P. C. | year = 2012 | title = Cerebral blood flow and neuropsychological functioning in elderly vascular disease patients | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 220–225 | doi=10.1080/13803395.2011.630653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbohydrates==
Studies have shown that learning and memory improve after consuming carbohydrates. There are two kinds of carbohydrates people consume: simple and complex.  Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods and release sugar into the bloodstream quickly after consumption.  Complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly and therefore cause sugar to be released into the bloodstream more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Brain-Carbohydrates|url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/carbs.html|work=The Franklin Institute Online|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Good sources of complex carbohydrates are whole-grain breads, pasta, brown rice, oatmeal, and potatoes.  It is recommended that people consume more complex carbohydrates because consuming complex carbohydrates will cause the level of sugar in the bloodstream to be more stable, which will cause less stress hormones to be released.  Consuming simple carbohydrates may cause the levels of sugar in the bloodstream to rise and fall, which can cause mood swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brain Foods|url=http://www.askdrsears.com/html/4/t040400.asp|work=Dr. Sears Official Website|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low carbohydrate ketogenic diets===
The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate is a fuel source for the brain during times of fasting when blood glucose levels fall. Although the mechanism is not understood, it is well established that eating a diet low in carbohydrates can be therapeutic for children with epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Neal E. G. |author2=Chaffe H. |author3=Schwartz R. H. |author4=Lawson M. S. |author5=Edwards N. |author6=Fitzsimmons G. |author7=Cross J.

Furthermore, a ketogenic diet can be beneficial for dementia patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Henderson S. T. | year = 2008 | title = Ketone bodies as a therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 470–480 | doi=10.1016/j.nurt.2008.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medium-chain triglyceride]]s can stimulate ketone synthesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yeh Y. Y. |author2=Zee P. | year = 1976 | title = Relation of ketosis to metabolic changes induced by acute medium-chain triglyceride feeding in rats | url = | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 106 | issue = 1| page = 58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and coconut oil is a rich source of medium chain triglycerides that several anecdotal reports suggest can improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's type dementia patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcactionnews.com/dpp/news/health/local-doctor-says-coconut-oil-helps-reduce-symptoms-of-alzheimers-disease|title=Local doctor says coconut oil helps reduce symptoms of Alzheimer's disease|first=Linda|last=Hurtado|date=5 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/spring-hill-couple-inspires-research-into-coconut-oil-for-alzheimers/2124596|title=Spring Hill couple inspires research into coconut oil for Alzheimer's patients|date=3 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protein==
When protein is consumed, it is broken down into amino acids.  These amino acids are used to produce many things like neurotransmitters, enzymes, hormones, and chromosomes.  Proteins known as complete proteins contain all eight of the essential amino acids. Meat, cheese, eggs, and yogurt are all examples of complete proteins.  Incomplete proteins contain only some of the eight essential amino acids and it is recommended that people consume a combination of these proteins.  Examples of incomplete proteins include nuts, seeds, legumes, and grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Brain-Protein|url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/proteins.html|work=The Franklin Institute Online|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When animals are fed a diet deficient in essential amino acids, uncharged tRNAs accumulate in the anterior piriform cortex signaling diet rejection [105]. The body normally interconverts amino acids to maintain homeostasis, but muscle protein can be catabolized to release amino acids during conditions of amino acid deficiency. Disruption of amino acid metabolism can affect brain development and neurophysiology to affect behavior. For example, fetal protein deficiency decreases the number of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lister J. P., Blatt G. J., DeBassio W. A., Kemper T. L., Tonkiss J., Galler J. R., Rosene D. L. | year = 2005 | title = Effect of prenatal protein malnutrition on numbers of neurons in the principal cell layers of the adult rat hippocampal formation | url = | journal = Hippocampus | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 393–403 | doi=10.1002/hipo.20065 | pmid=15669101| last2 = Blatt | last3 = Debassio | last4 = Kemper | last5 = Tonkiss | last6 = Galler | last7 = Rosene }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glutamate===
[[Glutamate]] is a [[proteinogenic amino acid]] and neurotransmitter, though it is perhaps publicly best known in its [[sodium]] [[salt]] form: [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG).  It is also a [[Glutamic acid (flavor)|flavor]] on its own, producing the [[umami]] or savory flavor found in many [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] foods such as [[cheese]].  As an amino acid it acts as a source of fuel for various cellular functions and as a neurotransmitter. Glutamate operates as an [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory neurotransmitter]] and is released when a nerve impulse excites a glutamate producing cell.  This in turn binds to neurons with glutamate receptors, stimulating them.

====Deficiencies and treatments====
Glutamate is a nutrient that is extremely difficult to be deficient in, as, being an amino acid, it is found in every food that contains protein.  Additionally it is found, as previously mentioned, in fermented foods and in foods containing monosodium glutamate.  As such, good sources of glutamate include meat, fish, dairy products and a [[Glutamic acid (flavor)#Concentration in foods|wide array]] of other foods.  Glutamate is also absorbed extremely efficiently by the intestines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Peter J. |last1=Reeds |first2=Douglas G. |last2=Burrin |first3=Barbara |last3=Stoll |first4=Farook |last4=Jahoor |title=Intestinal Glutamate Metabolism |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |pmid=10736365 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10736365 |year=2000 |volume=130 |issue=4S Suppl |pages=978S–82S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are instances of glutamate deficiency occurring, but only in cases where genetic disorders are present.  One such example is ''Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency'' and can cause either minor or profound physical and intellectual disabilities, depending on the severity of the condition.  This disorder is extremely rare however, as only twenty people have so far been identified with this condition.&lt;ref&gt;http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/glutamate-formiminotransferase-deficiency{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glutamate, while critically important in the body also acts as an [[Excitotoxicity|excitotoxin]] in high concentrations not normally found outside of laboratory conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0896-6273(95)90186-8 |title=Glutamate-induced neuronal death: A succession of necrosis or apoptosis depending on mitochondrial function |year=1995 |last1=Ankarcrona |first1=Maria |last2=Dypbukt |first2=Jeannette M. |last3=Bonfoco |first3=Emanuela |last4=Zhivotovsky |first4=Boris |last5=Orrenius |first5=Sten |last6=Lipton |first6=Stuart A. |last7=Nicotera |first7=Pierluigi |journal=Neuron |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=961–73 |pmid=7576644}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can occur following [[brain injury]] or [[spinal cord injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.12.010 |title=Mechanisms of chronic central neuropathic ''pain after'' spinal cord injury |year=2009 |last1=Hulsebosch |first1=Claire E. |last2=Hains |first2=Bryan C. |last3=Crown |first3=Eric D. |last4=Carlton |first4=Susan M. |journal=Brain Research Reviews |volume=60 |pages=202–13 |pmid=19154757 |issue=1 |pmc=2796975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phenylalanine===
L-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids, and beta-[[phenethylamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broadley|first=KJ|title=The vascular effects of trace amines and amphetamines.|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|date=March 2010|volume=125|issue=3|pages=363–75|pmid=19948186|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; L-tyrosine in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenethylamine is further converted into N-methylphenethylamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pendleton|first=RG|author2=Gessner, G |author3=Sawyer, J |title=Studies on lung N-methyltransferases, a pharmacological approach.|journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology|date=September 1980|volume=313|issue=3|pages=263–8|pmid=7432557|doi=10.1007/BF00505743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier, and, in large quantities, interferes with the production of serotonin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pascucci T., Ventura R., Puglisi-Allegra S., Cabib S. | year = 2002 | title = Deficits in brain serotonin synthesis in a genetic mouse model of phenylketonuria | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 13 | issue = 18| pages = 2561–2564 | pmid = 12499868 | last2 = Ventura | last3 = Puglisi-Allegra | last4 = Cabib | doi =  10.1097/00001756-200212200-00036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phenylketonuria====
Toxic levels of phenylalanine accumulate in the brains of patients with [[phenylketonuria]] leading to severe brain damage and mental retardation. To prevent brain damage, these individuals can restrict dietary phenylalanine intake by avoiding protein and supplementing their diet with essential amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thompson A. J., Tillotson S., Smith I., Kendall B., Moore S. G., Brenton D. P. | year = 1993 | title = Brain MRI changes in phenylketonuria: associations with dietary status | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 116 | issue = 4| pages = 811–821 | doi=10.1093/brain/116.4.811| last2 = Tillotson | last3 = Smith | last4 = Kendall | last5 = Moore | last6 = Brenton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14171">'''Nutritional rating systems''' are methods of ranking or rating food products or food categories to communicate the nutritional value of food in a simplified manner to a target audience. Rating systems are developed by governments, nonprofit organizations, or private institutions and companies.

The methods may use point systems to rank or rate foods for general nutritional value or they may rate specific food attributes such as [[cholesterol]] content. Graphics or other symbols may be used to communicate the ratings to the target audience.

Nutritional rating systems differ from [[Nutrition facts label|nutritional labeling]] in that they attempt to simplify food choices, rather than listing specific amounts of nutrients or ingredients. [[Dietary guidelines]] are similar to nutritional rating systems in that they attempt to simplify the communication of nutritional information, however, they do not rate individual food products.

== Systems in use today ==

===Glycemic index===
[[Glycemic index]] is a ranking of how quickly [[food]] is metabolized into [[glucose]] when digested. It compares available [[carbohydrate]]s gram for gram in individual foods, providing a numerical, evidence-based index of postprandial (post-meal) [[Blood sugar|glycemia]]. The concept was invented by Dr. [[David J. Jenkins]] and colleagues in 1981 at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;Brouns ''et al.'' (2005). "Glycaemic index methodology." ''Nutrition Research Reviews'' '''18'''; 145-171&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycemic load]] (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's [[blood glucose level]] after eating it.

===Guiding Stars===
Guiding Stars is patented food rating system that rates food based on [[nutrient density]] using a scientific [[algorithm]]. Foods are credited for [[vitamins]], minerals, [[dietary fibre]], whole grains, and [[Omega-3 fatty acids]], and debited for [[saturated fats]], [[trans fats]], added sodium ([[salt]]) and [[added sugar]]. Rated foods are marked with tags indicating one, two or three stars. The  program first launched a Hannaford Supermarkets in 2006, and is currently found in about 1,900 supermarkets in the US and Canada. Guiding Stars has also expanded into public schools, colleges and hospitals.&lt;ref name="guidingstars"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://guidingstars.ca/about/ | title=About | publisher=Guiding Stars Licensing Company | accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence-based proprietary algorithm is based on the dietary guidelines and recommendations of regulatory and health organizations including the US [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[US Department of Agriculture]], and the [[World Health Organization]]. It was developed by a scientific advisory panel composed of experts in nutrition and health from [[Dartmouth College]], [[Harvard University]], [[Tufts University]], [[University of North Carolina]] and other colleges.&lt;ref name="guidingstars" /&gt;

===Nutripoints===
Nutripoints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutripoints.com/ |title=nutripoints.com |publisher=nutripoints.com |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a system for rating foods on a numerical scale for their overall nutritional value. The method is based on an analysis of 26 positive (such as vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber) and negative factors (such as cholesterol, saturated fat, sugar, sodium) compared to the calories in the food. The overall Nutripoint score of the food is the result. The higher the value, the more nutrition per calorie (nutrient density) and the least negative factors in the food. Thus, the higher the Nutripoint score, the better the food for overall health. The system rates 3600+ foods including basic foods like apples and oranges, fast-foods, and brand-name foods.

Nutripoints was developed by Dr. Roy E. Vartabedian (a Doctor of Public Health) in the 1980s and was released to the general public in 1990 with his book, "Nutripoints," published in 13 countries and 10 languages worldwide. The food rating system is part of an overall program designed to help people measure, balance, and upgrade their diet's nutritional quality for overall health improvement and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nutripoints: Healthy Eating Made Simple! (1990&amp;ndash;2010) |url= http://www.nutripoints.com/  |publisher= Nutripoints.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition iQ===
The Nutrition iQ program is a joint venture of the Joslin Clinic and multi-banner supermarket operator [[SuperValu (United States)|Supervalu]].  The labeling system consists of color-coded tags denoting a food product's superior status with respect to attributes such as vitamin and mineral content, fiber content, 100% juice content, Omega-3 or low saturated fat content, whole grain content, calcium content, protein content, low or reduced sodium content and low or reduced caloric content.  The first phase of the program launched in 2009 covering center store food products, with coverage of fresh food departments rolling out in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110113005149/en/Fresh-Ideas-Healthy-Eating-SUPERVALU%C2%AE-Expands-%E2%80%9Cnutrition |title=Fresh Ideas for Healthy Eating: SUPERVALU Expands "nutrition iQ" Program, SUPERVALU, January 13, 2011 |publisher=Businesswire.com |date=2011-01-13 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===POINTS Food System===
[[Weight Watchers]] developed the POINTS Food System for use with their Flex Plan. Healthy weight control is the primary objective of the system. The system is designed to allow customers to eat any food while tracking the number of points for each food consumed. Members try to keep to their POINTS Target, a number of points for a given time frame. The daily POINTS Target is personalized based on members' height, weight and other factors, such as gender. A weekly allowance for points is also established to provide for special occasions, mistakes, etc.&lt;ref name=WeightWatchers&gt;{{cite journal |author=WeightWatchers website. |title=The Flex plan and the Core Plan: Food plans tailored to fit your life. |journal=weightwatchers.com |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naturally Nutrient Rich (NNR) ===
Developed by [[Adam Drewnowski]], University of Washington, NNR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drewnowski|first=Adam|title=Concept of a nutritious food: toward a nutrient density score|url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/82/4/721.abstract|publisher=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|accessdate=Jan 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "is based on mean percentage daily values (DVs) for 14 nutrients in 2000 kcal food, can be used to assign nutrient density values to foods within and across food groups. Use of the NNR score allows consumers to identify and select nutrient-dense foods while permitting some flexibility where the discretionary calories are concerned."

===ReViVer Score===
Developed by ReViVer, a nutritionally-oriented restaurant in New York City,&lt;ref name="Walt Street Journal"&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/articles/reviver-serves-healthy-food-backed-by-science-1407203647/ "ReViVer Serves Healthy Food Backed By Science"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', August 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  the ReViVer Score expresses the nutrient density of menu items from a variety of fast food and casual restaurants, based on the amount of 10 nutrients (Vitamins A, C, and E, folate, calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, fiber, and omega-3 fats) per calorie. A score of 100 indicates that the meal provides at least 100% of the recommended daily intake for all ten nutrients, proportionate to the energy (calorie) content of the meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ReViVer Score|url=http://revivernyc.com#TheReviverScore |accessdate=Aug 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score allows consumers to compare the nutritional quality of various restaurant offerings with similar calorie content.

===Nutrient Per Calorie===
Developed by Efficiency Is Everything, a Data Science website.&lt;ref name="Efficiency Is Everything"&gt;[http://efficiencyiseverything.com/nutrient-per-calorie/ "Nutrients Per Calorie – Math Proves The Healthiest Lowest Calorie Foods"] ''[[Efficiency Is Everything]]'', October 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  This expresses the amount of micronutrients in produce per the caloric value based on 40+ vitamins and minerals. Based off a sum of each nutrient vs that nutrients maximum value per calorie, Spinach, Parsely, Romaine Lettuce, and turnip greens top the list. This allows consumers to compare the nutritional quality of various produce.

==Systems used in the past==

===Smart Choices Program===
Launched late in 2009, the Smart Choices Program (SCP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Choices Program|url=http://www.smartchoicesprogram.com/|accessdate=Jan 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a rating system developed by a coalition of companies from the food industry. The criteria for rating food products used 18 different attributes, however, the system had varying levels of acceptability based on 16 types of food which allowed for wide discretion in the selection of foods to include in the program. The program was discontinued in October 2009 after sharp criticism for including products such as "Froot Loops", "Lucky Charms" and "Frosted Flakes" as Smart Choices.&lt;ref name"smart choice"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| last = MacVean| first = Mary| title = 'Smart Choice' food label: a sign of nutrition or marketing?| work = Los Angeles Times| date = 2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=suspended&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Neuman| first = William| title = ‘Smart Choices’ Food Labeling Loses Support| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-08-24| date = 2009-10-23| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/business/24food.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the backlash from the program, [[General Mills]] announced on December 10, 2009 that it would reduce the amount of sugar in many of its cereal brands.

====Announcement of Closure====
On August 19, 2009, the FDA wrote a letter to SCP manager, saying: "FDA and FSIS would be concerned if any FOP labeling systems used criteria that were not stringent enough to protect consumers against misleading claims; were inconsistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans; or had the effect of encouraging consumers to choose highly processed foods and refined grains instead of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Michael R.|author2=Jerold R. Mande |title=Label Claims - Letter to the Smart Choces Program|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/LabelClaims/ucm180146.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=August 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCP was suspended in 2009 after the FDA's announcement that they will be addressing both on front-of- package and on-shelf systems. SCP Chair Mike Hughes said: "It is more appropriate to postpone active operations and channel our information and learnings to the agency to support their initiative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Mike|title=Smart Choices Program Postpones Active Operations|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smart-choices-program-postpones-active-operations-65809752.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=Jan 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Claimed Rigor====
Smart Choices Program "was developed by a coalition of scientists and nutrition educators, experts with experience with dietary guidelines, public health organizations, and food manufacturers in response to consumer confusion over multiple front-of-the-package systems based on different criteria. Representatives from different government organizations acted as observers. The process of developing the program was facilitated by the nonprofit Keystone Center, an organization that develops consensus solutions to complex health and social policy changes. The nutrition criteria for receiving the SCP icon are specific for product category by indicating "smarter" products within that category. A calorie indicator noting calories per serving and servings per package accompanies the SCP icon to remind consumers that calories do count, even for smarter food choices. For a product to qualify, it first has to be below the threshold for "nutrients to limit" and then (in most cases) it must be above the threshold for one or more nutrients or food groups to encourage. The criteria are based on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines and other consensus science and are transparent and available on the SCP website."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6266">'''Occupational rehabilitation''' is the science and practices of returning injured workers to a level of work activity that is appropriate to their functional and cognitive capacity, both of which are influenced by the severity of a worker's injuries.

== Professionals involved ==
; [[Occupational therapist]]s&lt;ref name="Keough"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoefsmit2012/&gt;
: The role of occupational therapists in the workplace is to facilitate individuals’ ability to return to work. Occupational therapists assist their clients in reaching their maximum level of function with the aim of meeting the physical and emotional demands of their job. Occupational therapists are also qualified to make recommendations to employers on how to downgrade job demands to meet the functional status of an employee in order to prevent further injury during occupational rehabilitation. Individual functional capacity evaluations are used to screen for [[person-environment fit]]. Industrial occupational therapists use a collaborative approach involving the workers and employers to encourage a supportive work environment that empowers the worker to reach productivity and other work related goals.&lt;ref name="Keough"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keough |first1=Jeremy L. |last2=Fisher |first2=Thomas F. |date=2001 |title=Occupational-psychosocial perceptions influencing return to work and functional performance of injured workers |journal=Work |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=101-110 |pmid=12441463 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational therapy interventions in occupational rehabilitation include developing assertiveness; communication and interpersonal skills; controlling anger; and stress management.&lt;ref name="Keough"/&gt;

== For common mental disorders ==
{{See also | Psychiatric rehabilitation }}
Many workers have an increased risk of developing common mental disorders (CMDs) in the workplace due to job stressors such as job insecurity, bullying or psychological harassment, low social support at work, employee perceptions of fairness in the workplace, and an imbalance between job demands and rewards.  These CMDs may include anxiety disorders, alcohol dependence, addiction-related disorders, suicidal ideation, and depression &lt;ref name="LaMontagne"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LaMontagne |first1=Anthony D. |last2=Martin |first2=Angela |last3=Page |first3=Kathryn M. |last4=Reavley |first4=Nicola J. |last5=Noblet |first5=Andrew J. |last6=Milner |first6=Allison J. |last7=Keegel |first7=Tessa |last8=Smith |first8=Peter M. |date=9 May 2014 |title=Workplace mental health: developing an integrated intervention approach |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=14 |page=131 |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-14-131 |pmid=24884425 |pmc=4024273 |url=https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-14-131 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaches ===
A symptom of CMDs is having disorganized and deteriorated habits. Therefore, during work rehabilitation, occupational therapists and/or other rehabilitation professionals often use a graded environment, intentionally eliminating barriers to increase individuals’ performance and self-esteem. An integrative approach, based on the three key disciplines of medicine, public health, and psychology, is being utilized by occupational therapists to reduce job stressors and improve the psychological well-being of employees with CMDs.&lt;ref name="LaMontagne"/&gt; The purpose of an integrative approach is to prevent further harm to the employee and to learn how to manage the illness through health promotion, [[occupational psychology]], positive psychology management, psychiatry, and [[occupational medicine]].&lt;ref name="LaMontagne"/&gt;

Cognitive work hardening programs administered by occupational therapists using the Canadian Model of Client-Centered Enablement (CMCE) improve return to work outcomes of employees suffering from depression. Cognitive work hardening incorporates meaningful occupations or work tasks that are graded to fit individual needs within an environment that is supportive in order to improve self-worth. Cognitive work hardening programs are individualized to promote interpersonal communication and coping skills within a real-life work setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wisenthal |first1=Adeena |last2=Krupa |first2=Terry |date=2013 |title=Cognitive work hardening: a return-to-work intervention for people with depression. Work |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=423-430 |doi=10.3233/wor-131635 |pmid=23676328 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stimulating Healthy Participation and Relapse Prevention (SHARP) approach is used for individuals with CMDs who experience many sick absences from work. The SHARP approach encompasses five steps including:  listing positive and negative situations encountered in the workplace; solutions to negative situations or problems; support need for solutions; planning how to implement solutions; and evaluation of implementation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arends |first1=Iris |last2=Bultmann |first2=Ute |last3=Nielsen |first3=Karina |last4=van Rhenen |first4=Willem |last5=de Boer |first5=Michiel R. |last6=van der Klink |first6=Jac J.L.

'''Phytic acid''' (known as '''inositol hexakisphosphate''' ('''IP6'''), '''inositol polyphosphate''', or '''phytate''' when in [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] form) is the phosphate ester of [[inositol]]. It contains six phosphate groups.  At physiological pH, these phosphates are partially ionized.  The resulting anion is a colorless species that has significant nutritional role as the principal storage form of [[phosphorus]] in many [[plant]] [[Biological tissue|tissue]]s, especially [[bran]] and [[seed]]s.&lt;ref name="schlemmer"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19774556|year=2009|last1=Schlemmer|first1=U.|title=Phytate in foods and significance for humans: Food sources, intake, processing, bioavailability, protective role and analysis|journal=Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research|volume=53 Suppl 2|pages=S330–75|last2=Frølich|first2=W.|last3=Prieto|first3=R.

==Significance in agriculture==
Phosphorus and inositol in phytate form are not, in general, [[bioavailability|bioavailable]] to non[[ruminant]] animals because these animals lack the digestive [[enzyme]] [[phytase]] required to hydrolyze (break) the inositol-phosphate linkages.

Also, viable low-phytic acid mutant lines have been developed in several crop species in which the seeds have drastically reduced levels of phytic acid and concomitant increases in inorganic phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Guttieri MJ, Peterson KM, Souza EJ |doi=10.2135/cropsci2006.03.0137 |title=Milling and Baking Quality of Low Phytic Acid Wheat | journal=Crop Science |volume=46 |pages=2403–8|issue=6|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, germination problems have reportedly hindered the use of these cultivars thus far. This may be due to phytic acid's critical role in both phosphorus and metal ion storage.{{Citation needed|date=April  2007}} Phytate variants also have the potential to be used in soil remediation, to immobilize [[uranium]], nickel and other inorganic contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seaman JC, Hutchison JM, Jackson BP, Vulava VM | title = In situ treatment of metals in contaminated soils with phytate | journal = Journal of Environmental Quality | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 153–61 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12549554 | doi = 10.2134/jeq2003.0153 }}{&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological and physiological roles==
Although indigestible for many animals, phytic acid and its metabolites as they occur in seeds and grains have several important roles for the seedling plant.

Most notably, phytic acid functions as a phosphorus store, as an energy store, as a source of cations and as a source of myoinositol (a cell wall precursor). Phytic acid is the principal storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds.&lt;ref name="Reddy"&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Reddy NR, Sathe SK, Salunkhe DK | title = Phytates in legumes and cereals | journal = Advances in Food Research | volume = 28 | pages = 1–92 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6299067 | doi = 10.1016/s0065-2628(08)60110-x | isbn = 9780120164288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In animal cells, myoinositol polyphosphates are ubiquitous, and phytic acid (myoinositol hexakisphosphate) is the most abundant, with its concentration ranging from 10 to 100 µM in mammalian cells, depending on cell type and developmental stage.&lt;ref name="Szwergold"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szwergold BS, Graham RA, Brown TR | title = Observation of inositol pentakis- and hexakis-phosphates in mammalian tissues by 31P NMR | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 149 | issue = 3 | pages = 874–81 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3426614 | doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(87)90489-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sasakawa"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sasakawa N, Sharif M, Hanley MR | title = Metabolism and biological activities of inositol pentakisphosphate and inositol hexakisphosphate | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–46 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7543266 | doi = 10.1016/0006-2952(95)00059-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This compound is not obtained from the animal diet, but must be synthesized inside the cell from phosphate and inositol (which in turn is produced from glucose, usually in the kidneys). The interaction of intracellular phytic acid with specific intracellular proteins has been investigated ''in vitro'', and these interactions have been found to result in the inhibition or potentiation of the physiological activities of those proteins.&lt;ref name="Hanakahi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanakahi LA, Bartlet-Jones M, Chappell C, Pappin D, West SC | title = Binding of inositol phosphate to DNA-PK and stimulation of double-strand break repair | journal = Cell | volume = 102 | issue = 6 | pages = 721–9 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11030616 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00061-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norris FA, Ungewickell E, Majerus PW | title = Inositol hexakisphosphate binds to clathrin assembly protein 3 (AP-3/AP180) and inhibits clathrin cage assembly in vitro | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 270 | issue = 1 | pages = 214–7 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7814377 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.270.1.214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best evidence from these studies suggests an intracellular role for phytic acid as a cofactor in DNA repair by nonhomologous end-joining.&lt;ref name="Hanakahi"/&gt; Other studies using yeast mutants have also suggested intracellular phytic acid may be involved in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytosol.&lt;ref name="York"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = York JD, Odom AR, Murphy R, Ives EB, Wente SR | title = A phospholipase C-dependent inositol polyphosphate kinase pathway required for efficient messenger RNA export | journal = Science | volume = 285 | issue = 5424 | pages = 96–100 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10390371 | doi = 10.1126/science.285.5424.96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shears1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shears SB | title = Assessing the omnipotence of inositol hexakisphosphate | journal = Cellular Signalling | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 151–8 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11282453 | doi = 10.1016/S0898-6568(01)00129-2 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1260121 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inositol hexaphosphate facilitates the formation of the six-helix bundle and assembly of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice. IP6 makes ionic contacts with two rings of lysine residues at the centre of the Gag hexamer. Proteolytic cleavage then unmasks an alternative binding site, where IP6 interaction promotes the assembly of the mature capsid lattice. These studies identify IP6 as a naturally occurring small molecule that promotes both assembly and maturation of HIV-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dick RA, Zadrozny KK, Xu C, Schur FK, Lyddon TD, Ricana CL, Wagner JM, Perilla JR, Ganser-Pornillos BK, Johnson MC, Pornillos O, Vogt VM | title = Inositol phosphates are assembly co-factors for HIV-1 | journal = Nature | volume = 560 | issue = 7719 | pages = 509–512 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30069050 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0396-4 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0396-4#article-info }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply cooking the food will reduce the phytic acid to some degree. More effective methods are soaking in an acid medium, [[sprouting]] and [[lactic acid fermentation]] such as in [[sourdough]] and [[pickling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US9032841 "Phytates in cereals and legumes"]. fao.org.&lt;/ref&gt; No detectable phytate (less than 0.02% of wet weight) was observed in vegetables such as scallion and cabbage leaves or in fruits such as apples, oranges, bananas, or pears.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillippy BQ, Wyatt CJ | title = Degradation of phytate in foods by phytases in fruit and vegetable extracts. | journal = Journal of Food Science | date = May 2001 | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 53–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PositiveSingles''' is a free friendship, social and [[dating website]] that specifically caters to people who are living with [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online dating for people with sexually transmitted infections|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21955126|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PositiveSingles.com Is A Niche Dating Site That Actually Makes Sense|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/05/positive-singles-std-stigma-love_n_4214524.html|website=HuffingtonPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its services are mainly provided in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. PositiveSingles was founded in 2001 and its headquarters are in [[Vaughan, Ontario]]. The company is privately held.

== Overview ==
Launched in [[Mountain View, California]] in 2001, PositiveSingles claims to be "The best, largest, completely anonymous and most trusted online dating site for people with [[Herpes]], [[HPV]], [[HIV]] / [[AIDS]], [[Hepatitis]], [[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[Gonorrhea]], [[Syphilis]] and other STD" on its homepage.

The slogan of PositiveSingles is "''Stay Positive! Find Love, Support &amp; Hope''" in contrast to its previous slogan "''We Are Not Alone!''"

== History ==
PositiveSingles was founded in 2001 as a free STD dating site. Membership was divided into guest and gold membership a year later.

In 2007, STD Q &amp; A (live counselor) was added on PositiveSingles, where every member can anonymously (if they choose to) ask questions about STDs and STD counselor will reply to each one. Members can put forward their own advice as well. Any information provided by users will be kept confidential.

In July, 2010, PositiveSingles added a feature named STD Legal Information. This feature was made on account of the particularity of the special group. PositiveSingles members can obtain legal information regarding their STD status as well as learn how to protect themselves from legal encounters.

In 2012, PositiveSingles launched its apps for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, which provide full functionality as the website.

== Pricing model ==
PositiveSingles charges no fee when users register, search or browse profiles, send winks to another user. However, gold membership (i.e., paid) is required to use some of its premium features.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Priapism''' is a condition in which a [[penis]] remains [[erection|erect]] for hours in the absence of stimulation or after stimulation has ended.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; There are three types: [[ischemic]] (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic (intermittent).&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Most cases are ischemic.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism is generally painful while nonischemic priapism is not.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In ischemic priapism, most of the penis is hard; however, the [[glans penis]] is not.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In nonischemic priapism, the entire penis is only somewhat hard.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Very rarely, [[clitoral]] priapism occurs in women.&lt;ref name=Lehmiller2014&gt;{{cite book |authors=Justin J. Lehmiller|title=The Psychology of Human Sexuality|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=1119164702|year=2014|page=545|accessdate=February 8, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytk5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanism, and diagnosis --&gt;
[[Sickle cell disease]] is the most common cause of ischemic priapism.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Other causes include medications such as [[antipsychotic]]s, [[SSRIs]], and [[anticoagulants|blood thinners]], as well as drugs such as [[cocaine]] and [[cannabis]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism occurs when blood does not adequately drain from the penis.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism is typically due to a connection forming between an [[artery]] and the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] or disruption of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] resulting in increased arterial flow.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism may occur following trauma to the penis or a [[spinal cord injury]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Diagnosis may be supported by [[blood gas]] analysis of blood aspirated from the penis or [[ultrasound]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment, prognosis, and epidemiology--&gt;
Treatment depends on the type.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism is typically treated with a [[nerve block]] of the penis followed by aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this is not sufficient, the corpus cavernosum may be irrigated with cold [[normal saline]] or injected with [[phenylephrine]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism is often treated with cold packs and compression.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Surgery may be done if usual measures are not effective.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In ischemic priapism, the risk of permanent scarring of the penis begins to increase after four hours and definitely occurs after 48 hours.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salam|first1=Muhammad A.|title=Principles &amp; Practice of Urology: A Comprehensive Text|date=2003|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=9781581124118|page=342|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QPSWilXhECkC&amp;pg=PA342|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427100327/https://books.google.ca/books?id=QPSWilXhECkC&amp;pg=PA342|archivedate=2017-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priapism occurs in about 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 100,000 males per year.&lt;ref name=EM2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podolej|first1=GS|last2=Babcock|first2=C|title=Emergency Department Management Of Priapism.|journal=Emergency medicine practice|date=January 2017|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–16|pmid=28027457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Priapism is classified into three groups: ischemic (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; The majority of cases (19 out of 20) are ischemic in nature.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

Some sources give a duration of four hours as a definition of priapism, but others give six: "The duration of a normal erection before it is classifiable as priapism is still controversial. Ongoing penile erections for more than 6 hours can be classified as priapism."&lt;ref name="scielo.br"&gt;PRIAPISM&amp;nbsp;– ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, C. VAN DER HORST, HENRIK STUEBINGER, CHRISTOPH SEIF, DIETHILD MELCHIOR, F.J. MARTÍNEZ-PORTILLO, K.P. JUENEMANN; {{cite web |url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ibju/v29n5/18554.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429234259/http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ibju/v29n5/18554.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priapism in females (continued, painful erection of the [[clitoris]]) is significantly rarer than priapism in men, and is known as clitoral priapism or clitorism.&lt;ref name="Lehmiller2014" /&gt; It is associated with [[persistent genital arousal disorder]] (PGAD).&lt;ref name="Carcio"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Helen Carcio, MS, MEd, ANP-BC, R. Mimi Secor, MS, MEd, FNP-BC, NCMP, FAANP|title=Advanced Health Assessment of Women, Third Edition: Clinical Skills and Procedures|publisher=[[Springer Publishing Company]]|isbn=0826123090|year=2014|page=85|accessdate=February 8, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4QbBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few case reports of women experiencing clitoral priapism exist.&lt;ref name="Lehmiller2014" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
===Complications===
Because [[ischemia|ischemic]] priapism causes the blood to remain in the penis for unusually long periods of time, the blood becomes deprived of oxygen and can cause damage to the penile tissue itself. Should the penile tissue become damaged, it can result in [[erectile dysfunction]] or disfigurement of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/priapism/basics/complications/con-20029378 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806005205/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/priapism/basics/complications/con-20029378 |archivedate=2014-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, if the penis develops severe vascular disease, the priapism can result in penile [[gangrene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Penile Gangrene: An Unusual Complication of Priapism in a Patient with Bladder Carcinoma| pmc=3192523 | pmid=22022653 | doi=10.4103/2006-8808.78470| volume=3| year=2011| journal=J Surg Tech Case Rep| pages=37–9| author=Ajape AA, Bello A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Priapism may be associated with [[hematology|haematological]] disorders, especially [[sickle-cell disease]], sickle-cell trait, and other conditions such as [[leukemia]], [[thalassemia]], and [[Fabry's disease]], and [[neurology|neurologic disorders]] such as [[spinal cord]] lesions and spinal cord trauma (priapism has been reported in people who have been hanged; see [[death erection]]).

Priapism may also be associated with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], which leads to decreased [[NADPH]] levels. NADPH is a co-factor involved in the formation of nitric oxide, which may result in priapism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Finley DS | title = Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency associated stuttering priapism: report of a case | journal = [[J Sex Med]] | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 2963–6 |date=December 2008 | pmid = 18823322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.01007.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sickle cell disease often presents special treatment obstacles. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also been used with success in some patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Macaluso JN | title = Priapism: Update for the non-urologist | journal = Sexual Medicine Today | volume = 9 | pages = 11–15 | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Priapism is also found to occur in extreme cases of [[rabies]]. Priapism also occurs due to encephalitic rabies.

===Medications===
Priapism can also be caused by reactions to [[medication]]s. The most common medications that cause priapism are intra-cavernous injections for treatment of [[erectile dysfunction]] ([[papaverine]], [[alprostadil]]). Other groups reported are [[antihypertensives]], [[antipsychotic]]s (e.g., [[chlorpromazine]], [[clozapine]]), [[antidepressant]]s (most notably [[trazodone]]), [[anti-convulsant]] and [[mood stabilizer]] drugs such as [[sodium valproate]],&lt;ref name="Bansal"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bansal S, Gupta SK | title = Sodium Valproate induced priapism in an adult with bipolar affective disorder | journal = [[Indian Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 629 |date=November 2013 | doi = 10.4103/0253-7613.121383}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anticoagulants]], [[cantharides]] (''Spanish Fly'') and recreational drugs ([[alcohol]], [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]). Priapism is also known to occur from bites of the [[Brazilian wandering spider]] and the [[Latrodectus|black widow spider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20090924/spider-venom-for-erectile-dysfunction|title=Spider Venom for Erectile Dysfunction?|work=webmd.com|accessdate=11 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211214317/http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20090924/spider-venom-for-erectile-dysfunction|archivedate=11 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The mechanisms are poorly understood but involve complex neurological and [[vascular]] factors.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is often based on the history of the condition and the [[physical exam]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

[[Blood gas]] testing the blood from the cavernosa of the penis can help in the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If the low flow type of priapism is present the blood typically has a low pH while if the high flow type is present the pH is typically normal.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Color doppler [[ultrasound]] may also help differentiate the two.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Testing a person to make sure they do not have a [[hemoglobinopathy]] may also be reasonable.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

==Treatment==

Medical evaluation is recommended for erections that last for longer than four hours. Pain can often be reduced with a [[dorsal penile nerve]] block or penile [[ring block]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; For those with nonischemic priapism cold packs and pressure to the area may be sufficient.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Aspiration===
For those with ischemic priapism the initial treatment is typically [[Suction (medicine)|aspiration]] of blood from the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; This is done on either side.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this is not sufficiently effective then cold [[normal saline]] may be injected and removed.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Medications===
If aspiration is not sufficient a small dose of [[phenylephrine]] may be injected into the corpus cavernosum.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Side effects of phenylephrine may include [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]], and [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this medication is used, it is recommended that people be monitored for at least an hour after.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; For those with recurrent ischemic priapism [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) or [[terbutaline]] may be tried.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Surgery===
Distal shunts, such as the [[George D. Winter|Winter's]],{{clarify|date=November 2009}} involve puncturing the glans (the distal part of the penis) into one of the cavernosa, where the old, stagnant blood is held. This causes the blood to leave the penis and return to the circulation. This procedure can be performed by a urologist at the bedside. Winter's shunts are often the first invasive technique used, especially in hematologically induced priapism, as it is relatively simple and repeatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macaluso JN, Sullivan JW | title = Priapism: A review of 34 cases | journal = Urology | volume = 26 | pages = 233–236 | year = 1985 | doi = 10.1016/0090-4295(85)90116-5 | pmid = 4035837 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proximal shunts, such as the Quackel's,{{clarify|date=November 2009}} are more involved and entail operative dissection in the [[perineum]] to where the corpora meet the spongiosum, making an incision in both, and suturing both openings together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montague DK, Jarow J, Broderick GA, Dmochowski RR, Heaton JP, Lue TF, Nehra A, Sharlip ID | title = American Urological Association guideline on the management of priapism | journal = [[J. Urol.]] | volume = 170 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 1318–24 |date=October 2003 | pmid = 14501756 | doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000087608.07371.ca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shunts created between corpora cavernosa and saphenous vein called Grayhack shunt can be done though this technique is rarely used.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

As the complication rates with prolonged priapism are high, early [[penile prosthesis]] implantation may be considered.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; As well as allowing early resumption of sexual activity, early implantation can avoid the formation of dense fibrosis and hence a shortened penis.

===Sickle cell anemia===
In sickle-cell anemia treatment is initially with [[intravenous fluids]], [[pain medication]], and [[oxygen therapy]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; The typical treatment of priapism may be carried out as well.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; [[Blood transfusions]] are not usually recommended as part of the initial treatment but if other treatments are not effective [[exchange transfusion]] may be done.&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite book|title=Evidence Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease|date=2014|publisher=NHLBI|pages=39–40|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/sickle-cell-disease-report.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125155233/https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/sickle-cell-disease-report.pdf|archivedate=2017-01-25|df=|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

==History==
Persistent semi-erections or intermittent states of prolonged erections have historically been sometimes called semi-priapism.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Herbert F., and Jane D. Northup. "Mechanism of human penile erection: an overview." Urology 17.5 (1981): 399-408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The name comes from the Greek god [[Priapus]] ({{lang-grc|Πρίαπος}}), a fertility god often represented with a disproportionately large and permanent erection.

A '''scar''' is an area of [[fibrosis|fibrous tissue]] that replaces normal [[skin]] after an injury. Scars result from the biological process of [[wound]] repair in the skin, as well as in other [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the [[healing]] process. With the exception of very minor [[lesion]]s, every wound (e.g., after [[accident]], [[disease]], or [[surgery]]) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this are animals with complete [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], which regrow tissue without scar formation.

Scar tissue is composed of the same protein ([[collagen]]) as the tissue that it replaces, but the fiber composition of the protein is different; instead of a random basketweave formation of the collagen fibers found in normal tissue, in fibrosis the collagen cross-links and forms a pronounced alignment in a single direction.&lt;ref name="collagenskinscar2010-08-20"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Sherratt  | first = Jonathan A.  | title = Mathematical Modelling of Scar Tissue Formation  | quote = This is composed of the same main protein (collagen) as normal skin, but with differences in details of composition. Most crucially, the protein fibres in normal tissue have a random (basketweave) appearance, while those in scar tissue have pronounced alignment in a single direction.  | publisher = Department of Mathematics, Heriot-Watt University  | year = 2010  | url = http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~jas/researchinterests/scartissueformation.html  | accessdate = 20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collagen scar tissue alignment is usually of inferior functional quality to the normal collagen randomised alignment. For example, scars in the skin are less resistant to [[ultraviolet radiation]], and [[sweat gland]]s and [[hair follicle]]s do not grow back within scar tissues.&lt;ref name=Kraftlynde/&gt; A [[myocardial infarction]], commonly known as a heart attack,  causes [[Myocardial scarring|scar formation]] in the [[heart]] muscle, which leads to loss of muscular power and possibly [[heart failure]]. However, there are some tissues (e.g. [[bone]]) that can heal without any structural or functional deterioration.

Scars differ in the amounts of collagen overexpressed. Labels have been applied to the differences in overexpression. Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and [[keloid]] scarring,&lt;ref name=Roseborough2004/&gt; both of which experience excessive stiff collagen bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an overexpression of collagen blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the collagen bundles do not overextend the tissue. Stretch marks (striae) are regarded as scars by some.

High melanin levels and either African or Asian ancestry may make adverse scarring more noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kelly AP | title = Update on the Management of Keloids | journal = Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 71–76 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19608056 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.sder.2009.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypertrophic ===
{{main|Hypertrophic scars}}
[[Hypertrophic scars]] occur when the body overproduces collagen, which causes the scar to be raised above the surrounding skin. [[Organ hypertrophy|Hypertrophic]] scars take the form of a red raised lump on the skin. They usually occur within 4 to 8 weeks following wound infection or wound closure with excess tension and/or other traumatic skin injuries.&lt;ref name=Roseborough2004&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gauglitz GG, Korting HC, Pavicic T, Ruzicka T, Jeschke MG | title = Hypertrophic Scarring and Keloids: Pathomechanisms and Current and Emerging Treatment Strategies | journal = Mol Med | volume = 17 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 113–125 | date = January–February 2011 | pmid = 20927486 | pmc = 3022978 | doi = 10.2119/molmed.2009.00153 | url = http://www.molmed.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keloid===
{{Main|Keloid}}
[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|Keloid scarring following persistent whipping. People with darker skin pigmentation are more prone to the development of keloid scarring.]]
Keloid scars are a more serious form of excessive scarring, because they can grow indefinitely into large, tumorous (although benign) [[neoplasm]]s.&lt;ref name=Roseborough2004/&gt;

Hypertrophic scars are often distinguished from keloid scars by their lack of growth outside the original wound area, but this commonly taught distinction can lead to confusion.&lt;ref name="Roseborough2004a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roseborough IE, Grevious MA, Lee RC | title = Prevention and treatment of excessive dermal scarring | journal = J Natl Med Assoc | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 108–16 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14746360 | pmc = 2594768 | doi =  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keloid scars can occur on anyone, but they are most common in dark-skinned people.&lt;ref&gt;Martini, Frederic H. (2006). ''Fundamentals of Anatomy &amp; Physiology,'' Seventh Edition, p. 171. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be caused by surgery, accident, [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or, sometimes, [[body piercings]]. In some people, keloid scars form spontaneously. Although they can be a cosmetic problem, keloid scars are only inert masses of collagen and therefore completely harmless and not cancerous. However, they can be itchy or painful in some individuals. They tend to be most common on the [[shoulder]]s and [[chest]]. Hypertrophic scars and keloids tend to be more common in wounds closed by secondary intention.&lt;ref name=secinten201104/&gt; Surgical removal of keloid is risky and may excerbate the condition and worsening of the keloid.

=== Atrophic ===
An atrophic scar takes the form of a sunken recess in the skin, which has a pitted appearance. These are caused when underlying structures supporting the skin, such as [[fat]] or [[muscle]], are lost. This type of scarring is often associated with acne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goodman GJ | title = Postacne scarring: A review of its pathophysiology and treatment | journal = Dermatologic Surgery | volume = 26 | issue = 9 | pages = 857–871 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10971560 | doi=10.1046/j.1524-4725.2000.99232.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fabbrocini G, Annunziata MC, D'Arco V, De Vita V, Lodi G, Mauriello MC, Pastore F, Monfrecola G | title = Acne Scars: Pathogenesis, Classification and Treatment | journal = Dermatology Research and Practice | volume = 2010 | pages = 1–13 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20981308 | pmc = 2958495 | doi = 10.1155/2010/893080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chickenpox]], other diseases (especially ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' infection), surgery, certain insect and spider bites, or accidents. It can also be caused by a genetic [[connective tissue]] disorder, such as [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes#H35121407|title=Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes|website=www.uptodate.com|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stretch marks ===
{{Main|Stretch marks}}
Stretch marks (technically called ''striae'') are also a form of scarring. These are caused when the skin is stretched rapidly (for instance during [[pregnancy]],&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD000066"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Young | first1 = G. | last2 = Jewell | first2 = D. | title = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD000066 | year = 1996 | pmid =  10796111| pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000066 | chapter = Creams for preventing stretch marks in pregnancy | editor1-first = Gavin | editor1-last = Young }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23152199|date = October 2018}} significant weight gain, or adolescent [[growth spurt]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elsaie ML, Baumann LS, Elsaaiee LT | title = Striae Distensae (Stretch Marks) and Different Modalities of Therapy: An Update | journal = Dermatologic Surgery | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 563–573 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19400881 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-4725.2009.01094.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; or when skin is put under tension during the healing process, (usually near [[joints]]). This type of scar usually improves in appearance after a few years.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD000066"/&gt;

Elevated [[corticosteroid]] levels are implicated in striae development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hengge UR, Ruzicka T, Schwartz RA, Cork MJ | title = Adverse effects of topical glucocorticosteroids | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16384751 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2005.01.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Umbilical ===
Humans and other [[List of placental mammals|placental mammals]] have an umbilical scar (commonly referred to as to a [[navel]]) which starts to heal when the [[umbilical cord]] is cut after birth. Egg-laying animals have an umbilical scar which, depending on the species, may remain visible for life or disappear within a few days after birth.&lt;ref&gt;"What Types of Animals Have Been to Space and More Questions From our Readers", Smithsonian Magazine May 2012, https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-types-of-animals-have-been-to-space-and-more-questions-from-our-readers-63029589/ Retrieved 25 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flat-tailed horned lizard (Phrynosoma mcallii), US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service https://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/arizona/Documents/Redbook/Flat-Tailed%20Horned%20Lizard%20RB.pdf Retrieved 25 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==

A scar is the product of the body's repair mechanism after tissue injury. If a wound heals quickly within two weeks with new formation of skin, minimal collagen will be deposited and no scar will form.&lt;ref name=bursurg&gt;{{Cite web| title = POST BURN SCAR RELATIVE TO RE-EPITHELIALIZATION| publisher = eplasty.com| year = 2011| url = http://eplasty.com/images/PDF/ManageBurnWound-part4.pdf| quote = Healing in 2 weeks – minimal to no scar; Healing in 3 weeks – minimal to no scar except in high risk scar formers;Healing in 4 weeks or more – hypertrophic in more than 50% of patients| accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the extracellular matrix senses elevated mechanical stress loading, tissue will scar,&lt;ref name=scarStress2011/&gt; and scars can be limited by stress shielding wounds.&lt;ref name=scarStress2011&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15350879| title = Pushing Back: Wound Mechanotransduction in Repair and Regeneration| last = Victor W.Wong, SatoshiAkaishi, Michael T.Longaker, Geoffrey C.Gurtner | date = | year = 2011| website = sciencedirect.com| publisher = Journal of Investigative Dermatology| access-date = 17 October 2018| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small full thickness wounds under 2mm reepithilize fast and heal scar free.&lt;ref name=myoscar201103/&gt;&lt;ref name=smallWound&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tam |first1=Joshua |last2=Wang |first2=Ying |last3=Vuong |first3=Linh N. |last4=Fisher |first4=Jeremy M. |last5=Farinelli |first5=William A. |last6=Anderson |first6=R.

The [[endometrium]], the inner lining of the uterus, is the only adult tissue to undergo rapid cyclic shedding and regeneration without scarring; shedding and restoring roughly inside a 7-day window on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name=Scrrpr2012918&gt;{{cite web| title = Endometrial repair| quote = Importantly, the endometrium is the only adult tissue to undergo rapid cyclic repair without scarring.| publisher = princehenrys.org| date = 18 September 2012 | url = http://www.princehenrys.org/endometrial-repair-menstruation| accessdate = 30 June 2013| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090914010721/http://www.princehenrys.org/endometrial-repair-menstruation| dead-url = yes| archivedate =2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other adult tissues, upon rapid shedding or injury, can scar.

Prolonged [[inflammation]], as well as the [[fibroblast]] proliferation&lt;ref name="Fibroblast"/&gt; can occur. Redness that often follows an injury to the skin is not a scar, and is generally not permanent (see [[wound healing]]). The time it takes for this redness to dissipate may, however, range from a few days to, in some serious and rare cases, a few years. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Scars form differently based on the location of the injury on the body and the age of the person who was injured. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The worse the initial damage is, the worse the scar will generally be. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Skin scars occur when the [[dermis]] (the deep, thick layer of skin) is damaged. Most skin scars are flat and leave a trace of the original [[injury]] that caused them. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Collagen synthesis===
Any injury does not become a scar until the wound has completely healed; this can take many months, or years in the worst pathological cases, such as keloids. To begin to patch the damage, a clot is created; the clot is the beginning process that results in a provisional matrix. In the process, the first layer is a provisional matrix and is not scar. Over time, the wounded body tissue then overexpresses collagen inside the provisional matrix to create a collagen matrix. This collagen overexpression continues and crosslinks the fiber arrangement inside the collagen matrix, making the collagen dense. This densely packed collagen, morphing into an inelastic whitish collagen&lt;ref name="Fibroblast"/&gt; scar wall, blocks off cell communication and regeneration; as a result, the new tissue generated will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding unwounded tissue. This prolonged collagen-producing process results in a fortuna scar.

====Fibroblasts====
The scarring is created by fibroblast proliferation,&lt;ref name="Fibroblast"/&gt; a process that begins with a reaction to the clot.&lt;ref name =Fibroblasts2007-12-17&gt;{{Cite web| last = Parlange| first = Mary | title = New mechanical insights into wound healing and scar tissue formation| quote = The body launches a complex rescue operation.

=====Myofibroblast=====
The fibroblast involved in scarring and contraction is the [[myofibroblast]],&lt;ref name=myo201103/&gt; which is a specialized contractile fibroblast.&lt;ref name=myo2011033/&gt; These cells express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).&lt;ref name=myosm201103&gt;{{Cite web|author=Traci A.

The myofibroblasts make up a high proportion of the fibroblasts proliferating in the postembryonic wound at the onset of healing.

Chemical peels are chemicals which destroy the epidermis in a controlled manner, leading to exfoliation and the alleviation of certain skin conditions, including superficial acne scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Khunger N | title = Standard guidelines of care for acne surgery | journal = Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology | volume = 74 Suppl | issue =  | pages = S28–36 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18688101 | url = http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2008;volume=74;issue=7;spage=28;epage=36;aulast=Khunger }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various chemicals can be used depending upon the depth of the peel, and caution should be used, particularly for dark-skinned individuals and those individuals susceptible to [[keloid]] formation or with active infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Khunger N | title = Standard guidelines of care for chemical peels | journal = Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology | volume = 74 Suppl | issue =  | pages = S5–12 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18688104 | url = http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2008;volume=74;issue=7;spage=5;epage=12;aulast=Khunger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filler injections ===
Filler injections of [[collagen]] can be used to raise atrophic scars to the level of surrounding skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper JS, Lee BT | title = Treatment of facial scarring: lasers, filler, and nonoperative techniques | journal = Facial Plastic Surgery | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 311–5 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20024872 | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1243079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Risks vary based upon the filler used, and can include further disfigurement and [[allergic reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemperle G, Rullan PP, Gauthier-Hazan N | title = Avoiding and treating dermal filler complications | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 118 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 92S–107S | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16936549 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000234672.69287.77 | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4t0019d6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laser treatment ===
Nonablative lasers, such as the 585&amp;nbsp;nm [[pulsed dye laser]], 1064&amp;nbsp;nm and 1320&amp;nbsp;nm [[Nd:YAG]], or the 1540&amp;nbsp;nm [[Er:Glass]] are used as laser therapy for hypertrophic scars and keloids.&lt;ref name="pmid21061757"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elsaie ML, Choudhary S | title = Lasers for scars: a review and evidence-based appraisal | journal = Journal of Drugs in Dermatology | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1355–62 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21061757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For burn scars they improve the appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willows|first1=BM|last2=Ilyas|first2=M|last3=Sharma|first3=A|title=Laser in the management of burn scars.|journal=Burns |date=4 August 2017|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2017.07.001|pmid=28784339|volume=43|issue=7|pages=1379–1389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radiotherapy ===
Low-dose, superficial [[radiotherapy]] is sometimes used to prevent recurrence of severe keloid and hypertrophic scarring.

=== Surgery ===

Scar revision is a process of cutting the scar tissue out. After the excision, the new wound is usually closed up to heal by [[primary intention]], instead of [[secondary intention]]. Deeper cuts need a multilayered closure to heal optimally, otherwise depressed or dented scars can result.&lt;ref name=scarrevision2010&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Scar revisions  | quote = Deep cuts need multi-layered closure to heal optimally; otherwise, depressed or dented scars can result  | url = http://www.haplasticsurgery.com/scar-revision-surgery-dallas-texas.html  | accessdate = 16 October 2010  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120119050557/http://www.haplasticsurgery.com/scar-revision-surgery-dallas-texas.html  | archive-date = 19 January 2012  | dead-url = yes  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surgical excision of hypertrophic or keloid scars is often associated to other methods, such as pressotherapy or silicone gel sheeting. Lone excision of keloid scars, however, shows a recurrence rate close to 45%. A clinical study is currently ongoing to assess the benefits of a treatment combining surgery and laser-assisted healing in hypertrophic or keloid scars.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

''Subcision'' is a process used to treat deep rolling scars left behind by [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or other skin diseases. It is also used to lessen the appearance of severe [[glabella]] lines, though its effectiveness in this application is debatable. Essentially the process involves separating the skin tissue in the affected area from the deeper scar tissue. This allows the blood to pool under the affected area, eventually causing the deep rolling scar to level off with the rest of the skin area. Once the skin has leveled, treatments such as [[laser resurfacing]], [[microdermabrasion]] or [[chemical peel]]s can be used to smooth out the scarred tissue. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Vitamins===
Research shows the use of [[vitamin E]] and onion extract (sold as [[Mederma]]) as treatments for scars is ineffective.&lt;ref name=Shih2007/&gt; Vitamin E causes contact [[dermatitis]] in up to 33% of users and in some cases it may worsen scar appearance and could cause minor skin irritations,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; but Vitamin C and some of its esters fade the dark pigment associated with some scars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Farris PK. Topical vitamin C: a useful agent for treating photoaging and other dermatologic conditions. Although many people claim that vitamin therapy does in fact help. Dermatol Surg 2005;31:814-818.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
*Cosmetics; Medical makeup can temporarily conceal scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Medical Makeup for Concealing Facial Scars|url = http://pubs.bli.uci.edu/sites/default/files/publications/s-0032-1325647.pdf|journal = Facial Plastic Surgery|date = 2012-10-01|pages = 536–540|volume = 28|issue = 5|doi = 10.1055/s-0032-1325647|language = en|first = Donna|last = Mee|first2 = Brian|last2 = Wong|pmid=23027221}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is most commonly used for [[Face|facial]] scars.
*[[Dermabrasion]] involves the removal of the surface of the skin with special equipment, and usually involves a [[local anaesthetic]].

==Society and culture==

=== Intentional scarring ===
{{main|Scarification}}
The permanence of scarring has led to its intentional use as a form of [[body art]] within some cultures and subcultures. These forms of  ritual and non-ritual scarring practices can be found in many groups and cultures around the world.

===Etymology===
First attested in English in the late 14th century, the word ''scar'' derives from a conflation of [[Old French]] ''escharre'', from [[Late Latin]] ''eschara'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Deschara eschara], 
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἐσχάρα (''eskhara''), meaning "hearth, fireplace", but in medicine "scab, eschar on a wound caused by burning or otherwise,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29sxa%2Fra ἐσχάρα], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=scar Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Middle English]] ''skar'' ("cut, crack, incision"), which is from [[Old Norse]] ''skarð'' ("notch, gap"). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=scar Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;. The conflation helped to form the English meaning. Compare [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] for evolution of ''skarð'' to ''scar''.

==Research==
An intradermal injection of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFβ3) is being tested. The results of three trials already completed were published in the ''Lancet'' along with an editorial commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Renovo. [http://www.renovo.com/en/news/lancet-publication]. Lancet trials in: 11 April 2009 (vol. 373, pages 1264-1274). Lancet commentary by Edward Tredget in: vol 373, pages 1226-1228&lt;/ref&gt;

A study implicated the protein [[ribosomal s6 kinase]] (RSK) in the formation of scar tissue and found the introduction of a chemical to counteract RSK could halt the formation of [[cirrhosis]].  This treatment also has the potential to reduce or even prevent altogether other types of scarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liver damage 'could be reversed' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7152415.stm |date=27 December 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also implicated [[osteopontin]] in scarring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/content/abstract/205/1/43 'Molecular mechanisms linking wound inflammation and fibrosis: knockdown of osteopontin leads to rapid repair and reduced scarring']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7199897.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gel 'to speed up wound healing' | date=22 January 2008 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensory gardens can be designed in such a way as to be accessible and enjoyable for both [[disabled]] and non-disabled users. A sensory garden, for example, may contain features accessible to the disabled individual such as: scented and edible plants, sculptures and sculpted handrails, water features designed to make sound and play over the hands, textured touch-pads, magnifying-glass screens, braille and audio [[induction loop]] descriptions.  Depending on the user group, other provisions may integrate sound and music more centrally to combine the play needs of younger users with their sensory needs.

Many sensory gardens devote themselves to providing experience for multiple senses; those specialising in scent are sometimes called [[scented gardens]], those specialising in music/sound are sound gardens where the equipment doubles up to provides an enhanced opportunity for strategic developmental, learning and educational outcomes.

Sensory Gardens usually have an enhanced infrastructure to permit [[wheelchair access]] and meet other accessibility concerns; the design and layout provides a stimulating journey through the senses, heightening awareness, and bringing positive learning experiences.

{{Taxation}}
A '''sugary drink tax''' or '''soda tax''' is a [[tax]] or [[fee|surcharge]] designed to reduce consumption of drinks with [[added sugar]]. Drinks covered under a soda tax often include [[Carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drinks]], [[sports drinks]] and [[energy drinks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Consumption of Sports Drinks by Kids and Adolescents|url=http://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/HER-Sports-Drinks-Research-Review-6-2012.pdf |website= Healthy Eating Research |accessdate= 18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax is a matter of public debate in many countries and [[beverage production|beverage producers]] like [[Coca-Cola]] often oppose it. Advocates such as national medical associations and the [[World Health Organization]] promote the tax as an example of [[Pigovian tax]]ation, aimed to discourage [[Healthy diet#Unhealthy diets|unhealthy diets]] and offset the growing [[Obesity#Economic impact|economic costs of obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Tavernise |first1=Sabrina |title= W.H.O. urges Tax on Sugary Drinks to Fight Obesity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/health/sugar-drink-tax-world-health-organization.html?_r=0 |accessdate=8 November 2016 |website= The New York Times |date= 11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Type II diabetes]] is a growing health concern in many developed and developing countries around the world, with 1.6 million deaths directly due to this disease in 2015 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Diabetes Fact Sheet |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/ |publisher=World Health Organisation |date= November 2016 |accessdate= 20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike sugar from food, the sugar from drinks enters the body so quickly that it can overload the pancreas and the liver, leading to [[diabetes]] and heart disease over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sugar-Sweetened Beverages |url= http://www.sugarscience.org/sugar-sweetened-beverages/ |work= SugarScience |publisher= University of California, San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study said that consuming one to two sugary drinks a day increases your risk of developing diabetes by 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Sugar-sweetened beverages and risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis|first1=Vasanti S. |last1=Malik |first2=Barry M. |last2=Popkin|first3=George A.|last3=Bray |first4=Jean-Pierre |last4= Després |first5=Walter C. |last5=Willett |first6=Frank B. |last6=Hu |date=1 November 2010 |publisher= |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=2477–2483  |doi=10.2337/dc10-1079 |pmid= 20693348 |pmc= 2963518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trends indicate that traditional soda consumption is declining in many developed economies, but growing rapidly in middle income economies such as Vietnam and India. In the United States, the single biggest market for carbonated soft drinks, consumers annual average per capita purchase of soda was 154 liters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silver|first1=Marc|title=Guess Which Country Has The Biggest Increase In Soda Drinking|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/19/415223346/guess-which-country-has-the-biggest-increase-in-soda-drinking|publisher=National Public Radio|date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denmark]] began taxing soft drinks and juices in the 1930s. More recently, [[Finland]] reintroduced an earlier soft drink tax in 2011, while [[Hungary]] taxes sugary drinks as part of its 2011 public health product tax, which covers all food products with unhealthy levels of sugar. [[France]] introduced a targeted sugar tax on soft drinks in 2012.&lt;ref name=ECSIP&gt;{{cite report |title=Food taxes and their impact on competitiveness in the agri-food sector |url=http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/5827/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/pdf |pages=27–30 |date=16 July 2014 |id=Ref.

In November 2014, [[Berkeley, California]] was the first city in the U.S. to pass a targeted tax on surgary drinks.

===Tobacco taxes===
Proponents of soda taxes cite the success of [[tobacco taxes]] worldwide when explaining why they think a soda tax will work to lower soda consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bittman|first1=Mark|title=Is Soda the New Tobacco?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/weekinreview/14bittman.html|website=The New York Times|date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the main concern with tobacco is cancer, the main concerns with soda are diabetes and obesity. The  tactics used to oppose soda taxes by soda companies mimic those of tobacco companies, including funding research that downplays the health risks of its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Soda the New Tobacco?|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/big-soda-is-fighting-science-on-sugar-2015-11|publisher=Business Insider|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics and economic theory of the tax ===
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] reports that a targeted tax on sugar in soda could generate $14.9 billion in the first year alone. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that three-cent-per-ounce tax would generate over $24 billion over four years.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, [http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/chicago_fed_letter/2011/cflmarch2011_284.pdf "Who would be affected by soda taxes?"] The Fed Letter, No. 284 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some tax measures call for using the revenue collected to pay for relevant health needs: improving diet, increasing physical activity, obesity prevention, nutrition education, advancing healthcare reform, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Soda Tax Weighed to Pay for Healthcare| url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124208505896608647|date=2009-05-12 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Janet | last=Adamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area to which the revenue raised by a soda tax might go, as suggested by Mike Rayner of the United Kingdom, is to subsidize healthier foods like fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext | title=Fat Taxes and the Financial Crisis | author=McColl, Karen | journal=[[The Lancet]] |date=March 2009 | volume=373 | issue=9666 | pages=797–798 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60463-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The imposition of a sugar tax means that sellers of sugary drinks would have to increase the price of their goods by an amount P2 from the original price X, and then take on the rest of the tax themselves (P1) in the form of lower profit per unit sold. The tax burden on consumers (P2) makes it more expensive for consumers to buy sugary drinks and hence a higher proportion of their incomes would have to be spent to buy the same amount of sugary drinks. This decreases the equilibrium quantity of sugary drinks that will be sold. Whether the sugary drinks tax is imposed on the seller or consumer, in both cases the tax burden is shared between both.&lt;ref name="website elasticity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thismatter.com/economics/tax-incidence.htm|title=Tax Incidence: How the Tax Burden is Shared Between Buyers and Sellers|first=William C.|last=Spaulding|website=thismatter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way that the tax burden is divided upon the consumer and seller depends on the price elasticity for sugary drinks. The tax burden will fall more on sellers when the price elasticity of demand is greater than the price elasticity of supply while on buyers when the price elasticity of supply is greater than the price elasticity of demand. The price elasticity for sugary drinks is different from country to country. For instance, the price elasticity of demand for sugary drinks was found to be -1.37 in Chile while -1.16 in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Guerrero-López, Carlos M. 2017"&gt;Guerrero-López, Carlos M., Mishel Unar-Munguía, and M. Arantxa Colchero. "Price Elasticity Of The Demand For Soft Drinks, Other Sugar-Sweetened Beverages And Energy Dense Food In Chile". BMC Public Health 17.1 (2017): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colchero, M.A. et al. "Price Elasticity Of The Demand For Sugar Sweetened Beverages And Soft Drinks In Mexico". Economics &amp; Human Biology 19 (2015): 129-137. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence if both of those results were realistic and the price elasticity of supply would be the same for both, the tax burden on consumers would be higher in Mexico than in Chile.&lt;ref name="website elasticity"/&gt;

===The reason for implementing a sugar tax in microeconomic terms===
The reasons for a sugar tax are the negative externalities of consuming sugar. As over-consumption of sugar causes health problems (external costs) such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and other diseases, and lost productivity, the third party impacted by this is the ‘public health system’ that will need to deal with those issues. More demand for health services leads to higher costs for health care and hence this increased stress on the public health system is a negative consumption externality of sugar consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Briggs | first1 = Adam | year = 2016 | title = Sugar Tax Could Sweeten A Market Failure | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 531 | issue = 7596| pages = 551–551 | doi=10.1038/531551a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brownell, Kelly D. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brownell | first1 = Kelly D. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = The Public Health And Economic Benefits Of Taxing Sugar-Sweetened Beverages | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 361 | issue = 16| pages = 1599–1605 | doi=10.1056/nejmhpr0905723| pmc = 3140416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics terms, the marginal social benefit (MSB) of sugar consumption is less than the marginal private benefit (MB). This can also be illustrated in the following equation. MSB = MB – Marginal External Cost (MXC). This is the case due to the fact that consumers think only of the benefit of sugar consumption to them (MB) and not the negative externalities to third parties (MXC) and so want to consume at the unregulated market equilibrium to maximize their utility. This means that there is overconsumption of sugar and a welfare loss is created.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saez|first1=Emmanuel|url=http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/course131/externalities1_ch05.pdf|title=Externalities: Problems and Solutions Chapter 5|publisher=UC Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sugary drinks tax, a Pigovian tax, is a way to correct the negative externality by regulating the consumption of sugary drinks.&lt;ref name="Guerrero-López, Carlos M. 2017"/&gt; Without a sugary drink tax, taxpayer money is used to pay for higher health care costs incurred from high consumption of sugar. Although this solution corrects the negative consumption externality, taxpayers that consume sugary drinks moderately and hence do not contribute to higher health care costs, still need to pay for this negative externality. Hence a sugary drinks tax may be a more appropriate solution as tax revenue that is collected from the sugar tax can be used to create childhood nutrition programs or obesity-prevention programs.&lt;ref name="Brownell, Kelly D. 2009"/&gt; This is a solution that could also correct the negative externality of sugar consumption as well as is a way to make the parties that cause the negative externality pay their fair share.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Countries ==
===Australia===
The [[Australian Beverages Council]] announced in June 2018 that the industry would cut sugar content by 10% by 2020, and by another 10%  by 2025. This was seen as an attempt to stave off a sugar tax. There were no plans to reduce the sugar content in the high sugar drinks. The plan is primarily to increase consumption of low-sugar or no-sugar drinks. sales of [[Coca-Cola Amatil]]'s fizzy drinks have fallen 8.1% by volume from 2016 to 2018.  The [[Australian Medical Association]] continued to press for a sugar tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Australian soft drink industry vows to slash use of sugar by 20 per cent |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australian-soft-drink-industry-vows-to-slash-use-of-sugar-by-20-per-cent-20180625-p4znkm.html |accessdate=7 September 2018 |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===
[[Denmark]] instituted a soft drink tax in the 1930s (it amounted to 1.64 Danish krone per liter), but announced in 2013 that they were going to abolish it along with an equally unpopular [[fat tax]], with the goal of creating jobs and helping the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/Denmark-to-scrap-decades-old-soft-drink-tax|title=Denmark to scrap decades-old soft drink tax|last1=Scott-Thomas|first1=Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed that the taxes were notably ineffective; to avoid the fat and sugar taxes, local retailers had complained that Danes simply went to Sweden and Germany, where prices were lower to buy butter, ice cream and soda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strom|first1=Stephanie|title='Fat Tax’ in Denmark Is Repealed After Criticism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/business/global/fat-tax-in-denmark-is-repealed-after-criticism.html|website=The New York Times|date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark repealed the fat tax in January 2013 and repealed the tax on soft drinks in 2014.

In September 2013, soda companies launched a media campaign to discourage the Mexican Chamber of Deputies and Senate from approving the 10% soda tax.

=== Norway ===
[[Norway]] has had a generalized sugar tax measure on refined sugar products since 1922, introduced to boost state income rather than reducing sugar consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tisdall|first1=Jonathan|title="Chocolate tax" should go|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1846927.ece|work=Aftenposten|date=26 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626022943/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1846927.ece|archivedate=26 June 2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Non-alcoholic beverages have since been separated from the general tax, and in 2017, the tax for sugary drinks was set to 3.34 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/okonomi-og-budsjett/skatter-og-avgifter/avgiftssatser-2017/id2514838/ |title=Avgiftssatser 2017 |language=Norwegian |publisher=Government of Norway |date=20 December 2016 |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the Norwegian government increased the sugar tax level by 83% for general sugar-containing ready-to-eat products, and 42% for beverages. The sugar tax per litre was bumped up to 4.75 kroner, and applies to beverages which are either naturally or artificially sweetened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/okonomi-og-budsjett/skatter-og-avgifter/avgiftssatser-2018/id2575160/|title=Avgiftssatser 2018|last=Finansdepartementet|date=2017-10-12|website=Regjeringen.no|language=no|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The levy was fixed at 2.1 cents per gram of sugar, for each gram above 4g per 100ml of sweetened beverage. The levy excludes fruit juices.

===United Arab Emirates===
On October 2017, the [[United Arab Emirates]] introduced a 50% tax on soft drinks and a 100% tax on energy drinks, to curb unhealthy consumption of sugary drinks that can lead to diabetes; it also added a 100% tax on cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/uae-dubai-sugar-diabetes-tax-soda-energy-drinks-tobacco-2017-10 UAE imposes 'sin' tax on soda, tobacco, and energy drinks] Business Insider October 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax is imposed at the point of production or importation, in two bands. Drinks with total sugar content above 5g per 100 millilitres are taxed at 18p per litre and drinks above 8g per 100 millilitres at 24p per litre. The measure is estimated to generate an additional £1 billion a year in tax revenue which will be spent on funding for sport in UK schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gander|first1=Kashmira|title=Budget 2016: George Osborne announces sugar tax on soft drinks industry|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/budget-2016-george-osborne-announces-sugar-tax-a6934206.html|publisher=The Independent|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/budget-2017-sugar-tax-philip-hammond-fight-obesity-child-weight-gain-fizzy-drinks-a7618316.html|title=New sugar tax confirmed in fight to combat rising obesity|date=8 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticism ====
The tax has been criticised on several grounds, including its likely efficacy and its narrow base. UK [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] [[Will Quince]] as, "patronising, regressive and the [[nanny state]] at its worst."&lt;ref name=SDIL&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neville|first1=Sarah|title=UK tax on sugary drinks is 'nannying' and ‘impractical’|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5b41e47a-ec53-11e5-bb79-2303682345c8.html |url-access=subscription |website=Financial Times|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition a study by the [[University of Glasgow]], which sampled 132,000 adults, found that focusing on sugar in isolation misleads consumers as reducing fat intake is also crucial to reducing obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_474903_en.html|title=University of Glasgow - University news - Focusing on sugar in the fight against global obesity could be misleading|website=www.gla.ac.uk|accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an opposing standpoint, Professor [[Robert Lustig]] of the [[University of California, San Francisco]] School of Medicine, has argued that the UK tax measure may not go far enough and that, "juice should be taxed the same way as soda because from a metabolic standpoint juice is the same as soda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaminska|first1=Izabella|title=Robert Lustig: godfather of the sugar tax|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/311a74ec-ed24-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc4a4.html?siteedition=intl|website=Financial Times|date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners have since called for the soft drinks tax to be extended to include confectionery and sweets to help tackle [[childhood obesity]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/12/sugar-tax-must-apply-to-sweets-as-well-as-drinks-say-campaigners  Sugar tax must apply to sweets as well as drinks, say campaigners] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cook County, Illinois=====
A one-cent-per-ounce soda tax passed on November 10, 2016, by a 9-8 vote, with [[Cook County Board of Commissioners]] President [[Toni Preckwinkle]] breaking the 8-8 tie.

Taxing soda can lead to a reduction in overall consumption, according to a scientific study published in the ''[[Archives of Internal Medicine]]'' in March 2010. The study found that a 10 percent tax on soda led to a 7 percent reduction in calories from soft drinks. These researchers believe that an 18 percent tax on these foods could cut daily intake by 56 calories per person, resulting in a weight loss of 5 pounds (2&amp;nbsp;kg) per person per year. The study followed 5,115 young adults ages 18 to 30 from 1985 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6275T720100308 Tax Soda, Pizza To Cut Obesity Researchers say], 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.ama-assn.org/media/2010a/0308.dtl#1 | title=Unhealthy Foods Become Less Popular With Increasing Costs | publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329092611/http://pubs.ama-assn.org/media/2010a/0308.dtl |archivedate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study published in the medical journal ''[[Health Affairs]]'' found that if taxes were about 18 cents on the dollar, they would make a significant difference in consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.2009.0061v1 Health Affairs, Soda Taxes, Soft Drink Consumption, And Children's Body Mass Index] 1 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press [https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iH4SZwbKI9PYhye5kJT_WLhm4B4AD9EQ1LN01 Study: Small Soda Taxes Don’t Dent Obesity] 1 April 2010, {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404132722/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iH4SZwbKI9PYhye5kJT_WLhm4B4AD9EQ1LN01 |date=4 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research from [[Duke University]] and the [[National University of Singapore]] released in December 2010 tested larger taxes and determined that a 20 percent and 40 percent taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages would largely not affect calorie intake because people switch to untaxed, but equally caloric, beverages. Kelly Brownell, a proponent of soda taxes, reacted by stating that “[t]he fact is that nobody has been able to see how people will really respond under these conditions.”&lt;ref&gt;Park, Alice (13 December 2010) [http://healthland.time.com/2010/12/13/study-sugar-tax-may-lead-to-only-modest-weight-loss "Study: Soda Taxes May Not Be Enough to Curb Obesity"] TIME.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2010 study concluded that while people would drink less soda as a result of a soda tax, they would also compensate for this reduction by switching to other high-calorie beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272710001222 | title=The effects of soft drink taxes on child and adolescent consumption and weight outcomes | author=Fletcher, Jason M. | journal=Journal of Public Economics |date=December 2010 | volume=94 | issue=11–12 | pages=967–974 | doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these arguments, the [[American Public Health Association]] released a statement in 2012 in which they argued that "Even if individuals switch to 100% juice or chocolate milk, this would be an improvement, as those beverages contribute some nutrients to the diet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/23/13/59/taxes-on-sugar-sweetened-beverages | title=Taxes on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: Policy Statement | publisher=APHA | date=30 October 2012 | accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study in the journal ''[[Preventive Medicine (journal)|Preventive Medicine]]'' concluded that "a modest tax on sugar-sweetened beverages could both raise significant revenues and improve public health by reducing obesity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andreyeva | first1 = T. | last2 = Chaloupka | first2 = F.

A 2012 study by [[Y. Claire Wang]], also in the journal ''Health Affairs'', estimates that a penny per ounce tax on sugared beverages could prevent 2.4 million cases of diabetes per year, 8,000 strokes, and 26,000 premature deaths over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Allison Aubrey, "Could a Soda Tax Prevent 2,600 Deaths Per Year?" NPR.org, 12 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, just before the city of Richmond began voting on a soda tax, a study was presented at a conference held by the [[American Public Health Association]] regarding the potential effects of such a tax in California. The study concluded that, given that soda's price elasticity is such that taxing it would reduce consumption by 10–20 percent, that this reduction "...is projected to reduce diabetes incidence by 2.9–5.6% and [[Coronary heart disease|CHD]] by 0.6–1.2%."&lt;ref&gt;[https://apha.confex.com/apha/140am/webprogram/Paper265089.html Health benefits, particularly in high risk populations, projected from an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages intake in California]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study in the ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'' concluded that a 0.5-cent-per-ounce tax on soft drinks would reduce consumption, but "increase sodium and fat intakes as a result of product substitution," in line with the Duke University study mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ajae.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/28/ajae.aat049.full | title=Predicting the Effects of Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxes on Food and Beverage Demand in a Large Demand System | author=Zhen, Chen | journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics |date=July 2013 | volume=95 | doi=10.1093/ajae/aat049 | pages=1–25| pmc=4022288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study published in the ''American Journal of Public Health'' concluded that Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) don’t have a negative impact on employment. Even though job losses in the taxed industry occurred, they were offset by new employment in other sectors of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M. Powell, Roy Wada, Joseph J. Persky, Frank J. Chaloupka, “Employment Impact of Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxes”, American Journal of Public Health 104, no. 4 (April 1, 2014): pp. 672-677.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 modelling study estimated that a 20% tax on SSBs would decrease the consumption of SSBs in Australia by 12.6%. The tax could decline the prevalence of obesity in the Australian population, which could lead to gains in health-adjusted life years. The results showed an increase of 7.6 days in full health for a 20-24-year-old male and a 3.7 day increase in longevity for their female peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veerman | first1 = JL | last2 = Sacks | first2 = G | last3 = Antonopoulos | first3 = N | last4 = Martin | first4 = J | year = 2016 | title = The Impact of a Tax on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages on Health and Health Care Costs: A Modelling Study | url = https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151460 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 4| page = e0151460 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0151460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proposals ====
There have been a number of proposed taxes on sugary beverages, including:

* In 1914, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] proposed a special revenue tax on soft drinks, beer and [[patent medicine]] after the outbreak of [[World War I]] caused a decline in imports and a corresponding decline in credit created by import [[tariff]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1914-09-01/ed-1/seq-1/ "Wilson Proposes Soft Drink Tax,"] Hawaiian Gazette. 1 September 1914. Page 1. Retrieved 1 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed taxation measure was not however linked to the anticipated health outcomes of reduced sugar sweetened beverage consumption. 
* In 1994, one of the first instances where the idea of a targeted tax on sugar sweetened drinks with a link to anticipated beneficial health outcomes, was proposed by [[Kelly D. Brownell]], Director of the [[Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale]]. 
* In a 2009 "Perspective" piece in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', Kelly D. Brownell, Director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale, and [[Thomas R. Frieden]], Director of the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], argue for taxing sugary beverages. The authors propose that sugary beverages may be the single largest cause of the obesity epidemic. They state that an excise tax of one cent per ounce would reduce consumption by more than 10%.&lt;ref name="hartocollis1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/03/nyregion/03sodatax.html | work=The New York Times | title=Soda Tax in N.Y. a Victim of Industry Campaign | first=Anemona | last=Hartocollis | date=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Public support ====
A 2016 poll by Morning Consult-Vox finds Americans split on their support of a soda tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://morningconsult.com/alert/poll-americans-split-soda-taxes/|title=Poll: Americans split on soda taxes |date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attitudes seem to have shifted a lot since 2013 when a poll concluded that "respondents were opposed to government taxes on sugary drinks and candy by a more than 2-to-1 margin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/04/25/most-americans-oppose-soda-candy-taxes|title=Most Americans Oppose Soda, Candy Taxes|work=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; In California, however, support for a tax has been high for a few years. According to a [[Field Poll]] conducted in 2012, "Nearly 3 out of 5 California voters would support a special fee on soft drinks to fight childhood obesity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Poll-shows-support-for-soda-tax-to-fight-obesity-3457423.php|title=Poll shows support for soda tax to fight obesity|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Support for a soda tax in New York was higher when pollsters say the money will go towards health care. A Quinnipiac University poll released in April 2010 found that New Yorkers opposed a state tax on soda of one penny per ounce by a 35-point margin, but opposition dropped to a margin of one point when respondents were told the money would go towards health care.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Bruce.

==== Lobbying ====
Fighting the creation of [[soft drink]] taxes, the [[American Beverage Association]], the largest U.S. trade organization for soft drink bottlers, has spent considerable money lobbying Congress. The Association's annual lobbying spending rose from about $391,000 to more than $690,000 from 2003 to 2008. And, in the 2010 election cycle, its lobbying grew to $8.67 million. These funds helped to pay for 25 lobbyists at seven different lobbying firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientlbs.php?lname=American+Beverage+Assn&amp;year=2009|title=Lobbying Spending Database-American Beverage Assn, 2009|publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An industry group called "Americans Against Food Taxes," backed by juice maker Welch's, soft drink maker PepsiCo Inc, the American Beverage Association, the Corn Refiners Association, McDonald's Corporation and Burger King Holdings Inc used national advertising and conducted lobbying to oppose these taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN16158491 Tax Soft Drinks To Fight Obesity, US experts say] Reuters, 16 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The group has characterized the soda tax as a regressive tax, which would unfairly burden the poor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nofoodtaxes.com/facts/#education "Education, Not Taxes] Americans Against Food Taxes, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against the sugary drinks tax====
* The criteria on what drinks are taxed may not include equally bad substitutes like fruit juice, energy-dense snacks and biscuits.&lt;ref name="Silano, Marco 2017"&gt;Silano, Marco, and Carlo Agostoni. "To Tax Or Not To Tax Sugary Drinks? This Is The Question". Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017): 1. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The tax is regressive since consumers on lower incomes will be more negatively impacted by higher prices than consumers on higher incomes.&lt;ref name="Silano, Marco 2017"/&gt; This regressive effect of the sugary drinks tax can be counteracted if the collected tax revenue is used to subsidize healthier foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brownell | first1 = Kelly D. | last2 = Frieden | first2 = Thomas R. | year = 2009 | title = Ounces Of Prevention — The Public Policy Case For Taxes On Sugared Beverages | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 360 | issue = 18| pages = 1805–1808 | doi=10.1056/nejmp0902392}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cross-border shopping can also be an easy way out for consumers to not pay the tax as they will buy sugary drinks from areas where they are not taxed.&lt;ref name="Silano, Marco 2017"/&gt;

===Various island nations and territories===

'''Telepathology''' is the practice of [[pathology]] at a distance. It uses [[telecommunications]] technology to facilitate the transfer of image-rich pathology data between distant locations for the purposes of [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[Medical education|education]], and [[Medical research|research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Weinstein | first = RS | last2 = Graham | first2 = AM | last3 = Richter | first3 = LC | last4 = Barker | first4 = GP | last5 = Krupinski | first5 = EA | last6 = Lopez | first6 = AM | last7 = Yagi | first7 = Y | last8 = Gilbertson | first8 = JR | last9 = Bhattacharyya | first9 = AK | last10 = Gilbertson | first10 = J.

The use of  "[[microscopy|television microscopy]]", the forerunner of telepathology, did not require that a pathologist have physical or virtual "hands-on" involvement in the selection of microscopic fields-of-view for analysis and diagnosis.

An [[academic]] pathologist, [[Ronald S. Weinstein]], M.D., coined the term "telepathology" in 1986.  In a [[medical journal]] [[editorial]], Weinstein outlined the actions that would be needed to create remote pathology diagnostic services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Weinstein  | first = RS | title = Prospects for telepathology (Editorial) | journal = Hum Pathol | year = 1986 | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 433–434|doi=10.1016/s0046-8177(86)80028-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his collaborators published the first scientific paper on robotic telepathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Weinstein | first = RS | last2 = Bloom | first2 = KJ | last3 = Rozek | first3 = LS | title = Telepathology and the networking of pathology diagnostic services | journal = Arch Pathol Lab Med | volume = 111 | issue = 7 | year = 1987 | pages = 646–652| pmid = 3606341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein was also granted the first [[United States|U.S.]] [[patents]] for [[robotics|robotic]] telepathology systems and telepathology diagnostic networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kayser | first = K | last2 = Szymas | first2 = J | last3 = Weinstein | first3 = RS | title = Telepathology: Telecommunications, Electronic Education and Publication in Pathology | year = 1999 | pages = 1–186 | publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein is known to many as the "father of telepathology".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://archive.is/20120805232102/http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=8942 | title=ReUnion '10 award winners}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norway]], Eide and Nordrum implemented the first sustainable clinical telepathology service in 1989;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Nordrum | first = I | last2 = Engum | first2 = B | last3 = Rinde | first3 = E | title = Remote frozen section service: A telepathology project to northern Norway. | journal = Hum Pathol | year = 1991 | pages = 514–518 | volume = 1991|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is still in operation decades later. A number of clinical telepathology services have benefited many thousands of patients in [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]].

Telepathology has been successfully used for many applications, including the rendering of [[histopathology]] tissue diagnoses at a distance. Although [[digital pathology]] imaging, including [[virtual microscopy]], is the mode of choice for telepathology services in developed countries, [[Analog signal|analog]] telepathology imaging is still used for patient services in some developing countries.

== Types of systems ==

Telepathology systems are divided into three major types: static image-based systems, [[real-time systems]], and [[virtual slide]] systems.

Static image systems have the benefit of being the most reasonably priced and usable systems.  They have the significant drawback in only being able to capture a selected subset of [[microscopic]] fields for off-site evaluation.

Real-time robotic microscopy systems and virtual slides allow a consultant pathologist the opportunity to evaluate histopathology slides in their entirety, from a distance. With real-time systems, the consultant actively operates a robotically controlled motorized [[microscope]] located at a distant site—changing focus, illumination, magnification, and field of view—at will.  Either an analog video camera or a digital video camera can be used for robotic microscopy. Another form of real-time microscopy involves utilizing a high resolution video camera mounted on a path lab microscope to send live digital video of a slide to a large computer monitor at the pathologist's remote location via encrypted store-and-forward software.  An echo-cancelling microphone at each end of the video conference allows the pathologist to communicate with the person moving the slide under the microscope.

[[Virtual slide]] systems utilize automated digital slide scanners that create a digital image file of an entire glass slide (whole slide image).  This file is stored on a computer server and can be navigated at a distance, over the [[Internet]], using a browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kayser | first = K | last2 = Molnar | first2 = B | last3 = Weinstein | first3 = RS | title = Digital pathology virtual slide technology in tissue-based diagnosis, research and education. | journal = VSV Interdisciplinary Medical Publishing | year = 2006 | pages = 1–193 | issue = Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital imaging]] is required for virtual microscopy.

While real-time and virtual slide systems offer higher diagnostic accuracy when compared with static-image telepathology, there are drawbacks to each. Real-time systems perform best on [[local area network]]s (LANs), but performance may suffer if employed during periods of high network traffic or using the Internet proper as a backbone. Expense is an issue with real-time systems and virtual slide systems as they can be costly.  Virtual slide telepathology is emerging as the technology of choice for telepathology services.  However, high throughput virtual slide scanners (those producing one virtual slide or more per minute) are currently expensive.  Also, virtual slide digital files are relatively large, often exceeding one [[gigabyte]] in size.  Storing and simultaneously retrieving large numbers of telepathology whole-slide image files can be cumbersome, introducing their own workflow challenges in the clinical laboratory.

== Uses and benefits ==

Benefits of telepathology include providing immediate access to off-site pathologists for rapid frozen section diagnoses. Another benefit can be gaining direct access to subspecialty pathologists such as a [[renal pathology|renal pathologist]], a [[neuropathologist]], or a [[dermatopathologist]], for immediate consultations.

== Services by country ==

=== Canada ===

[[Canada Health Infoway]] is the organization responsible for the implementation of telepathology in [[Canada]]. Canada Health Infoway is a federal non-profit which provides funding for improving digital health infrastructure.

Canada Health Infoway has targeted funding of $1.2 million CAD to the Telepathology Solution for the province of [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|accessdate=November 23, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is designed to connect all pathologists within the province. The long-term expectations are improvement to patient care and safety through access to pathology expertise, improved timeliness of results and quality of service.

In [[Ontario]], the [[University Health Network]] (UHN) hospitals are the primary drivers of the development of telepathology. The three northern Ontario communities of [[Timmins]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] and [[Kapuskasing]] have several community hospitals virtually linked to UHN pathologists via the Internet 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/lang-en/about-infoway/news/news-releases/613-uhn-establishes-first-telepathology-system-in-ontario |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803205309/http://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/lang-en/about-infoway/news/news-releases/613-uhn-establishes-first-telepathology-system-in-ontario |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 3, 2010 |title=UHN establishes first telepathology system in Ontario |work=News Releases |publisher=[[Canada Health Infoway]] |accessdate=November 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Therapy''' (often abbreviated '''tx''', '''Tx''', or '''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the attempted remediation of a [[health]] problem, usually following a [[diagnosis]]. In the medical field, it is usually [[synonym]]ous with '''treatment''' (also abbreviated '''tx''' or '''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'''). Among [[psychologist]]s and other mental [[health]] [[professional]]s, including [[psychiatrist]]s, psychiatric nurse practitioners, counselors, and clinical social workers, the term may refer specifically to [[psychotherapy]] (sometimes dubbed 'talking therapy'). The English word ''therapy'' comes via Latin ''therapīa'' from {{lang-grc-gre|θεραπεία}} and literally means "curing" or "healing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=therapy&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary, ''Therapy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As a rule, each therapy has [[indication (medicine)|indications]] and [[contraindication]]s.

== Semantic field ==
The words '''''care''''', '''''therapy''''', '''''treatment''''', and '''''intervention''''' overlap in a [[semantic field]], and thus they can be [[synonym]]ous depending on [[context (language use)|context]]. Moving rightward through that order, the [[connotation|connotative]] level of [[holism]] decreases and the level of specificity (to [[wikt:concrete#Adjective|concrete]] instances) increases. Thus, in [[health care]] contexts (where its [[word sense|senses]] are always [[mass noun|noncount]]), the word ''care'' tends to imply a broad idea of everything done to protect or improve someone's health (for example, as in the terms ''[[preventive healthcare|preventive care]]'' and ''[[primary care]]'', which connote ongoing action), although it sometimes implies a narrower idea (for example, in the simplest cases of [[wound care]] or [[post-anesthesia care unit|postanesthesia care]], a few particular steps are sufficient, and the patient's interaction with that provider is soon finished). In contrast, the word ''intervention'' tends to be specific and concrete, and thus the word is often [[count noun|countable]]; for example, one instance of [[cardiac catheterization]] is one [[Medical procedure|intervention]] performed, and [[coronary care unit|coronary care]] (noncount) can require a series of interventions (count). At the extreme, the piling on of such countable interventions amounts to [[interventionism (medicine)|interventionism]], a flawed model of care lacking holistic [[wikt:circumspection#Noun|circumspection]]—merely treating [[wikt:discrete#Adjective|discrete]] problems (in billable increments) rather than maintaining health. ''Therapy'' and ''treatment'', in the middle of the semantic field, can connote either the holism of ''care'' or the discreteness of ''intervention'', with context conveying the intent in each use. Accordingly, they can be used in both noncount and count senses (for example, ''therapy for [[chronic kidney disease]] can involve several [[dialysis]] treatments per week'').

The words ''aceology'' and ''iamatology'' are obscure and obsolete synonyms referring to the study of therapies.

== Types of therapies ==
{{See also|List of therapies}}

=== By chronology, priority, or intensity ===
==== Levels of care ====
Levels of care classify [[health care]] into categories of chronology, priority, or intensity, as follows:
* [[Emergency medicine|Emergency care]] handles [[medical emergency|medical emergencies]] and is a first point of contact or intake for less serious problems, which can be referred to other levels of care as appropriate.
* [[Intensive care medicine|Intensive care]], also called [[critical care medicine|critical care]], is care for extremely ill or injured patients. It thus requires high resource intensity, knowledge, and skill, as well as quick [[decision making]].
* [[Ambulatory care]] is care provided on an [[patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatient]] basis. Typically patients can walk into and out of the clinic under their own power (hence "ambulatory"), usually on the same day.
* [[Home care]] is care at home, including care from providers (such as physicians, nurses, and home health aides) making [[house call]]s, care from [[caregiver]]s such as family members, and patient [[self care|self-care]].
* [[Primary care]] is meant to be the main kind of care in general, and ideally a [[medical home]] that unifies care across referred providers.
* [[Secondary care]] is care provided by medical specialists and other health professionals who generally do not have first contact with patients, for example, cardiologists, urologists and dermatologists. A patient reaches secondary care as a next step from primary care, typically by provider referral although sometimes by patient self-initiative.
* [[Tertiary care]] is specialized consultative care, usually for [[patient#Outpatients and inpatients|inpatients]] and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional, in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced medical investigation and treatment, such as a [[tertiary referral hospital]].
* Follow-up care is additional care during or after [[convalescence]]. Aftercare is generally synonymous with follow-up care.
* [[End-of-life care]] is care near the end of one's life. It often includes the following:
** [[Palliative care]] is [[#Supportive therapy|supportive care]], most especially (but not necessarily) near the end of life.
** [[Hospice|Hospice care]] is palliative care very near the end of life when [[cure]] is very unlikely. Its main goal is comfort, both physical and mental.

==== Lines of therapy ====
&lt;!-- Over a dozen pages redirect to this section; if the text in this section header is changed, {{Anchor|Lines of therapy}} must be added to the heading to ensure that those pages continue to redirect to this section. --&gt;
Treatment decisions often follow formal or informal [[algorithm]]ic guidelines. Treatment options can often be ranked or prioritized into '''lines of therapy''': '''first-line therapy''', '''second-line therapy''', '''third-line therapy''', and so on. '''First-line therapy''' (sometimes called '''induction therapy''', '''primary therapy''', or '''front-line therapy''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary/?CdrID=346494 National Cancer Institute &gt; Dictionary of Cancer Terms &gt; first-line therapy] Retrieved July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; is the first therapy that will be tried. Its priority over other options is usually either: (1) formally recommended on the basis of [[clinical trial]] evidence for its best-available combination of efficacy, safety, and tolerability or (2) chosen based on the clinical experience of the physician. If a first-line therapy either fails to resolve the issue or produces intolerable [[side effect]]s, additional (second-line) therapies may be substituted or added to the treatment regimen, followed by third-line therapies, and so on.

An example of a context in which the formalization of treatment algorithms and the ranking of lines of therapy is very extensive is [[chemotherapy regimens]]. Because of the great difficulty in successfully treating some forms of cancer, one line after another may be tried. In [[oncology]] the count of therapy lines may reach 10 or even 20.

Often multiple therapies may be tried simultaneously ([[combination therapy]] or polytherapy). Thus [[combination chemotherapy]] is also called polychemotherapy, whereas chemotherapy with one agent at a time is called single-agent therapy or monotherapy.

[[Adjuvant therapy]] is therapy given in addition to the primary, main, or initial treatment, but simultaneously (as opposed to second-line therapy). [[Neoadjuvant therapy]] is therapy that is begun before the main therapy. Thus one can consider surgical excision of a tumor as the first-line therapy for a certain type and stage of cancer even though radiotherapy is used before it; the radiotherapy is neoadjuvant (chronologically first but not primary in the sense of the main event). [[Premedication]] is conceptually not far from this, but the words are not interchangeable; cytotoxic drugs to put a tumor "on the ropes" before surgery delivers the "knockout punch"  are called neoadjuvant chemotherapy, not premedication, whereas things like anesthetics or prophylactic antibiotics before dental surgery are called premedication.

[[Step therapy]] or stepladder therapy is a specific type of prioritization by lines of therapy. It is controversial in [[health care in the United States|American health care]] because unlike conventional [[decision-making]] about what constitutes first-line, second-line, and third-line therapy, which in the U.S. reflects safety and efficacy first and cost only according to the patient's wishes, step therapy attempts to mix cost containment by someone other than the patient (third-party payers) into the algorithm. [[Therapy freedom]] and the negotiation between [[individual and group rights]] are involved.

! scope="col" class="unsortable" | Description
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Abortive therapy}} abortive therapy
| A therapy that is intended to stop a medical condition from progressing any further.  A medication taken at the earliest signs of a disease, such as an [[analgesic]] taken at the very first symptoms of a [[migraine headache]] to prevent it from getting worse, is an abortive therapy. Compare [[abortifacient]]s, which abort a pregnancy.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Bridge therapy}} [[bridge therapy]]
| A therapy that [[figurative analogy|figuratively]] provides a bridge to another step or phase, crossing over some immediate chasm (challenge), in contrast with [[destination therapy]], which is the final therapy in cases where clinically appropriate. 
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Consolidation therapy}} consolidation therapy
| A therapy given to consolidate the gains from [[#Lines of therapy|induction therapy]]. In cancer, this means chasing after any malignant cells that may be left.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Curative therapy}} curative therapy
| A therapy with ''curative intent'', that is, one that seeks to [[cure]] the root cause of a disorder.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Definitive therapy}} definitive therapy
| A therapy that may be final, superior to others, [[#Curative therapy|curative]], or all of those.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Destination therapy}} [[destination therapy]]
| A therapy that is the final destination rather than a [[bridge therapy|bridge]] to another therapy. Usually refers to [[ventricular assist device]]s to keep the existing heart going, not just until a [[heart transplantation|heart transplant]] can occur, but for the rest of the patient's life expectancy.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Empiric therapy}} [[empiric therapy]]
| A therapy given on an empiric basis; that is, one given according to a clinician's educated guess despite uncertainty about the illness's causative factors. For example, empiric antibiotic therapy administers a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] immediately on the basis of a good chance (given the history, physical examination findings, and risk factors present) that the illness is bacterial and will respond to that drug (even though the bacterial species or variant is not yet known).
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Gold standard therapy}} gold standard therapy
| A therapy that is [[#Definitive therapy|definitive]], just as a [[gold standard (test)|gold standard diagnostic test]] is a definitive test.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Investigational therapy}} investigational therapy
| An [[experiment]]al therapy. Use of experimental therapies must be ethically justified, because by definition they raise the question of [[standard of care]]. Physicians have autonomy to provide empirical care (such as [[off-label use|off-label]] care) according to their experience and clinical judgment, but the autonomy has limits that preclude [[quackery]]. Thus it may be necessary to design a [[clinical trial]] around the new therapy and to use the therapy only per a formal [[protocol (science)|protocol]]. Sometimes shorthand phrases such as "treated on protocol" imply not just "treated according to a plan" but specifically "treated with investigational therapy".
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Maintenance therapy}} [[maintenance therapy]]
| A therapy taken during [[remission (medicine)|disease remission]] to prevent relapse.

! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Preventive therapy}} preventive therapy&lt;br /&gt;{{nowrap|(prophylactic therapy)}}
| A therapy that is intended to [[preventive healthcare|prevent a medical condition]] from occurring (also called prophylaxis). For example, many [[vaccine]]s prevent infectious diseases.
|- valign="top"

! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Supportive therapy}} supportive therapy
| A therapy that does not treat or improve the underlying condition, but instead increases the patient's comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfids.org/about-cfids/supportive-therapy.asp |title=CFIDS |publisher=CFIDS |date= |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213075456/http://www.cfids.org/about-cfids/supportive-therapy.asp |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, supportive care for flu, colds, or gastrointestinal upset can include rest, fluids, and [[over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] pain relievers; those things don't treat the cause, but they do ''treat the symptoms'' and thus provide relief. Supportive therapy may be ''palliative therapy'' ([[palliative care]]). The two terms are sometimes [[synonym]]ous, but ''palliative care'' often [[connotation|connotes]] serious illness and [[end-of-life care]], whereas ''supportive care'' is always connotatively neutral (it may be as simple as mere bedrest for the common cold). Therapy may be categorized as having [[#Curative therapy|curative intent]] (when it is possible to eliminate the disease) or ''palliative intent'' (when eliminating the disease is impossible and the focus shifts to minimizing the distress that it causes). The two are often [[wikt:contradistinguish#Verb|contradistinguished]] (mutually exclusive) in some contexts (such as the [[management of cancer|management of some cancers]]), but they are not inherently mutually exclusive; often a therapy can be both curative and palliative simultaneously. [[Supportive psychotherapy]] aims to support the patient by alleviating the worst of the symptoms, with the expectation that [[#Definitive therapy|definitive therapy]] can follow later if possible.

! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Systemic therapy}} systemic therapy
| A therapy that is [[wikt:systemic#Adjective|systemic]]. In the physiological [[word sense|sense]], this means affecting the whole body (rather than being local or locoregional), whether via [[systemic administration]], systemic effect, or both. [[Systemic therapy (psychotherapy)|Systemic therapy in the psychotherapeutic sense]] seeks to address people not only on the individual level but also as people in relationships, dealing with the interactions of groups.

==Big picture==

===Late 1700s–1930s (pre-WWII era)===

During this pre-WWII era, there are three big trends that operate separately, but sometimes affect each other in development and outcomes.

First, a trend of urbanization (fueled by the [[Industrial Revolution]]) as well as greater global trade and migration leads to new challenges, including those in urban sanitation and infectious diseases/pandemics. Six global [[cholera]] pandemics happen in this period because of increased commerce and migration.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

Second, there is a lot of development on the underlying theory of disease, advancements in vaccine and antibiotic development, and a variety of experimental large-scale eradication and control programs. One big example: the [[germ theory of diseases]] begins to become accepted and popularized starting around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/germtheory.html |title=Germ Theory |publisher=Harvard |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another big example is the development of the smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner in 1796.&lt;ref name=Baxby1999/&gt; Systematic eradication and control efforts include the [[Rockefeller Sanitary Commission]] and efforts to eradicate smallpox.&lt;ref name="cugh.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150918175742/http://cugh.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/modules/To%20Post%20Both%20Faculty%20and%20Trainees/29_Global_Health_In_Historical_Perspective_The_Uses_Of_History_FINAL.pptx.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Antitoxins and vaccines for numerous diseases including [[cholera]] and [[tuberculosis]] are developed during this period, building on a trend of greater understanding of and control over [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="vaccine_timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/timeline |title=Timeline – History of Vaccines |publisher=The College of Physicians of Philadelphia |accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theme during this era is the formation of various preliminary international alliances and conferences, including the [[International Sanitary Conferences]], [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]], and the [[League of Nations]] Health Committee. This is closely intertwined with the other two trends. For instance, the cholera pandemics mentioned above, as well as the growing scientific understanding of the germ theory of disease, are both key impetuses for the International Sanitary Conferences.&lt;ref name="markel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |title=Worldly approaches to global health: 1851 to the present |first=Howard |last=Markel |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418174941/http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}}

===1940s–early 1960s (post-WWII era)===
Following the end of [[World War II]], the first batch of big organizations, both international and national (with international cooperation), including the [[United Nations]] and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), form.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt; Beginning with the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] for relief of victims of war in 1943, there is a big push to begin creating large scale health initiatives, non-governmental organizations, and worldwide global health programs by the United Nations to improve quality of life around the world. [[UNICEF]], the World Health Organization, as well as the UNRRA are all part of United Nations efforts to benefit global health beginning with developing countries. These various programs aim to aid in economic endeavors by providing loans, direct disease prevention programs, health education, etc.

===Late 1960s–1970s===

After wrapping up complications caused by the end of the war, there is an international energy put in into eradication, beginning with the complete smallpox eradication in 1979. There is greater dissatisfaction with WHO for its focus on disease/infection control at the expense of trying to improve general living conditions, as well as disappointment at its low budget and staffing. This atmosphere spurs other organizations to provide their own forms of aid.&lt;ref name="palilonis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioethics.wfu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Topic-3-A-Brief-History-of-Global-Health.pdf |title=An Introduction to Global Health and Global Health Ethics: A Brief History of Global Health |author= M. A. Palilonis |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|126}} The [[Alma Ata Declaration]] and selective [[primary healthcare]] are created to express urgent action by all governments and citizens to protect and promote the health of all people equally.&lt;ref name="Alma Ata Declaration"&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/publications/almaata_declaration_en.pdf Declaration from the website of the World Health Organization].&lt;/ref&gt; More organizations form following these new active attitudes toward global health, including the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] and the [[Doctors Without Borders]] organization. Publications like the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]] highlight basic medicines required by most adults and children to survive, and set priorities for healthcare fund allocation in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/|title=WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, there is more buy-in for the idea that direct, targeted efforts to address healthcare could be worthwhile and benefit many countries.

===1980s–2000===

Certain specific efforts increase in efficiency and productivity, including improvement in maternal and child health and a focus on [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]] (the 'Big Three') in developing countries. During this time period, the [[child survival revolution]] (CSR), which helps reduce child mortality in the developing world, and [[GOBI-FFF]] are both advocated by [[James P. Grant]].&lt;ref name="David Bornstein 2007 pp. 250"&gt;David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Summit for Children]] also takes place, becoming one of the largest ever gathering of heads of states and government to commit a set of goals to improve the well-being of children. Finally, HIV/AIDS becomes the focus of many governmental and non-governmental organizations, leading to the formation of the Global Programme on AIDS (GPA) by efforts of the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|6}} However, these health organizations also make significant advancements to tuberculosis treatments, including the [[DOTS]] strategy and the formation of the [[Stop TB Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoptb.org/|title=Stop TB Partnership - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and beyond===

UN's [[Millennium Development Goals]] establishes health care as an important goal (not just combating infectious diseases).&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Later in 2015, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] build on the MDGs to outline the objectives that will transform our world by ending poverty, helping the environment, and improving health and education. More specific disease-targeting organizations are created primarily to fund healthcare plans in developing countries, including the  [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] and [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/|title=Home - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations (especially the WHO) adopt new strategies and initiatives, including the [[3 by 5 Initiative]] to widen the access to [[antiretroviral treatment]], the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/|title=World Health Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private large donors such as the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] begin to play an important role in shaping the funding landscape and direction of efforts in global health.

==Full timeline==

=== Inclusion criteria ===

The following events are selected for inclusion in the timeline:

* Major medical advances, such as the first vaccines or antibiotics for important diseases.
* Major disease outbreaks, particularly those that played a key role in identifying key medical facts about the nature of disease or epidemiology.
* Key programs, innovations, and strategies in delivery of treatments and healthcare supply chains.
* Government policies or healthcare systems that are the first of their kind in the world, or have global significance for some other reason.
* The forming of trans-national organizations and private foundations that either directly deal with global health, or fund and manage other organizations that do. Note that we also include some emergency medical relief organizations, because they have played an important role in identifying and combating disease outbreaks in the aftermath of natural or man-made disaster.
* Important conferences related to global health. For conferences held regularly, we only include an event for the first time the conference was held, or if there was a particularly influential conference.

We do ''not'' include:

* Incremental advances in medical science except the most important ones.
* Rollouts of policies by different governments, or changes to local healthcare structures, except those that are pioneering. To understand healthcare at the country level, you can see the timelines of healthcare by country.
* Incremental changes to existing trans-national organizations or private foundations in their global health programs, except those that have significance as pioneering new approaches to global health.

==Description==
The Total Diet Study is the US [[FDA]]´s ongoing annual assessment of U.S. consumers' average [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] intake of about 800 contaminants and nutrients. To this effort its [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]] at College Park, Maryland has been buying, preparing, and analyzing about "280 kinds of foods and beverages from representative areas of the country, four times a year".
To make estimates as realistic as possible, foods are bought from the same places "as consumers do", in each of four regions of the country (North Central, West, South, and Northeast). The purchases or [[market basket]]s are identical as much as possible. It is bought in supermarkets, grocery stores, and fast-food restaurants in three cities per region, which change every year.&lt;ref name=tds&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/default.htm Total Diet Study] US FDA,Page Last Updated: 04/08/2016, accessed 10 Nov 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA Kansas City District Laboratory  in [[Lenexa, Kansas]] is the central lab for the country and prepares and analyzes each kind of food, combining samples from the 3 cities of a region to make one composite sample.&lt;ref name=studydesign/&gt; 
Foods are prepared "as consumers typically would",&lt;ref name=tds/&gt; which includes washing, peeling, cooking.&lt;ref name=compliance/&gt;{{rp|3}} Radionuclide analyses are only done from two market baskets per year at FDA's Engineering and Analytical Center in [[Winchester, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=studydesign/&gt;

With the analysis, FDA estimates the average consumption by the entire U.S. population, and split up by age and gender (from age 14 years onward) each year. The food list is adjusted about every 10 years to account for [[food trends]], changing patterns of what people eat. Likewise data on how much of those foods consumers eat may be adjusted.&lt;ref name=tds/&gt;
 
FDA states the purpose as tracking [[food trends]] and trends in the consumption of contaminants and nutrients in the average American diet, and developing interventions to reduce risks, as needed in its food safety and nutrition programs.&lt;ref name=tds/&gt;

==Foods and analytes==
Food categories include baby foods, beverages, dairy products, eggs, food mixtures, fruits and fruit juice, grain products, legumes &amp; nuts &amp; seeds, meat &amp; poultry &amp; fish, fats and oils, sweets, vegetables.&lt;ref name=food&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/ucm184970.htm Total Diet Study.Foods and analytes] US FDA, Page Last Updated: 04/08/2016, accessed 10 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Determination methods for analysis including [[Strontium-90]], a [[beta emitter]] and for [[Gamma emitter]]s are published .&lt;ref name=anal&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/ucm184646.htm Total Diet Study. Analytical Methods] US FDA, Page Last Updated: 04/08/2016, accessed 10 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of |November 2017}} the latest individual-year results for elements are from 2015 for pesticides are from 2012.&lt;ref name=anal/&gt;

==History==
In 1961, the US FDA began a program to monitor radioactive contamination of foods.
Over time, it expanded to include pesticides,{{when|date=November 2017}} industrial and other toxic chemicals, and nutrients.
Data are published annually, and electronic data since 1991 are available.&lt;ref name=tds/&gt; 

In 1991, the market baskets were updated, and the food list was chosen from the [[USDA]] 1987-88 "Nationwide Food Consumption Survey".&lt;ref name=studydesign&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/ucm184232.htm Total Diet Study. Study Design] US FDA, Page Last Updated: 04/08/2016, accessed 10 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 food-list update used a food list from the USDA's 1994-96, 1998 "Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals" (CSFII) published in 2000.&lt;ref name=studydesign/&gt;

In 2014, FDA updated methods of measuring elements in foods to detect and differentiate them at lower levels.&lt;ref name=anal/&gt;
 
==Controversy==
In 2016 the FDA has been criticized for not following their own compliance program guidance manual&lt;ref name=compliance&gt;US FDA [https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170406021314/https:/www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/ComplianceEnforcement/UCM073281.pdf compliance program guidance manual] 32 pp, 9/30/17, accessed 11 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt; to follow-up on unusual analytical findings. [[Perchlorate]] levels in the 2016 update had been far greater than in 2004-2006. Upon a [[FOIA request]], the Center for Food Science and Applied Nutrition could not find any records or communications of the coordinator investigating the possible cause of high levels of perchlorate in bologna, collard greens and salami lunchmeat nor receipts to identify brand and lot &lt;ref&gt;Tom Neltner [http://blogs.edf.org/health/2017/11/02/little-follow-up-when-fda-finds-high-levels-of-perchlorate-in-food/ Little follow-up when FDA finds high levels of perchlorate in food] Environmental Defense Fund, November 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8066">The '''University of Washington Department of Global Health''' is a department jointly run by the schools of [[University of Washington School of Medicine|Medicine]] and [[University of Washington School of Public Health|Public Health]] at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. Its aim is to provide a multidisciplinary venue to address issues of [[global health]] at the university.

The department was begun with funding supplied by the [[Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Nick. [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2002346623&amp;zsection_id=2002111777&amp;slug=globalhealth24m&amp;date=20050624 “UW to add global health studies.”] ''The Seattle Times'', 24 June 2005, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, Tom. [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/256259_globalhealth19.html “UW gets global-health shot in the arm $30 million from Gates Foundation.”] ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', 19 Jan. 2006, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

== About the Department ==
The Department of Global Health was launched in January 2007 with support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the state of Washington, and the University of Washington, with a mandate to harness the extraordinary expertise, energy, and creativity of faculty across all 17 UW schools and colleges to create one of the most comprehensive academic global health programs in the world.[1]

The pioneering work of UW researchers in sexually transmitted diseases in the 1970s and 1980s paved the way for the University's leading role in HIV/AID research and training, and, now, global health.

The Department is housed in both the School of Medicine and School of Public Health and has formed linkages across campus and throughout the world to help address not only infectious diseases but a host of pressing global health issues, including health metrics and evaluation; the health of women, children, and adolescents; [[health system strengthening]] and implementation science; climate change and health; global trauma and violence prevention; and global medicines safety with a cross-cutting focus on social justice and equity. The Center for Integrated Health of Women, Children, and Adolescents, for example, includes at least 22 collaborations (13 on campus and partnerships in Kenya, Ethiopia, Mexico, and Peru). And the initiative on Climate Change and Global Health involves more than 25 collaborations on campus and beyond.

Its closely affiliated centers also include the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] (IHME), the International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH), the International Clinical Research Center (ICRFC), the Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), Health Alliance International (HaI), and the Global Health Resource Center (GHRC).&lt;ref&gt;Department of Global Health brochure, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department has strong ties in Kenya, Peru, Mozambique, and Ethiopia. But worldwide, the Department works with nearly 250 collaborating organizations, including universities and hospitals, NGOs, government agencies, and ministries of health.

Quote from Howard Frumkin MD, MPH, Dean of the UW School of Public Health: "Global health represents the best of academic health sciences -- transdisciplinary systems thinking, cross-cultural sensitivity, rigorous scientific research, hands-on participatory training, effective service delivery with impact empirically measured, and sustainable collaboration. This Department is outstanding. "

== Education ==
'''Master's Level:''' The Department offers several global health tracks for a master of Public Health degree: General; Leadership, Policy, and Management; Health Metrics and Evaluation; Peace Corps; Epidemiology; and concurrent degrees.

'''Doctoral Programs:''' The Department offers a doctoral program in Pathobiology. A doctoral program in global health with emphases on health metrics and evaluation and implementation science is in development.

'''Fellowship Programs:''' The Department offers post-bachelor and post-graduate fellowship programs with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

'''Certificate Programs:''' The Department has a certificate program in Global Health and a program in AIDS and STIs. Medical students also can take a Global Health Pathway.

'''Undergraduate Programs:''' An undergraduate minor in global health was launched in January 2011.

== Selection of the Chair ==
[[Jim Yong Kim]], formerly of [[Partners in Health]] and the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] [[HIV/AIDS]] program, was originally a candidate for director of the department, but was not selected.  A controversial second selection process involving three new candidates took place in late 2005 and early 2006. The process was criticized for not being open, and there was concern&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, Tom. [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/259935_uwglobalhealth17.html “Concern over new UW department.”] ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', 17 Feb. 2006, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erkkinen, Meghan. [http://dailyuw.com/2006/2/23/student-voices-an-issue/ “Student voices an issue.”] ''The Daily of the University of Washington'', 23 Feb. 2006, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; among the student body and faculty about the chosen chair. Some feared that the department would be too heavily oriented towards [[biomedical research]] and [[biotechnology]] (e.g. [[vaccine]] development) and would neglect the broader issues of public health, such as [[social justice]], [[health disparities]], [[Preventive medicine|prevention]], [[health promotion|promotion]], human resources in health, and [[public policy]]. Some also feared that the areas of education and service would be sacrificed for a research agenda, and pointed to the fact that one of the first steps in implementing the department was the leasing of a large facility off campus in Seattle's [[South Lake Union]] neighborhood - an area being developed as a biotechnology hub.&lt;ref&gt;Engleman, Eric. [http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2006/01/09/daily13.html?jst=b_ln_hl “UW signs lease at Seattle’s South Lake Union.”] ''Puget Sound Business Journal'' (Seattle), 11 Jan. 2006, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Those within the process argued that planning was open and that the department would be multidisciplinary and would live up to its stated vision of taking a broad approach to global health. They also noted that while the department would have some facilities off campus, it would be primarily based at the university; the deans of the schools committed to finding on-campus space to house the department's administrative offices, although much of the lab space was planned to be located in a building in the Eastlake neighborhood.

In Spring, 2006, Michael Merson of [[Yale University]] was offered the position of director. However, in July of that year it was announced that Merson had been appointed direct of [[Duke University]]'s Global Health Institute.

On September 8, University of Washington announced King K. Holmes, MD, PhD, a world leader in AIDS and infectious disease research and training, to become the first chair of the University of Washington's new Department of Global Health.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, Tom. [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/284329_globalhealth08.html “UW picks Holmes to lead new global health program.”] ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', 8 Sept. 2006, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; His leadership in global health research and training, and experience as a public-health practitioner, will serve Holmes well in leading the Department of Global Health, according to Paul G. Ramsey, dean of the School of Medicine.

Studies of social attitudes show violence is perceived as more or less serious depending on the gender of victim and perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golden|first1=Tom|title=Male Bashing in Mental Health Research|url=http://menaregood.com/bias.pdf|website=Men Are Good|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WjRbju2W?url=http://menaregood.com/bias.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2015|access-date=2 March 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Munirkazmi | first1 = Syeda Sana | last2 = Mohyuddin | first2 = Anwaar | title = Violence against men (a case study of Naiabaadichaakra, Rawalpindi) | journal = International Journal of Environment, Ecology, Family and Urban Studies (IJEEFUS) | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;10 | publisher = Trans Stellar | date = December 2012 | url = http://www.tjprc.org/publishpapers/--1354635512-1.%20Merged%20formatting%20files%20-Env%20eco.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feather1&gt;{{cite journal | last = Feather | first = Norm T. | title = Domestic violence, gender, and perceptions of justice | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 35 | issue = 7&amp;ndash;8 | pages = 507&amp;ndash;519 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF01544134 | date = October 1996 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01544134 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Felson]] challenges the assumption that violence against women is different from violence against men. The same motives play a role in almost all violence, regardless of gender: to gain control or retribution and to promote or defend self-image.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Gail Erlick | title = Violence and gender reexamined | journal = [[American Journal of Psychiatry]] | volume = 160 | issue = 9 | pages = 1711&amp;ndash;1712 | publisher = [[American Psychiatric Association]] | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.9.1711 | date = September 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.160.9.1711 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for [[Time (magazine)|TIME]], [[Cathy Young]] criticised the feminist movement for not doing enough to challenge double standards in the treatment of male victims of physical abuse and sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Cathy|author-link=Cathy Young|title=Sorry, Emma Watson, but HeForShe is rotten for men|url=http://time.com/3432838/emma-watson-feminism-men-women/|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=September 26, 2014|access-date= August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homicide==

In the U.S., crime statistics from the 1976 onwards show that men make up the majority of the [[homicide]] perpetrators regardless if the victim is female or male. Men are also over-represented as victims in homicide involving both male and female offenders.&lt;ref name="BJS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htius.pdf#page=48 |title=Homicide trends in the United States|publisher=[[Bureau of Justice Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], women who kill men are most likely to kill acquaintances, spouses or boyfriends while men are more likely to kill strangers.&lt;ref name="BJS-WO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/wo.pdf | title=Bureau of Justice Statistics - Special Report - Women Offenders | work=[[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] | date=December 1999 | accessdate=6 March 2015 | pages=14 | last1=Greenfeld | first1=Lawrence A. | last2=Snell | first2=Tracy L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, women kill men due to being victims of [[intimate partner violence]],&lt;ref name="Farr"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Farr | first = Kathryn Ann | title = Aggravating and differentiating factors in the cases of white and minority women on death row | journal = [[Crime &amp; Delinquency]] | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 260&amp;ndash;278 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0011128797043003002 | date = July 1997 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0011128797043003002 | quote=''They [women on death row] typically kill people they know, primarily men - most often husbands or lovers in domestic encounters (Mann 1996; Campbell 1993; Silverman et al. 1993; Weisheit 1993; Browne 1987; Goetting 1987; Wilbanks 1983). ...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11698">A '''well woman examination''' is an exam offered to women to review elements of their [[reproductive health]]. It is recommended once a year for most women. The exam includes a [[breast examination]], a [[pelvic examination]] and a [[pap smear]] but may also include other procedures. Hospitals employ strict policies relating to the provision of consent by the patient, the availability of [[chaperone (clinical)|chaperone]]s at the examination, and the absence of other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|url=http://www.whittington.nhs.uk/Documents/Intimate%20Examination%20and%20Chaperoning_1905.pdf|date=July 2003|author=Kath Evans|publisher=Whittington Hospital NHS Trust|title=INTIMATE EXAMINATION, PROCEDURE, CARE &amp;amp; CHAPERONING POLICY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=School pupil allowed to observe intimate examination|author=Helen Barratt|url=http://www.studentbmj.com/issues/01/10/news/361a.php|journal=studentBMJ|date=October 2001|volume=09|pages=357&amp;ndash;398|publisher=BMJ Publishing Group Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most healthcare providers also allow the patient to specify if they have any preferences towards the examiner's gender.

==Importance==
The well-woman examination by a medical professional is recommended at least once a year to women over 18 years old and/or women who are sexually active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/ACOG-Departments/Annual-Womens-Health-Care/Well-Woman-Recommendations|title=Well-Woman Recommendations - ACOG|website=www.acog.org|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its importance lies in identifying potential early health problems. The most important tests included in an examination is the breast exam, pelvic exam and the pap test, although some doctors consider other tests in the examination, including measurement of blood pressure, [[HIV testing]], and other laboratory tests such as [[urinalysis]], [[Complete blood count|CBC (Complete blood count)]] and testing for other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. The procedure is important also to detect certain cancers, especially [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name="Reproductive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcm.edu/crowd/?pmid=1467|title=Reproductive Health Information - The Well Woman Exam|work=Baylor College of Medicine. Center for research on women with disabilities|accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Well&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campushealth.unc.edu/services/womens-health/well-womans-exam.html|title=Well Woman’s Exam |work=trive. Campus Health Services |accessdate=2013-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breast examination==

===Visual inspection===
The breast examination begins with a visual inspection. With the patient in a prone or seated position, the medical professional will look at both breasts to check the color, symmetry, dimensions according to age, lean body mass, the physiological (pregnancy and lactation) and race, looking for abnormalities, such as bulges and shrinkage.&lt;ref name=Manual&gt;{{cite web|url= http://escuela.med.puc.cl/Publ/ManualSemiologia/270ExamenMamas.htm|title=Examen de las Mamas |work= Manual de Semiología|accessdate=2013-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these abnormalities is changed in the [[areola]] or nipple. If it is flattened or retracted (umbilicated), it is necessary to consider the possibility of a cancerous lesion which has caused the malformation.&lt;ref name=Manual/&gt;&lt;ref name="Exploración"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.isea.gob.mx/formatos/Cancer%20de%20mama/CLINICA%20DE%20MAMAS%20(web).pdf |title=Manual de exploración Física de las Mamas |work= Secretaría de Salud|accessdate=2013-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palpation===
Next, the breasts are palpated, again with the patient lying or sitting. The patient has to lift the arm and put one hand behind her head. With this position, the entire gland is palpated. It is also important to examine the armpits, because of masses that may be found there.&lt;ref name=Manual/&gt; The test is executed pressing the gland with two or three fingers against the chest wall, making a radial route or by quadrants. The nipple is also squeezed check for secretions, such as secretion of milk ([[galactorrhea]]), [[serous]], blood or purulent secretions. If a node is detected, it is necessary to determine its place, size, shape, edges, consistency and sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Manual/&gt;

===Self-examination===
In addition to the yearly check by a professional, women over the age of 18 should also perform this examination monthly.
It is important because regular and comprehensive examinations of the breasts can be used to find breast changes that occur between every clinical examination and detect early breast cancer. This auto examination should to be performed seven days after the onset of the menstrual period. If a woman finds a lump or notice any changes in her breast, she should seek medical attention promptly.&lt;ref name=Autoexamen&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.permanente.net/homepage/kaiser/pdf/6293.pdf|title=Autoexamen de los senos |work= Kaiser permanent|accessdate=2013-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Autoexamen/&gt;

===Further examination of the breasts===
A mammogram or mammography is a special x-ray of the breasts. They are the procedure most likely to detect early breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Mammograms can show tumors long before they are large enough to palpate. They are recommended for women who have symptoms of breast cancer or who are at increased risk of developing the disease. They are performed with the patient standing, the breast pressed between two plastic plates, as the image is taken. The interpretation has to be performed by a specialist.&lt;ref name=Mmmography&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mammography.html|title=Mammography |website= Medline Plus|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health|accessdate=2013-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast ultrasound is a complementary study of mammography. In many women the tissue that makes up the breast is very dense, representing fibrous tissue and glandular tissue, which produces milk during lactation. This limits the radiologist interpreting the study, so, in these cases, the ultrasound is helpful, since this is capable of distinguishing tumors in women with dense breast tissue, where identification is otherwise difficult. Additionally, it is advisable to follow up a mammogram that shows indications of tumors with an ultrasound, to confirm, before more invasive procedures are undertaken.&lt;ref name=Ultrasonido&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.fucam.org.mx/index.php/servicios/ultrasonido-mamario|title=Ultrasonido mamario |work= FUCAM|accessdate=2013-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pelvic exam==
The [https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pelvic-exam/about/pac-20385135?p=1 pelvic exam] is part of the physical examination of the pelvic area of a woman, which generally also includes the taking of a sample for a pap smear. This test includes three parts. These are the general inspection of the external genitalia, bimanual examination, and inspection of the vaginal canal using a speculum.&lt;ref name=Anatomia&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parrondo P, Pérez-Medina T, Álvarez-Heros J |title = Anatomía del aparato genital femenino|journal = Salud Mujer|pages = 15–18 |date=April 2013 |url = http://www2.univadis.net/microsites/area_salud_mujer/pdfs/1-Anatomia_del_aparto_genital_femenino.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspection of external female genitalia ===
The patient is placed in a supine position on a special examination table, which has two protrusions called "stirrups." With the feet in these stirrups, the legs are placed in a position such that the medical professional can access the pelvic area. The external genitalia is examined first, looking for abnormalities like lesions, ulcers, warts and color changes. The elements of this exam include the vulva, which contains the mons pubis, of which there are two longitudinal folds of skin forming the labia majora; then the labia minora and hair follicles. The clitoral hood is also checked.&lt;ref name=Anatomia/&gt;

===Bimanual exam===
The purpose of this exam is to palpate organs which cannot be seen with visual inspection. The index and middle finger are inserted into the vagina. This maneuver allows the doctor to check the orientation, length and width of the vagina. Next, the cervix and vaginal fornices are palpated, to check position, size, consistency, mobility and sensibility.&lt;ref name=Examen&gt;{{cite web |url= http://escuela.med.puc.cl/Publ/ManualSemiologia/Ginecolo.html|title=Examen ginecológico  |work= Manual de Semiología |accessdate=2013-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other hand is placed in the pubis pressing it to feel the uterus between both hands. The most important characteristics to examine are the size of the uterus, presence of nodes or agglomerations, consistency, size, tilt, and mobility. With this technique, the ovaries are also palpable.&lt;ref name=Examen/&gt;

===Speculum examination===
The speculum examination is recommended for only women over 21 years old, irrespective of her sexual activity.&lt;ref name=Well-Woman&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.acog.org/Resources%20And%20Publications/Committee%20Opinions/Committee%20on%20Gynecologic%20Practice/Well-Woman%20Visit.aspx |title=Well-Woman Visit |work= The American College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists |accessdate=2013-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The speculum is an instrument made of metal or plastic and is constructed with two flaps. Its purpose is to separate and widen the vaginal opening and keep it open. This allows direct observation by the physician into the vaginal canal with the help of a lamp or a mirror.&lt;ref name=tecnica&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.polgalvan.sld.cu/softw_apn/contenido/tecnicaespeculo.htm|title=Técnica de colocación del eséculo |work= Omar Morera |accessdate=2013-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different types of speculums used within the different characteristics of each patient such as age, sex life, and other factors. The first step is to open the vaginal opening with two fingers at the vulvo-perineal angle, then separate the fingers slightly and press down, then insert the speculum arranging the width of the tip of the flaps in anteroposterior. Then the speculum is moved into the vagina at an angle of 45°, following the natural contour of the posterior vaginal wall. When the speculum is in place, the fingers are removed and the device is rotated so that the flaps are horizontal. The flaps are then separated and locked into place when the cervical neck is completely visible.&lt;ref name=tecnica/&gt;

==Pap smear==
The pap smear is a screening test to test for abnormalities such as cervical cancer and human papillomavirus infections, which require early treatment. To be viable, the patient should not be menstruating and had not used a vaginal contraceptive in the prior 24–48 hours.&lt;ref name=pelvico&gt;{{cite journal | author = Klein S., Miller S., Thomson F002E| title = El examen pélvico| journal = Atención del embarazo, el parto y la salud de la mujer| pages = 373–387 |date=May 2000 | url = http://hesperian.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/es_midw_2011/es_midw_2011_Cap20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure begins with the scraping of cells from the cervix and the uterine fornix, done during the speculum examination as there is access to the cervix. The scraping is done with a spatula, cervical brush or swab. Some women experience temporary bleeding from this procedure. The scrapings are placed on a slide, covered with a fixative for later examination under a microscope to determine if they are normal or abnormal.&lt;ref name=pelvico/&gt;
