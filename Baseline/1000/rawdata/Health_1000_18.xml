      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">In [[epidemiology]], the '''attack rate''' is the biostatistical measure of frequency of [[morbidity]], or speed of spread, in an at risk population. It is used in hypothetical predictions and during actual [[outbreaks]] of disease. An at risk population is defined as one that has no immunity to the attacking pathogen which can be either a [[novel pathogen]] or an established pathogen. It is used to project the number of victims to expect during an [[epidemic]]. This aids in marshalling resources for delivery of medical care as well as production of vaccines and/or anti-viral and anti-bacterial medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony N. Glaser. High-Yield Biostatistics. Williams &amp; Wilkins. Baltimore. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The rate is arrived at by taking the number of new cases in the population at risk and dividing by the number of persons at risk in the population.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mbox{number of new cases in the population at risk}}{\mbox{number of persons at risk in the population}}=\mbox{Rate}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Rates are determined from the beginning of the [[outbreak]] to its end. The term should probably not be described as a rate because its time dimension is uncertain. While the duration of an epidemic can be predicted given other variables such as early intervention, it cannot be known in absolute terms. In epidemiology, a rate requires a defined unit change (in this instance, time) over which the rate applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = International Epidemiological Association | title = A Dictionary of Epidemiology. (Last JM, editor) | edition = 4th | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-19-514169-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is often referred to as an attack ratio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8950">Children in [[Uganda]] are regularly exposed to many preventable health risks.  According to the WHO, the country ranks 175th out of 193 eligible countries in life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Life Expectancy|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688?lang=en|publisher=WHO|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The country also ranks 168 out of 188 in infant mortality rates, with a lower rank reflecting lower infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2091.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many cultural factors influencing the current health status of Uganda including the negative stigmas associated with sex, and the [[wood-burning stove]]s. The former{{which|date=June 2014}} of these has resulted in a severe lack in education and communication necessary to improve the health and well-being of children.

== HIV/AIDS ==

HIV/AIDS is likely the leading health risk facing Ugandan children; it affects many facets of their physical and mental health in a variety of ways. It is the leading cause of death in Uganda, as reported by the [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) in 2010.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Health - Uganda|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/countries/uganda/|publisher=CDC|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC has been fairly active in the country, working in cooperation with government organizations as well as a number of other partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global HIV/AIDS Uganda|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalaids/Global-HIV-AIDS-at-CDC/countries/Uganda/|publisher=CDC|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work has been on multiple fronts including door to door HIV counseling and testing.  Despite these and many other efforts, there are poor rates of treatment of children.  Of the 190,000 HIV-positive children in Uganda, only 35,500 received Antiretroviral medication (ARV).  Uganda is not alone in this, in 21 high burden African countries, only 34 percent of eligible children receive ARVs, compared to 68 percent of adults.

In addition, many of the children that receive medication have been found to lack necessary diligence in their drug therapy routine.  Many children find the medication unpleasant and are not even aware of their HIV status.  Part of this can be attributed to lapses in communication.  For example, it is common practice not to inform children of their HIV status until they reach 13 years of age. Sexual lifestyles are typically frowned upon in Uganda, particularly for women, which contributes to a poor dissemination of sexual related health information.

Research has shown that efforts to improve health and awareness of parents and guardians, as well as the communities, of children with HIV/AIDS could be an effective way to improve treatment.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilborn|first=Laelia|title=Making a Difference for Children Affected by AIDS: Baseline Findings from Operations Research in Uganda|date=2001|publisher=The Population Council, Inc|page=26|citeseerx = 10.1.1.175.8111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased education and awareness can help with communication breakdowns and access to resources.  These efforts can also help decrease mother-to-child transmissions.

It is estimated that 91,000 infants are born each year to HIV-positive women.&lt;ref name=ART&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuznik|first=Andreas|title=Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of combination antiretroviral therapy for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Uganda|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=April 10, 2012|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/8/11-095430/en/|accessdate=15 May 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only 51.6 percent of these women receive any sort of mother-to-child HIV prevention and about 24 percent of all 110,000 new HIV infections in Uganda in 2009 were a result of [[mother-to-child transmission]].  A study published by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that [[antiretroviral therapy]] (ART) is a very effective management strategy, in terms of efficacy as well as cost, for prevention of mother-to-child transmissions.&lt;ref name=ART /&gt;  In addition, often material support for parents/guardians can be an effective strategy in improving care and treatment of children, including funding for food, clothing, and educational expenses.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

To date, most of Uganda's policies to combat AIDS have focused on [[abstinence]] and fidelity, both preventative measures while little action has been taken around youth education.  The main tool of this strategy is the controversial ABC campaign (Abstinence, Be faithful, and use Condoms).  While initially believed to be a successful approach, the effectiveness of this strategy is currently inconclusive as more recent studies have found that increased condom use and deaths have been responsible for the decreases in HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russell|first=Sabin|title=Uganda's HIV rate drops, but not from abstinence|url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Uganda-s-HIV-rate-drops-but-not-from-abstinence-2727887.php|work=SFGate|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malnutrition ==

[[Malnutrition]] plagues much of Uganda's youth. According to a study by the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP), roughly one third of Ugandan children have stunting, a permanent condition resulting from lack of proper nutrition during the first 5 years of life. Consequences of this have been found to be very costly to the Ugandan government and economy, with estimated losses totaling at US $899 million annually, or 5 percent of the country's GDP.&lt;ref name=WFP&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger Costs Uganda 5.6 Per Cent Of GDP|url=http://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/hunger-costs-uganda-56-cent-gdp|publisher=World Food Programme|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vaccinations ==

While many efforts are currently in place in Uganda to distribute vaccinations to children, it is still a very serious health concern. About 2 million deaths each year in Uganda are a result of [[vaccine preventable diseases]].  [[Tuberculosis]] is one example of these, which was found to be the 4th leading cause of death in Uganda in 2010 according to the CDC.&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt; In 2001, it was found that 63% of children less than one year old had either failed to complete their [[vaccination schedule]] or not had any vaccinations at all.&lt;ref name=ministry&gt;{{cite book|title=Promotion of Immunisation in Uganda|date=June 2002|publisher=The Ministry of Health|page=3|url=http://www.path.org/vaccineresources/files/Uganda_immunization_advocacy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study found that vaccination rates can be improved by providing additional support to mothers to enable them to make use of immunization services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babirye|first=Juliet|title=Timeliness of Childhood Vaccinations in Kampala Uganda: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study|journal=PLOS One|date=23 April 2012|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035432|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wood-burning stoves ==

Traditionally in Uganda, as in most developing countries, open word-burning stoves are commonly used for cooking and to heat homes.  It has been estimated that 95 percent of Ugandans rely on wood or charcoal for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugand Efficient Wood Cook Stoves|url=http://www.offsetters.ca/offset-projects/by-country/uganda-efficient-wood-cook-stoves|publisher=Offsetters|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sanitary pads ==

One health issue facing female children specifically in Uganda as well as many other developing countries is the inability to afford [[sanitary pads]].  Besides the obvious health and sanitation concerns, this problem also often has harmful effects on education.  Evaluations by the Kasiisi Project, a non-profit organization working in rural Western Uganda, found that girls will often skip school or drop out altogether as a result of menstruation and insufficient resources and facilities associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Support|url=http://www.kasiisiproject.org/what-we-do/girls-support/|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Road Map campaign ==

In 2008, Janet Museveni launched the Road Map campaign in an effort to coordinate efforts to lower maternal and neonatal death rates in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uganda’s First Lady Launches Road Map to Accelerate Reduction of Maternal and Neonatal Mortality and Morbidity|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/uganda/press-materials/item/1444-uganda%E2%80%99s-first-lady-launches-road-map-to-accelerate-reduction-of-maternal-and-neonatal-mortality-and-morbidity.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. Rapid progress has resulted in a significant decline in preventable child deaths since 1990, with the global under-5 mortality rate declining by over half between 1990 and 2016.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; While in 1990, 12.6 million children under age five died, in 2016 that number fell to 5.6 million children.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; However, despite advances, there are still 15,000 under-five deaths per day from largely preventable causes.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; About 80 per cent of these occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and just 6 countries account for half of all under-five deaths: India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and China.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; 45% of these children died during the first 28 days of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Li|last2=Oza|first2=Shefali|last3=Hogan|first3=Dan|last4=Chu|first4=Yue|last5=Perin|first5=Jamie|last6=Zhu|first6=Jun|last7=Lawn|first7=Joy E|last8=Cousens|first8=Simon|last9=Mathers|first9=Colin|title=Global, regional, and national causes of under-5 mortality in 2000–15: an updated systematic analysis with implications for the Sustainable Development Goals|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673616315938|journal=The Lancet|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(16)31593-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
Child mortality refers to number of child deaths under the age of 5 per 1000 live births. However, the child mortality could be simplified into more specific terms such as [[Prenatal development|prenatal]], [[Prenatal development|perinatal]], [[Neonatal]], [[Infant|infancy]] and [[Under 5 Infant Mortality|under 5]]. Prenatal: child death before the birth, Perinatal: child death before one week of birth, Neonatal: child death before 28 days of birth, Infancy: child death before 1st birthday, and child mortality under 5 refer to any deaths from birth to the 5th birthday.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884617656|title=Population : an introduction to concepts and issues|last=1944-|first=Weeks, John Robert,|isbn=9781305094505|edition=Twelfth |location=Boston, MA|oclc=884617656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perinatal mortality rate: Number of child deaths within first week of birth/ total number of birth&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

Neonatal mortality rate: number of child deaths within first 28 days of life/ total number of birth&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

Infancy mortality rate: number of child deaths within first 12 months of life/ total number of birth&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

Under 5 mortality rates: number of child deaths within 5th birthday/ total number of birth&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:Child Mortality vs Fertility Rate.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Child mortality is high in countries where women have many children (high [[Total fertility rate|fertility rates]]). Wealthy countries have lower child mortality rates than poor ones.]]
{{Further|Infant mortality}}
The leading causes of death of children under five include:

* [[Preterm birth]] complications (18%)
* [[Pneumonia]] (16%)
* Interpartum-related events (12%)
*[[Neonatal sepsis]] (7%)
*[[Diarrhea]] (8%)
*[[Malaria]]  (5%)
*[[Malnutrition in children|Malnutrition]] and Under nutrition

There is variation of child mortality around the world; countries that are in the second or third stage of the Demographic Transition Mode ([[Demographic transition model|DTM]]) have higher rates of child mortality than countries in the fourth or fifth state of the DTM. [[Chad]] infant mortality is about 96 per 1,000 live births. And developed country such as Japan [[infant mortality]] is about 2.2 per 1,000 live births.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; In 2010, there were estimated to 7.6 million child deaths around the world and most of it occurred in [[Developing country|less developed countries]] and 4.7&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.aurarialibrary.idm.oclc.org/docview/1023015914?pq-origsite=summon|title=Global, regional, and national causes of child mortality: an updated systematic analysis for 2010 with time trends since 2000|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; million died from infection and disorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Child mortality isn’t only caused by infection and disorder, it is also caused by premature birth, birth defect, new born infection, birth complication, and disease like [[malaria]], sepsis, and diarrhea.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldvision.org/health-news-stories/child-mortality-causes-solutions|title=Child mortality: Top causes, best solutions {{!}} World Vision|date=2016-01-13|work=World Vision|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In less developed countries, [[malnutrition]] is the main source of child mortality.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria together are the cause of 1 out of every 3 child deaths before the age of 5 and nearly half of under-five deaths globally are attributable to under nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.unicef.org/child-survival/under-five|title=UNICEF STATISTICS|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==

{{Further|Infant mortality}}

{{More citations needed|date=June 2015}}

Child survival is a field of [[public health]] concerned with reducing child mortality. Child survival 
interventions are designed to address the most common causes of child deaths that occur, which include [[diarrhea]], [[pneumonia]], [[malaria]], and neonatal conditions.  Of the portion of children under the age of 5 alone, an estimated 5.6 million children die each year mostly from such preventable causes.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.data.unicef.org/child-mortality/under-five|title=UNICEF STATISTICS|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child survival strategies and interventions are in line with the fourth [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which focused on reducing child mortality by 2/3 of children under five before the year 2015. In 2015, the MDGs were replaced with the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), which aim to end these deaths by 2030. In order to achieve SDG targets, progress must be accelerated in more than 1/4 of all countries (most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa) in order to achieve targets for under-5 mortality, and in 60 countries (many in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia) to achieve targets for neonatal mortality.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt; Without accelerated progress, 60 million children under age 5 will die between 2017 and 2030, about half of which would be newborns.

Two-thirds of child deaths are preventable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/index.html UNICEF - Young child survival and development].&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the children who die each year could be saved by low-tech, evidence-based, cost-effective measures such as [[vaccine]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, micronutrient supplementation, insecticide-treated bed nets, improved family care and [[breastfeeding]] practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/mdg/childmortality.html|title=UNICEF  - Goal: Reduce child mortality|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[oral rehydration therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/release35/en/|title=WHO - New formula for oral rehydration salts will save millions of lives|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowering women, removing financial and social barriers to accessing basic services, developing innovations that make the supply of critical services more available to the poor and increasing local accountability of health systems are policy interventions that have allowed health systems to improve equity and reduce mortality.&lt;ref name="UN Child Mortality Report 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/files/Child_Mortality_Report_2012.pdf|title=Surveys - UNICEF MICS|website=www.childinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and [[diarrheal diseases]] can be reduced by introducing simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[handwashing]] with soap. This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Val|last2=Cairncross|first2=Sandy|title=Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|date=May 2003|volume=3|issue=5|pages=275–281|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6|pmid=12726975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proven, cost-effective interventions can save the lives of millions of children per year. The UN Vaccine division as of 2014 supported 36% of the world's children in order to best improve their survival chances, yet still, low-cost immunization interventions do not reach 30 million children despite success in reducing polio, tetanus, and measles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-05-01|title=Role of vaccine manufacturers in developing countries towards global healthcare by providing quality vaccines at affordable prices|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14601749|journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection|language=en|volume=20|pages=37–44|doi=10.1111/1469-0691.12568|issn=1198-743X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measles and tetanus still kill more than 1 million children under 5 each year. Vitamin A supplementation costs only $0.02 cents for each capsule and given 2-3 times a year will prevent blindness and death. Although vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality by 12 to 24 per cent, only 70 per cent of targeted children were reached in 2015.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt; Between 250,000 and 500,000 children become blind every year, with 70 percent of them dying within 12 months. [[Oral rehydration therapy]] (ORT) is an effective treatment for lost liquids through diarrhea; yet only 4 in 10 (44 per cent) of children ill with diarrhea are treated with ORT.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt;

Essential newborn care - including immunizing mothers against tetanus, ensuring clean delivery practices in a hygienic birthing environment, drying and wrapping the baby immediately after birth, providing necessary warmth, and promoting immediate and continued breastfeeding, immunization, and treatment of infections with antibiotics - could save the lives of 3 million newborns annually. [[Improved sanitation]] and access to clean [[drinking water]] can reduce childhood infections and diarrhea. Over 30% of the world's population does not have access to basic [[sanitation]], and 844 million people use unsafe sources of drinking water.&lt;ref name="UNICEF WASH"&gt;[web=https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/overview/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efforts ===
Agencies promoting and implementing child survival activities worldwide include [[UNICEF]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s; major child survival donors worldwide include the [[World Bank]], the British Government's [[Department for International Development]], the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]]. In the United States, most non-governmental child survival agencies belong to the [[CORE Group]], a coalition working, through collaborative action, to save the lives of young children in the world's poorest countries.

== Epidemiology ==
Child mortality has been dropping as each country reaches a high stage of DTM. From 2000 to 2010, child mortality has dropped from 9.6 million to 7.6 million. In order to reduce child mortality rates, there needs to be better education, higher standards of healthcare and more caution in childbearing. Child mortality could be reduced by attendance of professionals at birth and by breastfeeding and through access to clean water, sanitation, and immunization.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In 2016, the world average was 41 (4.1%), down from 93 (9.3%) in 1990.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; This is equivalent to 5.6 million children less than five years old dying in 2016.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

===Variation===

Huge disparities in under-5 mortality rates exist. Globally, the risk of a child dying in the country with the highest under-5 mortality rate is about 60 times higher than in the country with the lowest under-5 mortality rate.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest under-5 mortality rates in the world: All six countries with rates above 100 deaths per 1,000 live births are in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

Furthermore, approximately 80% of under-5 deaths occur in only two regions: sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; 6 countries account for half of the global under-5 deaths, namely, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and China.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; India and Nigeria alone account for almost a third (32 per cent) of the global under-five deaths.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

Likewise, there are disparities between wealthy and poor households in developing countries. According to a [[Save the Children]] paper, children from the poorest households in [[India]] are three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday than those from the richest households.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_12286.htm Inequalities in child survival: looking at wealth and other socio-economic disparities in developing countries] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607200429/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_12286.htm |date=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child survival rate of nations varies with factors such as [[fertility rate]] and [[income distribution]]; the change in distribution shows a strong correlation between child survival and income distribution as well as fertility rate, where increasing child survival allows the average income to increase as well as the average fertility rate to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Rosling shows the best stats you've ever seen|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html|work=TED talks|publisher=TED Conferences|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9239">'''Chronic care''' refers to [[health care|medical care]] which addresses pre-existing or long term illness, as opposed to [[acute care]] which is concerned with short term or severe illness of brief duration. [[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic medical conditions]] include [[asthma]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[emphysema]], chronic [[bronchitis]], congestive heart disease, [[cirrhosis of the liver]], [[hypertension]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Without effective treatment chronic conditions may lead to [[disability]].

The incidence of chronic disease has increased as [[mortality rate]]s have decreased.&lt;ref name="chroncity"/&gt;  It is estimated that by 2030 half of the population of the USA will have one or more chronic conditions.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"/&gt;

Conditions, injuries and diseases which were previously fatal can now be treated with chronic care. Chronic care aims to maintain wellness by keeping [[symptom]]s in [[remission (medicine)|remission]] while balancing treatment regimes and [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name="chroncity"/&gt;  Many of the core functions of [[primary health care]] are central to chronic care.&lt;ref name="mtcoci"&gt;{{cite book |title=Meeting the Challenge of Chronic Illness |last=Kane |first=Robert L. |author2=Reinhard Priester |author3=Annette M. Totten  |year=2005 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=0801882095 |page=93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ghdohJiwz44C |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chronic care is complex in nature because it may extend over a pro-longed period of time, requires input from a diverse set of [[Health care provider|health professionals]], various [[medication]]s and possibly [[Monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] equipment.&lt;ref name="mcc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Managing Chronic Conditions: Experience in Eight Countries |last=Ellen |first=Nolte |author2=Cécile Knai |author3=Martin McKee  |year=2008 |publisher=WHO Regional Office Europe|isbn=928904294X |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDzMOTS0TlUC |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy making==
According to 2008 figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chronic medical care accounts for more than 75% of health care spending in the US.&lt;ref name="chroncity"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chronicity |title=Chronic Illness: Impact and Intervention |last=Larsen |first=Pamala D. |editor1-last=Lubkin |editor1-first=Ilene Morof |editor2-last=Larsen |editor2-first=Pamala D. |year=2011 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |isbn=0763799661 |pages=3–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NMCb5PeHXbcC |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the increased government expenditure in dealing with chronic care policy makers are searching for effective interventions and strategies.  These strategies can broadly be described within four categories.  These are [[Preventive healthcare|disease prevention]] and early detection, new providers, settings and qualifications, [[Disease management (health)|disease management programs]] and [[Clinical pathway|integrated care models]].&lt;ref name="tackcdie"&gt;{{cite book |title=Tackling Chronic Disease in Europe: Strategies, Interventions and Challenges |last=Busse |first=Reinhard |author2=Miriam Blümel |author3=David Scheller-Kreinsen |author4=Annette Zentner  |year=2010 |publisher=WHO Regional Office Europe |isbn=9289041927 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfyyrC7Q_j4C |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
One of the major problems from a health care system which is poorly coordinated for sufferers of chronic conditions is the incidence of patients receiving conflicting advice from different providers.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"/&gt; Patients will often be given prescriptions for medication that adversely interact with
one another.  One recent study estimated that more than 20% of older patients in the USA took at least one medication which could negatively impact another condition.&lt;ref name="ptc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0089447#pone.0089447-Anderson1 |title=Potential Therapeutic Competition in Community-Living Older Adults in the U.S.: Use of Medications That May Adversely Affect a Coexisting Condition |date=February 25, 2014 |work=PLOS ONE |publisher=Public Library of Science |accessdate=14 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is referred to as therapeutic competition.

Effective chronic care requires an information platform to track patients' status and ensure appropriate treatments are given.&lt;ref name="kpiiltc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Key Policy Issues in Long-term Care |last=Brodsky |first=Jenny |author2=Jack Habib |author3=Miriam Hirschfeld  |year=2003 |publisher=World Health Organisation |isbn=9241562250 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J8DXL147v_MC |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a recognised gap between treatment guidelines and current practice for chronic care.&lt;ref name="cfpwc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Caring For People With Chronic Conditions: A Health System Perspective: A Health System Perspective |last=Nolte |first=Ellen |author2=Martin McKee |year=2008 |publisher=McGraw-Hill International |isbn=0335233708 |pages=2, 4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RV3id1wQIcsC |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individualised treatment plans are critical in treating chronic conditions because patients will place varying important on health outcomes.  For example, some patients will fore-go complex, inconvenient medication regimes at the expense of quality of life.&lt;ref name="cfpwc"/&gt;

===Multiple conditions===
One of the greatest challenges in this field of health care is dealing with the co-existence of multiple disorders,&lt;ref name="mcc"/&gt; which is called multi-morbidity.  There are few incentives within current [[health system|health care systems]] to coordinate care across multiple providers and varying services.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/reports/2010/rwjf54583 |title=Chronic Care: Making the Case for Ongoing Care |date=2010 |author=Gerard Anderson |publisher=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation |accessdate=14 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2001 survey by [[Mathematica Policy Research]] found that physicians feel they have inadequate training to deal with multiple chronic conditions.  An increase in the number of chronic conditions correlates with an increase in the number of inappropriate hospitalizations.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"/&gt;  Self-management can be challenging because recommended activities for one condition may be made difficult because of another condition.&lt;ref name="cfpwc"/&gt;

==Approaches==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
{{original research section|date=March 2014}}
A nurse has to be qualified to handle all the needs of a chronic client and has to be an advocate to put the case of the chronically ill across to the health administration, hospital board or their families.

A variety of specialists such as surgeons, dietitians, nutritionists, and occupational therapists have to be in attendance for the maximum benefit of the client. Someone suffering from chronic pain for a long time may need the help of a psychiatrist. Everyday activities that the physically fit see as normal may be a Herculean feat for the chronically ill and they need all the support that they can get. The nurse may be privy to some of these help that the chronically ill can benefit from. They need to be proactive and put these patients in contact with these help but also sensitive enough to give their client the freedom to decline any help if they think that they do not need it.

Chronic pain might also get the person to start questioning their faith and/or wanting to have a deeper spiritual experience because of their pain and suffering.

The patient also needs to take time to participate in some fun activities. They may need to check out of the facility/hospital or get out of the house occasionally preventing an association of hospitals with pain. This further helps the patients keep their sanity and keeps them psychologically sound.

They may need a nurse who is qualified in palliative care. Some may be dying and they need respect and dignity as they die in pain. They also need a nurse who is non-judgmental and one who is also compassionate and caring. The family has to be involved to help the client better manage the pain. One very important quality is co-ordinating the best care for the client and some amount of diplomacy and empathy.

In some cases, such as with [[diabetes]] or [[sleep apnea]], the treatment is long term and difficult for patients to understand and comply with. In these cases [[chronic care management]] is highly recommended to help the patient learn about the consequences of refusing treatment and how to best follow treatment.

The effectiveness of condoms, as of most forms of [[contraception]], can be assessed two ways. ''Perfect use'' or ''method'' effectiveness rates only include people who use condoms properly and consistently. ''Actual use'', or ''typical use'' effectiveness rates are of all condom users, including those who use condoms incorrectly or do not use condoms at every act of intercourse. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use.&lt;ref name="hatcher"&gt;{{cite book |first=RA |last=Hatcher |author2=Trussel, J |author3=Nelson, AL |year=2007 |title=Contraceptive Technology |edition=19th |publisher=Ardent Media | location=New York | isbn=1-59708-001-2 | url=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html |accessdate=2009-07-26|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531095926/http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html |archivedate = May 31, 2008|deadurl=yes|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly the [[Pearl Index]] is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use [[decrement table]]s.&lt;ref name="kippley"&gt;{{cite book | first=John | last=Kippley |author2=Kippley, Sheila | year=1996 | title=The Art of Natural Family Planning | edition=4th addition | publisher=The Couple to Couple League | location=Cincinnati, OH | isbn=0-926412-13-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|141}}

Condoms are widely recommended for the prevention of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs). They have been shown to be effective in reducing infection rates in both men and women. While not perfect, the condom is effective at reducing the transmission of organisms that cause [[AIDS]], [[genital herpes]], [[cervical cancer]], [[genital wart]]s, [[syphilis]], [[chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], and other diseases.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood"&gt;{{cite web |title=Condom |publisher=Planned Parenthood | year=2008 |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/condom-10187.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Condoms are often recommended as an adjunct to more effective birth control methods (such as [[IUD]]) in situations where STD protection is also desired.&lt;ref name=DualProtection&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cates, W.|author2=Steiner, M.

According to a 2000 report by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), consistent use of latex condoms reduces the risk of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] transmission by approximately 85% relative to risk when unprotected, putting the seroconversion rate (infection rate) at 0.9 per 100 person-years with condom, down from 6.7 per 100 person-years.&lt;ref name="workshop"&gt;{{cite conference|last=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |authorlink=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |title=Workshop Summary: Scientific Evidence on Condom Effectiveness for Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention |pages=13–15 |date=2001-07-20 |location=Hyatt Dulles Airport, Herndon, Virginia |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dmid/documents/condomreport.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009022150/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dmid/documents/condomreport.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis published in 2007 from the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003255|author1=Cayley, W.E. |author2=Davis-Beaty, K.|year=2007|title=Effectiveness of Condoms in Reducing Heterosexual Transmission of HIV (Review)|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. |editor1-last=Weller|editor1-first=Susan C|journal=Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=World Health Organization Department of Reproductive Health and Research (WHO/RHR) &amp; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Communication Programs (CCP), INFO Project|year=2007|title=Family Planning: A Global Handbook for Providers|publisher=INFO Project at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|url=http://www.infoforhealth.org/globalhandbook/index.shtml|page=200|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827081805/http://www.infoforhealth.org/globalhandbook/index.shtml|archivedate=2009-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found similar risk reductions of 80–95%.

The 2000 NIH review concluded that condom use significantly reduces the risk of [[gonorrhea]] for men.&lt;ref name="workshop" /&gt; A 2006 study reports that proper condom use decreases the risk of transmission of [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) to women by approximately 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winer, R |author2=Hughes, J |author3=Feng, Q |author4=O'Reilly, S |author5=Kiviat, N |author6=Holmes, K |author7=Koutsky, L |title=Condom use and the risk of genital human papillomavirus infection in young women |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa053284 |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=354 |issue=25 |pages=2645–54 |year=2006 |pmid=16790697 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/25/2645 |accessdate=2007-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421144623/http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/25/2645 |archivedate=2007-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in the same year found consistent condom use was effective at reducing transmission of [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex virus-2]] also known as genital herpes, in both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wald |first1=Anna |title=The Relationship between Condom Use and Herpes Simplex Virus Acquisition |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=143 |pages=707–713 |year=2005 |pmid=16287791 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/143/10/707 |accessdate=2007-04-07 |last2=Langenberg |first2=AG |last3=Krantz |first3=E |last4=Douglas Jr |first4=JM |last5=Handsfield |first5=HH |last6=Dicarlo |first6=RP |last7=Adimora |first7=AA |last8=Izu |first8=AE |last9=Morrow |first9=RA |last10=Lawrence |first10=C |issue=10 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-143-10-200511150-00007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328204310/http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/143/10/707 |archivedate=2007-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom. Infectious areas of the genitals, especially when symptoms are present, may not be covered by a condom, and as a result, some diseases like HPV and herpes may be transmitted by direct contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Villhauer |first=Tanya |title=Condoms Preventing HPV? |publisher=University of Iowa Student Health Service/Health Iowa |date=2005-05-20 |url=http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |accessdate=2009-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314084306/http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |archivedate=2010-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary effectiveness issue with using condoms to prevent STDs, however, is inconsistent use.&lt;ref name="badnews" /&gt;

Condoms may also be useful in treating potentially [[cervical cancer|precancerous cervical changes]].

Among people who intend condoms to be their form of birth control, pregnancy may occur when the user has sex without a condom. The person may have run out of condoms, or be traveling and not have a condom with them, or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to "take a chance". This type of behavior is the primary cause of typical use failure (as opposed to method or perfect use failure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Steiner, M |author2=Cates, W |author3=Warner, L |title=The real problem with male condoms is nonuse | journal = Sex Transm Dis | volume = 26 | issue = 8 |pages=459–62 |year=1999 | pmid = 10494937 | doi = 10.1097/00007435-199909000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
[[File:CondomUse2 alternative.jpg|thumb|Illustrations showing how to put on a condom]]
Male condoms are usually packaged inside a foil or plastic wrapper, in a rolled-up form, and are designed to be applied to the tip of the penis and then unrolled over the [[erection|erect]] penis. It is important that some space be left in the tip of the condom so that semen has a place to collect; otherwise it may be forced out of the base of the device. Most condoms have a teat end for this purpose. After use, it is recommended the condom be wrapped in tissue or tied in a knot, then disposed of in a trash receptacle.&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal" /&gt; Condoms are used to reduce the likelihood of pregnancy during intercourse and to reduce the likelihood of contracting sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms are also used during fellatio to reduce the likelihood of contracting STIs.

Some couples find that putting on a condom interrupts sex, although others incorporate condom application as part of their foreplay. Some men and women find the physical barrier of a condom dulls sensation. Advantages of dulled sensation can include prolonged erection and delayed ejaculation; disadvantages might include a loss of some sexual excitement.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood" /&gt; Advocates of condom use also cite their advantages of being inexpensive, easy to use, and having few side effects.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fwhc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Male Condom |publisher=Feminist Women's Health Center |date=October 18, 2007 |url=http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121011004/http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex education ===
Condoms are often used in [[sex education]] programs, because they have the capability to reduce the chances of pregnancy and the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases when used correctly. A recent [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) press release supported the inclusion of information about condoms in sex education, saying "''comprehensive sexuality education programs... discuss the appropriate use of condoms''", and "''promote condom use for those who are sexually active''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Based on the research, comprehensive sex education is more effective at stopping the spread of HIV infection, says APA committee |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=February 23, 2005 |url=http://www.apa.org/releases/sexeducation.html |accessdate=2006-08-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811000127/http://www.apa.org/releases/sexeducation.html |archivedate=August 11, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infertility treatment {{anchor|Infertility treatment}} ===
&lt;!-- [[Conception device]] links to anchor Infertility treatment --&gt;
Common procedures in [[infertility]] treatment such as [[semen analysis]] and [[Artificial insemination|intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) require collection of semen samples. These are most commonly obtained through [[masturbation]], but an alternative to masturbation is use of a special ''collection condom'' to collect semen during sexual intercourse.

Collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation,{{cn|date=November 2018}} and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely. Also, compared with samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as intracervical or intrauterine [[Artificial insemination|insemination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sofikitis NV, Miyagawa I |title=Endocrinological, biophysical, and biochemical parameters of semen collected via masturbation versus sexual intercourse |journal=J.

For fertility treatments, a collection condom may be used to collect semen during [[sexual intercourse]] where the semen is provided by the woman's partner. Private [[sperm donors]] may also use a collection condom to obtain samples through masturbation or by sexual intercourse with a partner and will transfer the ejaculate from the collection condom to a specially designed container. The sperm is transported in such containers, in the case of a donor, to a recipient woman to be used for insemination, and in the case of a woman's partner, to a fertility clinic for processing and use. However, transportation may reduce the fecundity of the sperm. Collection condoms may also be used where semen is produced at a sperm bank or fertility clinic.

''Condom therapy'' is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the female has high levels of [[antisperm antibodies]]. The theory is that preventing exposure to her partner's semen will lower her level of antisperm antibodies, and thus increase her chances of pregnancy when condom therapy is discontinued. However, condom therapy has not been shown to increase subsequent pregnancy rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0272.1979.tb02229.x |vauthors=Franken D, Slabber C |title=Experimental findings with spermantibodies: condom therapy (a case report) | journal = Andrologia | volume = 11 | issue = 6 |pages=413–6 |year=1979 | pmid = 532982}}&lt;br /&gt;

IMPORTANT: When adding a new listing, please include a reliable source that discusses the use.

Condoms excel as multipurpose containers and barriers because they are waterproof, elastic, durable, and (for military and espionage uses) will not arouse suspicion if found.

Ongoing military utilization began during World War II, and includes covering the muzzles of rifle barrels to prevent fouling,&lt;ref name="dday"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ambrose, Stephen E |title=D-Day, June 6, 1944: the climactic battle of World War II |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-671-71359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the waterproofing of firing assemblies in underwater demolitions,&lt;ref&gt;Couch, D (2001).

Condoms have also been used to [[drug smuggling|smuggle]] [[alcohol]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and other drugs across borders and into prisons by filling the condom with drugs, tying it in a knot and then either swallowing it or inserting it into the [[rectum]]. These methods are very dangerous and potentially lethal; if the condom breaks, the drugs inside become absorbed into the bloodstream and can cause an overdose.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;A 41-year-old man has been remanded in custody after being stopped on Saturday by customs officials at the Norwegian border at Svinesund.

[[File:Préservatif féminin.jpg|thumb|right|A female condom]]

Male condoms have a tight ring to form a seal around the penis while female condoms usually have a large stiff ring to prevent them from slipping into the [[body orifice]]. The Female Health Company produced a female condom that was initially made of polyurethane, but newer versions are made of [[nitrile rubber|nitrile]]. Medtech Products produces a female condom made of latex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/female-condom.htm |title=The Female Condom |publisher=AVERT |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228152904/http://www.avert.org/female-condom.htm |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materials ===

==== Natural latex ====
[[File:Condom unrolled durex.jpg|thumb|375px|An unrolled latex condom]]

Latex has outstanding elastic properties: Its [[tensile strength]] exceeds 30&amp;nbsp;MPa, and latex condoms may be stretched in excess of 800% before breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Relationship of condom strength to failure during use | journal = PIACT Prod News | volume = 2 | issue = 2 |pages=1–2 |year=1980 | pmid = 12264044 |author1=Program for the Introduction and Adaptation of Contraceptive Technology PIACT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] set standards for condom production (ISO 4074, Natural latex rubber condoms), and the [[European Union|EU]] followed suit with its [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] standard (Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices). Every latex condom is tested for holes with an electric current. If the condom passes, it is rolled and packaged. In addition, a portion of each batch of condoms is subject to water leak and air burst testing.&lt;ref name="badnews"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nordenberg |first=Tamar |title=Condoms: Barriers to Bad News |journal=FDA Consumer magazine |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=March–April 1998 |url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/HIVandAIDSActivities/ucm126370.htm |accessdate=2007-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308051921/http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/HIVandAIDSActivities/ucm126370.htm |archivedate=2010-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the advantages of latex have made it the most popular condom material, it does have some drawbacks. Latex condoms are damaged when used with oil-based substances as [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], such as [[petroleum jelly]], [[cooking oil]], [[baby oil]], [[mineral oil]], [[skin lotion]]s, [[Sunscreen|suntan lotions]], [[cold cream]]s, [[butter]] or [[margarine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42331/1/1885960018_eng.pdf Essentials of Contraceptive Technology &gt; Chapter 11 Condoms] From the Knowledge for Health Project, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

In May 2009 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] granted approval for the production of condoms composed of [[Vytex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=FDA Clearance for Envy Natural Rubber Latex Condom Made with Vytex NRL |publisher=Vystar |date=2009-05-06 |url=http://www.vytex.com/BizDocs/R-EnvyFDA_Clearance.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007172424/http://www.vytex.com/BizDocs/R-EnvyFDA_Clearance.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; latex that has been treated to remove 90% of the [[antibody generator|proteins responsible for allergic reactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Vytex Works |publisher=Vystar |year=2009 |url=http://www.vytex.com/Consumers/howvytexworks.aspx?pageid=C8 |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530223349/http://www.vytex.com/Consumers/howvytexworks.aspx?pageid=C8 |archivedate=2010-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An allergen-free condom made of synthetic latex (polyisoprene) is also available.&lt;ref name="isoprenepr" /&gt;

==== Synthetic ====
The most common non-latex condoms are made from [[polyurethane]]. Condoms may also be made from other synthetic materials, such as [[AT-10 resin]], and most recently [[polyisoprene]].&lt;ref name="isoprenepr"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Lifestyles Condoms Introduces Polyisoprene Non-latex |publisher=HealthNewsDigest.com |date=2008-07-31 |url=http://healthnewsdigest.com/news/New_Product_460/Lifestyles_Condoms_printer.shtml |accessdate=2008-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823054656/http://healthnewsdigest.com/news/New_Product_460/Lifestyles_Condoms_printer.shtml |archivedate=2008-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyurethane condoms tend to be the same width and thickness as latex condoms, with most polyurethane condoms between 0.04&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Condoms |work=Condom Statistics and Sizes |date=2008-03-12 |url=http://blog.condomman.com/articles/condom-use/all-you-need-to-know-on-condom-statistics-and-sizes/ |accessdate=2012-05-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525205018/http://blog.condomman.com/articles/condom-use/all-you-need-to-know-on-condom-statistics-and-sizes/ |archivedate=2013-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyurethane can be considered better than latex in several ways: it conducts heat better than latex, is not as sensitive to temperature and ultraviolet light (and so has less rigid storage requirements and a longer shelf life), can be used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], is less allergenic than latex, and does not have an odor.&lt;ref name="nonlatex"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nonlatex vs Latex Condoms: An Update | journal = The Contraception Report | volume = 14 | issue = 2 |publisher=Contraception Online|date=September 2003|url=http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243|accessdate=2006-08-14 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060926035226/http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243 |archivedate = September 26, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyurethane condoms have gained [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval for sale in the United States as an effective method of contraception and HIV prevention, and under laboratory conditions have been shown to be just as effective as latex for these purposes.&lt;ref name="AlicePolyLatex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are polyurethane condoms as effective as latex ones? |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=February 22, 2005 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1842.html |accessdate=2007-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530000038/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1842.html |archivedate=May 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, polyurethane condoms are less elastic than latex ones, and may be more likely to slip or break than latex,&lt;ref name="nonlatex" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AlicePoly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prefers polyurethane protection |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=March 4, 2005 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1203.html |accessdate=2007-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609115429/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1203.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; lose their shape or bunch up more than latex,&lt;ref name="PPAA"&gt;{{cite news|title=Allergic to Latex?

Polyisoprene is a synthetic version of natural rubber latex. While significantly more expensive,&lt;ref name="isopreneglove"&gt;{{cite web | title = Polyisoprene Surgical Gloves | publisher = SurgicalGlove.net | year = 2008 | url = http://www.surgicalglove.net/polyisoprene.html | accessdate = 2008-08-24 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080918193917/http://www.surgicalglove.net/polyisoprene.html | archivedate = 2008-09-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has the advantages of latex (such as being softer and more elastic than polyurethane condoms)&lt;ref name="isoprenepr" /&gt; without the protein which is responsible for latex allergies.&lt;ref name="isopreneglove" /&gt; Like polyurethane condoms, polyisoprene condoms are said to do a better job of transmitting body heat. Unlike polyurethane condoms, they cannot be used with an oil-based lubricant.&lt;ref name="PPAA" /&gt;

==== Lambskin ====
Condoms made from [[sheep]] [[intestine]]s, labeled "lambskin", are also available. Although they are generally effective as a contraceptive by blocking sperm, it is presumed that they are likely less effective than latex in preventing the transmission of agents that cause [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], because of pores in the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Boston Women's Health Book Collective |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves: A New Edition for a New Era |publisher=Touchstone |location=New York, NY |year=2005 |isbn=0-7432-5611-5 |page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the idea that intestines, by their nature, are porous, permeable membranes, and while sperm are too large to pass through the pores, viruses—such as [[HIV]], [[herpes]], and [[genital warts]]—are small enough to pass through.&lt;ref name="PPAA" /&gt; However, there are to date no clinical data confirming or denying this theory. Some believe that lambskin condoms provide a more "natural" sensation, and they lack the allergens that are inherent to latex, but because of their lesser protection against infection, other hypoallergenic materials such as [[polyurethane]] are recommended for latex-allergic users and/or partners. Lambskin condoms are also significantly more expensive than other types and as slaughter by-products they are also not [[vegetarian]].

=== Spermicide ===
Some latex condoms are lubricated at the manufacturer with a small amount of a [[nonoxynol-9]], a [[spermicide|spermicidal chemical]]. According to [[Consumer Reports]], condoms lubricated with spermicide have no additional benefit in preventing pregnancy, have a shorter shelf life, and may cause [[urinary tract infection|urinary-tract infections]] in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condoms: Extra protection |work=ConsumerReports.org |date=February 2005 |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2005/02/eng0502tcv.htm?resultPageIndex=1&amp;resultIndex=1&amp;searchTerm=condom |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110317120248/http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2005/02/eng0502tcv.htm?resultPageIndex=1&amp;resultIndex=1&amp;searchTerm=condom |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-17 |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, application of separately packaged spermicide ''is'' believed to increase the contraceptive efficacy of condoms.&lt;ref name="simultaneous" /&gt;

Nonoxynol-9 was once believed to offer additional protection against STDs (including HIV) but recent studies have shown that, with frequent use, nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of HIV transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonoxynol-9 and the Risk of HIV Transmission |work=HIV/AIDS Epi Update |publisher=Health Canada, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control |date=April 2003 |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/epiu-aepi/hiv-vih/nonoxynol-eng.php |accessdate=2006-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929172125/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/epiu-aepi/hiv-vih/nonoxynol-eng.php |archivedate=2009-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] says that spermicidally lubricated condoms should no longer be promoted.

=== Ribbed and studded ===
[[File:Kondom - abgerollt - hängend.jpg|thumb|75px|A ribbed condom]]
Textured condoms include studded and ribbed condoms which can provide extra sensations to both partners. The studs or ribs can be located on the inside, outside, or both; alternatively, they are located in specific sections to provide directed stimulation to either the [[g-spot]] or [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]]. Many textured condoms which advertise "mutual pleasure" also are bulb-shaped at the top, to provide extra stimulation to the penis.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=Condom Types: A look at different condom styles|url=http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/tp/CondomTypes.htm|last=Stacey|first=Dawn|accessdate=2008-12-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219035952/http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/tp/CondomTypes.htm|archivedate=2008-12-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women experience irritation during vaginal intercourse with studded condoms.

=== Other ===
The [[anti-rape condom]] is another variation designed to be worn by women. It is designed to cause pain to the attacker, hopefully allowing the victim a chance to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape-aXe: Questions and answers |publisher=Rape-aXe |year=2006 |url=http://www.antirape.co.za/questions.htm |accessdate=2009-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503104839/http://www.antirape.co.za/questions.htm |archivedate=2009-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[collection condom]] is used to collect semen for fertility treatments or sperm analysis. These condoms are designed to maximize sperm life.

Some condom-like devices are intended for entertainment only, such as glow-in-the dark condoms. These [[novelties|novelty]] condoms may not provide protection against pregnancy and STDs.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood" /&gt;

== Prevalence ==
The prevalence of condom use varies greatly between countries. Most surveys of contraceptive use are among married women, or women in informal unions. Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in that country, condoms account for almost 80% of contraceptive use by married women. On average, in developed countries, condoms are the most popular method of birth control: 28% of married contraceptive users rely on condoms. In the average less-developed country, condoms are less common: only 6–8% of married contraceptive users choose condoms.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Family Planning Worldwide: 2008 Data Sheet |publisher=Population Reference Bureau |year=2008 |url=http://www.prb.org/pdf08/fpds08.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-06-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911033118/http://www.prb.org/pdf08/fpds08.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-11 |df= }} Data from surveys 1997–2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

{{Main|History of condoms}}
[[File:De Morbo Gallico.jpg|thumb|A page from ''De Morbo Gallico'' (On the French Disease), Gabriele Falloppio's treatise on syphilis. Published in 1564, it describes what is possibly the first use of condoms.]]

=== Before the 19th century ===
Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians.&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;{{cite book | first=Aine | last=Collier | year=2007 |title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | publisher=Prometheus Books | location=Amherst, NY | isbn=978-1-59102-556-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|11}} In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, pregnancy prevention was generally seen as a woman's responsibility, and the only well documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|17,23}} In Asia before the 15th century, some use of [[glans]] condoms (devices covering only the head of the penis) is recorded. Condoms seem to have been used for contraception, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of lamb intestines. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|60–1}}

In 16th-century Italy, anatomist and physician [[Gabriele Falloppio]] wrote a treatise on [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|51,54–5}} The earliest documented strain of syphilis, first appearing in Europe in a 1490s outbreak, caused severe symptoms and often death within a few months of contracting the disease.&lt;ref name=Scars_of_Venus&gt;{{cite book | author=Oriel, JD |title=The Scars of Venus: A History of Venereology | location=London | publisher= Springer-Verlag | year=1994 |isbn=0-387-19844-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diamond1&gt;{{cite book |author=Diamond, Jared | year=1997 | title=Guns, Germs and Steel | location=New York |publisher=W.W.

The cloths he described were sized to cover the [[Glans penis|glans of the penis]], and were held on with a ribbon.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|51,54–5}}&lt;ref name=pai&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Topic: History of Condom Use |publisher=Population Action International |year=2002 |url=http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714101959/http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |archivedate=14 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Falloppio claimed that an experimental trial of the linen sheath demonstrated protection against syphilis.&lt;ref name="youssef"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Youssef |first=H |date=1 April 1993|title=The history of the condom | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 86|pages=226–228 | pmid = 7802734|issue=4|pmc=1293956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, the use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout Europe. The first indication that these devices were used for birth control, rather than disease prevention, is the 1605 theological publication ''De iustitia et iure'' (On justice and law) by Catholic theologian [[Leonardus Lessius]], who condemned them as immoral.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|56}} In 1666, the English Birth Rate Commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of "condons", the first documented use of that word (or any similar spelling).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|66–8}} (Other early spellings include "condam" and "quondam", from which the Italian derivation "guantone" has been suggested, from "guanto", "a glove."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=condom |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118222011/http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=condom |archivedate=2017-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Condom 1900.jpg|left|thumb|A condom made from animal intestine circa 1900]]
In addition to linen, condoms during the [[Renaissance]] were made out of intestines and bladder. In the late 16th century, Dutch traders introduced condoms made from "fine leather" to Japan. Unlike the horn condoms used previously, these leather condoms covered the entire penis.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|61}}

[[File:Condoomgebruik in de 19e eeuw.png|right|thumb|170px|[[Giacomo Casanova]] tests his condom for holes by inflating it]]
[[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] in the 18th century was one of the first reported using "assurance caps" to prevent impregnating his mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;Fryer P. (1965) 'the Birth controllers', London: Secker and Warburg and Dingwall EJ. (1953) 'Early contraceptive sheaths' BMJ, Jan 1: 40–1 in Lewis M. 'A Brief history of condoms' in Mindel A. (2000) 'Condoms', BMJ books&lt;/ref&gt;

From at least the 18th century, condom use was opposed in some legal, religious, and medical circles for essentially the same reasons that are given today: condoms reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, which some thought immoral or undesirable for the nation; they do not provide full protection against sexually transmitted infections, while belief in their protective powers was thought to encourage sexual promiscuity; and, they are not used consistently due to inconvenience, expense, or loss of sensation.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|73,86–8,92}}

Despite some opposition, the condom market grew rapidly. In the 18th century, condoms were available in a variety of qualities and sizes, made from either linen treated with chemicals, or "skin" (bladder or intestine softened by treatment with [[sulfur]] and [[lye]]).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|94–5}} They were sold at pubs, barbershops, chemist shops, open-air markets, and at the theater throughout Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|90–2,97,104}} They later spread to America, although in every place there were generally used only by the middle and upper classes, due to both expense and lack of sex education.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|116–21}}

=== 1800 through 1920s ===
[[File:El Paral·lel 1894-1939- exhibit at CCCB in Barcelona (78).JPG|thumb|An old-fashioned condom package]]
The early 19th century saw contraceptives promoted to the poorer classes for the first time. Writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control to the condom. By the late 19th century many feminists expressed distrust of the condom as a contraceptive, as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone. They advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women, such as diaphragms and spermicidal douches.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|152–3}} Other writers cited both the expense of condoms and their unreliability (they were often riddled with holes, and often fell off or broke), but they discussed condoms as a good option for some, and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|88,90,125,129–30}}

Many countries passed laws impeding the manufacture and promotion of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|144,163–4,168–71,193}} In spite of these restrictions, condoms were promoted by traveling lecturers and in newspaper advertisements, using euphemisms in places where such ads were illegal.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|127,130–2,138,146–7}} Instructions on how to make condoms at home were distributed in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|126,136}} Despite social and legal opposition, at the end of the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|173–4}}

[[File:Surgeon Sage Says.jpg|left|thumb|200px|During World War I, the U.S. military was the only one that did not promote condom use. Posters such as these were intended to promote abstinence.]]
Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, American rates of sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketed. Causes cited by historians include effects of the [[American Civil War]], and the ignorance of prevention methods promoted by the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|137–8,159}} To fight the growing epidemic, sex education classes were introduced to public schools for the first time, teaching about venereal diseases and how they were transmitted.

The stigma against victims of these diseases was so great that many hospitals refused to treat people who had syphilis.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|176}}

[[File:Condom with manual from 1813.jpg|thumb|400px|Condom (and manual) from 1813]]
The German military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers, beginning in the later 19th century.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|169,181}} Early 20th century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|180–3}} During [[World War I]], the United States and (at the beginning of the war only) Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|187–90}}

In the decades after World War I, there remained social and legal obstacles to condom use throughout the U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|208–10}} Founder of psychoanalysis [[Sigmund Freud]] opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high. Freud was especially opposed to the condom because he thought it cut down on sexual pleasure. Some feminists continued to oppose male-controlled contraceptives such as condoms. In 1920 the Church of England's [[Lambeth Conferences#Sixth Conference (1920)|Lambeth Conference]] condemned all "unnatural means of conception avoidance". London's Bishop [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]] complained of the huge number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks, especially after weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|211–2}}

However, European militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection, even in countries where they were illegal for the general population.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|213–4}} Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|197}} Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|204,206,221–2}} Worldwide, condom sales doubled in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|210}}

=== Rubber and manufacturing advances ===
In 1839, [[Charles Goodyear]] discovered a way of processing natural [[rubber]], which is too stiff when cold and too soft when warm, in such a way as to make it elastic. This proved to have advantages for the manufacture of condoms; unlike the sheep's gut condoms, they could stretch and did not tear quickly when used. The [[vulcanized rubber|rubber vulcanization]] process was patented by Goodyear in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reprinted from ''India Rubber World'' |title=CHARLES GOODYEAR—The life and discoveries of the inventor of vulcanized India rubber |journal=Scientific American Supplement |issue=787 |publisher=Munn &amp; Co. |location=New York |date=1891-01-31 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14009 |accessdate=2008-06-08 }}&lt;br /&gt;

Besides this type, small rubber condoms covering only the [[glans]] were often used in England and the United States. There was more risk of losing them and if the rubber ring was too tight, it would constrict the penis. This type of condom was the original "capote" (French for condom), perhaps because of its resemblance to a woman's bonnet worn at that time, also called a [[Bonnet (headgear)|capote]].

For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|148}} In 1912, Polish inventor [[Julius Fromm]] developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution.&lt;ref name="billy" /&gt; Called ''cement dipping'', this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|200}} [[Latex]], rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. The use of water to suspend the rubber instead of [[gasoline]] and [[benzene]] eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|199–200}}

Until the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semi-skilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in the automation of the condom assembly line were made. The first fully automated line was patented in 1930. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems, and small manufacturers were driven out of business.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|201–3}} The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|220}}

=== 1930 to present ===
In 1930 the Anglican Church's [[Lambeth Conferences#Seventh: 1930|Lambeth Conference]] sanctioned the use of birth control by married couples. In 1931 the [[National Council of Churches|Federal Council of Churches]] in the U.S. issued a similar statement.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|227}} The Roman Catholic Church responded by issuing the encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]'' affirming its opposition to all contraceptives, a stance it has never reversed.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|228–9}} In the 1930s, legal restrictions on condoms began to be relaxed.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|216,226,234}}&lt;ref name="note"&gt;{{cite web |title=Biographical Note |work=The Margaret Sanger Papers |publisher=Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass. |year=1995 |url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html |accessdate=2006-10-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912180741/http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html |archivedate=2006-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But during this period [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] increased restrictions on condoms (limited sales as disease preventatives were still allowed).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|252,254–5}} During the Depression, condom lines by Schmid gained in popularity. Schmid still used the cement-dipping method of manufacture which had two advantages over the latex variety. Firstly, cement-dipped condoms could be safely used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]]. Secondly, while less comfortable, these older-style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical, a valued feature in hard times.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|217–9}} More attention was brought to quality issues in the 1930s, and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] began to regulate the quality of condoms sold in the United States.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|223–5}}

Throughout [[World War II]], condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members, but also heavily promoted with films, posters, and lectures.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|236–8,259}} European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war, even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in 1941.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|252–4,257–8}} In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of [[#Other uses|non-sexual uses]] for the devices, many of which continue to this day. After the war, condom sales continued to grow. From 1955–1965, 42% of Americans of reproductive age relied on condoms for birth control. In Britain from 1950–1960, 60% of married couples used condoms. The [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] became the world's most popular method of birth control in the years after its 1960 début, but condoms remained a strong second. The U.S. [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] pushed condom use in developing countries to help solve the "world population crises": by 1970 hundreds of millions of condoms were being used each year in India alone.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|267–9,272–5}}(This number has grown in recent decades: in 2004, the government of India purchased 1.9 billion condoms for distribution at family planning clinics.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=AP |last=Sharma |title=Annual Report of the Tariff Commission |page=9 |publisher=India government |year=2006 |url=http://tc.nic.in/areports/annualreport-2005-06.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619062117/http://tc.nic.in/areports/annualreport-2005-06.pdf |archivedate=2009-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology and other terms ===
The term ''condom'' first appears in the early 18th century. Its etymology is unknown.
In popular tradition, the invention and naming of the condom came to be attributed to an associate of England's [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], one "Dr. Condom" or "Earl of Condom". There is however no evidence of the existence of such a person, and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before King Charles II ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|54,68}}

== Society and culture ==

Some [[moral]] and [[scientific]] criticism of condoms exists despite the many benefits of condoms agreed on by [[scientific consensus]] and sexual health experts.

Condom usage is typically recommended for new couples who have yet to develop full trust in their partner with regard to STDs. Established couples on the other hand have few concerns about STDs, and can use other methods of birth control such as [[birth control pill|the pill]], which does not act as a barrier to intimate sexual contact. Note that the polar debate with regard to condom usage is attenuated by the target group the argument is directed. Notably the age category and stable partner question are factors, as well as the distinction between heterosexual and homosexuals, who have different kinds of sex and have different risk consequences and factors.

Among the prime objections to condom usage is the blocking of erotic sensation, or the intimacy that barrier-free sex provides. As the condom is held tightly to the skin of the penis, it diminishes the delivery of stimulation through rubbing and friction. Condom proponents claim this has the benefit of making sex last longer, by diminishing sensation and delaying male ejaculation. Those who promote condom-free heterosexual sex (slang: "[[Bareback (sex)|bareback]]") claim that the condom puts a prophylactic barrier between partners, diminishing what is normally a highly sensual, intimate, and spiritual connection between partners.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] opposes all kinds of sexual acts outside of marriage, as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by [[direct and intentional]] acts (for example, [[Human sterilization|surgery to prevent conception]]) or foreign objects (for example, condoms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanæ Vitæ |author=[[Pope Paul VI]] |date=1968-07-25 |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xI2Wz6n5?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of condoms to prevent [[Sexually Transmitted Infections|STI]] transmission is not specifically addressed by Catholic doctrine, and is currently a topic of debate among theologians and high-ranking Catholic authorities.

In a November 2011 interview, Pope Benedict XVI discussed for the first time the use of condoms to prevent STI transmission. He said that the use of a condom can be justified in a few individual cases if the purpose is to reduce the risk of an HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Jonathan Wynne-Jones |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/the-pope/8148944/The-Pope-drops-Catholic-ban-on-condoms-in-historic-shift.html |title=The Pope drops Catholic ban on condoms in historic shift |publisher=The Telegraph |date=20 November 2010 |accessdate=20 November 2010 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122052824/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/the-pope/8148944/The-Pope-drops-Catholic-ban-on-condoms-in-historic-shift.html |archivedate=22 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave as an example male prostitutes. There was some confusion at first whether the statement applied only to homosexual prostitutes and thus not to heterosexual intercourse at all. However, [[Federico Lombardi]], spokesman for the Vatican, clarified that it applied to heterosexual and transsexual prostitutes, whether male or female, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/world/europe/24pope.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Rachel | last1=Donadio | first2=Laurie | last2=Goodstein | title=Vatican Confirms Shift on Condoms as AIDS Prevention | date=2010-11-23 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221084914/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/world/europe/24pope.html | archivedate=2017-02-21 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, also clarify that the Vatican's principles on sexuality and contraception had not been changed.

=== Scientific and environmental ===
More generally, some scientific researchers have expressed objective concern over certain ingredients sometimes added to condoms, notably [[talc]] and [[nitrosamine]]s. Dry dusting powders are applied to latex condoms before packaging to prevent the condom from sticking to itself when rolled up. Previously, talc was used by most manufacturers, but [[cornstarch]] is currently the most popular dusting powder.&lt;ref name="fhi4"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Caroline E |title=Chapter 4: Recent Advances in the Research, Development and Manufacture of Latex Rubber Condoms |journal=The Latex Condom: Recent Advances, Future Directions |publisher=Family Health International |url=http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/booksReports/latexcondom/recentadvances.htm |accessdate=2007-04-08 |year=1998 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405095036/http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/booksReports/latexcondom/recentadvances.htm |archivedate=2007-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Talc is known to be toxic if it enters the abdominal cavity (i.e., via the [[vagina]]). Cornstarch is generally believed to be safe; however, some researchers have raised concerns over its use as well.&lt;ref name="fhi4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wright, H |author2=Wheeler, J |author3=Woods, J |author4=Hesford, J |author5=Taylor, P |author6=Edlich, R |title=Potential toxicity of retrograde uterine passage of particulate matter |journal=J Long Term Eff Med Implants |volume=6 |issue=3–4 |pages=199–206 |year=1996 |pmid=10167361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the large-scale use of disposable condoms has resulted in concerns over their environmental impact via [[littering]] and in [[landfills]], where they can eventually wind up in [[wildlife]] environments if not [[incinerated]] or otherwise permanently disposed of first. Polyurethane condoms in particular, given they are a form of [[plastic]], are not [[biodegradable]], and latex condoms take a very long time to break down. Experts, such as [[AVERT]], recommend condoms be disposed of in a garbage receptacle, as flushing them down the toilet (which some people do) may cause plumbing blockages and other problems.&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmentally-friendly condom disposal |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=December 20, 2002 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2311.html |accessdate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020050953/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2311.html |archivedate=October 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avert.org/condom.htm |title=Using Condoms, Condom Types &amp; Condom Sizes |publisher=AVERT |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621222629/http://www.avert.org/condom.htm |archivedate=2009-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the plastic and foil wrappers condoms are packaged in are also not biodegradable. However, the benefits condoms offer are widely considered to offset their small landfill mass.&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal" /&gt; Frequent condom or wrapper disposal in public areas such as a parks have been seen as a persistent litter problem.&lt;ref name="power"&gt;{{cite web|last=Power |first=Robert |title=The black plastic bag of qualitative research |work=BMJ.com |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/318/7175/48#1918 |accessdate=2007-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030729223328/http://bmj.com/cgi/eletters/318/7175/48 |archivedate=July 29, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While biodegradable,&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal" /&gt; latex condoms damage the environment when disposed of improperly. According to the Ocean Conservancy, condoms, along with [[marine debris|certain other types of trash]], cover the [[coral reef]]s and smother [[sea grass]] and other bottom dwellers. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] also has expressed concerns that many animals might mistake the litter for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hightower |first1=Eve |last2=Hall |first2=Phoebe |title=Clean sex, wasteful computers and dangerous mascara&amp;nbsp;– Ask E |journal=[[E–The Environmental Magazine]] |date=March–April 2003 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 |accessdate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227050429/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 |archivedate=2007-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural barriers to use ===
In much of the [[Western world]], the introduction of [[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] in the 1960s was associated with a decline in condom use.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|267–9,272–5}} In [[Japan]], oral contraceptives were not approved for use until September 1999, and even then access was more restricted than in other industrialized nations.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite news |author=Hayashi, Aiko |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |title=Japanese Women Shun The Pill |publisher=CBS News |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2006-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629074107/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |archivedate=2006-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps because of this restricted access to hormonal contraception, Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in 2008, 80% of contraceptive users relied on condoms.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt;

Cultural attitudes toward [[gender roles]], [[contraception]], and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] vary greatly around the world, and range from extremely conservative to extremely liberal. But in places where condoms are misunderstood, mischaracterised, demonised, or looked upon with overall cultural disapproval, the prevalence of condom use is directly affected. In less-developed countries and among less-educated populations, misperceptions about how disease transmission and conception work negatively affect the use of condoms; additionally, in cultures with more traditional gender roles, women may feel uncomfortable demanding that their partners use condoms.

As an example, [[Latino]] immigrants in the United States often face cultural barriers to condom use. A study on female HIV prevention published in the ''Journal of Sex Health Research'' asserts that Latino women often lack the attitudes needed to negotiate safe sex due to traditional gender-role norms in the Latino community, and may be afraid to bring up the subject of condom use with their partners. Women who participated in the study often reported that because of the general [[machismo]] subtly encouraged in Latino culture, their male partners would be angry or possibly [[domestic violence|violent]] at the woman's suggestion that they use condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gomez |first=Cynthia A |year=1996 |title=Gender, Culture, and Power: Barriers to HIV-Prevention Strategies for Women |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=355–362 |author2=Marín |doi=10.1080/00224499609551853 |jstor=3813287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar phenomenon has been noted in a survey of low-income [[African-American|American black]] women; the women in this study also reported a fear of violence at the suggestion to their male partners that condoms be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kalichman |first1=Seth C. | last2 = Williams | first2 = Ernestine A. | last3 = Cherry | first3 = Charsey | last4 = Belcher | first4 = Lisa | last5 = Nachimson | first5 = Dena | title = Sexual coercion, domestic violence, and negotiating condom use among low-income African American women | journal = [[Journal of Women's Health]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 371–378 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.1998.7.371 | date = April 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A telephone survey conducted by [[Rand Corporation]] and [[Oregon State University]], and published in the ''[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]]'' showed that belief in [[AIDS conspiracy theories]] among United States black men is linked to rates of condom use. As conspiracy beliefs about AIDS grow in a given sector of these black men, consistent condom use drops in that same sector. Female use of condoms was not similarly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexualhealth.e-healthsource.com/?p=news1&amp;id=523594 |title=AIDS Conspiracy Theory Belief Linked to Less Condom Use |last=Dotinga |first=Randy |publisher=SexualHealth.com |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702133205/http://sexualhealth.e-healthsource.com/?p=news1&amp;id=523594 |archivedate=2010-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the African continent, condom promotion in some areas has been impeded by anti-condom campaigns by some Muslim&lt;ref name="northeast kenya" /&gt; and Catholic clerics.&lt;ref name="catholicafrica" /&gt; Among the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in [[Tanzania]], condom use is hampered by an aversion to "wasting" sperm, which is given sociocultural importance beyond reproduction. Sperm is believed to be an "elixir" to women and to have beneficial health effects. Maasai women believe that, after conceiving a child, they must have sexual intercourse repeatedly so that the additional sperm aids the child's development. Frequent condom use is also considered by some Maasai to cause impotence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coast |first=Ernestina |year=2007 |title=Wasting semen: context and condom use among the Maasai |journal=Culture, Health, and Sexuality |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2502/1/Wasting_semen-context_and_condom_use_among_the_Maasai(LSERO).pdf |accessdate=2009-07-26 |doi=10.1080/13691050701208474 |pmid=17612958 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=387–401 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524091500/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2502/1/Wasting_semen-context_and_condom_use_among_the_Maasai(LSERO).pdf |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women in Africa believe that condoms are "for prostitutes" and that respectable women should not use them.&lt;ref name="northeast kenya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74336 |title=Muslim opposition to condoms limits distribution |date=Sep 17, 2007 |publisher=PlusNews |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003165407/http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74336 |archivedate=2007-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few clerics even promote the idea that condoms are deliberately laced with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pius-kamau/islam-condoms-and-aids_b_120418.html |title=Islam, Condoms and AIDS |last=Kamau |first=Pius |date=August 24, 2008 |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115211414/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pius-kamau/islam-condoms-and-aids_b_120418.html |archivedate=November 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, possession of many condoms has been used by police to accuse women of engaging in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guza |first1=Megan |title=Condoms criminalized in Allegheny County prostitution cases |url=http://triblive.com/local/allegheny/13690556-74/condoms-criminalized-in-allegheny-county-prostitution-cases |accessdate=6 June 2018 |publisher=Trib Live |date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Big2014&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-bill-would-bar-condoms-proof-prostitution |title=NY bill would bar condoms as proof of prostitution |last1=KLEPPER |first1=DAVID |date=27 April 2014 |work=Associated Press |accessdate=27 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427210304/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-bill-would-bar-condoms-proof-prostitution |archivedate=27 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS]] has condemned this practice and there are efforts to end it.&lt;ref name=Big2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wurth|first=MH|author2=Schleifer, R |author3=McLemore, M |author4=Todrys, KW |author5= Amon, JJ |title=Condoms as evidence of prostitution in the United States and the criminalization of sex work.|journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society|date=May 24, 2013|volume=16|page=18626|pmid=23706178 |pmc=3664300 |doi=10.7448/ias.16.1.18626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2012/10/07/city-cease-using-condoms-evidence-prostitution-cases |title=City to cease using condoms as evidence in prostitution cases |last1=Chanoff |first1=Yael |date=7 October 2014 |website=www.sfbg.com |publisher=San Francisco Bay Guardian |accessdate=27 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428022226/http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2012/10/07/city-cease-using-condoms-evidence-prostitution-cases |archivedate=28 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, technology mogul [[Bill Gates]] offered a US$100,000 grant through his foundation for a condom design that "significantly preserves or enhances pleasure" to encourage more males to adopt the use of condoms for safer sex. The grant information states: "The primary drawback from the male perspective is that condoms decrease pleasure as compared to no condom, creating a trade-off that many men find unacceptable, particularly given that the decisions about use must be made just prior to intercourse. Is it possible to develop a product without this stigma, or better, one that is felt to enhance pleasure?". The project has been named the "Next Generation Condom" and anyone who can provide a "testable hypothesis" is eligible to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Gates offers $100,000 grant for improved condoms|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/|accessdate=2 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=24 March 2013|author=Jessica Chasmar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504144403/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/|archivedate=4 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle-Eastern couples who have not had children, because of the strong desire and social pressure to establish fertility as soon as possible within marriage, rarely use condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 3649633|title= The Sociocultural Context of Condom Use Within Marriage in Rural Lebanon|last1= Kulczycki|first1= Andrzej|date= 4 December 2004 |journal=Studies in Family Planning |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=246–260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, India restricted TV advertisements for condoms to between the hours of 10PM to 6AM.

One analyst described the size of the condom market as something that "boggles the mind". Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government-run manufacturing plants exist around the world.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|322,328}} Within the condom market, there are several major contributors, among them both for-profit businesses and philanthropic organizations. Most large manufacturers have ties to the business that reach back to the end of the 19th century.

A [[spray-on condom]] made of latex is intended to be easier to apply and more successful in preventing the transmission of diseases. {{as of|2009}}, the spray-on condom was not going to market because the drying time could not be reduced below two to three minutes.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lefevre | first = Callie | title = Spray-On Condoms: Still a Hard Sell | work = TIME Magazine | date = 2008-08-13 | url = http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1832445,00.html | accessdate = 2009-07-26 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090523103504/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1832445,00.html | archivedate = 2009-05-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spraytv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sf.tv/var/videoplayer.php?videourl=http%3A%2F%2Freal.xobix.ch%2Framgen%2Fsfdrs%2F10vor10%2F2006%2F10vor10_29112006.rm%3Fstart%3D0%3A23%3A35.732%26amp%3Bend%3D0%3A27%3A02.140 |title=Spray-On-Condom |accessdate=2006-12-03 |publisher=Schweizer Fernsehen News |date=November 29, 2006 |format=streaming video [Real format] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206171909/http://www.sf.tv/var/videoplayer.php?videourl=http%3A%2F%2Freal.xobix.ch%2Framgen%2Fsfdrs%2F10vor10%2F2006%2F10vor10_29112006.rm%3Fstart%3D0%3A23%3A35.732%26amp%3Bend%3D0%3A27%3A02.140 |archivedate=December 6, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spray"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spraykondom.de/spraycondom/index.php? |title=Spray-On-Condom |accessdate=2006-12-03 |publisher=Institut für Kondom-Beratung |year=2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211204724/http://www.spraykondom.de/spraycondom/index.php |archivedate=2006-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Invisible Condom, developed at [[Université Laval]] in Quebec, Canada, is a gel that hardens upon increased temperature after insertion into the vagina or rectum. In the lab, it has been shown to effectively block HIV and herpes simplex virus. The barrier breaks down and liquefies after several hours. {{as of|2005}}, the invisible condom is in the clinical trial phase, and has not yet been approved for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safety, Tolerance and Acceptability Trial of the Invisible Condom in Healthy Women |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |date=August 2005 |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 |accessdate=2006-08-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829080802/http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 |archivedate=2006-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also developed in 2005 is a condom treated with an erectogenic compound. The drug-treated condom is intended to help the wearer maintain his erection, which should also help reduce slippage. If approved, the condom would be marketed under the Durex brand. {{as of|2007}}, it was still in [[clinical trials]].&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|345}} In 2009, Ansell Healthcare, the makers of Lifestyle condoms, introduced the X2 condom lubricated with "Excite Gel" which contains the amino acid l-arginine and is intended to improve the strength of the erectile response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifestyles.com/condoms.php |title=Condoms: Lifestyles Condoms |publisher=Lifestyles.com |accessdate=2012-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109010100/http://www.lifestyles.com/condoms.php |archivedate=2011-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}

'''Diamond plate''', also known as '''checker plate''', '''tread plate'''&lt;ref name=metalsdepot&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metalsdepot.com/products/stainless2.phtml?page=Floor%20Plate&amp;LimAcc=%20&amp;aident= | title = Stainless Steel Floor Plate | publisher = Metals Depot International | accessdate = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Durbar floor plate''', is a type of [[Fabrication (metal)|metal stock]] with a regular pattern of raised [[Diamond (geometry)|diamonds]] or lines on one side, with the reverse side being featureless. Diamond plate is usually [[steel]], [[stainless steel]] or [[Aluminium|aluminum]]. Steel types are normally made by [[Rolling (metalworking)#Hot rolling|hot rolling]], although modern manufacturers also make a raised and pressed diamond design.

The added texture reduces the risk of slipping, making diamond plate a solution for [[stairway|stairs]], [[Footbridge#Catwalk|catwalks]], walkways, and ramps&lt;ref name=metalsdepot/&gt; in industrial settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sizemetal.com/product/aluminum-diamond-plates/#overview | title=Aluminum Diamond Plates - Overview | publisher=Size Metal | accessdate=19 May 2014 | author=Lee, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its non-skid properties mean that diamond plate is frequently used on the interior of ambulances and on the footplates of firetrucks. Additional applications include truck beds and trailer floors.&lt;ref name=metalsdepot/&gt; 

Diamond plate can also be used decoratively, particularly highly polished aluminum variants. Manufactured in plastic, diamond plate is marketed as an interlocking tile system to be installed on garage floors, trailers, and exercise rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kofflersales.com/p/diamond-plate-plastic-interlocking-tile.asp?cid=864 | title = Diamond Plate Plastic Interlocking Floor Tile - #A463 | publisher = Koffler Sales, LLC | accessdate = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond plate may be used for surface protection against damage from foot traffic or harmful chemicals. Manufactured with polymer variants, inter-locking diamond plate tile is used in areas with high surface-erosive traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.garageflooringllc.com/diamond-garage-floor-tile/ | title = Diamond Plate Floor Tile - #A463 | publisher = Wiki Soldiers, LLC | accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tata Steel]] marketed the plate as Durbar Plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tatasteeleurope.com/en/products_and_services/products/construction_products_and_systems/floors/durbar/ | title = Hot-rolled Durbar floor plate | publisher = Tata Steel | accessdate = 3 November 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131104005653/http://www.tatasteeleurope.com/en/products_and_services/products/construction_products_and_systems/floors/durbar/ | archivedate = 4 November 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Diamond plate" can also refer to similar anti-slip textures.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Definitions==

Although digital therapeutics can be employed in numerous ways, the term can broadly be defined as a treatment or therapy that utilizes digital and often [[Internet]]-based health technologies to spur changes in patient behavior.&lt;ref name="Forbes01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dietitian"&gt;{{cite news | last=Yeager| first=David| title =Fighting Chronic Disease With Digital Therapeutics| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Today's Dietitian''| date =November 2014 | url =http://www.todaysdietitian.com/enewsletter/enews_1114_01.shtml| accessdate =19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of digital products to improve health outcomes dates as far back as 2000&lt;ref name="Frontiers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR03"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Webb |first=Thomas L. |last2= Joseph|first2=Judith| last3=Yardley |first3=Lucy| last4=Michie| first4= Susan| date=17 February 2010 |title=Using the Internet to Promote Health Behavior Change: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Impact of Theoretical Basis, Use of Behavior Change Techniques, and Mode of Delivery on Efficacy |url=http://www.jmir.org/2010/1/e4/ |journal= [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|publisher= |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages= e92|doi=10.2196/jmir.4052 |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term itself has been in use since around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn85765357&amp;docId=FTK20121101070417#docIndex=4&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention of the term in a peer-reviewed research publication was in 2015, in which Dr. Cameron Sepah formally defined the field as: "Digital therapeutics are evidence-based behavioral treatments delivered online that can increase accessibility and effectiveness of health care."&lt;ref name="JMIR01" /&gt; Digital therapeutics can be used as a standalone therapy or in conjunction with more conventional treatments like pharmacological or in-person therapy.&lt;ref name="Forbes01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MHNOverview"/&gt; As of 2018, digital therapeutics continues to be an evolving field that medical professionals, students, and patients are beginning to utilize.&lt;ref name="Building"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Le Ber |first=Jeanne M. |last2=Lombardo |first2=Nancy T.| last3=Wimmer |first3=Erin | date=22 January 2015|title=Building Technology Services That Address Student Needs |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02763869.2015.986708 |journal=Medical Reference Services Quarterly|publisher= |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages= 1–16|doi=10.1080/02763869.2015.986708 |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often used as a preventive measure for patients who are at risk of developing more serious conditions. For instance, a patient with [[prediabetes]] may be prescribed digital therapeutics as a method to change their diet and behavior that could otherwise lead to a diabetes diagnosis.&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCNTime"/&gt; Digital therapeutics can also be used as a treatment option for existing conditions. For instance, a patient with type II diabetes can use digital therapeutics to manage the disease more effectively.&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune01"/&gt;

The methodology uses a variety of digital implements to help manage, monitor, and prevent illnesses in at-risk patients. These include [[mobile devices]] and technologies, [[Mobile app|apps]], sensors, [[desktop computers]], and various [[Internet of Things]] devices.&lt;ref name="MCNItsTime"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kvedar| first=Joseph| title =It’s time to break free of the traditional paradigms of disease management| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = Med City News| date =25 August 2016 | url =http://medcitynews.com/2016/08/time-break-free-traditional-paradigms-disease-management/| accessdate =19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These implements can collect a wide variety of data, ranging from [[Big data|big]] to small. Digital therapeutics can theoretically collect a high volume of data from a variety of sources. It also collects "smaller" data, "capturing personalized physiological parameters, behavior patterns and social and geographical patterns that can be recorded from multiple digital sources."&lt;ref name="Drug"/&gt;

==Methodologies==

Digital therapeutics can be used for a variety of conditions. There is no single methodology used in the practice of digital therapeutics. It uses methods rooted in [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] to spur patients to make lifestyle changes. The method can be used to manage and prevent numerous conditions, including type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, congestive heart failure, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], asthma, [[lung disease]], obesity, substance abuse, ADHD, [[insomnia]], [[panic attack]]s, anxiety, depression, and others.&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCNDigit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR02"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dahlberg |first=Leif E. |last2= Grahn |first2=Daniel| last3=Dahlberg |first3=Jakob E. |last4=Thorstensson |first4= Carina A.| date=2016 |title=A Web-Based Platform for Patients With Osteoarthritis of the Hip and Knee: A Pilot Study |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leif_Dahlberg/publication/303801480_A_Web-Based_Platform_for_Patients_With_Osteoarthritis_of_the_Hip_and_Knee_A_Pilot_Study/links/5756a3ac08aec74acf5acd9d.pdf |journal= [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|publisher= |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages= e115|doi=10.2196/resprot.5665 |access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodologies can be as simple as sending notifications designed to alter behavior to patients who are at risk of obesity or diabetes&lt;ref name="Fortune01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt; and as complex as administering an ingestible radio tag that communicates with an external sensor to monitor the efficacy of a given medication.&lt;ref name="Forbes01"/&gt; Diabetes and obesity prevention and management is a major focus in the field of digital therapeutics.&lt;ref name="JMIR04"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willey |first=Steven |last2=Walsh|first2=James K.| date=8 January 2016 |title=Outcomes of a Mobile Health Coaching Platform: 12-Week Results of a Single-Arm Longitudinal Study |journal= [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|publisher= |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages= e3|doi=10.2196/mhealth.4933 |pmid=26747611 |pmc=4723727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vlachopapadopoulou |first1=Elpis |last2=Fotiadis |first2=Dimitrios I. |editor-last=Moumtzoglou |editor-first=Anastasius |title=M-Health Innovations for Patient-Centered Care |publisher=IGI Global |date=26 January 2016 |orig-year= |pages=126–146 |chapter=Chapter 7: The Contribution of mHealth in the Care of Obese Pediatric Patients |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fQB6CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22Digital+therapeutics%22&amp;ots=dfrCtFMlHe&amp;sig=sTxVvATahb5uy3gDfszcE4V1-Mk#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Digital%20therapeutics%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1466698611 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connected devices like [[insulin pump]]s, [[Glucose meter|blood glucose meters]], and wearable gadgets can all send data to a unified system. The therapy also uses self-reported data like diet or other lifestyle factors.&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt; It is also often used to monitor the potential for heart and lung conditions and change behaviors like smoking, poor diet, or a lack of exercise.&lt;ref name="MCNItsTime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;

Digital therapeutics can also be used to treat patients with psychological and neurological disorders. For example, patients with disorders like ADHD, depression, and anxiety can receive cognitive behavioral therapy via their mobile devices.&lt;ref name="MHNOverview"/&gt; One study looked at the efficacy of [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]-based therapeutic interventions to reduce depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="Avatar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pinto |first=Melissa D. |last2= Greenblatt |first2=Amy M.| last3=Hickman |first3=Ronald L. |last4=Rice |first4= Heather M.| last5=Thomas|first5=Tami L. |last6=Clochesy |first6=John M. | date=19 March 2015 |title=Assessing the Critical Parameters of eSMART-MH: A Promising Avatar-Based Digital Therapeutic Intervention to Reduce Depressive Symptoms |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppc.12112/abstract |journal= Perspectives in Psychiatric Care|publisher= |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages= 157–168|doi=10.1111/ppc.12112 |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study demonstrated that a 4-week at-home treatment eliminated or reduced panic attacks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Outcomes==

The general consensus among researchers in the field of digital therapeutics is that the discipline requires more clinical data and investigation to be fully evaluated.&lt;ref name="JMIR03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt; A variety of studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and impact of behavior change techniques that utilize a digital platform, however.&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR04"/&gt; In a meta-analysis of 85 such studies comprising a total sample size of over 43,000 participants, researchers discovered that digital therapeutics have a "statistically small but significant effect on health-related behavior." The study also showed that a broader use of theory, behavior change techniques, and modes of delivery (especially regular notifications) improved the efficacy of a given program.&lt;ref name="JMIR03"/&gt;

Individual studies have also showed some benefits for patients. For instance, a diabetes prevention program using digital therapeutics saw participants lose an average of 4.7% of baseline body weight after 1 year (4.2% after 2 years) and undergo a 0.38% reduction in [[Glycated hemoglobin|A1c]] levels after 1 year (0.43% after 2 years).&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt; Another weight loss pilot program using digital therapeutics reported a mean weight loss of 13.5 pounds (or 7.3% of baseline) with a significant average drop in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (18.6 mmHg and 6.4 mmHg respectively). The study also saw a slight but statistically insignificant drop in total cholesterol, [[LDL]], [[triglycerides]], and A1c.&lt;ref name="JMIR04"/&gt;

'''Environmental Health Officers''' (also known as '''Public Health Inspectors''' or '''Environmental Health Practitioners''') are responsible for carrying out measures for protecting public health, including administering and enforcing legislation related to [[environmental health]] and providing support to minimize health and safety hazards. Environmental Health Practitioners are multi-skilled in many areas with individuals being highly trained, usually to degree level, and often requiring additional professional training, professional competency assessment and continuing professional development in order to continue to practise in the field.
They are involved in a variety of activities, for example inspecting food facilities, investigating public health nuisances, and implementing disease control, conducting work place safety assessments and accident investigation. Environmental health officers are focused on prevention, consultation, investigation, and education of the community regarding health risks and maintaining a safe environment.

EHOs bring to the position an understanding of microbiology, risk assessment, environmental science and technology, food science, knowledge of the built environment as well as the skills and knowledge related to the tracking and control of communicable disease, investigation of environmental health related incidents and criminal investigations. They therefore must also have strong investigative skills and a thorough understanding of the application of legislation related to public health, the built environment, pollution control and workplace safety. Working in partnership with Government Ministries (such as Health, Agriculture and Environment), local municipalities, businesses, community groups, other agencies and individual members of the community, the EHO plays a major role in protecting public health. They are allowed with a permit to select what to inspect.

Some past/historic titles include inspector of nuisances, sanitarian, and sanitary inspector. Other titles that currently exist include environmental health specialist/practitioner/professional, public health officer, health officer, health inspector, and health official. The legal title used will depend on the definitions found in local legislation/jurisdiction.

Environmental health professionals are usually employed by local government or state health authorities to advise on and enforce [[public health]] standards. However, many are employed in the [[private sector]] the [[military]] and other third sector agencies such as charities and NGOs.

==Jobs==
The following represents jobs that can be found in either the public or private sectors:
* Inspection and enforcement services
* Environmental health consulting and education
* Communicable disease investigations and outbreak control
* Food safety course training
* Community planning
* Sewage disposal (septic) systems planning
* Floor plan review and approval
* Housing standards/quality inspection and control
* Urban renewal 
* Pest control
* Emergency contingency planning and implementation
* Noise control
* Air quality monitoring
* Health and safety at work inspection and control
* Water testing (drinking water &amp; recreational water)
* Tobacco control
* Community care facilities licensing
* Public Buildings
* Quality Improvement

The common identifier of environmental health personnel is that they are responsible for the identification, evaluation and management of risks to human health from factors in the environment, whether on behalf of government agencies or commercial and industrial concerns.

==Roles==
A Public Health Inspector (also known as an Environmental Health Officer) investigates health hazards in a wide variety of settings, and will take action to mitigate or eliminate the hazards. Usually the public perception of a health inspector is someone who examines restaurants and ensures they maintain sanitary standards for food safety set by the regulating authority. However, public health inspectors have much broader job duties, including inspecting swimming pools, substandard housing conditions, public schools, day cares, nursing homes, and personal service establishments such as tattoo parlours. Depending on their jurisdiction, Registered Environmental Health Officers often permit and inspect wells, private water systems, and individual subsurface sewage disposal (septic) systems. Other tasks include: campground inspections, tanning salon inspections, beauty salon inspections, correctional facility inspections and mobile home park inspection. The public health inspector (environmental health officer) also plays a vital role in community projects such as those concerning health promotion, tobacco reduction, healthy built environments/healthy communities, food security, and emergency preparedness.
  
They may also respond to complaints such as animal bites, garbage complaints, odor complaints, or sewage overflows. Due to their educational background they can provide information and referrals with regards to; lead, radon, mold, and emerging diseases such as West Nile Virus and Avian Flu. The field also overlaps with hazardous materials (Hazmat) and many Hazmat responders are also Licensed Environmental Health Practitioners or Registered Environmental Health Specialists.

==Working conditions==
Environmental health officers work with many different people in a variety of environments. Their jobs often involve considerable fieldwork, and some travel frequently. Many environmental health officers work long and often irregular hours. They inspect pools, childcare centers, restaurants, septic systems, and many other types of establishments that relate to health and safety.

Environmental health officers may be exposed to many of the same physically strenuous conditions and hazards as industrial employees, and the work may be performed in unpleasant, stressful, and dangerous working conditions. They may find themselves in an adversarial role if the management of an organization disagrees with the recommendations for ensuring a safe working environment.

==History==
The field of environmental health can be traced back to the 1840s in England. [[Edwin Chadwick]], a Poor Law Commissioner, conducted an inquiry into the causes of poverty which concluded that people often became poor because of ill health due to a bad environment. He believed that improving sanitation was the key to breaking this vicious cycle.

Chadwick led a vigorous campaign for change which eventually won over the establishment, resulting in the [[Public Health Act 1848]]. The Act provided for the appointment of Inspectors of Nuisances – the forerunners of today’s environmental health practitioners – in areas of need.

The Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors – the organisation which was to become the United Kingdom's [[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]] – was established in 1883. Over subsequent decades, the role of environmental health practitioners changed and grew, with standards of qualification rising until, in the 1960s, it became a graduate profession. The grant of a Royal Charter in 1984 set the seal on this enhanced role and status. As a result of changing roles, the titles have changed over the decades from inspector of nuisances -&gt; sanitary inspector -&gt; public health inspector / environmental health officer (see Inspector of Nuisances below). This is also true internationally, as the titles have changed to reflect the advanced education and roles of environmental health officers today.

===Inspector of Nuisances===
An Inspector of Nuisances was the title of an office in several English-speaking jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions this term is now archaic, the position and/or term having been replaced by others. In the United Kingdom from the mid 19th century this office was generally associated with public health and sanitation.

The first Inspector of Nuisances appointed by a UK local authority Health Committee was [[Thomas Fresh]]  in Liverpool in 1844. Both the 1855 Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act and the Metropolis Management Act 1855 defined such an office but with the title of 'Sanitary Inspector'. In local authorities that had established a Board of Health, the title was 'Inspector of Nuisances'. Eventually the title was standardized across all UK local authorities as 'Sanitary Inspector'. An Act of Parliament later changed the title to 'Public Health Inspector'. Similar offices were established across the British Empire.

The nearest modern equivalent of this position in the UK is an Environmental Health Officer. This title being adopted by local authorities on the recommendation of Central Government after the Local Government Act 1972. Today, Registered UK Environmental Health Officers working in non-enforcement roles (e.g. in the private sector) may prefer to use the generic term 'Environmental Health Practitioner'.

In the United States, a modern example of an officer with the title 'Inspector of Nuisances' but not the public health role is found in Section 3767[7] of the Ohio Revised Code which defines such a position to investigate nuisances, where this term broadly covers establishments in which lewdness and alcohol are found. Whereas in the United States the environmental health officer role in local authorities is taken by officers with the titles 'Registered Environmental Health Specialist' or 'Registered Sanitarian' depending on the jurisdiction. The role in the US Public Health Service is undertaken by Commissioned (uniformed) 'Environmental Health Officers'.

==Qualifications==
Environmental health is a graduate career in most countries. The minimum requirements in most countries include an approved university degree program, field training and professional certification &amp; registration.

===Australia – General===
[[Environmental Health Australia]] accredits Australian Environmental Health Degree and Graduate Diploma programs in accordance with the Environmental Health Australia  [http://accreditation.eh.org.au/ Accreditation Policy] to ensure course content meets nationally consistent requirements for practice as an EHO anywhere in Australia.

Public Health Inspectors are highly trained individuals whose training include a bachelor's degree in environmental health followed by certification by the [[Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors]] (CIPHI). To become nationally certified, public health inspectors must complete a field training practicum, submit a number of reports and pass the Institute's exam. Some inspectors have additional training in areas such as biology, toxicology and epidemiology.

Only six schools in Canada offer degree programs approved by the CIPHI as meeting the educational component for certification: British Columbia Institute of Technology, Cape Breton University, Concordia University of Edmonton, Conestoga College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, First Nations University of Canada, and Ryerson University. These programs are generally four years long, however fast-track programs are available in some schools for those who have completed a previous science degree.

'''Flavonoids''' (or '''bioflavonoids''') (from the Latin word ''flavus'' meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of [[plant]] and [[fungus]] [[secondary metabolite]]s.

Chemically, flavonoids have the general structure of a 15-carbon skeleton, which consists of two [[phenyl]] rings (A and B) and a heterocyclic ring (C). This carbon structure can be abbreviated C6-C3-C6. According to the [[IUPAC]] nomenclature,&lt;ref name="iupac"&gt;
{{Citation |title=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology |edition=2 |last=McNaught |first=Alan D |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Andrew | author3=IUPAC |publisher=Blackwell Scientific |place=Oxford |year=1997 |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/F02424.html |doi=10.1351/goldbook.F02424 |isbn = 978-0-9678550-9-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |chapter-url=http://goldbook.iupac.org |title=The Gold Book |doi=10.1351/goldbook |accessdate=16 September 2012 |year= 2009 |isbn= 978-0-9678550-9-7 |chapter=Flavonoids (isoflavonoids and neoflavonoids)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
they can be classified into:
*''flavonoids'' or ''bioflavonoids''
*''[[isoflavonoid]]s'', derived from 3-phenyl[[chromone|chromen-4-one]] (3-phenyl-1,4-[[benzopyran|benzopyrone]]) structure
*''[[neoflavonoids]]'', derived from 4-phenyl[[coumarine]] (4-phenyl-1,2-[[benzopyran|benzopyrone]]) structure

The three flavonoid classes above are all [[ketone]]-containing compounds, and as such, are [[anthoxanthin]]s ([[flavone]]s and [[flavonol]]s). This class was the first to be termed ''bioflavonoids''. The terms ''flavonoid'' and ''bioflavonoid'' have also been more loosely used to describe non-ketone polyhydroxy polyphenol compounds which are more specifically termed flav'''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'''noids.  The three cycle or heterocycles in the flavonoid backbone are generally called ring A, B and C. Ring A usually shows a [[phloroglucinol]] substitution pattern.

== Biosynthesis ==
{{Main|Flavonoid biosynthesis}}

==Functions of flavonoids in plants==
Flavonoids are widely distributed in plants, fulfilling many functions.  Flavonoids are the most important [[Biological pigment|plant pigment]]s for flower coloration, producing yellow or red/blue pigmentation in petals designed to attract [[pollinator]] animals.  In higher plants, flavonoids are involved in UV filtration, symbiotic nitrogen fixation and floral pigmentation.  They may also act as chemical messengers, physiological regulators, and cell cycle inhibitors.  Flavonoids secreted by the root of their host plant help ''[[Rhizobia]]'' in the infection stage of their [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with legumes like peas, beans, clover, and soy. Rhizobia living in soil are able to sense the flavonoids and this triggers the secretion of [[Nod factor]]s, which in turn are recognized by the host plant and can lead to root hair deformation and several cellular responses such as ion fluxes and the formation of a [[root nodule]].  In addition, some flavonoids have inhibitory activity against organisms that cause plant diseases, e.g. ''Fusarium oxysporum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.phytol.2007.10.001|title=Flavonoids from carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus) and their antifungal activity|year=2008|last1=Galeotti|first1=F|last2=Barile|first2=E|last3=Curir|first3=P|last4=Dolci|first4=M|last5=Lanzotti|first5=V|journal=Phytochemistry Letters|volume=1|pages=44–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgroups==
Over 5000 naturally occurring flavonoids have been characterized from various plants. They have been classified according to their chemical structure, and are usually subdivided into the following subgroups (for further reading see&lt;ref name="Ververidis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ververidis F, Trantas E, Douglas C, Vollmer G, Kretzschmar G, Panopoulos N | title = Biotechnology of flavonoids and other phenylpropanoid-derived natural products.

[[Procyanidins]], a class of flavonoids, have been shown in preliminary research to have anti-inflammatory mechanisms including modulation of the [[arachidonic acid]] pathway, inhibition of [[gene transcription]], [[gene expression|expression]] and activity of inflammatory enzymes, as well as secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez-Micaelo N, González-Abuín N, Ardèvol A, Pinent M, Blay MT | title = Procyanidins and inflammation: Molecular targets and health implications | journal = BioFactors | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–265 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22505223 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/biof.1019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
[[Clinical trial|Clinical]] studies investigating the relationship between flavonoid consumption and cancer prevention/development are conflicting for most types of cancer, probably because most studies are [[retrospective]] in design and use a small [[Sample size determination|sample size]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Romagnolo DF, Selmin OI | title = Flavonoids and cancer prevention: a review of the evidence | journal = J Nutr Gerontol Geriatr | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 206–38 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22888839 | doi = 10.1080/21551197.2012.702534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two apparent exceptions are [[gastric carcinoma]] and [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]]-related cancers.

===Cardiovascular diseases===

Among the most intensively studied of general human disorders possibly affected by dietary flavonoids, preliminary [[cardiovascular disease]] research has revealed the following mechanisms under investigation in patients or normal subjects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/issues/2009-03/view_features/new-roles-for-polyphenols |title=Non-Antioxidant Roles for Dietary Flavonoids: Reviewing the relevance to cancer and cardiovascular diseases |last1=Higdon |first1=J |last2=Drake |first2=V|last3=Frei|first3=B |date=March 2009 |website=Nutraceuticals World |publisher=Rodman Media |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Dam RM, Naidoo N, Landberg R | title = Dietary flavonoids and the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases | journal = Current Opinion in Lipidology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–33 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23254472 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0b013e32835bcdff }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tangney CC, Rasmussen HE | title = Polyphenols, Inflammation, and Cardiovascular Disease | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 324 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23512608 | pmc = 3651847 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-013-0324-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siasos G, Tousoulis D, Tsigkou V, Kokkou E, Oikonomou E, Vavuranakis M, Basdra EK, Papavassiliou AG, Stefanadis C | title = Flavonoids in atherosclerosis: An overview of their mechanisms of action | journal = Current Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 20 | issue = 21 | pages = 2641–2660 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23627935 | doi = 10.2174/0929867311320210003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= pmid19572741&gt;{{cite journal| last=Cappello| first=AR, Dolce V, Iacopetta D, Martello M, Fiorillo M, Curcio R, Muto L, Dhanyalayam D. |title= Bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso) Flavonoids and Their Potential Benefits in Human Hyperlipidemia and Atherosclerosis: an Overview |journal= Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry | year=2015|volume=16| issue=8 |pages=1–11|doi=10.2174/1389557515666150709110222| pmid=26156545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Listed on the [[clinical trial]] registry of the US [[National Institutes of Health]] (July 2016) are 48 human studies completed or underway to study the dietary effects of plant flavonoids on cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=flavonoids+cardiovascular&amp;Search=Search |title=Flavonoids in cardiovascular disease clinical trials |author=Search Results |website=Clinicaltrials.gov |publisher=US National Institutes of Health |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, population-based studies have failed to show a strong beneficial effect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which might be due to the considerably lower intake in the habitual diet of those investigated.

===Antibacterial===
Flavonoids have been shown to have (a) direct [[antibacterial]] activity, (b) [[synergistic]] activity with [[antibiotics]], and (c) the ability to suppress bacterial [[virulence factors]] in numerous ''[[in vitro]]'' and a limited number of ''[[in vivo]]'' studies.&lt;ref name="pmid21514796" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19844590"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor PW, Hamilton-Miller JM, Stapleton PD | title = Antimicrobial properties of green tea catechins | journal = Food Science and Technology Bulletin | volume = 2 | issue = 7 | pages = 71–81 | year = 2005 | pmid = 19844590 | pmc = 2763290 | doi = 10.1616/1476-2137.14184 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763290/pdf/nihms-1032.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noteworthy among the ''[[in vivo]]'' studies&lt;ref name="pmid17391908 "&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi O, Yahiro K, Morinaga N, Miyazaki M, Noda M | title = Inhibitory effects of various plant polyphenols on the toxicity of Staphylococcal alpha-toxin | journal = Microbial Pathogenesis | volume =  42| issue = 5–6 | pages = 215–224 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17391908 | doi = 10.1016/j.micpath.2007.01.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20512479"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oh DR, Kim JR, Kim YR | title = Genistein inhibits Vibrio vulnificus adhesion and cytotoxicity to HeLa cells | journal = Archives of Pharmacal Research | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 787–792 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20512479 | doi = 10.1007/s12272-010-0520-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18600388"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = González-Segovia R, Quintanar JL, Salinas E, Ceballos-Salazar R, Aviles-Jiménez F, Torres-López J | title = Effect of the flavonoid quercetin on inflammation and lipid peroxidation induced by Helicobacter pylori in gastric mucosa of guinea pig | journal = Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 441–447 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18600388 | doi = 10.1007/s00535-008-2184-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the finding that oral [[quercetin]] protects [[guinea pigs]] against the [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]] ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid18600388" /&gt;  Researchers from the [[European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition]]  have speculated this may be one reason why dietary flavonoid intake is associated with reduced [[gastric carcinoma]] risk in European women.&lt;ref name="pmid23076618"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zamora-Ros R, Agudo A, Luján-Barroso L, Romieu I, Ferrari P, Knaze V, Bueno-de-Mesquita HB, Leenders M, Travis RC, Navarro C, Sánchez-Cantalejo E, Slimani N, Scalbert A, Fedirko V, Hjartåker A, Engeset D, Skeie G, Boeing H, Förster J, Li K, Teucher B, Agnoli C, Tumino R, Mattiello A, Saieva C, Johansson I, Stenling R, Redondo ML, Wallström P, Ericson U, Khaw KT, Mulligan AA, Trichopoulou A, Dilis V, Katsoulis M, Peeters PH, Igali L, Tjønneland A, Halkjær J, Touillaud M, Perquier F, Fagherazzi G, Amiano P, Ardanaz E, Bredsdorff L, Overvad K, Ricceri F, Riboli E, González CA | title = Dietary flavonoid and lignan intake and gastric adenocarcinoma risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 96 | issue = 6 | pages = 1398–1408 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23076618 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.112.037358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional ''[[in vivo]]'' and [[Clinical trial|clinical]] research is needed to determine if flavonoids could be used as [[pharmaceutical drug]]s for the treatment of bacterial infection, or whether dietary flavonoid intake offers any protection against infection.

== Synthesis, detection, quantification, and semi-synthetic alterations ==

=== Color spectrum ===
Flavonoid synthesis in plants is induced by light color spectrums at both high and low energy radiations. Low energy radiations are accepted by [[phytochrome]], while high energy radiations are accepted by [[carotenoid]]s, [[Flavin group|flavins]], [[cryptochrome]]s in addition to phytochromes. The [[Photomorphogenesis|photomorphogenic]] process of phytochome-mediated flavonoid biosynthesis has been observed in [[Amaranth|''Amaranthus'']], [[barley]], [[maize]], ''[[Sorghum]]'' and [[turnip]]. Red light promotes flavonoid synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Plant Physiology|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=03S6VbTjCmUC|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2004-01-01|isbn = 9780849317149|language = en|first = Rajiv Kumar|last = Sinha|page = 457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Availability through microorganisms ===
Several recent research articles have demonstrated the efficient production of flavonoid molecules from genetically engineered microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hwang EI, Kaneko M, Ohnishi Y, Horinouchi S | title = Production of plant-specific flavanones by Escherichia coli containing an artificial gene cluster | journal = Appl.

=== Tests for detection ===
;Shinoda test
Four pieces of magnesium filings are added to the ethanolic extract followed by few drops of concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]]. A pink or red colour indicates the presence of flavonoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yisa, Jonathan |title=Phytochemical Analysis and Antimicrobial Activity Of Scoparia Dulcis and Nymphaea Lotus|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/51366872/phytochemical-analysis-antimicrobial-activity-scoparia-dulcis-nymphaea-lotus|journal=Australian Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences|year= 2009|volume= 3|issue=4|pages=3975–3979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colours varying from orange to red indicated [[flavone]]s, red to crimson indicated flavonoids, crimson to magenta indicated [[flavonone]]s.

;Sodium hydroxide test
About 5&amp;nbsp;mg of the compound is dissolved in water, warmed and filtered. 10% aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] is added to 2 ml of this solution. This produces a yellow coloration. A change in color from yellow to colorless on addition of dilute hydrochloric acid is an indication for the presence of flavonoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bello IA, Ndukwe GI, Audu OT, Habila JD | title = A bioactive flavonoid from Pavetta crassipes K.

; p-Dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde test
A colorimetric assay based upon the reaction of A-rings with the chromogen [[p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde]] (DMACA) has been developed for flavanoids in beer that can be compared with the [[vanillin]] procedure.&lt;ref&gt;A new colourimetric assay for flavonoids in pilsner beers.

=== Quantification ===
Lamaison and Carnet have designed a test for the determination of the total flavonoid content of a sample (AlCI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; method). After proper mixing of the sample and the reagent, the mixture is incubated for 10 minutes at ambient temperature and the absorbance of the solution is read at 440&amp;nbsp;nm. Flavonoid content is expressed in mg/g of quercetin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lamaison, JL  |author2=Carnet, A |title=Teneurs en principaux flavonoides des fleurs de Cratageus monogyna Jacq et de Cratageus Laevigata (Poiret D.C) en Fonction de la vegetation|journal=Plantes Medicinales Phytotherapie|year= 1991|volume =25| pages= 12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semi-synthetic alterations ===
Immobilized ''[[Candida antarctica]]'' lipase can be used to catalyze the [[Regioselectivity|regioselective]] [[acylation]] of flavonoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Passicos E, Santarelli X, Coulon D | title = Regioselective acylation of flavonoids catalyzed by immobilized Candida antarctica lipase under reduced pressure | journal = Biotechnol Lett. | volume = 26 | issue = 13 | pages = 1073–1076 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15218382 | doi = 10.1023/B:BILE.0000032967.23282.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Forum represents all the parties interested in health research: governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), United Nations agencies, research centers, universities, and the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref name="capdevila"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobalreport.org/issues/144/worldnews.html|title=World News - Profit alone motivates drug companies, say health activists|last=Capdevila|first=Gustavo|date=2001-10-09|publisher=Asheville Global Report|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inclen" /&gt; It is run by a governing council and provides support to programmes of research that benefit the developing world. It draws attention to global health research aims with an annual forum that draws together international health researchers and policy makers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Health Score''' is a scoring system used by several mobile health companies in various ways to track an individual's health via [[Quantified Self]]  and the help of mobile applications, [[social networking]] and elements of [[gamification]]. According to them when tracked over time, it offers a good directional indicator of how the users health and well-being is evolving over time. The scoring engine varies considerably from one company to another, and in some cases, the scoring engine is trademarked and/or patented,&lt;ref name="Reuters: dacadoo Obtains US Patent for Health Score"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reuters: dacadoo Obtains US Patent for Health Score|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/24/bc-dacadoo-idUKnPn6R1Fd8+94+PRN20140624|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141202151927/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/24/bc-dacadoo-idUKnPn6R1Fd8+94+PRN20140624|archivedate=2014-12-02|work=dacadoo Obtains US Patent for its Health Score and Launches New Website|accessdate=June 24, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as in the case of [[Dacadoo]]. Health is invisible and therefore, all health scores in use have one thing in common: they want to capture and measure health and wellness and make it visible.

==Overview==
Health is invisible and intangible. The basic premise of a health scoring concept is that what you can measure, you can manage. If you can measure health and wellness good enough as an indicator, then you can start working with it. None of the available health scores is in medical diagnosis, they're all lifestyle-products where the health score in use is to be understood as an indicator, a number that helps you to work with it.
The score typically moves up or down indicating improvement, when it moves up, and vice versa. The simpler health scores available are more static in nature and provide a number based on some inputs provided.  The more sophisticated health scores are dynamic and function in real-time, moving (such as exercise, nutrition, stress and sleep) change.
Most health scores claim they are based on scientific data. The simpler models use one or a few models, the more sophisticated health scores claim to include a vast amount of models and person-years of clinical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://research2guidance.com/health-scores-the-business-of-apps-that-aggregates-health-and-fitness-data-into-one-score-interview-with-peter-ohnemus-ceo-and-founder-of-dacadoo/|title=Health scores: The business of apps that aggregates health and fitness data into one score. Interview with Peter Ohnemus, CEO and founder of Dacadoo|author=Ralf-Gordon Jahns|publisher=Research 2 Guidance|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some health scores use in addition to static questionnaires also dynamic and ongoing data, such as captured and tracked by fitness or activity trackers or applications for smartphones, For instance, exercise can be tracked automatically by using a mobile app for smartphones to track the activity, or by using fitness tracking apps or devices from the supplier of the health score solution, or by connecting popular fitness tracking apps such as RunKeeper and activity tracking devices such as Fitbit or UP Jawbone step counters, etc.
In the past, available information was limited and lifestyle adjustments were largely made only once a health problem was detected, and then under the guidance of healthcare professionals. Today due partly to the availability of electronic mass media there is a trend among the population to maintain their health on their own terms. This seems to be precipitating a shift away from the reactive model of health to a more proactive approach where the individual works towards the maintenance of their wellness before problems arise. This shift in attitudes is said to have broad implications for both public health and individual companies. Improved health would logically lead to reduced healthcare costs and increase workplace productivity.

A wide array of technologies are now available that allow data to be collected on various components of wellness many of them using a variant of the Health Scoring system. Devices for measuring physical attributes, such as blood pressure, blood glucose, and total cholesterol are also commonly used by patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension. Furthermore, devices that can be used by healthy individuals to monitor exercise and energy expenditure are increasingly popular, and range from simple heart rate monitors or step counters to more elaborate computerized exercise machines. These tools provide data on the user’s performance and many can upload the data to further systems to be processed. Undoubtedly, the largest growth area has been in apps, facilitated by the widespread use of tablets and smartphones. Although some of these apps may be gimmicks, many are said to be validated genuine tools to assist in improving health and wellness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.dacadoo.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/06/TheTruthToldAboutHealthScoringMcCannHealth.pdf|title=The Truth Told About Health Scoring|year=2014|publisher=McCann|series=White Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Health Score using companies such as [[Fitocracy]] have grown to over one million users or more by focusing progress based on what's known as [[gamification]] as well as by celebrity exposure with the likes of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] promoting their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/fitocracys-1m-users-including-arnold-schwarzenegger-are-more-engaged-than-any-other-social-network-besides-facebook/android-2-4/|author=Jordan Crook|title=Fitocracy’s 1M Users, Including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Are More Engaged Than Any Other Social Network Besides Facebook|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=March 26, 2013|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism==
The large majority of offerings with health scores is in the lifestyle segment and not in medical diagnosis, therefore prospective clinical trials to scientifically prove whether a score is accurate or not, are often missing.

A single integer measuring wellness and health outcomes is subject to many unknown variables and incomplete data.

'''Health care in [[Antigua and Barbuda]]''' is provided through four institutions maintained for the care of the sick and aged. [[Holberton Hospital]], with 135 beds, is the only public acute care facility. The only private hospital is [[Adelin Medical Center]]. Other facilities include the Fiennes Institute for the aged, with 100 beds,
and the Mental Hospital, with 150 beds. In addition, 9 health centers and 18 dispensaries are located throughout the country. As of 2004, there were an estimated 17 physicians, 328 nurses, and 18 dentists per 100,000 people.

[[Gaston Browne]] said in November 2018 that the health sector stood out like a jewel in the list of the country’s accomplishment since independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ours is a glorious quest – PM Browne |url=https://antiguaobserver.com/ours-is-a-glorious-quest-pm-browne/ |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=Antigua Observer |date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[infant mortality rate]] in 2005 was estimated at 22 per 1,000 live births, up from 12 in 1998. The average [[life expectancy]] was 71.9 years in 2005. As of 1995, 100% of the population was immunized against [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]], and [[tetanus]] and 94% against [[measles]], [[mumps]], and [[rubella]]. The leading causes of death included [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and [[Physical trauma|trauma]].

By the end of 2003, 271 cases of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] had been reported. As of that year, the annual incidence of AIDS was 209 per million people. The government approved a national policy on HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases in 1997.

'''Health policy''' can be defined as the "decisions, plans, and actions that are undertaken to achieve specific [[healthcare]] goals within a society".&lt;ref name="WHO-HP"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/health_policy/en/ ''Health Policy''], accessed 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]], an explicit health policy can achieve several things: it defines a vision for the future; it outlines priorities and the expected roles of different groups; and it builds consensus and informs people.&lt;ref name="WHO-HP"/&gt;

There are many categories of health policies, including global health policy, public health policy, mental health policy, health care services policy, [[insurance policy]], personal healthcare policy, [[pharmaceutical policy]], and policies related to [[public health]] such as [[vaccination policy]], [[Tobacco smoking#Public policy|tobacco control policy]] or [[breastfeeding promotion]] policy. They may cover topics of financing and delivery of healthcare, access to care, quality of care, and [[HealthEquity|health equity.]]&lt;ref&gt;Harvard School of Public Health, Department of Health Policy and Management [http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/about ''About Health Care Policy''], accessed 25 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Health-related policy and its implementation is complex. Conceptual models can help show the flow from health-related policy development to health-related policy and program implementation and to [[health system]]s and health outcomes. Policy should be understood as more than a national law or health policy that supports a program or intervention. Operational policies are the rules, regulations, guidelines, and administrative norms that governments use to translate national laws and policies into programs and services.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, H, N Jewell and Karen Hardee.  2001. [http://www.policyproject.com/pubs/occasional/op-7.pdf ''Reforming Operational Policies:  A Pathway to Improving Reproductive Health Programs''] POLICY Occasional Paper. No. 7.  Washington DC: The Futures Group International, POLICY Project&lt;/ref&gt; The policy process encompasses decisions made at a national or decentralized level (including funding decisions) that affect whether and how services are delivered. Thus, attention must be paid to policies at multiple levels of the health system and over time to ensure sustainable scale-up. A supportive policy environment will facilitate the scale-up of health interventions.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hardee, L. Ashford, E. Rottach, R. Jolivet, and R. Kiesel. 2012. [http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/index.cfm?ID=publications&amp;get=pubID&amp;pubID=83 ''The Policy Dimensions of Scaling Up Health Initiatives'']. Washington, DC: Futures Group, Health Policy Project&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many topics in the [[politics]] and [[evidence]] that can influence the decision of a government, private sector business or other group to adopt a specific policy. [[Evidence-based policy]] relies on the use of science and rigorous studies such as [[randomized controlled trial]]s to identify programs and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes. Most political debates surround personal health care policies, especially those that seek to [[health care reform|reform healthcare delivery]], and can typically be categorized as either [[philosophy|philosophical]] or [[economics|economic]]. Philosophical debates center around questions about [[individual rights]], ethics and government authority, while economic topics include how to maximize the efficiency of health care delivery and minimize costs.

The modern concept of healthcare involves access to [[health care provider|medical professionals]] from various fields as well as [[medical technology]], such as [[medication]]s and [[surgical instrument|surgical equipment]]. It also involves access to the latest information and evidence from research, including [[medical research]] and [[health services research]].

In many countries it is left to the individual to gain access to healthcare goods and services by paying for them directly as [[out-of-pocket expenses]], and to private sector players in the medical and [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] industries to develop research. Planning and production of [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] is distributed among labour market participants.

Other countries have an explicit policy to ensure and support access for all of its citizens, to fund health research, and to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of health workers to meet healthcare goals. Many governments around the world have established [[universal health care]], which takes the burden of healthcare expenses off of private businesses or individuals through pooling of financial risk.  There are a variety of arguments for and against universal healthcare and related health policies. Healthcare is an important part of [[health systems]] and therefore it often accounts for one of the largest areas of spending for both [[government]]s and individuals all over the world.

== Personal healthcare policy options ==

=== Philosophy: right to health ===
{{See also|Philosophy of healthcare}}

Many countries and jurisdictions integrate a [[human rights]] philosophy in directing their healthcare policies. The [[World Health Organization]] reports that every country in the world is party to at least one human rights [[treaty]] that addresses health-related rights, including the [[right to health]] as well as other rights that relate to conditions necessary for good health.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/hhr/en/ ''Health and Human Rights''.] Geneva. Accessed 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]]' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) asserts that medical care is a right of all people:&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml ''The Universal Declaration of Human Rights''.] Adopted on December 10, 1948 by the General Assembly of the United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[UDHR]] Article 25:'' "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, illness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control."

In some jurisdictions and among different [[faith-based organizations]], health policies are influenced by the perceived obligation shaped by religious beliefs to care for those in less favorable circumstances, including the sick. Other jurisdictions and [[non-governmental organization]]s draw on the principles of [[humanism]] in defining their health policies, asserting the same perceived obligation and enshrined [[right to health]].&lt;ref name="NHCHC"&gt;National Health Care for the Homeless Council.[http://www.nhchc.org/humanright.html "Human Rights, Homelessness and Health Care."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610180442/http://www.nhchc.org/humanright.html |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CESR"&gt;Center for Economic and Social Rights. [http://cesr.org/ushealthright "The Right to Health in the United States of America: What Does it Mean?"] October 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the worldwide human rights organization [[Amnesty International]] has focused on [[health]] as a human right, addressing inadequate access to [[HIV]] drugs and women's [[reproductive health|sexual and reproductive]] rights including wide disparities in [[maternal mortality]] within and across countries. Such increasing attention to health as a basic human right has been welcomed by the leading medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = The Lancet | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60768-X | title = Half a century of Amnesty International | journal = The Lancet | volume = 377 | issue = 9780 | pages = 1808 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21621708 | pmc = | url    =  http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(11)60768-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There remains considerable controversy regarding policies on who would be paying the costs of medical care for all people and under what circumstances. For example, government spending on healthcare is sometimes used as a global indicator of a government's commitment to the health of its people.&lt;ref name="LANCET"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lu | first1 = C. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = M. T. | last3 = Gubbins | first3 = P. | last4 = Leach-Kemon | first4 = K. | last5 = Jamison | first5 = D. | last6 = Murray | first6 = C.

The argument furthers that universal health insurance denies the right of individual patients to dispose of their own income as per their own will.&lt;ref name="Sade"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sade | first1 = R. M. | title = Medical Care as a Right: A Refutation | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197112022852304 | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 285 | issue = 23 | pages = 1288–1292 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5113728 | pmc = }} (Reprinted as [http://www.aapsonline.org/brochures/sademcr.htm "The Political Fallacy that Medical Care is a Right."])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cato Institute. [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3057 ''Universal Health Care Won't Work – Witness Medicare.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue in the rights debate is governments' use of legislation to control competition among private medical insurance providers against national [[social insurance]] systems, such as the case in [[Canada's national health insurance program]]. [[Laissez-faire]] supporters argue that this erodes the [[cost-effectiveness]] of the health system, as even those who can afford to pay for private healthcare services drain resources from the public system.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner MD. [http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/08/23/revolt-against-canadian-health-care-system-continues/ ''Revolt Against Canadian Health Care System Continues''.] "Cato-at-liberty" – The Cato Institute, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue here is whether investor-owned medical insurance companies or [[health maintenance organization]]s are in a better position to act in the best interests of their customers compared to government regulation and oversight. Another claim in the United States perceives government over-regulation of the healthcare and insurance industries as the effective end of charitable home visits from doctors among the poor and elderly.&lt;ref name="David E. Kelley"&gt;David E. Kelley, "A Life of One's Own: Individual Rights and the Welfare State." [[Cato Institute]], October 1998, {{ISBN|1-882577-70-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics: healthcare financing===
Many types of health policies exist focusing on the financing of healthcare services to spread the economic risks of ill health. These include [[publicly funded health care]] (through taxation or insurance, also known as single-payer systems), mandatory or voluntary private [[health insurance]], and complete [[rights issue|capitalization]] of personal health care services through private companies, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kereiakes | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Willerson | first2 = J. T. | title = US Health Care: Entitlement or Privilege? | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.0000124795.36864.78 | journal = Circulation | volume = 109 | issue = 12 | pages = 1460–1462 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15051650 | pmc = |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/109/12/1460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/health_financing/en/ ''Health financing policy''.] Geneva. Accessed 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is ongoing on which type of health financing policy results in better or worse quality of healthcare services provided, and how to ensure allocated funds are used effectively, efficiently and [[health equity|equitably]].

There are many arguments on both sides of the issue of public versus private health financing policies:

'''''Claims that publicly funded healthcare improves the quality and efficiency of personal health care delivery:'''''
* Government spending on health is essential for the accessibility and sustainability of healthcare services and programmes.&lt;ref name="LANCET"/&gt;
* For those people who would otherwise go without care due to lack of financial means, any quality care is an improvement.
* Since people perceive universal healthcare as ''free'' (if there is no insurance premium or co-payment), they are more likely to seek [[preventive care]] which may reduce the disease burden and overall healthcare costs in the long run.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
* Single-payer systems reduce wastefulness by removing the middle man, i.e. private insurance companies, thus reducing the amount of bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;William F May. [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=106 "The Ethical Foundations of Health Care Reform."] ''The Christian Century'', June 1–8, 1994, pp. 572–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, reducing the amount of paperwork that medical professionals have to deal with for insurance claims processing allows them to concentrate more on treating [[patient]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Other health policy options ==
Health policy options extend beyond the financing and delivery of personal health care, to domains such as [[medical research]] and [[health workforce]] planning, both domestically and internationally.

=== Medical research policy ===
[[Medical research]] can be both the basis for defining evidence-based health policy, and the subject of health policy itself, particularly in terms of its sources of funding. Those in favor of government policies for publicly funded medical research posit that removing profit as a motive will increase the rate of medical [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, the recent discovery that dichloroacetate (DCA) can cause regression in several cancers, including lung, breast and brain tumors.[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/01/17/cancer-chemo.html Alberta scientists test chemotherapy alternative Last Updated: Wednesday, January 17, 2007]  The DCA compound is not patented or owned by any pharmaceutical company, and, therefore, would likely be an inexpensive drug to administer, Michelakis added.  The bad news, is that while DCA is not patented, Michelakis is concerned that it may be difficult to find funding from private investors to test DCA in clinical trials.[http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=8153 University of Alberta – Small molecule offers big hope against cancer. January 16, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227080213/http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=8153 |date=February 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those opposed argue that it will do the opposite, because removing the incentive of profit removes incentives to innovate and inhibits new technologies from being developed and utilized.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Miller RL |author2=DK Benjamin |author3=DC North |title=The Economics of Public Issues |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2003 |isbn=0321118731 |edition=13th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of sound medical research does not necessarily lead to evidence-based policymaking. For example, in South Africa, whose population sets the record for [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|HIV infections]], previous government policy limiting funding and access for AIDS treatments met with strong controversy given its basis on a refusal to accept scientific evidence on the means of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm "Controversy dogs Aids forum."] ''BBC News'', 10 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A change of government eventually led to a change in policy, with new policies implemented for widespread access to HIV services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/aidssouthafrica.htm "HIV and AIDS in South Africa."] ''Avert''. Accessed 23 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue relates to [[intellectual property]], as illustrated by the case of Brazil, where debates have arisen over government policy authorizing the domestic manufacture of [[antiretroviral drug]]s used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS in violation of [[HIV/AIDS in Brazil#Drug patents|drug patents]].

=== Health workforce policy ===
{{Main|Health workforce}}
Some countries and jurisdictions have an explicit policy or strategy to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] to meet healthcare goals, such as to address [[physician supply|physician]] and [[nursing shortage]]s. Elsewhere, workforce planning is distributed among labour market participants as a [[laissez-faire]] approach to health policy. Evidence-based policies for workforce development are typically based on findings from [[health services research]].

=== Health in foreign policy ===
Many governments and agencies include a health dimension in their [[foreign policy]] in order to achieve [[global health]] goals. Promoting health in lower income countries has been seen as instrumental to achieve other goals on the global agenda, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kickbusch | first1 = I. | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d3154 | title = Global health diplomacy: How foreign policy can influence health | journal = BMJ | volume = 342 | pages = d3154 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21665931 | pmc = |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21665931}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promoting [[global security]] – linked to fears of global [[pandemic]]s, the intentional spread of [[pathogen]]s, and a potential increase in humanitarian conflicts, natural disasters, and emergencies;
* Promoting [[economic development]] – including addressing the economic effect of poor health on development, of pandemic outbreaks on the global market place, and also the gain from the growing global market in health goods and services;
* Promoting [[social justice]] – reinforcing health as a social value and human right, including supporting the United Nations' [[Millennium Development Goals]].

=== Global health policy ===
Global health policy encompasses the global governance structures that create the policies underlying public health throughout the world. In addressing [[global health]], global health policy "implies consideration of the health needs of the people of the whole planet above the concerns of particular nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = T.

This concept is taught to managers in industry, to be promoted as standard practice in the workplace. Various illustrations are used to depict this system, most commonly a triangle.

The hazard controls in the hierarchy are, in order of decreasing effectiveness:
* [[Hazard elimination|Elimination]]
* [[Hazard substitution|Substitution]]
* [[Engineering controls]]
* [[Administrative controls]]
* [[Personal protective equipment]]

==Components of the hierarchy==
===Elimination===
{{Main article|Hazard elimination}}
Physically removed the hazard—is the most effective hazard control.&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt; For example, if employees must work high above the ground, the hazard can be eliminated by moving the piece they are working on to ground level to eliminate the need to work at heights.&lt;ref name=NYCOSH /&gt;

===Substitution===
{{Main article|Hazard substitution}}
[[Image:DDTDichlordiphényltrichloréthane7.JPG|thumb|right|150px|This pesticide contains [[DDT]], an effective substitution would be to replace it with a [[green pesticide]].]]

Substitution, the second most effective hazard control, involves replacing something that produces a hazard (similar to elimination) with something that does not produce a hazard—for example, replacing [[lead paint|lead-based paint]] with [[titanium white]]. To be an effective control, the new product must not produce [[Unintended consequences|another hazard]]. Because airborne dust can be hazardous, if a product can be purchased with a larger [[particle size]],  the smaller product may effectively be substituted with the larger product.&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt;

===Engineering controls===
{{Main article|Engineering controls}}
The third most effective means of controlling hazards is engineered controls.  These do not eliminate hazards, but rather isolate people from hazards.&lt;ref name="NYCOSH" /&gt;  Capital costs of engineered controls tend to be higher than less effective controls in the hierarchy, however they may reduce future costs.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt; For example, a crew might build a work platform rather than purchase, replace, and maintain [[fall arrest]] equipment.  "Enclosure and isolation" creates a physical barrier between personnel and hazards, such as using remotely controlled equipment.  [[Fume hood]]s can remove airborne contaminants as a means of engineered control.&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt;

===Administrative controls===
[[image:Walker_lake_munitions_warning.JPG|This sign warns people that there are explosives in [[Walker Lake (Nevada)|Walker Lake]], however it cannot prevent people from swimming in it.|thumb|right]]{{Main article|Administrative controls}}
Administrative controls are changes to the way people work. Examples of administrative controls include procedure changes, employee training, and installation of signs and warning labels (such as those in the [[Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System]]).&lt;ref name=NYCOSH /&gt;  Administrative controls do not remove hazards, but limit or prevent people's exposure to the hazards, such as completing [[road construction]] at night when fewer people are driving.&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt;

===Personal protective equipment===
{{main|Personal protective equipment}}
[[Personal Protective Equipment|Personal protective equipment]] (PPE) includes gloves, Nomex/Uniform, [[respirator]]s, [[hard hat]]s, [[safety glasses]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and safety footwear.  PPE is the least effective means of controlling hazards because of the high potential for damage to render PPE ineffective.&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt;  Additionally, some PPE, such as respirators, increase physiological effort to complete a task and, therefore, may require medical examinations to ensure workers can use the PPE without risking their health.

== Role in Prevention through Design ==
The hierarchy of controls is a core component of [[Prevention through design|Prevention through Design]], the concept of applying methods to minimize [[Occupational safety and health|occupational hazards]] early in the design process. Prevention through Design emphasizes addressing hazards at the top of the hierarchy of controls (mainly through elimination and substitution) at the earliest stages of project development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html|title=CDC - Hierarchy of Controls - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical perspective==
While repair of the perineum may be medically necessary, an ''extra'' stitch is not, and may cause discomfort or pain.&lt;ref name="Vinopal"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vinopal |first1=Lauren |title=Who’s Afraid of the ‘Husband Stitch’?

Cupples was called upon to explain the 'Husband Stitch,' which he did as follows: He said that when he was stitching up a ruptured perineum, of a married lady, the husband was an anxious and interested observer, and when he had taken all the stitches necessary, the husband peeped over his shoulders and said, 'Dr., can't you take another stitch?' and he did, and called it the 'Husband Stitch'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transactions of the Texas State Medical Association|volume=Seventeenth Annual Session|year=21–23 April 1885|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22husband%20stitch%22&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=%22husband%20stitch%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Texas State Medical Association|location=Houston, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} There is also a reference to it in ''What Women Want to Know'' (1958), a book co-written by an American gynaecologist.{{efn|"Such a problem confronted a colleague of mine, whose pregnant patient asked him before delivery if he would please put in what she referred to as 'her husband's stitch'. It turned out that she wanted him to tighten up her vagina somewhat, so that it would revert to its original state. The doctor took her at her word and, following delivery of her fourth baby, performed a [[Perineoplasty|perineorrhaphy]]. This operation has the effect of tightening the sphincter and rendering the introitus somewhat smaller.{{pb}}"Unhappily, the patient and her husband decided that the 'stitch' had been made too tight, was unsatisfactory, and sued the doctor for malpractice, asking something in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand dollars. The doctor won his case, though not without difficulty, and it was a genuine legal battle despite the humorous implications of the issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Imerman|first1=Harold M.|last2=Dewey|first2=Thomas Blanchard|title=What Women Want to Know: A Noted Gynecologist's Guide to the Personal Problems of Women's Health|date=1958|publisher=Crown|location=New York|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It appears that no studies exist to determine whether the procedure occurs and how many women have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Carrie|title=The Husband Stitch Isn’t Just a Horrifying Childbirth Myth|url=https://www.healthline.com/health-news/husband-stitch-is-not-just-myth#3|work=Healthline|date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medical practitioners view reports about the procedure as an [[urban legend]]. One writer suggests that it might be a joke made by men to relieve tension after their partners have given birth.&lt;ref name="Vinopal"/&gt;

==Popular culture==
A [[short story]] by [[Carmen Maria Machado]], "The Husband Stitch", first published in 2014 by ''[[Granta]]'', describes a woman undergoing the procedure.&lt;ref name="Machado"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Machado |first1=Carmen Maria |authorlink1=Carmen Maria Machado |title=The Husband Stitch |url=https://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/ |website=[[Granta]]|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indoor Mold.jpg|thumb|350px|Indoor mold on the head jamb of the window in multi storey building.]]
'''Mold''' (American English) or '''mould''' (British English), also sometimes referred to as mildew, is a fungal growth that develops on wet materials. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays an important part in nature by breaking down dead organic matter such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold growth should be avoided. Mold reproduce by means of tiny spores. The spores are like seeds, but invisible to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surfaces. When the temperature, moisture, and available nutrient conditions are correct, the spores can form into new mold colonies where they are deposited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/whatismold.html|title=CDC - Indoor Environmental Quality: Dampness and Mold in Buildings - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many types of mold, but all require moisture and a food source for growth.

==Health effects==
{{Main|Mold health issues}}
Mold are ubiquitous, and mold spores are a common component of household and workplace dust. In large amounts they can be a health hazard to humans, potentially causing allergic reactions and respiratory problems.

Some mold produce [[mycotoxin]]s that can pose serious health risks to humans and animals. "Toxic mold" refers to mold which produce mycotoxins, such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/mold.html Indoor Environmental Quality Dampness and Mold in Buildings]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and death. Prolonged exposure (for example, daily exposure) can be particularly harmful.

==={{anchor|Symptoms of mold exposure}}Symptoms===
Symptoms of mold exposure may include nasal and sinus congestion; runny nose, eye irritation; itchy, red, watery eyes, respiratory problems, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing, chest tightness, cough, throat irritation, skin irritation (such as a rash), headache, and persistent sneezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minnesota Department of Health|title=Mold and Moisture in Homes|url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/mold/|publisher=Minnesota North Star|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immune-compromised people and people with chronic lung illnesses, such as obstructive lung disease, may get serious infections in their lungs when they are exposed to mold. These people should stay away from areas that are likely to have mold, such as compost piles, cut grass, and wooded areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mold/dampness_facts.htm|title=CDC - Mold - General Information - Facts About Mold and Dampness|date=2018-04-13|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Health effects linking to asthma}}Asthma ====
Infants may develop respiratory symptoms as a result of exposure to ''[[Penicillium]]'', a fungal [[genus]]. Signs of mold-related respiratory problems in an infant include a persistent cough or [[wheeze]]. Increased exposure increases the probability of developing respiratory symptoms during the first year of life. Studies have indicated a correlation between the probability of developing asthma and exposure to ''Penicillium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gent|first=Janneane|title=Levels of Household Mold Associated with Respiratory Symptoms in the First Year of Life in a Cohort at Risk for Asthma|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241132/pdf/ehp0110-a00781.pdf|publisher=Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mold exposure has a variety of health effects, and sensitivity to mold varies. Exposure to mold may cause throat irritation, nasal stuffiness, eye irritation, cough and wheezing and skin irritation in some cases. Exposure to mold may heighten sensitivity, depending on the time and nature of exposure. People with chronic lung diseases are at higher risk for mold allergies, and will experience more severe reactions when exposed to mold. Damp indoor environments correlate with upper-respiratory-tract symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing in people with asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Aaron|title=WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/43325/E92645.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Causes &amp; growing conditions}}Causes and growing conditions==
Mold is found everywhere and can grow on almost any substance when moisture is present.  They reproduce by [[spore]]s, which are carried by [[air current]]s. When spores land on a moist surface suitable for life, they begin to grow. Mold is normally found indoors at levels which do not affect most healthy individuals.

Because common [[building material]]s are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). [[Flood]]ing, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor-[[plumbing]] problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warm Air is a Moisture Conduit|url=http://fourseasonsroofingandsiding.com/moisture.htm#moistair|work=by Robert Wewer|publisher=FSI Restorations|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without [[vapor barrier]]s or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The "[[doormat test]]" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Doormat Test|url=http://fourseasonsroofingandsiding.com/Phantom.Siding.Leaks.htm#doormat|work=by Robert Wewer|publisher=FSI Restorations|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some materials, such as [[polished concrete]], do not support mold growth.

Significant mold growth requires moisture and food sources and a substrate capable of sustaining growth. Common building materials, such as [[plywood]], [[drywall]], [[furring]] strips, carpets, and carpet padding provide food for mold. In carpet, invisible dust and [[cellulose]] are food sources. After water damage to a building, mold grows in walls and then becomes [[Dormancy|dormant]] until subsequent high humidity; suitable conditions reactivate mold. Mycotoxin levels are higher in buildings which have had a water incident.&lt;ref name=CMHC&gt;[[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:DublinMold.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Bedroom with mold on wall and ceiling|Although this home experienced minor exterior damage from [[Hurricane Katrina]], small leaks and inadequate airflow permitted mold infestation.]]

=== Hidden mold ===
Mold is detectable by smell and signs of water damage on walls or ceiling and can grow in places invisible to the human eye. It may be found behind wallpaper or paneling, on the inside of ceiling tiles, the back of drywall, or the underside of carpets or carpet padding. Piping in walls may also be a source of mold, since they may leak (causing moisture and condensation).&lt;ref name="EPA mold guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mold/moldguide.html|title=A Brief Guide to Mold, Moisture, and Your Home. EPA 402-K-02-003|date=September 2010|publisher=U. S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spores need three things to grow into mold: nutrients - cellulose (the cell wall of green plants) is a common food for indoor spores; moisture - To begin the decaying process caused by mold; time -mold growth begins from 24 hours to 10 days after the provision of growing conditions.

Mold colonies can grow inside buildings, and the chief hazard is the inhalation of mycotoxins. After a flood or major leak, mycotoxin levels are higher even after a building has dried out.&lt;ref name=CMHC/&gt;

Food sources for mold in buildings include cellulose-based materials such as wood, [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] and the paper facing on drywall and [[organic matter]] such as soap, fabrics and dust-containing skin cells. If a house has mold, the moisture may originate in the basement or crawl space, a leaking roof or a leak in plumbing pipes. Insufficient ventilation may accelerate moisture buildup. Visible mold colonies may form where ventilation is poorest and on perimeter walls (because they are nearest the [[dew point]]).

If there are mold problems in a house only during certain times of the year, the house is probably too [[Hermetic seal|airtight]] or too drafty. Mold problems occur in airtight homes more frequently in the warmer months (when humidity is high inside the house, and moisture is trapped), and occur in drafty homes more frequently in the colder months (when warm air escapes from the living area and condenses). If a house is [[Humidifier|artificially humidified]] during the winter, this can create conditions favorable to mold. Moving air may prevent mold from growing, since it has the same [[Desiccation|desiccating]] effect as low humidity. Mold grow best in warm temperatures, {{convert|77|to|86|F|C}}, although growth may occur between {{convert|32|and|95|F|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookstore.ksre.k-state.edu/pubs/mf2141.pdf|title=Controlling Mold Growth in the Home|publisher=Kansas State University|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Removing one of the three requirements for mold reduces (or eliminates) new mold growth: moisture; food for the mold spores (for example, dust or [[dander]]); and warmth since mold generally does not grow in cold environments.

[[HVAC]] systems can produce all three requirements for mold growth. The [[air conditioning]] system creates a difference in temperature, encouraging condensation. The high rate of dusty air movement through an HVAC system may furnish ample food for mold. Since the air-conditioning system is not always running, warm conditions are the final component for mold growth.

== Assessment ==
An observation of the indoor environment should be conducted before any sampling is performed. The area should be surveyed for odors indicating mold or bacterial growth, moisture sources, such as stagnant water or leaking pipes, and water-damaged building materials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41606485|title=Clinical environmental health and toxic exposures|date=2001|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|others=Sullivan, John B. (John Burke), Krieger, Gary R.|isbn=068308027X|edition=2nd ed|location=Philadelphia|oclc=41606485}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can include moving furniture, lifting (or removing) carpets, checking behind wallpaper or paneling, checking ventilation ductwork and exposing wall cavities. Efforts typically focus on areas where there are signs of liquid moisture or water vapor (humidity), or where moisture problems are suspected. Often, quick decisions about the immediate safety and health of the environment can be made by these observations before sampling is even needed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) does not generally recommend sampling unless an occupant of the space has symptoms. In most cases, if visible mold growth is present, sampling is unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/mold/mold-testing-or-sampling|title=Mold Testing or Sampling {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OAR,ORIA,IED|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sampling should be performed by a trained professional with specific experience in mold-sampling protocols, sampling methods and the interpretation of findings. It should be done only to make a particular determination, such as airborne spore concentration or identifying a particular species.

=== Sampling ===
Before sampling, a subsequent course of action should be determined.

In the U.S., sampling and analysis should follow the recommendations of the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), the EPA and the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).

Types of samples include air, surface, bulk, and swab. Air is the most common form of sampling to assess mold levels. Indoor and outdoor air are sampled, and their mold-spore levels compared. Air sampling often identifies hidden mold. Surface sampling measures the number of mold spores deposited on indoor surfaces, collected on tape or in dust. Bulk removal of material from the contaminated area is used to identify and quantify the mold in the sample.  With swab, a cotton swab is rubbed across the area being sampled, often a measured area, and subsequently sent to the mold testing laboratory. Final results indicate mold levels and species located in the suspect area.

Multiple types of sampling are recommended by the AIHA, since each has limitations; for example, air samples will not identify a hidden mold source and a tape sample cannot determine the level of contamination in the air.&lt;ref name="Niemeier"&gt;Niemeier, R. Todd, Sivasubramani, Satheesh K., Reponen, Tiina and Grinshpun, Sergey A., (2006) "Assessment of Fungal Contamination in Moldy Homes: Comparison of Different Methods", ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene'', 3:5, 262-273 [1]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Remediation ==
[[File:Mold Remediation.png|thumbnail|alt=Worker in protective clothing removing mold from a wall|Mold remediation]]
The first step in solving an indoor mold problem is to remove the moisture source;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mold/moldresources.html|accessdate=July 12, 2015|title=Mold Resources|website=United States Environmental Agency|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040218000155/http://www.epa.gov/mold/moldresources.html|archivedate=February 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; new mold will begin to grow on moist, porous surfaces within 24 to 48 hours. There are a number of ways to prevent mold growth. Some cleaning companies specialize in [[fabric restoration]], removing mold (and mold spores) from clothing to eliminate odor and prevent further damage to garments.

The effective way to clean mold is to use detergent solutions which physically remove mold.  Many commercially available detergents marketed for mold cleanup include an EPA-approved antifungal agent.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants EPA-approved antifungal agent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/list_a_sterilizer.pdf|format=PDF|title=List A: Antimicrobial Products Registered with the EPA as Sterilizers|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency Office of Pesticide Programs|accessdate=July 12, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305010203/http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/list_a_sterilizer.pdf |date=February 2014 |archivedate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant mold growth may require professional mold remediation to remove the affected building materials and eradicate the source of excess moisture. In extreme cases of mold growth in buildings, it may be more cost-effective to condemn the building than to reduce mold to safe levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moldbadger.com/toxic-mold-101/mold-remediation/|title=Mold Removal &amp; Remediation Mold Badger |language=en-US |access-date=2017-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before doing any work yourself or even hiring someone to do it for you, check your state laws. Mold remediation professionals may need a special license. Licensed General Contractors are exempt from obtaining a license and are free to perform remediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lookmold.com/removal/mold-remediation|title=Mold Remediation – Complete Homeowners Mold Removal Guide (2018)|work=Lookmold|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of remediation are to remove (or clean) contaminated materials, preventing fungi (and fungi-contaminated dust) from entering an occupied (or non-contaminated) area while protecting workers performing the [[Dust abatement|abatement]].&lt;ref name="NYCguide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines on Assessment and Remediation of Fungi in Indoor Environments |url=https://www.mouldcleaningaustralia.com.au/uploads/74132/ufiles/FAQs/mould-resources/epi-mold-guidelines.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521050755/http://nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/epi-mold-guidelines.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 May 2009 |publisher=New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene |accessdate=10 May 2013 |date=November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Evaluating mold exposures|HVAC Cleaning|What to wear when removing mold|Dry brushing or agitation device|Dry ice blasting|Vacuumming|Damp wipe|HEPA vacuum|Disposal of debris and damaged materials}}Cleanup and removal methods===
The purpose of cleanup is to eliminate mold and remove contaminated materials. Killing mold with a [[biocide]] is insufficient, since chemicals and [[protein]]s causing reactions in humans to remain in dead mold. The following methods are used.
*Evaluation: Before remediation, the area is assessed to ensure safety, clean up the entire moldy area, and properly approach the mold. The EPA provides the following instructions:&lt;ref name="EPA mold guide" /&gt; 
*HVAC cleaning: Should be done by a trained professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NIOSH|title=Recommendations for the cleaning and remediation of flood-contaminated HVAC system: A guide for building owners and managers|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/emres/Cleaning-Flood-HVAC.html|publisher=Center For Disease Control|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Protective clothing: Includes a half- or full-face respirator mask. Goggles with a half-face respirator mask prevent mold spores from reaching the [[mucous membrane]]s of the eyes. Disposable hazmat coveralls are available to keep out particles down to one [[micrometre|micrometer]], and protective suits keep mold spores from entering skin cuts. Gloves are made of rubber, nitrile, polyurethane, or neoprene.&lt;ref name="EPA mold guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYCguide" /&gt;
*Dry brushing or agitation device: Wire brushing or sanding is used when microbial growth can be seen on solid wood surfaces such as framing or underlayment (the subfloor).
*[[Dry-ice blasting]]: Removes mold from wood and cement; however, this process may spray mold and its byproducts into surrounding air.
*Wet vacuum: Wet vacuuming is used on wet materials, and this method is one of those approved by the EPA.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
*Damp wipe: Removal of mold from [[Porosity|non-porous]] surfaces by wiping or scrubbing with water and a [[detergent]] and drying quickly.
*[[HEPA]] (high-efficiency particulate air) vacuum: Used in remediation areas after materials have been dried and contaminated materials removed; collected debris and dust is stored to prevent debris release.
*Debris disposal: Sealed in the remediation area, debris is usually discarded with ordinary [[construction waste]].

===Equipment===
Equipment used in mold remediation includes:  [[moisture meter]]: measures drying of damaged materials; [[Hygrometer|Humidity gauge]]: often paired with a thermometer;  [[borescope]]: Camera at the end of a flexible [[Plumber's snake|snake]], illuminating potential mold problems inside walls, ceilings and crawl spaces;  [[digital camera]]: Documents findings during assessment; [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE): [[Respirator]]s, gloves, impervious suit, and [[eye protection]]; [[thermographic camera]]: Infrared thermal-imaging cameras identify secondary moisture sources.

=={{anchor|Level I|Level II|Level III|Level IV}}Protection levels==
During mold remediation in the U.S., the level of contamination dictates the protection level for remediation workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 6 - Containment and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)|url=http://www.epa.gov/mold/moldcourse/chapter6.html|publisher=EPA|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contamination levels have been enumerated as I, II, III, and IV:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mold Removal Protection Levels|url=http://www.themoldsolution.com/mold-removal-protection-levels.html|publisher=Environmental Protective Solutions|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Level I'': Small, isolated areas ({{convert|10|sqft|m2}} or less); remediation may be conducted by trained building staff;
* ''Level II'': Mid-sized, isolated areas ({{convert|10|-|30|sqft|m2}}); may also be remediated by trained, protected building staff;
* ''Level III'': Large, isolated areas ({{convert|30|-|100|sqft|m2}}): Professionals experienced in microbial investigations or mold remediation should be consulted, and personnel should be trained in the handling of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] and equipped with respiratory protection, gloves and eye protection;
* ''Level IV'': Extensive contamination (more than {{convert|100|sqft|m2}}); requires trained, equipped professionals

After remediation, the premises should be reevaluated to ensure success.

==={{anchor|Mold prevention and control}}Residential mold prevention and control===

According to the EPA, residential mold may be prevented and controlled by cleaning and repairing [[roof gutters]], to prevent moisture seepage into the home; keeping air-conditioning drip pans clean and drainage lines clear; monitoring indoor humidity; drying areas of moisture or condensation and removing their sources; treating exposed structural wood or wood framing with an EPA-approved fungicidal encapsulation coating after pre-cleaning (particularly homes with a crawl space, unfinished basement or a poorly-ventilated; attic).&lt;ref name="EPA mold guide" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9888">{{for|the village in Iran|Jengu, Iran}}
{{No footnotes|date=December 2013}}
A '''jengu''' (plural '''miengu''') is a water [[spirit]] in the traditional beliefs of the [[Sawa (ethnic group)|Sawa]] ethnic groups of [[Cameroon]], particularly the [[Duala people|Duala]], [[Bakweri]], and related Sawa peoples. Among the Bakweri, the name is '''liengu''' (plural: '''maengu'''). Miengu are similar to [[Mami Wata]] spirits. 

The miengus appearance differs from people to people, but they are typically said to be beautiful, [[mermaid]]-like figures with long hair and beautiful gap-teeth. They live in rivers and the sea and bring good fortune to those who worship them. They can also cure disease and act as intermediaries between worshippers and the [[Spirit|world of spirits]]. For this reason, a jengu [[cult]] has long enjoyed popularity among the Duala peoples. Among the Bakweri, this cult is also an important part of a young girl's [[rite of passage]] into womanhood.

==Jengu as a single spirit==

Jengu may refer to a single spirit, as well. In some traditions, this spirit replaces the class of miengu spirits, while in others, it acts as their leader. Among the Isubu, for example, this spirit is called Jengu.

Bakweri belief talks of a female spirit named Mojili or Mojele. Mojili became the progenitor of the miengu when she lost a bet with Moto, the ancestor of mankind, over who could build the longer-lasting fire. Moto won the right to stay in the village, but Mojili was forced to flee to the sea. The Bakweri still worship Mojili as the ruler of the miengu. In fact, her name is so powerful, that many believe that children under seven may die if they hear it uttered. By extension of this tale, the miengu are said to be the wives of the rats, as the ancestor of the rats also lost the bet and fled to the forest.

Another Bakweri tradition names this spirit Liengu la Mwanja and makes her the consort of [[Efasa-Moto]], spirit of [[Mount Cameroon|Mount Fako]] (Mount Cameroon). Long ago, the two formed an understanding that Efasa-Moto would live on the mountain, while Liengu la Mwanja would inhabit the sea. When lava from Mount Fako's 1992 eruption made it all the way to the ocean, many hailed it as a sign that the spirit was visiting his wife.

==Jengu cult==

The Duala and related groups hold the jengu cult in high importance. The cult may have originated with peoples further west, possibly the [[Ijaw people|Ijo]], and then passed from people to people, reaching the [[Grand Batanga|Batanga]] at its most eastward extent. In the earliest days, jengu-worship centred on the water spirits as the source of four boons: [[crayfish]], the end of the rainy season in one of the world's wettest regions, victory in the [[pirogue racing|pirogue races]], and protection from [[epidemic]]s of disease. Among the Duala proper, membership was originally reserved to "free" (pure-blooded) Duala, a stipulation that even excluded members of the prestigious Akwa clan due to one of their ancestors being a [[Bassa people (Cameroon)|Bassa]] woman. Observations by European traders and explorers prove that jengu-worship was well established by the early 19th century. Early [[missionary|missionaries]] largely failed in their attempts to suppress it.

The cult is still active in Cameroon's [[Littoral Province, Cameroon|Littoral]] and [[Southwest Province, Cameroon|Southwest Province]]s. Both males and females are eligible to join, though this openness may be a fairly recent development. Jengu-worship is primarily male among the Duala proper, but among the Bakweri, on the other hand, the cult is primarily for women.

===Ceremonies and rituals===

Jengu worship centres on a [[secret society]] led by an individual known as the ''ekale''. This person traditionally wears a [[mask]] at all meetings, though this practice all but died out by the mid-20th century. Anyone can supplicate the miengu, however, and the simplest [[ritual]]s involve nothing more than [[prayer]]s or [[sacrifice]]s to the deities before [[fishing]] or traveling by water.

Early jengu worshippers performed rituals in pirogues on the [[Wouri River]], its tributaries and [[Wouri estuary|estuary]], and on nearby islands. The person would first dress in ceremonial garb, a cape, skirt, and headdress of [[raffia]] fronds, and carry palm fronds and wooden paddles. He would then summon the miengu and offer them oblations of food and drink. He might also visit a jengu [[shrine]] further up the Wouri.

Much jengu worship is related to [[healing]] and [[traditional medicine|medicine]], and the miengu are called upon when mainstream healing fails. For example, a jengu doctor can treat a patient by first sacrificing a cock and goat. He then administers a vomit-inducing medicine and waves a small stool over the patient's head. The one treated must then follow a series of [[taboo]]s. Among the Bakweri, this rite is known as ''Liengu la Vafea''. 

The highest-profile miengu ceremony today is the annual [[Ngondo]] celebration in [[Douala]], first held in 1949. The night before the fête's culmination, members of the jengu cult hold a private ceremony at Jebale Island on the Wouri. There they sacrifice to the water spirits and prepare a package of gifts. The next day, this offering is presented to the miengu during a public ceremony on a beach near Douala. One cult member dives into the sea with the gift and stays down as long as possible. Afterward, he returns with a message from the miengu about the year to come.

The climax of the ngondo festival is the jengu cult. Wherein the traditional diver goes into the river under supervision of the traditional rulers. This undisclosed custodian of tradition, accompanied by a woman and two men, embarks on a ritual boat. He will then submerge himself in the middle of the river and stay underneath the water for three to ten minutes. It is believed that he visits the kingdom of their ancestors (spirits) beneath the waters. He returns with news of the successor of the ngondo presidency and a coded message from the gods of the land in a calabash. One mystery of this ritual is that the calabash, which the diver holds as he re-emerges from underneath the river, is dry.

===Induction===

The rites observed by the Bakweri people of Mount Cameroon serve as an example of similar rituals among other coastal groups. 

Toward the coast, the Bakweri practice two major induction rituals. In the ''Liengu la Ndiva'', cult members take a [[seizure]] or collapse as a sign that a young girl is ready for induction. A cult member then speaks to her in a [[Ceremonial language|secret liengu language]], and if she seems to understand any of it, a traditional healer begins the [[initiation]] rites. The girl must live in seclusion for several months, during which she must follow a strict set of taboos and may see [[vision (religion)|visions]] of spirits. She also receives a [[secret name]] and teaching in the secret liengu language. Eventually, the healer releases her into the custody of a group of strong men and a number of women singing in the liengu language. The men take turns carrying her until she reaches the middle of a stream. There, the healer plunges her in, inducting her into the cult. Meanwhile, other cult members attempt to capture a crab from the waters, as this animal represents the liengu spirit. The new member's taboos remain, however, and she must live in seclusion for several more months. Finally, the cult holds a [[festival|feast]] in her honour, and the initiation comes to an end. The entire process takes the better part of a year.

An alternate Bakweri initiation ritual is the ''Liengu la Mongbango''. If a young girl disappears into the bush, her female relatives try to track her down by singing to her in the liengu language and carrying cult insignia made of wicker. When they find her, they hide her away for several months (outsiders may visit, however). Afterward, the cult prepares a feast for the girl. She and her sponsor then go alone into the forest. The initiate dresses in traditional regalia of fern fronds and rubs her body with red [[camwood]]. She is then led back to the village tied to the middle of a long rope. Two groups play a [[tug of war]] over her until the rope breaks, and she collapses. The cult members call to her nine times in the liengu language, which causes her to stand back up. After a few more weeks of taboos, a traditional healer bathes her in a stream, and her initiation ends. This process also takes most of a year.

'''Joseph LaDou''' (born 1938) is an [[occupational medicine|occupational]] and [[environmental medicine]] physician who practiced in [[Silicon Valley]] during the early years of the [[semiconductor]] and computer industries. He was appointed the first Chief of the [[University of California, San Francisco]] (MC) Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine {{when?|date=December 2018}}, and was co-director of the residency program there from 1982-1991.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} 

LaDou was the founding editor of the ''International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health'', serving in that capacity from 1992-2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maneyonline.com/loi/oeh ''International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health'' website.] Accessed: August 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; And was director of the International Center for Occupational Medicine at UCSF.&lt;ref name=ucsfmag&gt;Miller, Jeff. (1999, January). "Joe LaDou: The Invisible Man," ''UCSF Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
From 1983 to 2002, in addition to his other responsibilities, LaDou was Director, "Advances in Occupational and Environmental Medicine", a continuing medical education course that trained more than 3,000 physicians (500 from developing countries) in [[occupational medicine]].

LaDou's study of the global migration of hazardous industries{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} has led to efforts to control occupational and [[environmental hazards]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} As one example, his study of [[asbestos]] in developing countries{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} led to a call for an international ban on asbestos mining and use in commercial products.&lt;ref name=ucsfmag /&gt;

'''Late preterm infants''' are [[infants]] born at a [[gestational age]] between {{frac|34|0|7}} weeks and {{frac|36|6|7}} weeks.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt; They have higher morbidity and mortality rates than term infants (gestational age ≥37 weeks) due to their relative physiologic and metabolic immaturity, even though they are often the size and weight of some term infants.&lt;ref name="Late preterm infants"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barfield|first1=Wanda|title=Late preterm infants|website=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-preterm-infants|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Late preterm" has replaced "near term" to describe this group of infants, since near term incorrectly implies that these infants are "almost term" and only require routine neonatal care.&lt;ref name="Late preterm infants"/&gt;

In 2005, late-preterm births accounted for more than 70% of all preterm births (&lt;37 weeks’ gestation), or approximately 377,000 infants. In fact, much of the increase in the preterm birth rate in recent years can be attributed to increases in late-preterm births.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

== Risk Factors ==
Several important factors that may predispose late-preterm infants to medical conditions associated with immaturity:&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;
* [[respiratory distress]]
* [[apnea]]
* temperature instability
* hypoglycemia
* [[hyperbilirubinemia]]
* poor feeding

At 34–35 weeks, the brain weight is only about {{frac|2|3}} that of a full-term baby.  This may lead to an increased risk of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moster|first1=Dag|last2=Lie|first2=Rolv|last3=Markestad|first3=Trond|title=Long Term Medical and Social Consequences of Preterm Birth|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=July 17, 2008|volume=359|pages=262–273|doi=10.1056/nejmoa0706475|pmid=18635431}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Early School-Age Outcomes of Late Preterm Infants|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 15, 2008|volume=123|issue=4|page=e622-e629|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-1405}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mental retardation
* Developmental delay/disability
* Special needs – education
* Retention in kindergarten
* Cerebral palsy

==Neonatal Nutrition==
Late preterm infants have immature gastrointestinal function and feeding difficulties that predispose them to in increase in enterohepatic circulation, decreased stool frequency, dehydration, and hyperbilirubinemia. Feeding during the birth hospitalization may be transiently successful, but not sustained after discharge. Feeding difficulties are associated with relatively low oromotor tone, function, and neural maturation also predispose these infants to dehydration and hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;ref name=Engle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engle|first1=William|last2=Tomashek|first2=Kay|last3=Wallman|first3=Carol|title="Late-Preterm" Infants: A Population at Risk|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 2007|volume=120|issue=6|pages=1390–1401|doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2952}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Late Preterm Infants have an increased risk of being underweight and stunted at 12 and 24 months of age versus term infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santos|first1=Ina|title=Late preterm birth is a risk factor for growth faltering in early childhood: a cohort study|journal=BMC Pediatrics|date=November 16, 2009|volume=9|issue=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper nutrition is essential for normal growth, optimal neurologic and cognitive development, immune protection, and long term health.

==Feeding==
The last trimester of pregnancy the fetus is expressing active amino acid transport, calcium, lipid transfer, and glucose facilitated diffusion.  Delivery of the premature infant requires higher energy expenditure, but with inadequate intake the infant will have negative nitrogen balance.  There are higher needs for Calcium, Phosphorus, and Vitamin D.

==Early Nutrition and Cognitive Outcome==
For every 10 kcal/kg increase in energy intake in the first week of life, there is a 4.6 points increase in MDI (Mental Development Index) at 18 months. For every 1 g/kg increase in protein intake in the first week of life, 8.2 point increase in MDI at 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Bonnie|title=First-Week Protein and Energy Intakes Are Associated With 18-Month Developmental Outcomes in Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 22, 2008|volume=123|issue=5|pages=1337–1343|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-0211|pmid=19403500}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to Feeding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meier|first1=Paula|title=Increased lactation risk for late preterm infants and mothers: evidence and management strategies to protect breastfeeding.|journal=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women’s Health|date=2007|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radtke|first1=Jill|title=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women’s Health|journal=Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, &amp; Neonatal Nursing|date=January 2011|volume=40|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
* Small mouth and immature oral muscle
* Weak suck and poor latch
* Easily tire with feeding
* Maternal delayed milk production

==When To Start Feeding==

Factors such as hemodynamic stability, severe IUGR, respiratory, abdominal exam, whether feeding cues are present, and stable glucose could all effect the timing of nutrition.  Some preterm infants will be NPO (nil per os).  If infants are unable to start oral or enteral intake intravenous fluids may begin with amino acids or total parenteral nutrition.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics section on breastfeeding recommendations are all infants should receive human milk.

==Nutrient Needs by Gestational Age&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lapillonne|first1=Alexandre|title=Nutritional Recommendations for the Late-Preterm Infant and the Preterm Infant after Hospital Discharge|journal=Journal of Pediatrics|date=March 2013|volume=162|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

==Fortifiers==
Use caution when fortifying single nutrients to prevent alteration of protein/energy ratio.  [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) recommends that sterile formulas and fortifiers be used when mom is not available.  Powdered formula and HMF may be contaminants. Start with the mom's diet during breastfeeding.  Mom should be eating adequate calories, protein, B vitamins and DHA.

===How Much===

{| class="wikitable"

===Colostrum Production===
[[Colostrum]] production can range from 26-56 mL the first day to 113-185 mL for day two.  Although colostrum production is not voluminous, it can still meet the needs of the newborn.

===Feeding Methods===
* Direct Breast Feeding
* Feeding tube at breast
* Cup/Finger feeding
* Bottle Feeding
* Gavage Tube (bolus feeding)

==Strategies to Improve Outcome==

===Early Nutrition===

* Colostrum Diet; Mother's own milk [Contains: [[Lactoferrin]], [[Secretory IgA]], Lysozyme, contains [[oligosaccharides]] (beneficial growth of good gut bacteria), and hormones]
* Trophic Feeds (beneficial effect on maturation of the intestinal tract)
* Donor Milk
* Fortify human milk
* Consistency in feedings important

'''Lipedema''' is a disorder where there is enlargement of both [[Human Legs|legs]] due to deposits of fat under the skin.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Typically it gets worse over time, pain may be present, and sufferers [[bruise]] easily.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; In severe cases the trunk and upper body may be involved.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Lipedema is commonly misdiagnosed.&lt;ref name="pmid22301856" /&gt; 

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause is unknown but is believed to involve genetics and hormonal factors.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; It often runs in families.&lt;ref name=GARD2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Lipedema|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10542/lipedema|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors include being [[overweight]] or [[obese]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Other conditions that may present similarly include obesity, [[lipohypertrophy]], [[chronic venous insufficiency]], and [[lymphedema]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
A number of treatments may be useful including [[physiotherapy]] and exercise.  Physiotherapy may help to preserve mobility for a little longer than would otherwise be the case.  Exercise, only as much as the patient is able to do without causing damage to the joints, may help with overall fitness but will not prevent progression of the disease.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; While surgery can remove fat tissue it can also damage [[lymphatic vessels]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Treatment does not typically result in complete resolution.&lt;ref name=War2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warren Peled|first1=A|last2=Kappos|first2=EA|title=Lipedema: diagnostic and management challenges.|journal=International Journal of Women's Health|date=2016|volume=8|pages=389–95|doi=10.2147/IJWH.S106227|pmid=27570465|pmc=4986968}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated to affect up to 11% of women.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Onset is typically during [[puberty]], [[pregnancy]], or [[menopause]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt;

===Lymphedema===

Lipedema can be underdiagnosed due the difficulty in differentiating it from other edemas and obesity, or clinicians failing to make themselves aware of the disease. Trayes 2013 published some tools including tables and a flow chart that can be used to diagnose lipedema and other edemas.&lt;ref name="pmid23939641" /&gt;

Lipedema / [[Adiposis dolorosa|Dercum’s Disease]] Differentiation
These conditions may co-exist. Dercum’s Disease is characterized by painful lipomas around the body.&lt;ref&gt;http://fatdisorders.org/fat-disorders/diagram{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
A number of treatments may be useful including [[physiotherapy]] and light exercise which does not put undue stress on the lymphatic system.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; While surgery can remove fat tissue it can also damage [[lymphatic vessels]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Treatment does not typically result in complete resolution.&lt;ref name=War2016/&gt;

The use of surgery to treat the condition is controversial.&lt;ref name=War2016/&gt; Options include [[liposuction]] and [[lipectomy]].&lt;ref name=War2016/&gt;

The studies of highest quality involve tumescent or super tumescent anesthesia and vibrating liposuction, powered, cannula used with lymph sparing techniques.&lt;ref name=pmid20087075&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.ASW.0000363503.92360.91 |pmid=20087075 |title=Lipedema |journal=Advances in Skin &amp; Wound Care |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=81–92 |year=2010 |last1=Fife |first1=Caroline E. |last2=Maus |first2=Erik A. |last3=Carter |first3=Marissa J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19785610&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2009.09413.x |pmid=19785610 |title=Lipoedema: From clinical presentation to therapy. A review of the literature |journal=British Journal of Dermatology |volume=161 |issue=5 |pages=980–6 |year=2009 |last1=Langendoen |first1=S.I. |last2=Habbema |first2=L. |last3=Nijsten |first3=T.E.C. |last4=Neumann |first4=H.A.M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment of lipedema with tumescent liposuction requires multiple procedures. In the United States Health Insurance do not generally pay for liposuction for lipedema, making it expensive. Liposuction under general anesthesia, without tumescent anesthesia, can be damaging and is not recommended for the treatment.&lt;ref name=pmid25586162&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1758-8111.2012.00045.x |pmid=25586162 |title=Lipedema: An overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of the disproportional fatty deposition syndrome - systematic review |journal=Clinical Obesity |volume=2 |issue=3–4 |pages=86–95 |year=2012 |last1=Forner-Cordero |first1=I. |last2=Szolnoky |first2=G. |last3=Forner-Cordero |first3=A. |last4=Kemény |first4=L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Complications include depression, anxiety, and pain.&lt;ref name="pmid22301856" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Estimates of the incidence of lipedema vary widely, and range as high as 11% of the post-pubertal female population, with estimates of 17 million women in the US, and 370 million women worldwide affected.&lt;ref name="Foldi Lipedema"/&gt; "11% of adult women" is often cited but that is unsubstantiated.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
Although first identified in the [[United States]], at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in 1940, lipedema is barely known in that country – to physicians or to the patients who have the disease. Lipedema often is confused with [[obesity]], and a significant number of patients currently diagnosed as obese are believed to have lipedema, either instead of or in addition to obesity.&lt;ref name="pmid22301856"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34203">{{refimprove|date=May 2017}}This page serves as a partial list of countries by adult mean body weight and incidence of obese and overweight populations as calculated by [[body mass index]] (BMI).  

The data for 2014 was first published by the [[World Health Organization]] in 2015.

==Methodology==
{{Main|Body mass index}}
[[Arithmetic mean|Mean]] [[body mass index]] (BMI) provides a simplified measure of the comparative weight of populations on a country by country basis.  BMI calculates a person's mass (weight) divided by the square of their height. An individual with a BMI of 25 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or more is considered overweight.  An individual with a BMI of 30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or more is considered obese.

The data highlighted on this page comes from [[World Health Organization]] statistics for adult (18 years old and older) populations. Mean BMI data is shown separately for males and females, as well as a combined figure. Mean data highlights the [[central tendency]] of the population data and is but one method of calculating relative body weight between populations.

==Limitations on the usefulness of comparative BMI data==
{{Main|Body mass index#Limitations}}
There are significant limitations to the usefulness of comparative BMI data cited by both the medical community and statisticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olson|first1=Samantha|title=BMI Is No Longer A Good Indication Of Healthy Weight; Here Are 6 Better Ways To Measure Your Health|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/body-mass-index-bmi-calculator-healthy-weight-obesity-372852|website=Medical Daily|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMI data has significant weaknesses in terms of scalability and in accounting for variations in physical characteristics.

'''MUMPS''' (''Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System''), or '''M''', is a general-purpose computer [[programming language]] originally designed in 1966 for the healthcare industry. Its differentiating feature is its "built-in" database, enabling high-level access to disk storage using simple symbolic program [[variable (computer science)|variables]] and subscripted [[Array data structure|arrays]]; similar to the variables used by most languages to access main memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/george.james/mumps-the-internet-scale-database-presentation|title=Mumps the Internet scale database|first=|last=george.james|date=22 August 2008|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It continues to be used today by many large hospitals and banks to provide high-throughput transaction data processing.

== History ==
{{For |context |Timeline of programming languages}}

===Genesis===
MUMPS was developed by [[Neil Pappalardo]], Robert Greenes, and Curt Marble in Dr. Octo Barnett's animal lab at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH) in [[Boston]] during 1966 and 1967.

The original MUMPS system was, like [[Unix]] a few years later, built on a spare [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-7]]. Octo Barnett and Neil Pappalardo were also involved with MGH's planning for a Hospital Information System, obtained a [[backward compatible]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP-9]], and began using MUMPS in the admissions cycle and laboratory test reporting. MUMPS was then an [[interpreted language]], yet even then, incorporated a [[hierarchical database]] file system to standardize interaction with the data.

Some aspects of MUMPS can be traced from [[Rand Corporation]]'s [[JOSS]] through [[BBN Technologies|BBN]]'s [[TELCOMP]] and [[STRINGCOMP]]. The MUMPS team deliberately chose to include portability between machines as a design goal. Another feature, not widely supported for machines of the era, in [[operating system]]s or in [[computer hardware]], was [[computer multitasking|multitasking]], which was also built into the language itself.{{Citation needed|reason=What sort of multitasking are we talking about? Timesharing was already spreading rapidly by the time MUMPS was being created|date=April 2014}}

The portability was soon useful, as MUMPS was shortly adapted to a DEC [[PDP-15]], where it lived for some time. MUMPS was developed with the support of a government research grant, and so MUMPS was released to the public domain (no longer a requirement for grants), and was soon ported to a number of other systems including the popular DEC [[PDP-8]], the [[Data General Nova]] and the DEC [[PDP-11]] and the [[Artronix]] [[PC12 minicomputer]]. Word about MUMPS spread mostly through the medical community, and by the early 1970s was in widespread use, often being locally modified for their own needs.

===1970s===
By the early 1970s, there were many and varied implementations of MUMPS on a range of hardware platforms. The most widespread was DEC's MUMPS-11 on the PDP-11, and [[MEDITECH]]'s [[MIIS (programming language)|MIIS]].  In 1972, many MUMPS users attended a conference which standardized the then-fractured language, and created the '''MUMPS Users Group''' and '''MUMPS Development Committee''' (MDC) to do so. These efforts proved successful; a standard was complete by 1974, and was approved, on September 15, 1977, as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard, X11.1-1977.  At about the same time DEC launched DSM-11 (Digital Standard MUMPS) for the PDP-11.  This quickly dominated the market, and became the reference implementation of the time. Also, [[InterSystems]] sold ISM-11 for the PDP-11 (which was identical to DSM-11).

===1980s===
During the early 1980s several vendors brought MUMPS-based platforms that met the ANSI standard to market. The most significant were:
* Digital Equipment Corporation with '''DSM''' (Digital Standard MUMPS). DSM-11 was superseded by '''VAX/DSM''' for the VAX/VMS platform, and that was ported to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] in two variants: '''DSM for OpenVMS''', and as '''DSM for Ultrix'''.
* [[InterSystems]] with '''ISM''' (InterSystems M) on VMS (M/VX), M/11+ on the PDP-11 platform, M/PC on MS-DOS, M/DG on [[Data General]], M/VM on IBM VM/CMS, and M/UX on various Unixes.

Other companies developed important MUMPS implementations:
* Greystone Technology Corporation with a compiled version called [[GT.M]].
* DataTree Inc. with an Intel PC based product called '''DTM'''.
* Micronetics Design Corporation with a product line called '''MSM''' for UNIX and Intel PC platforms (later ported to IBM's VM [[operating system]], VAX-VMS platforms and Alpha-VMS platforms).
* Computer Consultants (later renamed MGlobal), a [[Houston]]-based company originally created '''CCSM''' on 6800, then 6809, and eventually a port to the 68000, which later became '''MacMUMPS''', a [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] based product. They also worked on the '''MGM''' MUMPS implementation. MGlobal also ported their implementation to the DOS platform. MGlobal MUMPS was the first commercial MUMPS for the IBM PC and the only implementation for the classic Mac OS. 
* [[Tandem Computers]] developed an implementation for their fault-tolerant computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://h17007.www1.hp.com/docs/enterprise/servers/nonstop/SPML_20_January_2012_final.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw considerable MDC activity. The second revision of the ANSI standard for MUMPS (X11.1-1984) was approved on November 15, 1984.

===1990s===
* On November 11, 1990 the third revision of the ANSI standard (X11.1-1990) was approved.
* In 1992 the same standard was also adopted as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard 11756-1992. Use of '''M''' as an alternative name for the language was approved around the same time.
* On December 8, 1995 the fourth revision of the standard ([[X11.1-1995]]) was approved by ANSI, and by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] in 1999 as [http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=29268 ISO 11756:1999].  The MDC finalized a further revision to the standard in 1998 but this has not been presented to ANSI for approval.
* InterSystems' Open M for Windows/NT was released, as well as Open M for Alpha/OSF and Alpha/VMS (their first 64-bit implementations, for the 64-bit Alpha processor).
* In 1997 Unicode support was added in InterSystems’ Caché 3.0

===2000s===
* By 2000, the [[Middleware (distributed applications)|middleware]] vendor InterSystems had become the dominant player in the MUMPS market with the purchase of several other vendors. Initially they acquired DataTree Inc. in the early 1990s. And, on December 30, 1995, InterSystems acquired the DSM product line from DEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.mumps/msg/d4509328a7930487 |title=Google Discussiegroepen |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; InterSystems consolidated these products into a single product line, branding them, on several hardware platforms, as '''OpenM'''. In 1997, InterSystems launched a new product named [[Caché (software)|Caché]]. This was based on their ISM product, but with influences from the other implementations. Micronetics Design Corporation assets were also acquired by InterSystems on June 21, 1998. InterSystems remains the dominant MUMPS vendor, selling Caché to MUMPS developers who write applications for a variety of operating systems.
* Greystone Technology Corporation's GT.M implementation was sold to Sanchez Computer Associates (now part of [[Fidelity National Information Services|FIS]]) in the mid-1990s. On November 7, 2000 Sanchez made GT.M for Linux available under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanchez.com/news_2000/nr_001107.asp |title=Sanchez to Explore New Business Opportunities for Its Database Technology |publisher=Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc. |date=November 7, 2000 |accessdate=2013-08-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040428215120/http://www.sanchez.com/news_2000/nr_001107.asp |archivedate=28 April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on October 28, 2005 GT.M for [[OpenVMS]] and [[Tru64 UNIX]] were also made available under the AGPL license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/ |title=GT.M High end TP database engine - Browse Files at |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; GT.M continues to be available on other [[UNIX]] platforms under a traditional license.
* During 2000, Ray Newman and others released MUMPS V1, an implementation of MUMPS (initially on FreeBSD) similar to DSM-11.  MUMPS V1 has since been ported to [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (using cygwin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/mumps/files/ |title=MUMPS Database and Language - Browse Files at |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially only for the x86 CPU, MUMPS V1 has now been ported to the Raspberry Pi.
* The newest implementation of MUMPS, released in April 2002, is an '''MSM''' derivative called '''M21''' from the Real Software Company of Rugby, [[UK]].
* There are also several open source implementations of MUMPS, including some research projects. The most notable of these is [http://www.cs.uni.edu/~okane Mumps/II], by Dr. Kevin O'Kane (Professor Emeritus, [[University of Northern Iowa]]) and students' project. Dr. O'Kane has also ported the interpreter to Mac OS X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rychannel.com/mumps |title=Mumps/Mii |publisher=Rychannel.com |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the original creators of the MUMPS language, Neil Pappalardo, early founded a company called [[MEDITECH]]. They extended and built on the MUMPS language, naming the new language MIIS (and later, another language named MAGIC). Unlike InterSystems, MEDITECH no longer sells middleware, so MIIS and MAGIC are now only used internally at MEDITECH.
* On 6 January 2005, and later again on 25 June 2010, ISO re-affirmed its MUMPS-related standards: [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29268&amp;ICS1=35&amp;ICS2=60&amp;ICS3=&amp;scopelist ISO/IEC 11756:1999, language standard], [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29269&amp;printable=true ISO/IEC 15851:1999, Open MUMPS Interconnect] and [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?printable=true&amp;CSNUMBER=29270 ISO/IEC 15852:1999, MUMPS Windowing Application Programmers Interface].

==Current users of MUMPS applications==
The US Department of Veterans Affairs (formerly the Veterans Administration) was one of the earliest major adopters of the MUMPS language.  Their development work (and subsequent contributions to the free MUMPS application codebase) was an influence on many medical users worldwide. In 1995, the Veterans Affairs' patient Admission/Tracking/Discharge system, [[Decentralized Hospital Computer Program]] (DHCP) was the recipient of the Computerworld [[Smithsonian Award]] for best use of Information Technology in Medicine. In July 2006, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) / [[Veterans Health Administration]] (VHA) was the recipient of the Innovations in American Government Award presented by the Ash Institute of the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] for its extension of DHCP into the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture ([[VistA]]). Nearly the entire VA hospital system in the United States, the [[Indian Health Service]], and major parts of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] [[CHCS]] hospital system use MUMPS databases for clinical data tracking. In 2015 the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] awarded a 10 year contract to [[Leidos]], [[Cerner]], and [[Accenture]] to replace [[CHCS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/dod-names-ehr-contract-winner|title=DoD awards Cerner, Leidos, Accenture EHR contract|date=29 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) announced that it would replace [[VistA]] with [[Cerner]] by 2024 or 2025. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthexec.com/topics/health-it/cerner-ehr-implementation-va-take-%E2%80%9C7-8-years%E2%80%9D|title=Cerner EHR implementation at VA to take '7 to 8 years'|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That contract did not affect the 2015 VHA contract for an online appointment scheduling from [[Epic Systems|Epic]], so the VHA will continue to use MUMPS. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ehrintelligence.com/news/epic-keeps-va-scheduling-contract-despite-cerner-decision|title=Epic Keeps VA Scheduling Contract Despite Cerner Decision|first=|last=EHRIntelligence|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other healthcare IT companies using MUMPS include [[Epic Systems|Epic]], [[MEDITECH]], [[GE Healthcare]] (formerly [[IDX Systems Corporation|IDX]] Systems and [[Centricity]]), AmeriPath (part of Quest Diagnostics), Care Centric, [[Allscripts]], [[Coventry Healthcare]], [[EMIS Health|EMIS]], and [[Sunquest Information Systems]] (formerly Misys Healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/sunquest-emerges-misys-shadow |title=SunQuest emerges from Misys' shadow |publisher=Healthcare IT News |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Many reference laboratories, such as DASA, [[Quest Diagnostics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/george.james/missioncritical-ajaxmaking-test-ordering-easier-and-faster-at-quest-diagnostics?type=powerpoint |title=Mission-critical Ajax: Making Test Ordering Easier and Faster at Qu |publisher=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dynacare, use MUMPS software written by or based on Antrim Corporation code. Antrim was purchased by Misys Healthcare (now [[Sunquest Information Systems]]) in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sunquest+acquires+Antrim+Corp.-a018916869 |title=Sunquest acquires Antrim Corp. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=1996-11-26 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MUMPS is also widely used in financial applications. MUMPS gained an early following in the financial sector and is in use at many banks and credit unions. It is used by [[Ameritrade]], the largest online trading service in the US, with over 12 billion transactions per day, as well as by the [[Bank of England]] and [[Barclays Bank]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m21.uk.com/newtom.php|title=Welcome to M21 -- the database for the 21st Century|publisher=M21.uk.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intersystems.com/industry/financial/intersystems-in-financial.html|title=Caché-based Financial Systems|publisher=Intersystems.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idea.cz/company/references|title=IDEA Turn-Key banking and ERP applications|publisher=Idea.cz|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the use of MUMPS has been either in the form of GT.M or InterSystems Caché. The latter is being aggressively marketed by InterSystems and has had success in penetrating new markets, such as telecommunications, in addition to existing markets. The European Space Agency announced on May 13, 2010 that it will use the [[InterSystems Caché]] database to support the [[Gaia mission]].  This mission aims to map the [[Milky Way]] with unprecedented precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realwire.com/release_detail.asp?ReleaseID=18645|title=European Space Agency Chooses InterSystems Caché Database For Gaia Mission to Map Milky Way|publisher=Realwire.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
MUMPS is a language intended for and designed to build database applications.  Secondary language features were included to help programmers make applications using minimal computing resources.  The original implementations were [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]], though modern implementations may be fully or partially [[Compiler|compiled]]. Individual "programs" run in memory [[Memory management (operating systems)#Partitioned allocation|"partitions"]].  Early MUMPS memory partitions were limited to 2048 bytes so aggressive abbreviation greatly aided multi-programming on severely resource limited hardware, because more than one MUMPS job could fit into the very small memories extant in hardware at the time. The ability to provide multi-user systems was another language design feature. The word "'''M'''ulti-'''P'''rogramming" in the acronym points to this. Even the earliest machines running MUMPS supported multiple jobs running at the same time. With the change from mini-computers to micro-computers a
few years later, even a "single user PC" with a single 8-bit CPU and 16K or 64K of memory could support multiple users, who could connect to it from (non-[[GUI|graphical]]) [[Computer terminal|video display terminals]].

Since memory was tight originally, the language design for MUMPS valued very terse code. Thus, every MUMPS command or function name could be abbreviated from one to three letters in length, e.g. Quit (exit program) as Q, $P = $Piece function, R = Read command, $TR = $Translate function. Spaces and end-of-line markers are significant in MUMPS because line scope promoted the same terse language design. Thus, a single line of program code could express, with few characters, an idea for which other programming languages could require 5 to 10 times as many characters.  Abbreviation was a common feature of languages designed in this period (e.g., [[FOCAL-69]], early BASICs such as [[Tiny BASIC]], etc.).  An unfortunate side effect of this, coupled with the early need to write minimalist code, was that MUMPS programmers routinely did not comment code and used extensive abbreviations.  This meant that even an expert MUMPS programmer could not just skim through a page of code to see its function but would have to
analyze it line by line.

Database interaction is transparently built into the language. The MUMPS language provides a [[hierarchical database model|hierarchical database]] made up of [[persistence (computer science)|persistent]] [[sparse array]]s, which is implicitly "opened" for every MUMPS application.  All variable names prefixed with the caret character ("^") use permanent (instead of RAM) storage, will maintain their values after the application exits, and will be visible to (and modifiable by) other running applications.  Variables using this shared and permanent storage are called ''Globals'' in MUMPS, because the scoping of these variables is "globally available" to all jobs on the system. The more recent and more common use of the name "global variables" in other languages is a more limited scoping of names, coming from the fact that [[Variable scoping|unscoped variables]] are "globally" available to any programs running in the same process, but not shared among multiple processes. The MUMPS Storage mode (i.e. Globals
stored as persistent sparse arrays), gives the MUMPS database the characteristics of a [[document-oriented database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gradvs1.mgateway.com/download/extreme1.pdf|title=Extreme Database programming with MUMPS Globals|publisher=Gradvs1.mjgateway.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All variable names which are not prefixed with caret character ("^") are temporary and private. Like global variables, they also have a hierarchical storage model, but are only "locally available" to a single job, thus they are called "locals".  Both "globals" and "locals" can have child nodes (called ''subscripts'' in MUMPS terminology).  Subscripts are not limited to numerals—any [[ASCII]] character or group of characters can be a subscript identifier. While this is not uncommon for modern languages such as Perl or JavaScript, it was a highly unusual feature in the late 1970s. This capability was not universally implemented in MUMPS systems before the 1984 ANSI standard, as only canonically numeric subscripts were required by the standard to be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://71.174.62.16/Demo/AnnoStd?Frame=Main&amp;Page=a202005&amp;Edition=1977 |title=The Annotated M[UMPS&amp;#93; Standards |publisher=71.174.62.16 |date=2011-11-29 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the variable named 'Car' can have
subscripts "Door", "Steering Wheel" and "Engine", each of which can contain a value and have subscripts of their own.  The variable ^Car("Door") could have a nested variable subscript of "Color" for example. Thus, you could say

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
SET ^Car("Door","Color")="BLUE"
&lt;/source&gt;

to modify a nested child node of ^Car.  In MUMPS terms, "Color" is the 2nd subscript of the variable ^Car (both the names of the child-nodes and the child-nodes themselves are likewise called subscripts).  Hierarchical variables are similar to objects with properties in many [[Object-oriented programming|object oriented]] languages.  Additionally, the MUMPS language design requires that all subscripts of variables are automatically kept in sorted order.  Numeric subscripts (including floating-point numbers) are stored from lowest to highest.  All non-numeric subscripts are stored in alphabetical order following the numbers.  In MUMPS terminology, this is ''canonical order''.  By using only non-negative integer subscripts, the MUMPS programmer can emulate the [[Array data type|arrays]] data type from other languages.  Although MUMPS does not natively offer a full set of [[Database Management System|DBMS]] features such as mandatory schemas, several DBMS systems have been built on top of it that provide
application developers with flat-file, relational and network database features.

Additionally, there are built-in operators which treat a delimited string (e.g., [[comma-separated values]]) as an array. Early MUMPS programmers would often store a structure of related information as a delimited string, parsing it after it was read in; this saved disk access time and offered considerable speed advantages on some hardware.

MUMPS has no data types. Numbers can be treated as strings of digits, or strings can be treated as numbers by numeric operators (''coerced'', in MUMPS terminology). Coercion can have some odd side effects, however. For example, when a string is coerced, the parser turns as much of the string (starting from the left) into a number as it can, then discards the rest.  Thus the statement &lt;code&gt;IF 20&lt;"30 DUCKS"&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated as &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; in MUMPS.

Other features of the language are intended to help MUMPS applications interact with each other in a multi-user environment. Database locks, process identifiers, and [[atomicity (database systems)|atomicity]] of database update transactions are all required of standard MUMPS implementations.

In contrast to languages in the C or [[Niklaus Wirth#Programming languages|Wirth]] traditions, some space characters between MUMPS statements are significant. A single space separates a command from its argument, and a space, or newline, separates each argument from the next MUMPS token. Commands which take no arguments (e.g., &lt;code&gt;ELSE&lt;/code&gt;) require two following spaces. The concept is that one space separates the command from the (nonexistent) argument, the next separates the "argument" from the next command. Newlines are also significant; an &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ELSE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FOR&lt;/code&gt; command processes (or skips) everything else till the end-of-line. To make those statements control multiple lines, you must use the &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; command to create a code block.

=="Hello, World!" example==

A simple [[Hello world program]] in MUMPS might be:
	
&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
hello()
  write "Hello, World!",!
  quit
&lt;/source&gt;

and would be run from the MUMPS command line with the command &lt;code&gt;do ^hello&lt;/code&gt;. Since MUMPS allows commands to be strung together on the same line, and since commands can be abbreviated to a single letter, this routine could be made more compact:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
hello() w "Hello, World!",! q
&lt;/source&gt;

The '&lt;code&gt;,!&lt;/code&gt;' after the text generates a newline.

==Summary of key language features==
{{Main|MUMPS syntax}}
ANSI X11.1-1995 gives a complete, formal description of the language; an annotated version of this standard is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://71.174.62.16/Demo/AnnoStd|title=The Annotated M[UMPS] Standards|website=71.174.62.16|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data types''': There is one universal [[datatype]], which is implicitly [[Type conversion|coerced]] to string, integer, or floating-point datatypes as context requires.

'''Booleans''' (called ''truthvalues'' in MUMPS): In IF commands and other syntax that has expressions evaluated as conditions, any string value is evaluated as a numeric value, and if that is a nonzero value, then it is interpreted as True.  &lt;code&gt; a&amp;lt;b &lt;/code&gt; yields 1 if a is less than b, 0 otherwise.

'''Declarations''': None. All variables are dynamically created at the first time a value is assigned.

'''Lines''': are important syntactic entities, unlike their status in languages patterned on C or Pascal. Multiple statements per line are allowed and are common. The scope of any IF, ELSE, and FOR command is "the remainder of current line."

'''Case sensitivity''': Commands and intrinsic functions are case-insensitive. In contrast, variable names and labels are case-sensitive.  There is no special meaning for upper vs. lower-case and few widely followed conventions. The percent sign (%) is legal as first character of variables and labels.

'''Postconditionals''': execution of almost any command can be controlled by following it with a colon and a truthvalue expression. &lt;code&gt;SET:N&lt;10 A="FOO"&lt;/code&gt;  sets A to "FOO" if N is less than 10; &lt;code&gt;DO:N&gt;100 PRINTERR,&lt;/code&gt; performs PRINTERR if N is greater than 100. This construct provides a conditional whose scope is less than a full line.

'''Abbreviation''': You can abbreviate nearly all commands and native functions to one, two, or three characters.

'''Reserved words''': None.  Since MUMPS interprets source code by context, there is no need for reserved words. You may use the names of language commands as variables. There has been no contest such as the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] for MUMPS, despite the potential of examples such as the following, perfectly legal, MUMPS code:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
GREPTHIS()
       NEW SET,NEW,THEN,IF,KILL,QUIT SET IF="KILL",SET="11",KILL="l1",QUIT="RETURN",THEN="KILL"
       IF IF=THEN DO THEN
       QUIT:$QUIT QUIT QUIT ; (quit)
THEN  IF IF,SET&amp;KILL SET SET=SET+KILL QUIT
&lt;/source&gt;

MUMPS can be made more obfuscated by using the contracted operator syntax, as shown in this terse example derived from the example above:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
GREPTHIS()
       N S,N,T,I,K,Q S I="K",S="11",K="l1",Q="R",T="K"
       I I=T D T
       Q:$Q Q Q
T  I I,S&amp;K S S=S+K Q
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Arrays''': are created dynamically, stored as [[B-trees]], are sparse (i.e. use almost no space for missing nodes), can use any number of subscripts, and subscripts can be strings or numeric (including floating point). Arrays are always automatically stored in sorted order, so there is never any occasion to sort, pack, reorder, or otherwise reorganize the database. Built in functions such as $DATA, $ORDER, $NEXT(deprecated) and $QUERY functions provide efficient examination and traversal of the fundamental array structure, on disk or in memory.

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
for i=10000:1:12345 set sqtable(i)=i*i
set address("Smith","Daniel")="dpbsmith@world.std.com"
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Local arrays''': variable names not beginning with caret (i.e. "^") are stored in memory by process, are private to the creating process, and expire when the creating process terminates. The available storage depends on implementation. For those implementations using partitions, it is limited to the partition size, (A small partition might be 32K). For other implementations, it may be several megabytes.

'''Global arrays''': &lt;code&gt;^abc, ^def&lt;/code&gt;. These are stored on disk, are available to all processes, and are persistent when the creating process terminates. Very large globals (for example, hundreds of gigabytes) are practical and efficient in most implementations. This is MUMPS' main "database" mechanism. It is used instead of calling on the operating system to create, write, and read files.

'''Indirection''': in many contexts, &lt;code&gt;@VBL&lt;/code&gt; can be used, and effectively substitutes the contents of VBL into another MUMPS statement. &lt;code&gt;SET XYZ="ABC" SET @XYZ=123&lt;/code&gt; sets the variable ABC to 123. &lt;code&gt;SET SUBROU="REPORT" DO @SUBROU&lt;/code&gt; performs the subroutine named REPORT. This substitution allows for [[lazy evaluation]] and late binding as well as effectively the operational equivalent of "pointers" in other languages.

'''Piece function''': This breaks variables into segmented pieces guided by a user specified separator string (sometimes called a "delimiter"). Those who know [[awk]] will find this familiar. &lt;code&gt;$PIECE(STRINGVAR,"^",3)&lt;/code&gt; means the "third caret-separated piece of STRINGVAR." The piece function can also appear as an assignment (SET command) target.

&lt;code&gt;$PIECE("world.std.com",".",2)&lt;/code&gt; yields "std".

After
&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
SET X="dpbsmith@world.std.com"
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;SET $P(X,"@",1)="office"&lt;/code&gt; causes X to become "office@world.std.com" (note that $P is equivalent to $PIECE and could be written as such).

'''Order function''': This function treats its input as a structure, and finds the next index that exists which has the same structure except for the last subscript. It returns the sorted value that is ordered after the one given as input. (This treats the array reference as a content-addressable data rather than an address of a value)

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
Set stuff(6)="xyz",stuff(10)=26,stuff(15)=""
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(""))&lt;/code&gt; yields 6, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(6))&lt;/code&gt; yields 10, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(8))&lt;/code&gt; yields 10, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(10))&lt;/code&gt; yields 15, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(15))&lt;/code&gt; yields "".

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
Set i="" For  Set i=$O(stuff(i)) Quit:i=""  Write !,i,10,stuff(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the argument-less ''For'' repeats until stopped by a terminating ''Quit''.  This line prints a table of i and stuff(i) where i is successively 6, 10, and 15.

For iterating the database, the Order function returns the next key to use.

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
GTM&gt;S n=""
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n=" building"
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n=" name:gd"
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n="%kml:guid"
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Multi-User/Multi-Tasking/Multi-Processor''': MUMPS supports multiple simultaneous users and processes even when the underlying operating system does not (e.g., MS-DOS).  Additionally, there is the ability to specify an environment for a variable, such as by specifying a machine name in a variable (as in &lt;code&gt;SET ^|"DENVER"|A(1000)="Foo"&lt;/code&gt;), which can allow you to access data on remote machines.

==Criticism==
Some aspects of MUMPS syntax differ strongly from that of more modern languages, which can cause confusion. Whitespace is not allowed within expressions, as it ends a statement: &lt;code&gt;2 + 3&lt;/code&gt; is an error, and must be written &lt;code&gt;2+3&lt;/code&gt;. All operators have the same precedence and are [[Operator associativity|left-associative]] (&lt;code&gt;2+3*10&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to 50). The operators for "less than or equal to" and "greater than or equal to" are &lt;code&gt;'&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'&lt;&lt;/code&gt; (that is, the boolean negation operator &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; plus a strict comparison operator).

MUMPS lacks a while statement; a GOTO statement can be used to simulate one. By default, the IF, ELSE, and FOR statements use the rest of the line as their block. The DO statement allows one of them to span multiple lines; periods (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) are used to indent the lines in a DO block. The ELSE statement does not need a corresponding IF, as it operates by inspecting the value in the builtin system variable &lt;code&gt;$test&lt;/code&gt;.

MUMPS [[Scope (computer science)|scoping]] rules are more permissive than other modern languages. Declared local variables are scoped using the stack. A routine can normally see all declared locals of the routines below it on the call stack, and routines cannot prevent routines they call from modifying their declared locals. By contrast, undeclared variables (variables created by using them, rather than declaration) are in scope for all routines running in the same process, and remain in scope until the program exits.

=="MUMPS" vs. "M" naming debate==
{{Cite-section|date=October 2018}}
All of the following positions can be, and have been, supported by knowledgeable people at various times:
*The language's name became M in 1993 when the M Technology Association adopted it.
*The name became M on December 8, 1995, with the approval of ANSI X11.1-1995
*Both M ''and'' MUMPS are officially accepted names.
*M is only an "alternative name" or "nickname" for the language, and MUMPS is still the official name.

Some of the contention arose in response to strong M advocacy on the part of one commercial interest, InterSystems, whose chief executive disliked the name MUMPS and felt that it represented a serious marketing obstacle. Thus, favoring M to some extent became identified as alignment with InterSystems. The dispute also reflected rivalry between organizations (the M Technology Association, the MUMPS Development Committee, the ANSI and ISO Standards Committees) as to who determines the "official" name of the language. Some writers have attempted to defuse the issue by referring to the language as ''M[UMPS]'', square brackets being the customary notation for optional syntax elements. A leading authority, and the author of an open source MUMPS implementation, Professor Kevin O'Kane, uses only 'MUMPS'.

The most recent standard (ISO/IEC 11756:1999, re-affirmed on 25 June 2010), still mentions both M and MUMPS as officially accepted names.

=== Trademark status ===
[[Massachusetts General Hospital]] registered "MUMPS" as a trademark with the USPTO on November 28, 1971, and renewed it on November 16, 1992 - but let it expired on August 30, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=72382020&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch|title=Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval|website=tsdr.uspto.gov|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to Pick==
MUMPS invites comparison with the [[Pick operating system]].&lt;ref&gt;A 1980's "shootout" had Pick "still going after 30" minutes whereas MUMPS had 
finished sort 100,000 "in less than a minute."{{cite web
|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/hardhats-members@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04639.html |title=BIG NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities include:

* Both systems are built on the efficient implementation of large, sparse, string-indexed arrays;
* Both historically commingled the language and the OS;
* Both have a similar domain of applicability.

'''Mental health inequality''' refers to the differences in quality of [[mental health]] and mental health care for different identities and populations. Mental health can be defined as well-being and/or the absence of clinically defined [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2003) Investing in mental health. Geneva, World Health Organization (&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/investing_mnh.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; ).&lt;/ref&gt; There are social economic factors that influence individuals or groups of people of a certain demographic. This can be a factor to mental health care access. Inequalities may include presence of mental health, access to mental health care, quality of mental health care, and mental health outcomes between populations with different [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], sex, [[gender]], [[socioeconomic status]]es, education level, and geographic location.

== Predictors ==

=== Socioeconomic status disparities ===
Social determinants of health are factors such as economic status, education level, demographics, where you live and genetics that can influence one's health. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/hsnsw/Publications/classifications-project.pdf|title=Public Health Determinants of health|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to experiences certain populations are much more susceptible to mental disorders or illnesses. Traumatic experiences can develop by the lack of resources of the determinants of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1797101|title=Are the brown and Harris vulnerable factors for depression ?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not having employment or being from a certain area where those resources are limited trigger some of the most common mental disorders. ( Depression, anxiety, bipolar, psychological stress)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-types-illness#1|title=Types of Mental Illness|work=WebMD|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health within itself leads to the inequality among the social determinants of health. The economic level of one's life is a factor to their life expectancy and mental health. For example lung cancer is by far the most preventable disease yet the rates of consumption of tobacco just increase. Ironically the consumers are those with mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e557702010-001|title=Mental Health of Children and Young People in Great Britain, 2004|last=Green|first=Hazel|last2=McGinnity|first2=Ainee|date=2005|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2018-10-14|last3=Meltzer|first3=Howard|last4=Ford|first4=Tamsin|last5=Goodman|first5=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education disparities ===
While education and mental health seem mutually exclusive, there is a significant parallel between the inequities. Educational disparities can be defined as unjust or unfair differences in educational outcomes that can be a result of difference in treatment of certain minority groups in schools, varying socioeconomic statuses, and varying educational needs.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2012|title=Ethnic and Racial Disparities in Education: Psychology's Contributions to Understanding and Reducing Disparities|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/resources/racial-disparities.pdf|journal=American Psychological Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These disparities in education can ultimately lead to issues of mental health. When this happens, less privileged groups get looped into the cascading effects of inequality.

The disparities that arise in education do not happen by chance. There are definitely predictors that factor into these inequalities. Some common ones are socioeconomic status, immigrant status, and ethnic/racial status.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Socioeconomic status plays a large role in the difference in access to educational resources. School districts are split geographically. Because the current funding for public schools comes from local property taxes, there is more incentive for high-status individuals to narrow the boundaries to not include lower income families from their school districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thenotebook.org/articles/2016/08/23/study-examines-how-school-district-borders-exacerbate-school-segregation|title=Study examines how district boundaries exacerbate school segregation|website=thenotebook.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each school district is then only encompassing one socioeconomic group, the programs and quality are affected. This is where we begin to see the dramatic differences between school districts. While some schools offer amazing guidance departments, advanced classes, and phenomenal facilities, other areas struggle to find qualified and motivated teachers to teach basic classes. Although public education is something that is supposed to be a right for all, an individual's socioeconomic status can greatly affect the quality of that education.

An individual's immigration status also affects the quality of education received. While there are some immigrant groups which do well after immigrating to the United States, many do not have the same level of success. There are many barriers that prevent the academic success of immigrant children. These barriers include but are not limited to the fact that most parents of immigrant children do not understand the United States educational system, inadequate English as a Second Language programs, and segregation. There are also differences in outcomes across immigrant generation, with first-generation immigrants performing better than subsequent generations. This is termed the [[immigrant paradox]]. These issues along with the psychological effects of [[acculturation]] (e.g., adapting to a whole new country, language, and culture) amplify educational inequality.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Disparities in education are the insufficiency of resources that are included but limited. These disparities usually targets socially excluded communities with low income. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unequal-opportunity-race-and-education/|title=Unequal Opportunity: Race and Education|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics are used when measuring grades, GPA, test scores, and dropout rates to determine the success of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/003465430303947|title=Race, School &amp;. Achievement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparities as such affect somones mental health by creating a system in which a person could never succeed.

=== Spatial disparities (geographic location) ===
Further research observes that those minority races living in areas of low-poverty have more and easier access to mental health services than those in high-poverty neighborhoods. There is a pattern of people in high-poverty areas being unable escape this cycle. Due to these conditions, inequality remains and they are unable to gain access to mental health care which can be very beneficial to those who may be suffering from stress due to lack of resources and money.

Many minorities including African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans inhabit these poverty filled neighborhoods due to factors being not in their favor in certain aspects of society. These neighborhoods lack resources such as offices with psychiatrists or health clinics with good doctors who are trained to help those in need of mental health care. It would also be beneficial to make specific services just for those in high-poverty neighborhoods who lack the resources so we can encourage those in need to get the help that they deserve. With adjustments made to meet these circumstances, the spatial disparities can be lowered and allow those who need the help to get it.

=== Ethnic and racial disparities ===
There is inequality in mental health care access for different races and ethnicities. It is known through much research that even poor minorities have less access to mental health care than poor non-Latino whites.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alegría|first=Margarita|last2=Canino|first2=Glorisa|last3=Ríos|first3=Ruth|last4=Vera|first4=Mildred|last5=Calderón|first5=José|last6=Rusch|first6=Dana|last7=Ortega|first7=Alexander N.|date=2002-12-01|title=Mental Health Care for Latinos: Inequalities in Use of Specialty Mental Health Services Among Latinos, African Americans, and Non-Latino Whites|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ps.53.12.1547|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=53|issue=12|pages=1547–1555|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.53.12.1547|issn=1075-2730}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is also known that blacks have even less of a chance to access to mental health services and care than those who are white.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Many of these minorities may confront an issue directly resulting in the search for mental health care support, yet they don't have the same access as other people.

After surveying people of different races over years we observe that African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans gain less access to the same type of mental services that non-minority whites get access to.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chow|first=Julian Chun-Chung|last2=Jaffee|first2=Kim|last3=Snowden|first3=Lonnie|date=2017-04-07|year=|title=Racial/Ethnic Disparities in the Use of Mental Health Services in Poverty Areas|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=5|pages=792–797|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1447841|pmid=12721146|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this research there was a piece that stated:

"This theory postulates that Whites have a greater propensity to avoid living in poverty communities because they are more likely to enjoy social and economic advantages. Only seriously mentally ill Whites suffer from steep downward mobility and come to reside in high-poverty neighborhoods"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; (Julian Chun-Chung Chow, Kim Jaffee, and Lonnie Snowden).

This has been a problem for minority races that need the same services. It is an issue because African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans need the services more in certain areas due to how biologically certain minority races are more likely to be diagnosed with a mental illness than whites.

=== LGBTQ disparities and predictors ===
{{See also|LGBTQ psychology}}
Sexuality plays a large role in the prediction of mental illnesses and overall mental health. Those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer have a higher risk of having mental health issues, most likely as a result of the continued discrimination and victimization they receive at the hands of others. Members of this population are confronted with derogatory and hateful comments, whether through face-to-face communication or through [[social media]], which affects their self-worth and confidence, leading to anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts, and suicide. These mental health effects are most commonly seen among adolescents, however, they are also prevalent among adults of all ages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=U-M Weblogin|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00246.x/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00246.x | volume=23|journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nursing|pages=205–213 | last1 = Ryan | first1 = Caitlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mustanski|first=Brian S.|last2=Garofalo|first2=Robert|last3=Emerson|first3=Erin M.|title=Mental Health Disorders, Psychological Distress, and Suicidality in a Diverse Sample of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youths|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2009.178319|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=100|issue=12|pages=2426–2432|doi=10.2105/ajph.2009.178319|pmc=2978194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of discrimination and victimization that the [[LGBTQ]] population suffers from can be both external and internal. While parts of society today are not accepting of the LGBTQ community and make public statements to advertise their discontent, an identifying LGBTQ can also have low confidence and a lack of self-worth that furthers these negative mental health effects.

The most notable predictor of mental health illnesses among the LGBTQ population is family acceptance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Those of the LGBTQ population who receive little or no family support and acceptance are three times more likely to have thoughts of suicide than those who do have a strong family support system behind them. Oftentimes, the lack of familial support is more conducive of detrimental behaviors, such as drug and illegal substance abuse, which can cause further harm to the individual. Multiple aspects of lifestyles, including religion, can affect family support. Those who have strong family ties to religion may be less likely to seek support and help from family members due to fear of a lack of acceptance within the family, as well as within the religious community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Sex and gender disparities and predictors ===
While [[Mental disorders and gender|gender differences among those with mental health disorders]] are an underdeveloped field of study, there are gender specific aspects to life that cause disparities. Gender is often a determinant of the amount of power one has over factors in their life, such as socioeconomic status and social position, and the stressors that go along with these factors. The location of genders and sex within the social construct can be a great determinant of risks and predictors of mental health disorders. These disparities in gender can correlate to the disparities in the types of mental health disorders that individuals have. While all genders and sexes are at risk of a large variety of mental health illnesses, some illnesses and disorders are more common among one sex than another. Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with forms of depression, whereas men are three times more likely to be given a diagnosis of a social anxiety disorder than women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/genderwomen/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Gender and women's mental health|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex can also be a determinant of other aspects of mental health as well. The time of onset of symptoms can be different dependent on one's sex. Women are more likely to show signs of mental illnesses, such as depression, earlier and at a younger age than men. Many believe this to be a correlation with the onset time of puberty. As a result of social stigmatisms and stereotypes within society, women are also more likely to be prescribed mood-altering medications, whereas men are more likely to be prescribed medications for addictions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Further research on the mental health disparities among sex and gender is needed in order to gain a deeper knowledge of the predictors of mental health and the possible differences in treatments.

== Disparities in success to mental health care ==
Over the past decade, many of the disparities regarding mental health stem from differences in racial/ethnic groups. Mental illness is one of the highest health burdens for minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Benjamin Lê|last2=Trinh|first2=Nhi-Ha|last3=Li|first3=Zhihui|last4=Hou|first4=Sherry Shu-Yeu|last5=Progovac|first5=Ana M.|title=Trends in Racial-Ethnic Disparities in Access to Mental Health Care, 2004–2012|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ps.201500453|journal=Psychiatric Services|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=9–16|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.201500453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many minority groups, certain mental illnesses are under and over diagnosed. For example, schizophrenia is over diagnosed in African Americans while mood disorders, depression, and anxiety are under diagnosed.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This is due to a variety of reasons. The recognition of mental illness is often thought of in conjunction with stereotypes regarding African Americans. Those who present symptoms exhibiting depression and mood swings may be mistaken as stereotypically violent.

While the diagnosis of these minority groups is vastly different, the care they receive also varies between whites and minority groups. This is not only due to external factors and facilities but also the way in which these minority groups choose to proceed with treatment. African Americans generally do receive care from lower quality facilities, but they are also more likely than whites to terminate treatment prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGuire|first=Thomas G.|last2=Miranda|first2=Jeanne|date=2008-01-01|year=|title=Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health Care: Evidence and Policy Implications|journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope)|volume=27|issue=2|pages=393–403|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.27.2.393|issn=0278-2715|pmc=3928067|pmid=18332495|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, health care plans are also a major contributor to the inequities in mental health care access. Provider discrimination involves health care providers unfairly using stereotypes to decide how to distribute diagnoses. Physicians often rely on common stereotypes of individuals in deciding treatment, which ultimately leads to minority groups not getting the specialized treatment required to diagnose and treat mental illness.

== Disparities in quality of mental health care ==
There is a growing unmet need for mental health services and equity in the quality of these services. While these services often advertise themselves as being a support system and caregiver for any and all who need treatment or support, oftentimes certain aspects of an individual's life, such as race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, will determine the type of care that they are given.

Due to a growing level of socioeconomic inequality among races, African Americans are less likely to have access to mental health care and are more likely to have lesser quality care when they do find it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Benjamin L.|last2=McGuire|first2=Thomas|last3=Miranda|first3=Jeanne|date=2007-12-01|title=Measuring Trends in Mental Health Care Disparities, 2000–2004|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ps.2007.58.12.1533|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=58|issue=12|pages=1533–1540|doi=10.1176/ps.2007.58.12.1533|issn=1075-2730}}&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans and Hispanics are more likely to be uninsured or have [[Medicaid]], limiting the amount and type of access that they have mental health outpatient sources. In one study, of all those who received mental health care, minority populations reported a higher degree of unmet needs and dissatisfaction with the services they were given (12.5% of whites, 25.4% of African Americans, and 22.6% of Hispanics reported poor care).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Kenneth|last2=Klap|first2=Ruth|last3=Koike|first3=Alan|last4=Sherbourne|first4=Cathy|date=2001-12-01|title=Ethnic Disparities in Unmet Need for Alcoholism, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Care|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.158.12.2027|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=158|issue=12|pages=2027–2032|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.12.2027|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LGBTQ population, while still open to the same disparities as racial minority groups, is often confronted with the problem of being denied mental health treatment because of the gender they identify as or their sexual orientation. In a study conducted by The National Center for Transgender Equality and the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]], 19% of the LGBTQ sample reported being denied the healthcare they needed. In addition, 28% of the sample reported being harassed or even physically assaulted during the health visit.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nursingstudentsforsexualandreproductivehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tab-6-Supplements-Web.pdf|title=National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on health and health care|last=|first=|date=National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While denial of treatment and harassment during treatment are large causes of the disparities among mental health care quality, the lack of knowledge is also of concern among the LGBTQ population. As it is such a newly developing field of study, there is very little knowledge or research conducted that relate specifically to LGBTQ health and healthcare. Because of this, about 50% of the LGBTQ population report having to teach aspects of their health and treatment to the health care providers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Suggestions on how to achieve better mental health equality ==
Because mental health inequality is largely due to disparities in health insurance, ways to improve mental health equity must come from changes in healthcare policies. While much of mental health disparities comes from improving access to healthcare for the underprivileged. The biggest reason why people are not obtaining mental health care is because they cannot afford it. Also, changing the content of healthcare literature to include mental health is equally important. The United States has made massive strides to break down the stigmas surrounding mental health. Given that, mental health is still not considered to be a main part of basic health care plans. In order for individuals to receive the treatment necessary for mental illness, it must be acknowledged as an illness.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/707963#vp_2|title=Disparities in Access to Mental Health Services by African Americans: An Expert Interview With Annelle B.

The '''National Institute for Health and Care Excellence''' ('''NICE''') is an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] in the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name="Committee2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Health Committee|title=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence: Eighth Report of Session 2012-13, Vol. 1: Report, |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3d-bsIthzCYC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2013|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-05239-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes guidelines in four areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/about|title=About|work=nice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* the use of [[Health technology|health technologies]] within the NHS (such as the use of new and existing medicines, treatments and procedures)
* clinical practice (guidance on the appropriate treatment and care of people with specific diseases and conditions)
* guidance for public sector workers on [[health promotion]] and ill-health avoidance
* guidance for social care services and users.

These appraisals are based primarily on evaluations of efficacy and cost-effectiveness in various circumstances.

It serves both the [[National Health Service (England)|English NHS]] and the [[Welsh NHS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | title = The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Establishment and Constitution) Order 1999 | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1999/uksi_19990220_en.pdf |format=PDF| date = 1999-02-02 | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was set up as the '''National Institute for Clinical Excellence''' in 1999, and on 1 April 2005 joined with the '''Health Development Agency''' to become the new '''National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence''' (still abbreviated as NICE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | title = The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Establishment and Constitution) Amendment Order 2005 | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20050497.htm | date = 2005-03-07 | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | title = The Special Health Authorities Abolition Order 2005 | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20050502.htm | date = 2005-03-07 | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]], NICE was renamed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on 1 April 2013 reflecting its new responsibilities for social care, and changed from a [[NHS special health authority|special health authority]] to an Executive Non-Departmental Public Body (ENDPB).

NICE was established in an attempt to end the so-called [[postcode lottery]] of healthcare in England and Wales, where treatments that were available depended upon the NHS Health Authority area in which the patient happened to live, but it has since acquired a high reputation internationally as a role model for the development of clinical guidelines. One aspect of this is the explicit determination of cost–benefit boundaries for certain technologies that it assesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Health Technology Assessments by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence | url = https://www.springer.com/public+health/book/978-0-387-71995-5 | last = Schlander | first = Michael | ISBN = 978-0-387-71995-5 | year = 2007 | page = 245 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]] | location = New York | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; NICE also plays an important role in pioneering technology assessment in other healthcare systems through NICE International, established in May 2008 to help cultivate links with foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/nice-international|title = NICE International: what we do|date = |accessdate = 8 Oct 2014|website = nice.org.uk|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5be67610-9ce2-11de-ab58-00144feabdc0,s01=1.html?nclick_check=1 | title = Nice approach | date = 2009-09-15 | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | last = Cheng| first = Tsung-Mei| publisher = [[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of an Institute to determine the clinical effectiveness of interventions first emerged at the end of [[John Major]]'s Conservative Government as moves elsewhere{{where|date=July 2013}} were being made to set professionally agreed standards for clinical care. In 1996, the [[UK National Screening Committee]] (NSC) had been established by [[Kenneth Calman|Sir Kenneth Calman]] and [[Muir Gray]] (now Sir Muir Gray) by the Policy Team led by Dr Tim Riley and latterly Sir Charles Nightingale for the Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screening.nhs.uk/history|title=History of the UK NSC|work=screening.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSC aimed to ensure that evidence-based medicine informed policy making on what national screening programmes were approved for funding and what quality assurance mechanisms should be in place. This was a timely action as concerns over screening quality had emerged in breast cancer screening services came under question at Exeter in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Hansard|date= November 1997| url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1997/nov/03/breast-cancer-screening|title=Breast Cancer Screening}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed in the wake of the 1995 [[Calman-Hine report|Calman-Hine Report]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4071083 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103025308/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4071083 |date=January 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of what was originally termed a National Institute for Clinical Excellence took root when Labour came to power having in 1997. [[Frank Dobson]] became Secretary of State and was supported by a team of Ministers keen on introducing clinical and health outcome measures to achieve improvements in the quality and delivery of care. The team included [[Alan Milburn]], [[Margaret Jay, Baroness Jay of Paddington|Baroness Margaret Jay]], and [[Tessa Jowell]]. The name and mission was agreed in a meeting between the Ministerial team, Dr Tim Riley and Dr Felicity Harvey shortly after the election and it was agreed that NICE should be described in the first policy [[white paper]], The New NHS: Modern, Dependable 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The New NHS: Modern, Dependable | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/Browsable/DH_4936272 | publisher = Department of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riley led the team that developed the policy for NICE and which managed the legislation through Parliament in addition to formalising the new institute as a [[NHS special health authority|Special Health Authority]]. Riley joined [[Michael Rawlins|Sir Michael Rawlins]] (the then recently appointed Chair of NICE) at the [[Health Select Committee]] in February 1999 where questions were raised as to whether NICE was just a means to "ration" healthcare. Sir Michael Rawlins presented a compelling case that positioned NICE as a standards setting body first and foremost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmhealth/222/9020406.htm|title=House of Commons - Health - Minutes of Evidence|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, the reality was that although NICE was principally aimed at aligning professional standards through clinical guidelines and audit, the acceptability of drugs, devices and technological interventions in defining those standards, could not be ignored and so the concept of a "fourth hurdle" for drugs accessing the NHS market was invoked. This controversial policy shift meant that NICE was critical for decisions on drug reimbursement. Indeed, the first drug appraisal by NICE was on the drug [[Relenza]] which was turned down amidst criticisms from [[Glaxo Wellcome|Glaxo-Wellcome]] that the appraisal had been fast tracked.&lt;ref&gt;NICE put on defensive as ruling on Relenza ends in row over 'leaks' [[Health Service Journal]], 7 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this policy development whereby the criteria for decision making, the role of costs, and the degree to which decisions of NICE and the secretary of state would be binding on clinicians was analysed by [[Andrew Dillon]], Trevor Gibbs, Tim Riley, and [[Trevor Sheldon|Trevor A. Sheldon]].&lt;ref&gt;Milbank Quarterly, September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology appraisals==
Since January 2005, the NHS in [[NHS England|England]] and [[NHS Wales|Wales]] has been legally obliged to provide funding for medicines and treatments recommended by NICE's technology appraisal board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE): How does it work and what are the implications for the U.S.? | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/8737637/National-Institute-for-Health-and-Clinical-Excellence-NICE-How-Does-it-Work-and-What-are-the-Implications-for-the-US-Executive-Summary | accessdate = 2009-09-18 |author1=Sorenson, C |author2=Drummond, M |author3=Kanavos, P |author4=McGuire, A | publisher = [[National Pharmaceutical Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was at least in part as a result of well-publicised postcode lottery anomalies in which certain less-common treatments were funded in some parts of the UK but not in others due to local decision making in the NHS.

Before an appraisal, the Advisory Committee on Topic Selection (ACTS) draws up a list of potential topics of clinical significance for appraisal. The [[Secretary of State for Health]] or the [[Welsh Assembly]] must then refer any technology so that the appraisal process can be formally initiated. Once this has been done NICE works with the Department of Health to draw up the scope of the appraisal.

NICE then invites consultee and commentator organisations to take part in the appraisal. A consultee organisation would include patient groups, organisations representing health care professionals and the manufacturers of the product undergoing appraisal. Consultees submit evidence during the appraisal and comment on the appraisal documents. Commentator organisations include the manufacturers of products to which the product undergoing appraisal is being compared. They comment on the documents that have been submitted and drawn up but do not actually submit information themselves.

An independent academic centre then draws together and analyses all of the published information on the technology under appraisal and prepares an assessment report. This can be commented on by the Consultees and Commentators. Comments are then taken into account and changes made to the assessment report to produce an evaluation report. An independent Appraisal Committee then looks at the evaluation report, hears spoken testimony from clinical experts, patient groups and carers. They take their testimony into account and draw up a document known as the 'appraisal consultation document'. This is sent to all consultees and commentators who are then able to make further comments. Once these comments have been taken into account the final document is drawn up called the 'final appraisal determination'. This is submitted to NICE for approval.

The process aims to be fully independent of government and lobbying power, basing decisions fully on clinical and cost-effectiveness. There have been concerns that [[lobbying]] by pharmaceutical companies to mobilise media attention and influence public opinion are attempts to influence the decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5063352.stm | title = Herceptin: Was patient power key? | date = 2006-06-09 | accessdate = 2008-11-13 | last = Berg | first = Sanchia | publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fast-track assessment system has been introduced to reach decisions where there is most pressure for a conclusion.

==Clinical guidelines==

NICE carries out assessments of the most appropriate treatment regimes for different diseases. This must take into account both desired medical outcomes (i.e. the best possible result for the patient) and also economic arguments regarding differing treatments.

NICE has set up several National Collaborating Centres bringing together expertise from the royal medical colleges, professional bodies and patient/carer organisations which draw up the guidelines. The centres are the [[National Collaborating Centre for Cancer]], the [[National Clinical Guideline Centre]], the [[National Collaborating Centre for Women and Children´s Health]], and the [[National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/aboutnice/howwework/developingniceclinicalguidelines/nationalcollaboratingcentres/national_collaborating_centres.jsp%7ctitle=About%7cwork=nice.org.uk%7ctitle=About%7cwork=nice.org.uk%7ctitle=About%7cwork=nice.org.uk|title=About|work=nice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Collaborating Centre appoints a Guideline Development Group whose job it is to work on the development of the clinical guideline. This group consists of medical professionals, representatives of patient and carer groups and technical experts. They work together to assess the evidence for the guideline topic (e.g. [[clinical trial]]s of competing products) before preparing a draft guideline. There are then two consultation periods in which stakeholder organisations are able to comment on the draft guideline. After the second consultation period, an independent Guideline Review Panel reviews the guideline and stakeholder comments and ensures that these comments have been taken into account. The Guideline Development Group then finalises the recommendations and the National Collaboration Centre produces the final guideline. This is submitted to NICE to formally approve the guideline and issue the guidance to the NHS.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} To date NICE has produced more than 200 different guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/published?type=guidelines|title = Guidance List|date = |accessdate = 8 October 2014|website = nice.org.uk|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 [[Andy Burnham]] said that a Labour government could reduce variation in access to drugs and procedures by making it mandatory for commissioners to follow NICE clinical guidelines. "We need to look at how you strengthen NICE. Where they have said something is effective and affordable, on what basis does a local commissioner withhold that from somebody? I’m not comfortable with that. I don’t support that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Labour could make NICE guidance mandatory|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-labour-could-make-nice-guidance-mandatory/5076286.article#.VHNoSfmsUk4|accessdate=24 November 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NICE has a service called Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS) which provides primary care practitioners with a readily accessible summary of the current evidence base and practical guidance.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Smith|title=Guide to the Primary Care Guidelines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzfPI3h4U-AC&amp;pg=PR6|year=2008|publisher=Radcliffe Publishing|isbn=978-1-85775-734-7|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReesSmith2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Judith A Rees|author2=Ian Smith|author3=Jennie Watson|title=Pharmaceutical Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMGdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|year=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences UK|isbn=978-0-7020-5282-8|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social care guidance==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}

Under the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012|Health and Social Care Act]] 2012, NICE was given responsibility for developing guidance and quality standards for [[social care]], using an evidence-based model. This is being delivered by the NICE Collaborating Centre for Social Care (NCCSC), which is hosted by the [[Social Care Institute for Excellence]] (SCIE) and 4 partner organisations - Research in Practice, Research in Practice for Adults, [[Personal Social Services Research Unit]] and the [[EPPI-Centre]].

NICE receives referrals for social care guidance from the Department of Health and the [[Department for Education]], and commission the guidance from the NCCSC. NICE, along with the NCCSC, carries out a scoping exercise with a scoping group and with input from key stakeholders, at both a workshop and a public consultation, to ensure the guidance to be produced is focused and achievable. A [[Chairman|chairperson]] and members of the Guidance Development Group are appointed, and pose review questions which will enable systematic evidence reviews to take place, thus delivering the guidance and subsequent recommendations. Service user and carer involvement takes place throughout, as well as public consultation on the draft guidance.

The Guidance Development Group then finalises the recommendations and the NCCSC produces the final guideline. This is submitted to NICE for formal approval and publication. The entire process from pre-scoping to publication takes approximately 24 months. The guidance is then available to NICE standing committees to develop a quality standard on the topic. The quality standard is developed using the guidance and other accredited sources, to produce high-level concise statements that can be used for quality improvement by social care providers and commissioners, as well as setting out what service users and carers can expect of high quality social care services.

The NCCSC is unique within NICE, in that it is the only collaborating centre to have responsibility for the adoption and dissemination support for guidance and quality standards in the [[Social work|social care arena]]. Drawing on the expertise of SCIE and their partners within the sector, each of the guidance products and quality standards have a needs assessment carried out to determine the requirements for tools to help embed the guidance and quality standards within the sector. These can include tailored versions of guidance for specific audiences, costing and commissioning tools and even training and learning packages.

As of August 2013, NICE and the NCCSC had scheduled guidance delivery for five topics: [[Home care|domiciliary care]], older adults with long-term conditions, transition between health and social care settings, transition from children's to adults' services and child abuse and neglect.

==Cost–effectiveness==

As with any system financing health care, the NHS has a limited budget and a vast number of potential spending options. Choices must be made as to how this limited budget is spent. [[Economic evaluation]]s are carried out within a [[health technology assessment]] framework to compare the cost-effectiveness of alternative activities and to consider the [[opportunity cost]] associated with their decisions.&lt;ref name="Health Care Programmes 2005"&gt;Methods for the Economic Evaluation of Health Care Programmes, Drummond et al (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; By choosing to spend the finite NHS budget upon those treatment options that provide the most efficient results, society can ensure it does not lose out on possible health gains through spending on inefficient treatments and neglecting those that are more efficient.

NICE attempts to assess the cost–effectiveness of potential expenditures within the NHS to assess whether or not they represent 'better value' for money than treatments that would be neglected if the expenditure took place. It assesses the cost–effectiveness of new treatments by analysing the cost and benefit of the proposed treatment relative to the next best treatment that is currently in use.&lt;ref&gt;NICE guidance, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality-adjusted life years===

NICE guidance supports the use of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALY) as the primary outcome for quantifying the expected health benefits associated with a given treatment regime. By comparing the present value (see [[discounting]]) of expected QALY flows with and without treatment, or relative to another treatment, the net/relative health benefit derived from such a treatment can be derived. When combined with the relative cost of treatment, this information can be used to estimate an [[incremental cost-effectiveness ratio]] (ICER), which is considered in relation to NICE's threshold willingness-to-pay value.&lt;ref name="Health Care Programmes 2005"/&gt;

As a guideline rule, NICE accepts as cost-effective those interventions with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than £20,000 per QALY and that there should be increasingly strong reasons for accepting as cost-effective interventions with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of over a threshold of £30,000 per QALY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/niceMedia/pdf/GuidelinesManualChapter8.pdf |format=PDF |title=NICE Guideline Manual: Incorporating health economics in guidelines and assessing resource impact |website=nice.org.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925050527/http://www.nice.org.uk/niceMedia/pdf/GuidelinesManualChapter8.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, there has been great controversy as to what value this threshold should be set at. Initially, there was no fixed number. But the appraisal teams created a consensus amount of about £30,000. However, in November 2008 [[Alan Johnson]], the then Secretary of State, announced that for end-of-life cancer drugs the threshold could be increased above £30,000. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Johnson lifts NHS ban on top-up treatment | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/04/nhs-health-cancer-topup-treatment |date=4 November 2008| accessdate = 14 September 2014 | last1 = Boseley |first1= S |last2= Sparrow |first2=A | work = [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first drug to go through the new process was [[Lenalidomide]], whose ICER was £43,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Final appraisal determination: Lenalidomide for the treatment of multiple myeloma in people who have received at least one prior therapy |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11937/43868/43868.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-13 |author=Appraisal Committee |publisher=nice.org.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327103851/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11937/43868/43868.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost per quality-adjusted life year gained===

The following example from NICE explains the QALY principle and the application of the cost per QALY calculation.

A patient has a life-threatening condition and is expected to live on average for 1 year receiving the current best treatment which costs the NHS £3,000. A new drug becomes available that will extend the life of the patient by three months and improve his or her quality of life, but the new treatment will cost the NHS more than three times as much at £10,000. Patients score their perceived quality of life on a scale from 0 to 1 with 0 being worst possible health and 1 being best possible health. On the standard treatment, quality of life is rated with a score of 0.4 but it improves to 0.6 with the new treatment. Patients on the new treatment on average live an extra 3 months, so 1.25 years in total. The quality of life gained is the product of ''life span'' and ''quality rating'' with the new treatment less the same calculation for the old treatment, i.e. &lt;span&gt;(1.25 x 0.6)&lt;/span&gt; less &lt;span&gt;(1.0 x 0.4)&lt;/span&gt; = 0.35 QALY. The marginal cost of the new treatment to deliver this extra gain is £7,000 so the cost per quality life year gained is £7000/0.35 or £20,000. This is within the £20,000-£30,000 that is suggested by NICE to be the limit for drugs to be cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp Measuring effectiveness and quality effectiveness - the QALY] National Institute for clinical effectiveness&lt;/ref&gt;

If the patient was expected to live only one month extra and instead of three then NICE would issue a recommendation not to fund. The patient's [[NHS primary care trust|Primary Care Trust]]{{update inline|date=December 2014}} could still decide to fund the new treatment, but if not, the patient would then have two choices. He or she could opt to take the free NHS standard treatment, or he or she may decide to pay out of pocket to obtain the benefit of the new treatment from a different health care provider. If the person has a private health insurance policy the person could check to see whether the private insurance provider will fund the new treatment. About 8% of the population has some private health insurance from an employer or trade association and 2% pay from their own resources.

===Basis of recommendations===

Theoretically, it might be possible to draw up a table of all possible treatments sorted by increasing the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. Those treatments with lowest cost per quality-adjusted life year gained would appear at the top of the table and deliver the most benefit per value spent and would be easiest to justify funding for. Those where the delivered benefit is low and the cost is high would appear at the bottom of the list. Decision makers would, theoretically, work down the table, adopting services that are the most cost effective. The point at which the NHS budget is exhausted would reveal the [[shadow price]], the threshold lying between the CQG gained of the last service that is funded and that of the next most cost effective service that is not funded.

In practice this exercise is not done, but an assumed shadow price has been used by NICE for many years in its assessments to determine which treatments the NHS should and should not fund. NICE states that for drugs the cost per QALY should not normally exceed £30,000 but that there is not a hard threshold,&lt;ref name="Quality Adjusted Life Year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp%7ctitle=News%7cwork=nice.org.uk%7ctitle=News%7cwork=nice.org.uk%7ctitle=News%7cwork=nice.org.uk|title=News|work=nice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; though research has shown that any threshold is "somewhat higher" than being in the range £35,000 - £40,000.&lt;ref name="Quality Adjusted Life Year"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Does NICE have a cost effectiveness threshold and what other factors influence its decisions?

The [[Health Select Committee|House of Commons Health Select Committee]], in its report on NICE, stated in 2008 that "the (...) cost-per-QALY it uses to decide whether a treatment is cost-effective is of serious concern. The threshold it employs is not based on empirical research and is not directly related to the NHS budget, nor is it at the same level as that used by Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in providing treatments not assessed by NICE, which tends to be lower. Some witnesses, including patient organisations and pharmaceutical companies, thought NICE should be more generous in the cost per QALY threshold it uses, and should approve more products. On the other hand, some PCTs struggle to implement NICE guidance at the current threshold and other witnesses argued that a lower level should be used. However, there are many uncertainties about the thresholds used by PCTs." It went on to recommend that "an independent body should determine the threshold used when making judgements of the value of drugs to the NHS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmhealth/27/27.pdf|format=PDF|title=House of Commons Health Committee: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence - First Report of Session 2007-08|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The work that NICE is involved in attracts the attention of many groups, including doctors, the pharmaceutical industry, and patients. NICE is often associated with controversy, because the need to make decisions at a national level can conflict with what is (or is believed to be) in the best interests of an individual patient.

Approved cancer drugs and treatments such as [[radiotherapy]] and [[chemotherapy]] are funded by the NHS without any financial contribution being taken from the patient. Where NICE has approved a treatment, the NHS must fund it. But not all treatments have been assessed by NICE and these treatments are usually dependent on local NHS decision making. In the case of cancer the [[Cancer Drugs Fund]] was set up in 2011 after complaints about NICE decisions on new and expensive cancer drugs with limited benefits.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Treatment for fertility problems are approved but not always funded by [[clinical commissioning group]]s and they may cap the number of rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/fertility-treatment-cost-nhs.html |title=NHS IVF and Fertility Treatment – Funding Options |publisher=Hfea.gov.uk |date=2015-01-06 |accessdate=2015-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127204213/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/fertility-treatment-cost-nhs.html |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NICE has been criticised for being too slow to reach decisions. On one occasion, the [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]] said it was outraged over its delayed decision for further guidance regarding two drugs for [[macular degeneration]] that are already approved for use in the NHS. However the Department of Health said that it had 'made it clear to PCTs that funding for treatments should not be withheld simply because guidance from NICE is unavailable'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | title=Media release (14 June 2007) | url = http://www.rnib.org.uk/aboutus/mediacentre/mediareleases/media2007/Pages/mediarelease14jun2007.aspx | date = 2007-08-08 | accessdate = 2008-11-13 | publisher = [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more controversial NICE decisions have concerned [[donepezil]], [[galantamine]], [[rivastigmine]] (review) and [[memantine]] for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[bevacizumab]], [[sorafenib]], [[sunitinib]] and [[temsirolimus]] for [[renal cell carcinoma]]. All these are drugs with a high cost per treatment and NICE has either rejected or restricted their use in the NHS on the grounds that they are not cost-effective.

A Conservative shadow minister once criticized NICE for spending more on communications than assessments. In its defence, NICE said the majority of its communications budget was spent informing doctors about which drugs had been approved and new guidelines for treatments and that the actual cost of assessing new drugs for the NHS includes money spent on NICE's behalf by the Department of Health. When these were added to NICE's own costs, the total cost of the technology appraisal programme far outstrips the cost of NICE communications.

A report from the [[University of York]] Centre for Health Economics written by [[Karl Claxton]] in February 2015 suggested that the maximum threshold, currently around £30,000 a year, for judging a medicine cost-effective should be more than halved. They found that any intervention costing more than £13,000 per [[Quality-adjusted life year]] risked causing more harm than good by denying cost effective treatment to other patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Expensive drugs cost lives, claims report|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d00c4a02-b784-11e4-981d-00144feab7de.html#axzz3ldCBJUxL|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute's approach to the introduction of new oral therapy for [[Hepatitis C]] has been criticised. [[Sofosbuvir]] was approved in 2015. It costs about £30,000 for 12 weeks treatment. [[NHS England]] established 22 Operational Delivery Networks to roll out delivery and proposes to fund 10,000 courses of treatment in 2016-17. Each has been given a “run rate” of how many patients they are allowed to treat. This is the NHS’ single biggest new treatment investment this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS England rollout of ground-breaking drugs 'changes role of NICE'|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/policy-and-regulation/nhs-england-rollout-of-ground-breaking-drugs-changes-role-of-nice/7003752.article|accessdate=14 May 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the North East London network patients with [[cirrhosis]] or [[fibrosis]] go to the front of the queue and three new patients at the Grahame Hayton Unit at the [[Royal London Hospital]] start treatment each month. Those without such complications may faced considerable delays before they start treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philip Christopher Baldwin: "We need better access to treatment for gay men living with HIV and Hep C"|url=https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/life/36173/philip-baldwin-need-better-access-treatment-gay-men-living-hiv-hep-c/|accessdate=14 May 2016|publisher=Gay Times|date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that millions of child deaths could be prevented every year if the non-specific effects of vaccines were taken into consideration in immunization programs.&lt;ref name=(2)/&gt;]]

'''Non-specific effects of vaccines''' (also called "'''heterologous effects'''" or "'''off-target effects'''") are effects which go beyond the specific protective effects against the targeted diseases. Non-specific effects can be strongly beneficial, increasing protection against non-targeted infections, but also at times negative, increasing susceptibility to non-targeted infections. This depends on both the [[vaccine]] and the sex of the infant.&lt;ref name=Benn13&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benn|first1=CS|last2=Netea|first2=MG|last3=Selin|first3=LK|last4=Aaby|first4=P|title=A small jab - a big effect: nonspecific immunomodulation by vaccines.|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=13 May 2013 |volume=34|issue=9|pages=431–9|pmid=23680130| name-list-format=vanc|doi=10.1016/j.it.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[live attenuated vaccines]] studied so far ([[BCG vaccine]], [[measles vaccine]], [[oral polio vaccine]], [[smallpox vaccine]]) have been shown to reduce [[Death|mortality]] more than can be explained by prevention of the targeted infections. In contrast, [[inactivated vaccine]]s ([[DTP vaccine|diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine]] (DTP), [[hepatitis B vaccine]], [[inactivated polio vaccine]]) may increase overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases.

These effects may be long-lasting, at least up to the time point where a new type of vaccine is given. The non-specific effects can be very pronounced, with significant effects on overall mortality and [[morbidity]]. In a situation with [[herd immunity]] to the target disease, the non-specific effects can be more important for overall health than the specific vaccine effects.&lt;ref name="Benn13" /&gt;

The non-specific effects should not be confused with the [[side effects]] of vaccines (such as local reactions at the side of vaccination or general reactions such as fever, head ache or rash, which usually resolve within days to weeks – or in rare cases [[anaphylaxis]]). Rather, non-specific effects represent a form of general immunomodulation, with important consequences for the [[immune system|immune system's]] ability to handle subsequent challenges.

It is estimated that millions of child deaths in [[developing country|low income countries]] could be prevented every year if the non-specific effects of vaccines were taken into consideration in immunization programs.&lt;ref name=(2)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|title=Nonspecific effects of vaccines and the reduction of mortality in children.|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|date=February 2013 |volume=35|issue=2|pages=109–14|pmid=23375475| name-list-format=vanc|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bandim Health Project.JPG|thumb|The [[Bandim Health Project]] Office built in 2008.]]
The hypothesis that vaccines have non-specific effects was formulated in the early 1990s by [[Peter Aaby]] at the [[Bandim Health Project]] in West Africa.&lt;ref name=(3)&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aaby |first1=P |last2=Andersen |first2=M |last3=Sodemann |first3=M |last4=Jakobsen |first4=M |last5=Gomes |first5=J |last6=Fernandes |first6=M |title=Reduced childhood mortality after standard measles vaccination at 4-8 months compared with 9-11 months of age. |journal=BMJ |date=20 November 1993 |volume=307 |issue=6915 |pages=1308–11 |pmid=8257884 |doi=10.1136/bmj.307.6915.1308 |pmc=1679462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first indication of the importance of the non-specific effects of vaccines came in a series of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the late 1980s. It was tested whether a high-titer (high-dose) measles vaccine (HTMV) given at 4–6 months of age was as effective against measles infection as the standard measles vaccine (MV) given at 9 months of age. Early administration of the HTMV prevented measles infection just as effectively as did the standard MV given at 9 months of age.

However, early administration of the HTMV was associated with twofold ''higher'' overall mortality among females (there was no difference in mortality for males).&lt;ref name=(6)&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holt |first1=EA |last2=Moulton |first2=LH |last3=Siberry |first3=GK |last4=Halsey |first4=NA |title=Differential mortality by measles vaccine titer and sex. |journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases |date=November 1993 |volume=168 |issue=5 |pages=1087–96 |pmid=8228340 |doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(5)&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aaby |first1=P |last2=Samb |first2=B |last3=Simondon |first3=F |last4=Knudsen |first4=K |last5=Seck |first5=AM |last6=Bennett |first6=J |title=Sex-specific differences in mortality after high-titre measles immunization in rural Senegal. |journal=Bull World Health Organ |date=1994 |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=761–70 |pmid=7955026 |pmc=2486568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(4)&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aaby |first1=P |last2=Knudsen |first2=K |last3=Whittle |first3=H |last4=Lisse |first4=IM |last5=Thaarup |first5=J |last6=Poulsen |first6=A |title=Long-term survival after Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccination in Guinea-Bissau: increased female mortality rate |journal=Journal of Pediatrics |date=June 1993 |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=904–8 |pmid=8501567 |doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(09)90015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the girls given HTMV died more often despite having the same protection against measles as the infants given standard MV. The discovery forced [[WHO]] to withdraw the HTMV in 1992.&lt;ref name=(7)&gt;{{cite journal |title=Expanded programme on immunization (EPI). Safety of high titre measles vaccines. |journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec |date=1992 |volume=67 |pages=357–61 |pmid=1449986}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered that it was not the HTMV, but rather a subsequent inactivated vaccine (DTP or IPV for different children), that caused the increase in female mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aaby |first1=Peter |last2=Jensen |first2=Henrik |last3=Samb |first3=Badara |last4=Cisse |first4=Badara |last5=Sodemann |first5=Morten |last6=Jakobsen |first6=Marianne |last7=Poulsen |first7=Anja |last8=Rodrigues |first8=Amabelia |last9=Lisse |first9=Ida Marie |last10=Simondon |first10=Francois |last11=Whittle |first11=Hilton |title=Differences in female-male mortality after high-titre measles vaccine and association with subsequent vaccination with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and inactivated poliovirus: reanalysis of West African studies |journal=The Lancet |date=28 June 2003 |volume=361 |issue=9376 |pages=2183–2188 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13771-3 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)13771-3/references |pmid=12842371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the mechanism was different than initially thought, this finding represents unexpected effects of a change in the vaccine program not attributable to the disease-specific protection provided by the vaccines.

This first observation that vaccines could protect against the target disease but at the same time affect mortality after infection with other pathogens, in a sex-differential manner, led to several further studies showing that other vaccines might also have such nonspecific effects.

==Live attenuated versus inactivated vaccines==
Numerous [[observational study|observational studies]] and [[randomized trial|randomised trials]] (RCTs) have found that the impact on mortality of live and inactivated vaccines differ markedly. All live vaccines studied so far (BCG, measles vaccine, oral polio vaccine (OPV) and smallpox vaccine) have been shown to reduce mortality more than can be explained by prevention of the targeted infection(s). In contrast, inactivated vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), hepatitis B, inactivated polio vaccine) may have deleterious effects in spite of providing target disease protection.&lt;ref name=(14)/&gt;

===BCG vaccine===
The live attenuated BCG vaccine developed against tuberculosis has been shown to have strong beneficial effects on the ability to combat non-tuberculosis infections.&lt;ref name=Benn13/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aaby14Oct&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Kollmann|first2=TR|last3=Benn|first3=CS|title=Nonspecific effects of neonatal and infant vaccination: public-health, immunological and conceptual challenges.|journal=Nature Immunology|date=October 2014|volume=15|issue=10|pages=895–9|pmid=25232810|doi=10.1038/ni.2961}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:A scar after received Bacillus Calmette-Guérin.jpg|thumb|Scar after BCG vaccination]]

Several studies have suggested that BCG vaccination may reduce atopy, particularly when given early in life. Furthermore, in multiple observational studies BCG vaccination has been shown to provide beneficial effects on overall mortality.&lt;ref name=Steenhuis08&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steenhuis|first1=TJ|last2=van Aalderen|first2=WM|last3=Bloksma|first3=N|title=Bacille-Calmette-Guerin vaccination and the development of allergic disease in children: a randomized, prospective, single-blind study.|journal=Clin Exp Allergy|date=2008|volume=38|issue=1|pages=79–85|pmid=17956585|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2222.2007.02859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations encouraged randomised controlled trials to examine BCG vaccination's beneficial non-specific effects on overall health.&lt;ref name=Roth07Jan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=AE|last2=Nielsen|first2=J|title=A non-beneficial effect of BCG on non-tuberculous childhood mortality?|journal=Vaccine|date=2 January 2007|volume=25|issue=1|pages=12–3|pmid=16198453|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roth04Jun&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=A|last2=Jensen|first2=H|last3=Garly|first3=ML|last4=Djana|first4=Q|last5=Martins|first5=CL|last6=Sodemann|first6=M|last7=Rodrigues|first7=A|last8=Aaby|first8=P|title=Low birth weight infants and Calmette-Guérin bacillus vaccination at birth: community study from Guinea-Bissau.|journal=The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal|date=June 2004|volume=23|issue=6|pages=544–50|pmid=15194836|doi=10.1097/01.inf.0000129693.81082.a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roth05Jun&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=A|last2=Gustafson|first2=P|last3=Nhaga|first3=A|last4=Djana|first4=Q|last5=Poulsen|first5=A|last6=Garly|first6=ML|last7=Jensen|first7=H|last8=Sodemann|first8=M|last9=Rodriques|first9=A|last10=Aaby|first10=P|title=BCG vaccination scar associated with better childhood survival in Guinea-Bissau.|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=June 2005|volume=34|issue=3|pages=540–7|pmid=15659474|doi=10.1093/ije/dyh392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roth06&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=A|last2=Garly|first2=ML|last3=Jensen|first3=H|last4=Nielsen|first4=J|last5=Aaby|first5=P|title=Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination and infant mortality.|journal=Expert Rev Vaccines|date=2006|volume=5|issue=2|pages=277–93|pmid=16608427|doi=10.1586/14760584.5.2.277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since BCG vaccination is recommended to be given at birth in countries that have a high incidence of tuberculosis it would have been unethical to randomize children into 'BCG' vs. 'no BCG' groups. However, many low-income countries delay BCG vaccination for low-birth-weight (LBW) infants; this offered the opportunity to directly test the effect of BCG on overall mortality.

In the first two randomised controlled trials receipt of BCG+OPV at birth vs. OPV only ('delayed BCG') was associated with strong reductions in [[neonatal]] mortality; these effects were seen as early as 3 days after vaccination. BCG protected against [[sepsis]] as well as [[respiratory infections]].&lt;ref name=(10)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biering-Sorensen|first1=S|last2=Aaby|first2=P|last3=Napirna|first3=BM|last4=Roth|first4=A|last5=Ravn|first5=H|last6=Rodrigues|first6=A|title=Small randomized trial among low-birth-weight children receiving bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination at first health center contact.|journal=Pediatr Infect Dis J|date=Mar 2012|volume=31|issue=3|pages=306–8|pmid=22189537|doi=10.1097/inf.0b013e3182458289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(9)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Roth|first2=A|last3=Ravn|first3=H|last4=Napirna|first4=BM|last5=Rodrigues|first5=A|last6=Lisse|first6=IM|title=Randomized trial of BCG vaccination at birth to low-birth-weight children: beneficial nonspecific effects in the neonatal period?|journal=J Infect Dis|date=15 July 2011|volume=204|issue=2|pages=245–52|pmid=21673035|doi=10.1093/infdis/jir240}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among BCG vaccinated children, those who develop a BCG scar or a positive skin test (TST) are less likely to develop sepsis and exhibit an overall reduction in child mortality of around 50%.&lt;ref name=Roth05Jun/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roth06Sep&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=A|last2=Sodemann|first2=M|last3=Jensen|first3=H|last4=Poulsen|first4=A|last5=Gustafson|first5=P|last6=Weise|first6=C|last7=Gomes|first7=J|last8=Djana|first8=Q|last9=Jakobsen|first9=M|last10=Garly|first10=ML|last11=Rodrigues|first11=A|last12=Aaby|first12=P|title=Tuberculin reaction, BCG scar, and lower female mortality.|journal=Epidemiology|date=September 2006|volume=17|issue=5|pages=562–8|pmid=16878042|doi=10.1097/01.ede.0000231546.14749.ab}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roth03Jun&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garly|first1=ML|last2=Martins|first2=CL|last3=Balé|first3=C|last4=Baldé|first4=MA|last5=Hedegaard|first5=KL|last6=Gustafson|first6=P|last7=Lisse|first7=IM|last8=Whittle|first8=HC|last9=Aaby|first9=P|title=BCG scar and positive tuberculin reaction associated with reduced child mortality in West Africa.

In a recent WHO-commissioned review based on five clinical trials and nine observational studies, it was concluded that "the results indicated a beneficial effect of BCG on overall mortality in the first 6–12 months of life.&lt;ref name=(10)/&gt; Relevant follow-up in some of the trials was short, and all of the observational studies were regarded as being at risk of bias, so the confidence in the findings was rated as very low according to the [http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ GRADE criteria] and "There was a suggestion that BCG vaccination may be more beneficial the earlier it is given". Furthermore, "estimated effects are in the region of a halving of mortality risk" and "any effect of BCG vaccine on all-cause mortality is not likely to be attributable to any great extent to fewer deaths from tuberculosis (i.e. to a specific effect of BCG vaccine against tuberculosis)".&lt;ref name=(11)&gt;{{cite web|last1=WHO/SAGE|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2014/april/3_NSE_Epidemiology_review_Report_to_SAGE_14_Mar_FINAL.pdf|title=Epidemiology review Report to SAGE|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the evidence, the WHO's Strategic Group of Experts on Immunization concluded that "the non-specific effects on all-cause mortality warrant further research".&lt;ref name=(12)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Meeting of the Strategic advisory group of experts on immunization, april 2014 – conclusions and recommendations.|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|pmid=24864348|date=2014|volume=89|pages=221–36|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2014/wer8921/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measles vaccine===

Standard titer measles vaccine is recommended at 9 months of age in low-income countries where measles infection is endemic and often fatal. Many observational studies have shown that measles-vaccinated children have substantially lower mortality than can be explained by the prevention of measles-related deaths.&lt;ref name=(13)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Martins|first2=CL|last3=Garly|first3=ML|last4=Rodrigues|first4=A|last5=Benn|first5=CS|last6=Whittle|first6=H|title=The optimal age of measles immunisation in low-income countries: a secondary analysis of the assumptions underlying the current policy|journal=BMJ Open|date=2012|volume=2|issue=4|pmid=22815465|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000761|pages=e000761|pmc=3401826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these observational studies were [[natural experiments]], such as studies comparing the mortality before and after the introduction of measles vaccine and other studies where logistical factors rather than maternal choice determined whether a child was vaccinated or not.

These findings were later supported in randomized trials from 2003 to 2009 in Guinea-Bissau. An intervention group of children given standard titer measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 month of age had a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality compared to the children in the control group, which were only vaccinated against measles at 9 month of age.&lt;ref name=(14)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Martins|first2=CL|last3=Garly|first3=ML|last4=Bale|first4=C|last5=Andersen|first5=A|last6=Rodrigues|first6=A|title=Non-specific effects of standard measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age on childhood mortality: randomised controlled trial.|journal=BMJ|date=2010|volume=341|issue=6495|pmid=21118875|pages=c6495|doi=10.1136/bmj.c6495|pmc=2994348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent WHO-commissioned review based on four randomized trials and 18 observational studies, it was concluded that "There was consistent evidence of a beneficial effect of measles vaccine, although all observational studies were assessed as being at risk of bias and the [http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org GRADE rating] was of low confidence. There was an apparent difference between the effect in girls and boys, with girls benefitting more from measles vaccination", and furthermore "estimated effects are in the region of a halving of mortality risk" and "if these effects are real then they are not fully explained by deaths that were established as due to measles".&lt;ref name=(11)/&gt; Based on the evidence, the [http://www.who.int/immunization/policy/sage/en WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization] concluded that "the non-specific effects on all-cause mortality warrant further research".&lt;ref name=(12)/&gt;[http://www.who.int/wer/2014/wer8921/en/]

===Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine===
DTP vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis does not seem to have the same beneficial effects as BCG, measles vaccine, OPV and smallpox vaccine, and in fact opposite effects are observed.&lt;ref name=(15)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Benn|first2=C|last3=Nielsen|first3=J|last4=Lisse|first4=IM|last5=Rodrigues|first5=A|last6=Ravn|first6=H|title=Testing the hypothesis that diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine has negative non-specific and sex-differential effects on child survival in high-mortality countries|journal=BMJ Open|date=2012|volume=2|issue=3|pmid=22619263|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000707|pages=e000707|pmc=3364456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative effects are seen as long as DTP vaccine is the most recent vaccine. BCG or measles vaccine given after DTP reverses the negative effects of DTP.&lt;ref name=(15)/&gt; The negative effects are seen mostly in females.&lt;ref name=(15)/&gt;

In a recent WHO-commissioned review of DTP based on ten observational studies, it was concluded that, "the findings were inconsistent, with a majority of the studies indicating a detrimental effect of DTP, and two studies indicating a beneficial effect. All of the studies were regarded as being at risk of bias, so the confidence in the findings was rated as very low according to the GRADE criteria."

Furthermore, "three observational studies provided a suggestion that simultaneous administration of BCG and DTP may be preferable to the recommended schedule of BCG before DTP; and there was suggestion that mortality risk may be higher when DTP is  given with, or after, measles vaccine compared with when it is given before measles vaccine (from five, and three, observational studies, respectively). These results are consistent with hypotheses that DTP vaccine may have detrimental effects on mortality, although a majority of the evidence was generated by a group centred in Guinea-Bissau who have often written in defence of such a hypothesis."&lt;ref name=(11)/&gt;

===Smallpox vaccine===
When smallpox vaccine was introduced in the early 19s century, there were anecdotal descriptions of non-specific beneficial effects. In the second half of the 20th century the potential for beneficial non-specific effects of smallpox vaccine was reviewed, and new evidence on "[[para-immune effects]]" was added.&lt;ref name=(25)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayr|first1=A|title=Taking advantage of the positive side-effects of smallpox vaccination.|journal=J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health.|date=June 2004|volume=51|issue=5|pages=199–201|pmid=15330977|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0450.2004.00763.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have focused on the phasing out of smallpox vaccine in the 1970s and compared vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts.
 
Smallpox vaccine leaves a very characteristic scar. In low-income countries, having a smallpox vaccine scar has been associated with reductions of more than 40% in overall mortality among adults;&lt;ref name=(27)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=ML|last2=Dave|first2=S|last3=Schim van der Loeff|first3=M|last4=da Costa|first4=C|last5=Vincent|first5=T|last6=Leligdowicz|first6=A|title=Vaccinia scars associated with improved survival among adults in rural Guinea-Bissau|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2006|volume=1|issue=101|pmid=17183634|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000101|pmc=1762358|pages=e101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(26)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Gustafson|first2=P|last3=Roth|first3=A|last4=Rodrigues|first4=A|last5=Fernandes|first5=M|last6=Sodemann|first6=M|title=Vaccinia scars associated with better survival for adults.

However it should be noted that no randomized trials testing the effect of smallpox vaccine on overall mortality and morbidity have been conducted.

==Sex differences==
Non-specific effects are frequently different in males and females. There are accumulating data illustrating that males and females may respond differently to vaccination, both in terms of the quality and quantity of the immune response.&lt;ref name=(6)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(5)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(4)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(15)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(31)/&gt; If true, then we must consider whether vaccination schedules should differ for males and females, or as has been suggested "should we treat the sexes differently in order to treat them equally?"&lt;ref name=(31)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flanagan|first1=KL|last2=Klein|first2=SL|last3=Skakkebaek|first3=NE|last4=Marriott|first4=I|last5=Marchant|first5=A|last6=Selin|first6=L|title=Sex differences in the vaccine-specific and non-targeted effects of vaccines.|journal=Vaccine|date=16 Mar 2011|volume=29|issue=13|pages=2349–54|pmid=21300095|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.01.071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interactions between health interventions==
The non-specific effects of vaccines can be boosted or diminished when other immunomodulating health interventions such as other vaccines, or vitamins, are provided.&lt;ref name=(32)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benn|first1=CS|last2=Bale|first2=C|last3=Sommerfelt|first3=H|last4=Friis|first4=H|last5=Aaby|first5=P|title=Hypothesis: Vitamin A supplementation and childhood mortality: amplification of the non-specific effects of vaccines?|journal=Int J Epidemiol|date=2003|volume=32|issue=5|pages=822–8|pmid=14559758|doi=10.1093/ije/dyg208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of pre-existing specific immunity==
The beneficial NSEs of live vaccines are stronger with earlier vaccination, possibly due to maternal antibodies.&lt;ref name=(33)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Martins|first2=CL|last3=Garly|first3=ML|last4=Andersen|first4=A|last5=Fisker|first5=AB|last6=Claesson|first6=MH|title=Measles vaccination in the presence or absence of maternal measles antibody: Impact on child survival.|journal=Clin Infect Dis|date=14 May 2014|pmid=24829213|doi=10.1093/cid/ciu354|volume=59|pages=484–92|pmc=4111916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boosting with live vaccines also seems to enhance the beneficial effects.

==High-income countries==
The non-specific effects were primarily observed in low-income countries with high infectious disease burdens, but they may not be limited to these areas. Recent [[Denmark|Danish]] register-based studies have shown that the live attenuated [[MMR vaccine|measles-mumps-rubella vaccine]] (MMR) protects against hospital admissions with infectious diseases and specifically getting ill by respiratory syncytial virus.&lt;ref name=(35)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorup|first1=S|last2=Benn|first2=CS|last3=Stensballe|first3=LG|last4=Aaby|first4=P|last5=Ravn|first5=H|title=Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination and respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospital contact|journal=Vaccine|date=1 Jan 2015|volume=33|pmid=25446818|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.07.110|pages=237–45|pmc=4270443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(34)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorup|first1=S|last2=Benn|first2=CS|last3=Poulsen|first3=A|last4=Krause|first4=TG|last5=Aaby|first5=P|last6=Ravn|first6=H|title=Live vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella and the risk of hospital admissions for nontargeted infections.|journal=JAMA|date=26 Feb 2014|volume=311|issue=8|pages=826–35|pmid=24570246|doi=10.1001/jama.2014.470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Castro15&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Castro|first1=MJ|last2=Pardo-Seco|first2=J|last3=Martinón-Torres|first3=F|title=Nonspecific (Heterologous) Protection of Neonatal BCG Vaccination Against Hospitalization Due to Respiratory Infection and Sepsis.|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=27 February 2015|pmid=25725054|doi=10.1093/cid/civ144|volume=60|pages=1611–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immunological mechanisms==
The findings from the epidemiological studies on the non-specific effects of vaccines pose a challenge to the current understanding of vaccines, and how they affect the immune system, and also question whether boys and girls have identical immune systems and should receive the same treatment.

The mechanisms for these effects are unclear. It is not known how vaccination induces rapid beneficial or harmful changes in the general susceptibility to infectious diseases, but the following mechanisms are likely to be involved.

===Heterologous T-cell immunity===
It is well known from animal studies that infections, apart from inducing pathogen-specific [[T-cells]], also induce cross-reactive T-cells through epitope sharing, so-called heterologous immunity.&lt;ref name=(37)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welsh|first1=RM|last2=Che|first2=JW|last3=Brehm|first3=MA|last4=Selin|first4=LK|title=Heterologous immunity between viruses|journal=Immunological reviews|date=May 2010|volume=235|issue=1|pages=244–66|pmid=20536568|doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00897.x|pmc=2917921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(36)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welsh|first1=RM|last2=Selin|first2=LK|title=No one is naive: the significance of heterologous T-cell immunity.|journal=Nat Rev Immunol|date=June 2002|volume=2|issue=6|pages=417–26|pmid=12093008|doi=10.1038/nri820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterologous T-cell immunity can lead to improved clearance of a subsequent cross-reactive challenge, but it may also lead to increased morbidity.&lt;ref name=(38)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Selin|first1=LK|last2=Wlodarczyk|first2=MF|last3=Kraft|first3=AR|last4=Nie|first4=S|last5=Kenney|first5=LL|last6=Puzone|first6=R|title=Heterologous immunity: immunopathology, autoimmunity and protection during viral infections.|journal=Autoimmunity|date=June 2011|volume=44|issue=4|pages=328–47|pmid=21250837|doi=10.3109/08916934.2011.523277|pmc=3633594}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism may explain why DTP could have negative effects.

It would, however, not explain effects occurring shortly after vaccination, as for instance the rapidly occurring beneficial effects of BCG vaccine,&lt;ref name=(10)/&gt; as the heterologous effect would only be expected to be present after some weeks, as the adaptive immune response need time to develop. Also, it is difficult to explain why the effect would vanish once a child receives a new vaccine.

===Trained innate immunity===
The concept that not only plants and insects, but also humans have innate immune memory may provide new clues to why vaccines have non-specific effects. Studies into BCG have recently revealed that BCG induces epigenetic changes in the monocytes in adults, leading to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon challenges with unrelated [[mitogens]] and [[pathogens]] (trained innate immunity).&lt;ref name=(39)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleinnijenhuis|first1=J|last2=Quintin|first2=J|last3=Preijers|first3=F|last4=Joosten|first4=LAB|last5=Ifrim|first5=DC|last6=Saeed|first6=S|title=Bacille Calmette-Guerin induces NOD2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date=23 Oct 2012|volume=109|issue=43|pages=17537–42|pmid=22988082|doi=10.1073/pnas.1202870109|pmc=3491454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[SCID mice]] that have no adaptive immune system, BCG reduced mortality from an otherwise lethal [[candida infection]]. The effects of BCG presented when tested after 2 weeks, but would be expected to occur rapidly after vaccination, and hence might be able to explain the very rapid protection against neonatal [[septicaemia]] seen after BCG vaccine.&lt;ref name=(40)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Benn|first2=CS|title=Saving lives by training innate immunity with bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date=23 Oct 2012|volume=109|issue=43|pages=17317–8|pmid=23071307|doi=10.1073/pnas.1215761109|pmc=3491466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trained [[innate immunity]] may also explain the generally increased resistance against broad disease categories, such as [[fevers]] and lower [[respiratory tract infections]]; such effects would be difficult to explain merely by shared [[epitope]]s, unless such epitopes were almost universally common on pathogens.

Lastly, it is plausible that the effects are reversible by a different vaccine. Hence, trained innate immunity may provide a biological mechanism for the observed non-specific effects of vaccines.&lt;ref name=(39)/&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2000 Aaby and colleagues presented data from Guinea-Bissau which suggested that DTP vaccination could, under some circumstances (e.g. absence of [[pertussis]]) be associated with increases in overall mortality, at least until children received measles vaccine. In response, WHO sponsored the analysis of a variety of data sets in other populations to test the hypothesis. None of these studies replicated the observation of increased mortality associated with DTP vaccination.&lt;ref name=(21)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(20)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(19)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(18)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(17)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(16)/&gt; WHO subsequently concluded, that the evidence was sufficient to reject the hypothesis for an increased nonspecific mortality following DTP vaccination.&lt;ref name=(41)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, 20–21 June|journal=Weekly epidemiological record|date=22 November 2002|volume=77|issue=47|pages=389–404|url=http://www.who.int/docstore/wer/pdf/2002/wer7747.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Aaby and colleagues subsequently pointed out that the studies which failed to show any mortality increase associated with DTP vaccination used methods of analysis that can introduce a bias against finding such an effect.&lt;ref name=(24)/&gt;

In these studies, data on childhood vaccinations were typically collected in periodic surveys, and the information on vaccinations, which occurred between successive home visits, was updated at the time of the second visit. The person-time at risk in unvaccinated and vaccinated states was then divided up according to the date of vaccination during the time interval between visits. This method opens up a potential bias, insofar as the updating of person time at risk from unvaccinated to vaccinated is only possible for children who survive to the second follow-up. Those who die between visits typically do not have vaccinations between the first visit and death recorded, and thus they will tend to be allocated as deaths in unvaccinated children – thus incorrectly inflating the mortality rate among unvaccinated children.&lt;ref name=(24)/&gt;

This bias has been described before, but in different contexts, as the distinction between 'landmark' and 'retrospective updating' analysis of [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] data.&lt;ref name=(43)/&gt; The retrospective updating method can lead to a considerable bias in vaccine studies, biasing observed mortality rate ratios towards zero (a large effect), whereas the landmark method leads to a non-specific misclassification and biases the mortality rate ratio towards unity(no effect).

An additional problem with the literature on the nonspecific effects of vaccines has been the variety and unexpected nature of the hypotheses which have appeared (in particular relating to sex-specific effects), which has meant that it has not always been clear whether some apparent 'effects' were the result of [[post hoc analysis|post hoc analyses]] or whether they were reflections of [[A priori probability|a priori]] hypotheses.

This was discussed at length at a review of the work of Aaby and his colleagues in Copenhagen in 2005.&lt;ref name=(22)/&gt; The review was convened by the Danish National Research Foundation and the [[Novo Nordisk Foundation]] who have sponsored much of the work of Aaby and his colleagues. An outcome of the review was the explicit formulation of a series of testable hypotheses, agreed by the Aaby group.&lt;ref name=(22)/&gt; It was hoped that independent investigators would design and conduct studies powered to confirm or refute these hypotheses.

Also, the two foundations sponsored a workshop on the analysis of vaccine effects, which was held in London in 2008.&lt;ref name=(22)/&gt; The workshop resulted in three papers.&lt;ref name=(43)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farrington|first1=CP|last2=Firth|first2=MJ|last3=Moulton|first3=LH|last4=Ravn|first4=H|last5=Andersen|first5=PK|last6=Evans|first6=S|title=Epidemiological studies of the non-specific effects of vaccines: II - methodological issues in the design and analysis of cohort studies.|journal=Trop Med Int Health|date=2009|volume=14|issue=9|pages=977–85|pmid=19531116|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02302.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(44)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|last2=Nohynek|first2=H|last3=Scott|first3=JA|last4=Hesseling|first4=A|last5=Flanagan|first5=KL|title=Randomized Trials to Study the Nonspecific Effects of Vaccines in Children in Low-Income Countries|journal=Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal|date=2010|volume=29|issue=5|pages=457–61|pmid=20431383|doi=10.1097/inf.0b013e3181c91361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(42)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=PEM|last2=Williams|first2=TN|last3=Aaby|first3=P|last4=Källander|first4=K|last5=Moulton|first5=LH|last6=Flanagan|first6=KL|title=Epidemiological studies of the 'non-specific effects' of vaccines: I - data collection in observational studies|journal=Trop Med Int Health|date=2009|volume=14|issue=9|pages=969–76|pmid=19531117|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02301.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proceedings were forwarded to WHO which subsequently concluded that it would "keep a watch on the evidence of nonspecific effects of vaccination".&lt;ref name=(45)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Meeting of Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|date=18 July 2008|volume=83|issue=32|pages=285–92|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2008/wer8332/en/|pmid=18689006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, WHO established a working group tasked with reviewing the evidence for the non-specific effects of BCG, measles and DTP vaccines. Two independent reviews were conducted, an immunological review&lt;ref name=(46)&gt;{{cite web|last1=WHO|title=Systematic Review of the Non-specific Immunological Effects of Selected Routine|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2014/april/2_NSE_Immunology_review_version_for_SAGE_JLC.pdf|website=WHO|publisher=The Oxford University|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an epidemiological review.&lt;ref name=(11)/&gt; The results were presented at the April 2014 meeting of WHO's Strategic Gourp of Experts on Immunizations (SAGE). WHO/SAGE  concluded that further research into the potential NSEs of vaccines was warranted.&lt;ref name=(12)/&gt;

==Implications for world health==
{{POV|date=August 2017}}
It would have major consequences for child survival if the non-specific effects of vaccines were taken into consideration in immunization programs: BCG and MV should be given to all children as early as possible; restrictive policies for opening multi-dose vials of BCG and MV should be abandoned.

Contrary to current WHO-recommendations, the age of MV should not be raised when measles infection is under control; DTP should not be given simultaneously with MV or after MV; and a booster dose of DTP is likely to have a negative effect on child survival. Finally, eradicating a disease and stopping a live vaccine with beneficial NSEs is likely to have negative effects for the overall health of the affected population.&lt;ref name=(2)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(27)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(26)/&gt;

Dr. Frank Shann from Australia recently assessed the consequences of changing the current [[EPI vaccine|EPI]] schedule to an alternative schedule taking non-specific effects into account, and concluded: "If all neonates in high-mortality regions were given BCG at birth, and the revised immunization schedule ... were adopted, with extra doses of measles vaccine at 14 weeks and 19 months (at a cost of only US $0.60/dose delivered), ~1 million (30%) of the 3.2 million neonatal deaths each year might be prevented in developing countries, and 1.5 million (30%) of the 4.8 million deaths between 1 month and 5 years of age might be prevented". Furthermore: "This very large reduction in mortality in children &lt;5 years of age would be achieved at a low cost using only vaccines that are already in the routine EPI schedule".&lt;ref name=(2)/&gt;

==''The Arc of the Swallow''==
In 2008, Danish crime novel author [[Sissel-Jo Gazan]] (author of the Danish crime novel ''Dinosaur Feather'') became interested in the work of the [[Bandim Health Project]] and based her science crime novel ''The Arc of the Swallow'' (''Svalens Graf'') on the research into non-specific effects of vaccines.

The novel was published in Danish in 2013; it was on the best-seller list for months and won the Readers' Prize 2014 in Denmark. It was published in English in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on November 6, 2014 and in the US on April 7, 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3099">'''Nosokinetics''' is the science/subject of measuring and modelling the process of care in [[health care|health]] and [[social care]] systems.&lt;ref name=nosok&gt;[http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/nosokinetics/ Nosokinetics website]&lt;/ref&gt;'' Nosokinetics'' brings together the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for ''noso'': disease and ''kinetics'': movement.

[[Black box]] models are currently used to plan changes in health and social care systems. These input-output models overlook the process of inpatient care, as a result suboptimal decisions are made. Nosokinetics, (analogous to [[Pharmacokinetics]]), seeks to develop dynamic methods which measure and model the process of inpatient care. The aim is to develop a scientific base to underpin the planning of sustainable health and social care systems.
== Establishment ==
Nosokinetics is a new ''science'' that was established in the UK in the early 1990s by Prof [[Peter H Millard]] after publishing his PhD thesis. In 2004 Nosokinetics group newsletter was established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/events/hscm2008/keynotes.html Peter Millard Resume &amp; Photo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825172724/http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/events/hscm2008/keynotes.html |date=August 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Prof [[Peter  H Millard]] writes about Nosokinetics : "If the random forces of wind and tide can make such a beautiful statue (referring to an [[iceberg]]), how much better could [[human|mankind]] do if a new [[science]] was developed which explains the complex processes of health and social care. Until new methods of planning health and social care services to meet the needs of an [[ageing]] population are introduced, service delivery will stumble on from [[crisis]] to crisis. The world population is ageing and sustainable systems of health care need to be developed."&lt;ref name=nosok/&gt;

He has established the nosokinetics group of interested [[researcher]]s. The group collaborates to organize [[Academic conference|conferences]] and disseminates [[news]] of nosokinetics and other researchers' research and practical use of modelling to enhance decision making in health and social care systems.&lt;ref name=nosok/&gt;

== Network ==
The Nosokinetics Group has succeeded in attracting a lot of researchers. Nosokinetics interested people are present in many countries including [[Australia]], [[UK]] &amp; [[Egypt]]. They are from different disciplines ranging from health care providers to management scientists. The news related to nosokinetics is shared to the network through the bimonthly newsletter ''Nosokinetics News''&lt;ref&gt;[http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/nosokinetics/newsletter.htm Nosokinetics newsletter archive]&lt;/ref&gt; which helps to communicate papers, conferences and events of interest to the Nosokinetics network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3934">'''Nutrition analysis''' refers to the process of determining the [[nutrition]]al content of [[food]]s and food products.  The process can be performed through a variety of certified methods.

==Methods==
===Laboratory analysis===
Traditionally, food companies would send food samples to laboratories for physical testing. 
Typical analysis includes:
Moisture (water) by loss of mass at 102 °C,
Protein by analysis of total nitrogen, either by Dumas or Kjeldahl methods,
Total fat, traditionally by a solvent extraction, but often now by secondary methods such as NMR,
[[Crude ash]] (total inorganic matter) by combustion at 550C,
Estimated dietary fibre by various AOAC methods such as 985.29,
Sodium (and thereby Salt) either by flame photometry, AA or ICP-OES,
Total sugars, normally by a liquid chromatography technique, such as IC-HPAED or HPLC-RI,
Fatty acids by GC-FID,
Carbohydrates and energy values are normally calculated from these analytical values.

===Software===
Software is available as an alternative to laboratory nutrition analysis.  This software typically utilizes a database of ingredients that have previously been laboratory tested.  The user can input ingredient data by matching their ingredients to ingredients found in the database; the analysis can then be calculated.

===Online nutrition analysis===
In recent years, web-based nutrition analysis software services have become more popular. Online nutrition analysis allows users to access online databases and draw from certified ingredients to produce instant nutrition information.

===Turnkey nutrition analysis services===
Another emerging trend is the use of nutritional analysis services that do a complete analysis of any recipe by using their proprietary database.  Users provide recipes, cooking methods and serving sizes.  In turn, the service provides a complete nutritional analysis.

==Applications==
In the United States, nutrition information is required on packaged retail foods in the form of nutrition facts panels as a result of [[food labeling regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/default.htm Food Labeling and Nutrition Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many restaurants have begun posting nutrition information as a result of both customer demand and menu-labeling laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/business/mcdonalds-to-start-posting-calorie-counts.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition facts label===
{{main|Nutrition facts label}}

===Menu-labeling===
The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], signed into law March 23, 2010, includes a provision that creates a national, uniform nutrition-disclosure standard for food service establishments.

The nutrition-disclosure provision requires chain restaurants, similar retail food establishments and vending machines with 20 or more locations to provide specific nutrition labeling information. Those establishments must post calories on menus, menu boards and drive-thru boards. Buffets, salad bars and other self-service items are also included and will be required to provide caloric information adjacent to the item.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Government/NutritionPolicy/Pages/MenuLabeling.aspx Issue Update:Menu Labeling ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently many state and local menu-labeling laws have been passed requiring restaurants to post nutrition information on menus and menu boards, or have it readily available upon customer request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspinet.org/menulabeling/ Center for Science in the Public Interest]&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurants have had to perform nutrition analysis in order to generate nutrition information and conform to these laws. More recently national legislation has been introduced that would set a national standard for menu labeling, the most popular of which is the [[LEAN act]].

==Background and preventive health==
Nutritional science originally emerged as a field that studied individuals lacking certain nutrients and the subsequent effects,&lt;ref name=Neeha2013/&gt; such as the disease [[scurvy]] which results from a lack of vitamin C. As other diseases closely related to diet (but not deficiency), such as obesity, became more prevalent, nutritional science expanded to cover these topics as well.&lt;ref name=Neeha2013/ Nutritional research typically focuses on preventative measure, trying to identify what nutrients or foods will raise or lower risks of diseases and damage to the human body.

For example, Prader-Willi syndrome, a disease whose most distinguishing factor is insatiable appetite, has been specifically linked to an epigenetic pattern in which the paternal copy in the chromosomal region is erroneously deleted, and the maternal loci is inactivated by over methylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3717174|doi= 10.1111/nyas.12020 | pmid=23360386 | volume=1281 | title=The genetics of human obesity | year=2013 | journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci | pages=178–90 | last1 = Xia | first1 = Q | last2 = Grant | first2 = SF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yet, although certain disorders may be linked to certain&amp;nbsp;[[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)]]&amp;nbsp;or other localized patterns, variation within a population may yield many more polymorphisms.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Bisen, Prakash A.; Debnath, Mousumi; Prasad, Godavarthi B.K.S. (2010).&amp;nbsp;''Molecular Dianostics: Promises and Possibilities''. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. p.&amp;nbsp;26.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|9048132614}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Obesity is one of the most widely studied topics in nutritional genomics. Due to genetic variations among individuals, each person could respond to diet differently. By exploring the interaction between dietary pattern and genetic factors, the field aims to suggest dietary changes that could prevent or reduce obesity.&lt;ref name=Doo2015&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Obesity: interactions of genome and nutrients intake|journal = Preventive Nutrition and Food Science|date = 2015-03-01|issn = 2287-1098|pmc = 4391534|pmid = 25866743|pages = 1–7|volume = 20|issue = 1|doi = 10.3746/pnf.2015.20.1.1|first = Miae|last = Doo|first2 = Yangha|last2 = Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There appear to be some [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] that make it more likely that a person will gain weight from a high fat diet; for people with AA genotype in the [[FTO gene]] showed a higher BMI compared those with TT genotype when having high fat or low carbohydrate dietary intake.&lt;ref name=Doo2015/&gt; The [[Apolipoprotein B|APO B]] SNP rs512535 is another diet-related variation; the A/G heterozygous genotype was found to have association with obesity (in terms of BMI and waist circumference) and for individuals with habitual high fat diet (&gt;35% of energy intake), while individuals with GG homozygotes genotype are likely to have a higher BMI compared to AA allele carriers. However, this difference is not found in low fat consuming group (&lt;35% of energy intake).&lt;ref name=Doo2015/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4081">'''Online patient education''', also known as '''online patient engagement''', is a method of providing medical information and education to patients using [[learning management systems]] delivered through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of bariatric Centers of Excellence Web sites for functionality and efficacy. Surg Obes Relat Dis. 2008 Sep-Oct;4(5):571-4&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of computer-based instruction and includes web seminars, downloadable materials, interactive learning courses, and audio/visual presentations. Generally, online patient education is supplemented with in-person consultations tailored to each individual.

==General usage==
Health professionals use online patient education to prepare patients for medical procedures, administer intake and informed consent paperwork, educate patients about health conditions, provide information about preventive care, encourage healthy behavior and lifestyle changes, etc. Health insurance companies use online patient education to inform patients about coverage policies. 

Online patient education is gaining popularity as home Internet access becomes more common and medical practices increasingly utilize digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Issues in patient education Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health, Volume 49, Issue 3, Pages 203-209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computers in Patient Education. Comput Inform Nurs 21(2):88-96, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Patients either view online patient education programs and materials in a medical office or from their homes or other remote locations with Internet access. Content may include interactive features such as quizzes, live question and answer sessions (in moderated web seminars), and the ability to complete and submit forms.

==Patient education by type==

===On location===
Any education delivered verbally by a healthcare provider to a single patient or group of patients can be considered as On Location patient education. Although this is still the most commonly used patient education method it is time consuming, can have consistency problems, and relies heavily on the individual patient ability to absorb, understand, and retain the verbal information.

===Paper based===
The second most common method. Any information brochure at a healthcare provider office falls under this category. The benefits of printed materials is that patients can refer back to the information

===Web based===
Patient education that is made available by a healthcare provider via his/her website, specific portal, or EHR. Web based education can be provided in an [[Asynchronous learning|Asynchronous]] and [[Synchronous learning|Synchronous]] styles.

==Advantages==
Educating patients with online technology can be advantageous&lt;ref&gt;Online patient education: A superior alternative to in-person information seminars Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages S44-S45&lt;/ref&gt; for both medical practices and patients because it gives health care providers the opportunity to create comprehensive educational materials that are consistently presented, rather than relying on face-to-face meetings in which information is presented by a staff member.&lt;ref&gt;Patients Postoperatively Forget Aspects of Preoperative Patient Education. Obesity Surgery, 15, 2005 1066-1069&lt;/ref&gt; Patients need not possess advanced computer/web skills to use this method of learning. A survey of 3200 patients revealed that even patients who are not computer literate are satisfied with online patient education as means of learning about medical care.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3655">'''Partner services''' is a [[public health]] term which refers to the [[health intervention]] given to a client's intimate partners when a client goes to a [[health care provider]] requesting [[health care]].  

'''[[Partner notification]]''' is a type of partner service, wherein if someone has a [[contagious disease]], the health care provider finding the problem will try to notify that person's partners that they have been exposed to infection. It is a form of [[contact tracing]].

Partner services are important because in some cases a person's health problems are partially caused or sustained by other people.  A common example would be that a person visits a doctor because he has an [[infectious disease]].  If that disease is also contagious, then that person's close associates may also have the disease.  If a [[physician]] were to only treat the person who initially requests treatment, then the disease may remain in the community.  Instead, principles of partner services dictate that health care should treat all members of a group which transmits infection.

==Examples==

Partner services are frequently discussed in the treatment of [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STI).  If one person has a sexually transmitted infection, then any sexual partner that person has is at risk to get that infection.  A common practice after identifying a person who has an STI is to ask that person to identify any sexual partners so that the clinic can contact them and arrange for them to receive STI testing, treatment, and counseling.

Another example is the case in which two people are in an [[intimate relationship]], such as a marriage.  One partner may be dissatisfied with the relationship and seek counseling.  In this case, the counselor may advise that if the other partner in the relationship does not also participate in counseling then improvement in the relationship might be difficult.  In this case, the counselor would assist the person making the complaint in arranging partner services.

==List of conditions for which partner services are often used==

Public health offices are often directed to offer partner services for sexually transmitted infections, including the following: 
*[[HIV]]
*[[syphilis]]
*[[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]
*[[gonorrhea]]
*[[hepatitis A]]
*[[hepatitis B]]

[[Mental health professionals]] often recommend partner services when clients express interest in treatment for many problems, including the following:
*[[substance abuse]], including [[alcoholism]]
*[[Relationship counseling]]
*[[Depression (mood)|depression]]
*and many [[List of mental disorders as defined by the DSM and ICD|other mental disorders]]

The intention is that often a person will benefit from the support of close friends, family, and significant others when getting treatment for a mental problem.

==Benefits==
Partner services help the original client have better health, and improve the health of that client's close associates, and benefit the community by relieving the burden of retaining an infectious reservoir of endemic health problems.&lt;ref name=cdc_fact&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr57e1030a1.htm |title=Recommendations for Partner Services Programs for HIV Infection, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, and Chlamydial Infection |first=Samuel W. |last=Dooley |work=cdc.gov |date=30 October 2008 |publisher=[[DAIDS]] |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4830">'''Pharmaceutical publication planning''' is the activity of planning the dissemination of scientific and clinical data on a [[drug]] to [[Health care provider#Practitioners and professionals |healthcare professional]]s at [[Congress#Scientific congress |scientific congresses]] and medical society meetings and in [[peer review]]ed [[Public health journal|medical journals]].

==Procedure==

Pharmaceutical publication planning involves developing a detailed plan that outlines the timely presentation of verified scientific and clinical data to appropriate types of healthcare professionals such as [[physician]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[nurse]]s, as a drug undergoes [[clinical trial]]s and after it is [[Marketing|marketed]]. Because of scientific and therapeutic advances, pharmaceutical publication planning has become a well-established and important function by [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] in order to educate healthcare professionals accordingly about new drugs and marketed drugs with new [[Clinical significance|clinical uses]] or [[safety]] information. 

Within pharmaceutical companies, publication planning is usually overseen by medical or clinical affairs professionals. In this effort, pharmaceutical companies frequently use the assistance of medical communication agencies with publication planning expertise and professional [[Medical writing|medical writers]].

==Medical communication agencies==

Medical communication agencies include a broad range of organizations, including those that focus largely or exclusively on publication planning. When developing and executing a publication plan on behalf of a pharmaceutical or [[biotechnology]] client, medical communication agencies employ professional publication strategists, scientific medical directors, medical writers and project managers. Working as a team, this group of individuals delves deep into their client's scientific discoveries, and propose the most effective and efficient ways to spread the word about new potential therapies to physicians and other healthcare providers. 

There has been some discussion in the [[Media (communication)|media]] regarding disclosure as it pertains to the use of [[medical writing|professional medical writers]] in this endeavor. Some agencies and professional organizations focused on publication planning have been and continue to develop and refine [[Ethics|ethical]] guidelines and standards for disclosure and transparency.

== Professional publication planning associations ==
Professional organizations for individuals involved in pharmaceutical publication planning include the [[International Society of Medical Publication Professionals]] (ISMPP) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ismpp.org|title=ISMPP Home|author=MemberClicks Admin|work=ismpp.org|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The International Publication Planning Association]] (TIPPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicationplanningassociation.org|title=Healthcare Education Associates|work=publicationplanningassociation.org|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of these organizations is to create a forum where individuals involved with pharmaceutical publication planning and [[Medical research|biomedical]] publications can meet and share knowledge and experience. They serve to promote career opportunities and [[professional development]] of individuals involved with pharmaceutical publication planning, as well as to promote standards of excellence in ethical professional medical writing and the biomedical publication process in disseminating scientific and clinical data on pharmaceutical products. 

In 2009, ISMPP began a certification program for publication planning professionals.

There are numerous issues affecting the '''safety and health''' of '''police officers''', including line of duty deaths and [[occupational stress]].

== Line of duty deaths ==
[[File:PoliceofficermemorialHoustonTX.JPG|thumb|Memorial to a fallen police officer at the [[Texas Department of Public Safety]] Houston Webster Office in [[Houston]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/pr102908.pdf Houston Dacoma Driver License office to close for expansion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705231446/http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/pr102908.pdf |date=2009-07-05 }}." [[Texas Department of Public Safety]]. October 29, 2008. Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Reference is to confirm that the Webster office is in Houston, *not* Webster--&gt;]]

Line of duty deaths are deaths which occur while an officer is conducting his or her appointed duties. Despite the increased risk of being a victim of a homicide, automobile accidents are the most common cause of officer deaths. Officers are more likely to be involved in traffic accidents because of their large amount of time spent conducting vehicle patrols, or directing traffic, as well as their work outside their vehicles alongside or on the roadway, or in dangerous pursuits. Officers killed by suspects make up a smaller proportion of deaths. In the U.S. in 2005, 156 line of duty deaths were recorded of which 44% were from assaults on officers, 35% vehicle related (only 3% during vehicular pursuits) and the rest from other causes: heart attacks during arrests/foot/vehicular pursuits, falling from heights during foot chases, diseases contracted either from suspects' body fluids or, more rarely, from [[window period]] emergency [[blood transfusions]] received after motor vehicle accidents, shootings, stabbings, accidental gun discharges or falls that result in blood loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/search/year?year=2005|title=Honoring Officers Killed in the Year 2005|date=|publisher=Odmp.org|accessdate=2010-05-22}} See also [http://www.odmp.org/search/year?year=2011 2011 figures]&lt;/ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/online-rants-rightwing-extremism-fuel-fears-for-us-cops-225012920.html]

Police officers who die in the line of duty, especially those who die from the actions of suspects or in accidents or heart attacks, are often given elaborate funerals, attended by large numbers of fellow officers. Their families may also be entitled to special pensions. Fallen officers are often remembered in public memorials, such as the [[National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial]] in the U.S., the [[National Police Memorial (United Kingdom)|National Police Memorial]] in the U.K. and the Scottish Police Memorial, at the [[Scottish Police College]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], in the 10 years from April 2000 there were 143 line of duty deaths: 54 in road accidents travelling to or from duty, 46 in road accidents on duty, 23 from natural causes on duty, 15 from criminal acts, and 5 in other accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policememorial.org.uk/Rolls_of_Honour/Statistics/Statistics_2000-2009.htm|title=UK Police Line of Duty Fatalities by Cause of Death, April 2000 to March 2010|date=|publisher=Policememorial.org.uk|accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Great Britain, police do not normally carry firearms.  Officers in Northern Ireland are routinely armed.

The [[Singapore Police Force]] registered [[List of Singapore police officers killed in the line of duty|just over 100 deaths]] in a century up to the year 2000. There have been 28 [[List of New Zealand police officers killed in the line of duty|New Zealand police officers killed]] by criminals since 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10531709|title=Policeman 28th killed in line of duty|date=11 September 2008|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work stress ==
[[File:The Buffalo Cardio-metabolic Occupational Police Stress (BCOPS) Study.webm|thumb|A video on the Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress study]]

=== Indicators ===
The actual presence of stress in police work is well documented and evidenced by certain statistics. Researchers typically use suicide, divorce and alcoholism rates as three key indexes of stress in a group of people.&lt;ref name="tearsofacop1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tearsofacop.com/police/articles/constant.html|title=Not So Obvious Police Stress|date=|publisher=Tearsofacop.com|accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors paint a compelling picture of police officers demonstrating signs of significant stress, for example:

* A study in the United States, by National Surveillance of Police Suicide Study (NSOPS), showed 141 suicides in 2008 and 143 in 2009. This yields a suicide rate of 17/100,000, a figure that holds up under scrutiny and is consistent with CDC/NOMS data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Violanti|first2=J. M.|date=Winter 2009|title=Police suicide- A web surveillance of national data|journal=Journal of Emergency Mental Health|volume=11|issue=1|last1=O'Hara|first1=A. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall suicide rate in the United States was 11.3 suicide deaths per 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-in-the-us-statistics-and-prevention/index.shtml|title=Suicide in the U.S.: Statistics and Prevention|publisher=NIMH|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some speculation or controversy that this official rate may understate the actual rate as it is often other police officers that report facts that lead to a cause of death determination, and death benefits, institutional image, and other factors may be incentives to misreport incident facts. It is speculated that some suicides are reported by fellow officers as accidents or as deaths in the line of duty perpetrated by unknown assailants. Also, many jurisdictions simply don't keep suicide statistics. Even though the information is incomplete, the available statistics suggest that police officers are more likely to commit suicide than the general population. However, there is still controversy in the interpretation of these statistics. When comparisons are made within age, gender, and racial cohorts, the differences are much less dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;Aamodt MG, Stalnaker NA. Police officer suicide: frequency and officer profiles. In Sheehan D, Warren J, eds. Suicide and Law Enforcement. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office;2002:383-98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan D, Warren J, eds. Suicide and Law Enforcement. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Although suicides may be notably more prevalent among police, it is not clear whether police suicides are the result of work stress or the consequence of other variables, such as the influence of a subculture of violence&lt;ref&gt;W C Terry, Police Stress – The Empirical Evidence, Journal of Police Science and Administration Volume:9 Issue:1 Dated:(March 1981) Pages:61–75.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Police officers are not more likely to experience interpersonal relationship problems. In a 2009 study, the divorce rates of law enforcement personnel were compared with the rates for other occupations, where data was analyzed from the 2000 U.S. Census. The results of the analysis indicate that the divorce rate for law enforcement personnel is lower than that of the general population, even after controlling for demographic and other job-related variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Aamodt|first2=M. G.|date=Spring 2010|title=A comparison of law enforcement divorce rates with those of other occupations|journal=Journal of Police &amp; Criminal Psychology|last1=McCoy|first1=S. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The propensity to domestic violence is also thought to be higher for police officers than the general population, though the statistics are very fuzzy and controversial. Police officers also seem to have relationship problems at work, typically with superiors or with political oversight, though the evidence is largely anecdotal and controversial.
* Alcoholism is considered another aberrant statistic for police officers. Although the statistics are fuzzy, clinically treated alcohol addiction rates are usually calculated to be about twice as high for police officers than for the general population in the United States. In contrast, statistics documenting alcohol abuse are less precise. Rates for arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol, or DUI or DWI, are somewhat higher for police officers than for other drivers, but the statistics are not widely trusted outside of the insurance industry since it is other police officers that make DUI arrests. Some departments and even some individual officers tend to hold police officers to a higher behavioral and ethical standard while others will recognize a 'blue line' behind which those within the 'brotherhood' are not held to the same standards as the rest of society. Despite the controversies in the interpretation of the statistics, it is generally considered evident that police officers are more susceptible to alcohol abuse than other occupations. The same conclusions are usually made regarding the police abuse of other substances, though the statistics are even less accurate, and even though the higher rates of substance abuse may be due in part to the more ready access to drugs and the more permissive atmosphere 'behind the blue line' rather than to [[Occupational stress|occupational stresses]].

As one would expect, being a police officer or having a career in criminal justice in any capacity will bring on stress. It is important to know how to cope positively to ensure you are always successful and safe. Some things that can help are avoiding negative treatments (drugs/alcohol), seeking additional help if one cannot handle the stress alone, and most importantly to stay healthy and happy.

Many people turn to negative solutions when presented with stress and that is never good. What I mean by this is drugs, alcohol, or even something as simple as having a poor diet. There is a myth in society today that some drugs can take away stress and that is why they get so widely abused, however, some drugs just make one forget about their problems while others make people more susceptible to stress. Marijuana is one of the most widely abused drugs in the world, and people use this drug thinking it will make all their problems go away. However, when one comes out of their “high” the stressors are still present and there has been nothing done to help solve them.

To avoid encountering stress here are some things one can do. Get a sufficient amount of sleep every night, waking up tired and in a bad mood increases the chances of becoming stressed. Physical exercise and a healthy diet are also crucial. If the body is healthy then the mind is more likely to be healthy. Having a life outside of one’s career can help greatly as well. Spending time with friends or family outside of one’s job can also help manage stress by taking one’s mind off whatever situation is disturbing them. Finally, perhaps the most important tool when dealing with stress is knowing what is worth becoming stressed out about. Focus on aspects of life that can be controlled, and do not worry as much about factors that are out of control.

If one is struggling with stress to the point where it is affecting every day activity, then seeking out council from a professional is a good option. Speaking and expressing oneself is a very effective treatment for stress. Understandably, not everyone can get access to professional help whether it be because of finances or just not enough time. For those people it can also be helpful to journal thoughts, goals, or anything that will help express how one feels. Also, being patient is key, nobody will solve all their problems in a short amount of time. It is imperative to give yourself time to heal from any situation that gives one stress and then come back and focus on why that particular instance is causing so many problems.

When one hears “stress” a negative connotation is automatically attached to the word, although not all stress is bad. It can be a very good thing when used properly. Without being a little stressed out every now and then one would not be motivated to accomplish anything. The trick is finding the balance of healthy stress and how much is too overwhelming. The information above is a great start to coping and eventually overcoming stress. It is impossible to avoid stress entirely, but if one uses these tips it becomes easier and easier to manage with time.

Hans Selye, the foremost researcher in stress in the world{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}, said that police work is "the most stressful occupation in America even surpassing the formidable stresses of air traffic control."&lt;ref name="tearsofacop1" /&gt;

Other researchers, though, claim that police officers are more psychologically healthy than the general population. Police officers are increasingly more educated, more likely to engage in a regular program of exercise and to consume less alcohol and tobacco, and increasingly family-oriented. Healthy behavior patterns typically observed at entry training usually continue throughout the career of an officer. Even though the presence of occupation related stress seems to be well documented, it is highly controversial. Many within the law enforcement industry claim the propagation of incorrect suicide, divorce, and substance abuse statistics comes from people or organizations with political or social agendas, and that the presence of these beliefs within the industry makes it hard for health workers to help police officers in need of treatment to deal with the fear of negative consequences from police work which is necessary to enable police officers to develop a healthy expectancy of success in treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/employee-development/482217-1.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415073419/http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/employee-development/482217-1.html|date=April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In August 2014, the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] revealed that 8 out of every 10 law enforcement officers are overweight. This sparked some Police Departments to improve their officers' overall fitness. Assistant Chief Jeff Bryan of Garland, Texas stated, "I think it's important for all of us to keep the weight down and stay in shape-especially this job. The stress that we incur at this job... this is a great way to relieve stress and to keep the blood pressure down."&lt;ref name="CBS-overweight"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/08/14/fbi-80-percent-of-police-officers-are-overweight/|title=FBI: 80 Percent Of Police Officers Are Overweight|date=August 14, 2014|publisher=CBS|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian policemen are required to participate in an exercise program because. In 2009, Mexican police also "set up a nutrition education program." In 2011, Russia's interior ministry warned its police officers, "lose weight or lose your job."

Even though the presence of occupational stresses appear to be well documented, though not without controversy, the causes of workplace stress are comparatively unclear or even a matter of conjecture.

Although individual policemen and institutional public relations typically cite the risks of being killed in the line of duty as the predominant source of stress for individual policemen, there is significant controversy regarding the causes of personal workplace stress due to the fact that the actual risk of being killed is so small relative to other occupations.

It is charged that the myth of the high risks of occupational mortality connected with police work is often propagated by the law enforcement community as part of its institutional advancement and a central element in its public relations. Actual homicides of police are comparatively rare, but the reports of such incidents are typically reported in the press along with quotes by police officials or police officer family members stressing the notion that police officers 'put their lives on the line for the public' or 'risk their lives everyday', making it look like individual policemen routinely place themselves in mortal danger for low pay and little recognition, and that the view of police work as 'combat' is the source of police occupational stress indications.

Another explanation often advanced is the idea that police officers will undergo some traumatic experience in their police work that they never recover from, leading to suicide, divorce, etc. However, since the effects of such traumatic stresses is readily recognized, there are usually proactive programs in place to help individual police officers deal with the psychological effects of a traumatic event. Unfortunately, there is some evidence that such programs are actually ineffective, especially group therapies, may re-traumatize the participant, weaken coping mechanisms, and contribute to the development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref&gt;Rose S, Bisson J, Wessely S. Psychological debriefing for preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Cochrane Review). In The Cochrane Library, Issue 3. Oxford: Update Software, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan Z, Iancu I, Bo E. A review of psychological debriefing after extreme stress. Psychiatr Serv 2001;52:824-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raphael B, Wilson JP, eds. Psychological Debriefing: Theory, Practice and Evidence. Cambridge University Press;2000:357&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations where police officers and other emergency workers, such as firemen, experience the same traumatic event, it is more likely that the police officer will have difficulty dealing with the long term emotional effects of the traumatic event. On this observation, some of the academic literature suggests that along these lines the causes of occupational stress is more complex for police officers. Stress in police work is often present in other occupations, but not in an ongoing capacity. One line of thinking is that the individual stresses of police work produce a condition of chronic stress. Police officers encounter stressors in call after call which sap their emotional strength. Debilitation from this daily stress accumulates making officers more vulnerable to traumatic incidents and normal pressures of life. The weakening process is often too slow to see; neither a person nor his friends are aware of the damage being done. The effects of chronic stresses is two-fold:

* First, prolonged stress causes people to regress. Their psychological growth reverses, and they become more immature. They rapidly become more childish and primitive, much like a person being sick for several days becoming more irritable and childish in its demands on other people.
* Second, chronic stress numbs people's sensitivity. They can't stand to continually see human misery. They must stop feeling or they won't survive. The mind has this defense mechanism so people can continue working in horrible situations. If they kept their normal sensitivity, they would fall apart. As they become insensitive to their own suffering, they become insensitive to the suffering of others. When treated with indignity, they lose not only a sense of their own dignity but also the dignity of others. The pain of others stops bothering them, and they are no longer bothered when they hurt others.

The daily work of a police officer involves certain paradoxes and conflicts which may be difficult to deal with, the predominant examples are&lt;ref name="tearsofacop1" /&gt;

* Interaction with the public, whether socially or officially, such as in a traffic stop, involves a risk of physical harm. Being on guard for an attack and treating every interpersonal situation with affirmative commands makes the police officer appear brutal and detached, limits his actual effectiveness with the public and engenders chronic stress.
[[File:Wayne_County_Sheriff_Deputy_with_Reising_submachine_gun.JPG|thumb|US [[deputy sheriff]] with a [[M50 Reising|Reising submachine gun]]]]
* A police department is a paramilitary organization. Policies, regulations, and procedures cover every facet of police work. Everything is expected to be done by the book with substantial repercussions, including civil and criminal liability, for varying from the expectations of operating procedures. Often the facts of a situation require a course of action that does not follow procedures. If he follows procedures exactly, he knows he won't fully help the public, and the public will think he is shirking his responsibility. If the officer follows his own judgment, he is taking a risk. The community and department expect officers to use judgment, but when they do, there is a danger they will be disciplined; another unnatural no-win situation engendering chronic stress.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* Police officers tend to become socially isolated. The reasons given for this isolation are lack of department support, a perceived sense of alienation from the residents of the community where they patrol, the degree of urbanism ("Big City"), and "anti-police" judicial verdicts. When a group of people are isolated they become disoriented and confused. Ironically an isolated class are usually the ones losing real world wisdom and tend to judge from a very limited perspective, leading to more stress.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "Community Alienation and Its Impact on Police," ''The Police Chief'', Oct. 1999, 150–53. [https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=179401]&lt;/ref&gt;

A more anecdotal view looks at specific sources of stress in police work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heavybadge.com/efstress.htm|title=Effects of Stress on police officers|date=|publisher=Heavybadge.com|accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of stress most often actually cited are:

* The fear of killing someone in the line of duty.
* Feeling at least partially responsible for getting your partner or somebody else killed in the line of duty.
* Lack of support by the department or superiors.
* The scheduling of work and irregular work demands resulting in a disruption of family time or family events or activities.

Other more academic studies have produced similar lists, but may include items that the more anecdotal surveys do not reveal, such as 'exposure to neglected, battered, or dead children.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=80993|title=Police Stress Survey – Sources of Stress in Law Enforcement|last2=Westberry|first2=L.G.|last3=Grier|first3=K. S.|last4=Greenfield|first4=G.|first1=C. D.|last1=Spielberger|work=University of South Florida Human Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, the actual fear of occupational death or physical harm is not high on the list of stress sources.

There have been numerous academic studies on the specific sources of police stress, and most conclude organizational culture and workload as the key issues in officer stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gibbs|first2=A. C. C.|date=June 2003|title=Stress in police officers: a study of the origins, prevalence and severity of stress-related symptoms within a county police force|url=http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/53/4/256|journal=Occupational Medicine|volume=53|pages=256–264|doi=10.1093/occmed/kqg061|last1=Collins|first1=P. A.|number=4|accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traumatic events are usually concluded to not be of sufficient scope or prevalence to account for prevalence of suicide, divorce, and substance abuse abnormalities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9467">'''Quantitative risk assessment (QRA) software''' and methodologies give [[wikt:Special:Search/quantitative#Adjective|quantitative]] estimates of risks, given the parameters defining them. They are used in the financial sector, the chemical process industry, and other areas.

In financial terms, quantitative risk assessments include a calculation of the [[single loss expectancy]] of monetary value of an asset.

In the chemical process and petrochemical industries a QRA is primarily concerned with determining the potential loss of life (PLL) caused by undesired events. Specialist software can be used to model the effects of such an event, and to help calculate the potential loss of life.  Some organisations use the risk outputs to assess the implied cost to avert a fatality (ICAF) which can be used to set quantified criteria for what is an unacceptable risk and what is tolerable.

For the explosives industry, QRA can be used for many explosive risk applications.  It is especially useful for site risk analysis when reliance on quantity distance (QD) tables is not feasible.

==Limitations==
Some of the QRA software models described above must be used in isolation: for example the results from a consequence model cannot be used directly in a risk model. Other QRA software programs link different calculation modules together automatically to facilitate the process. Some of the software is proprietary and can only be used within certain organisations.

Due to the large amount of data processing required by QRA calculations, the usual approach has been to use two-dimensional ellipses to represent hazard zones such as the area around an explosion which poses a 10% chance of fatality. Similarly, a pragmatic approach is used in the simplification of dispersion results. Typically a flat terrain, unobstructed world is used to determine the behaviour of a dispersing cloud and/or a vaporizing pool. This presents problems when the effects of non-flat terrain or the complex geometry of process plants would no doubt affect the behaviour of a dispersing cloud.  Though they have limitations, the 2D hazard zone and simplified approach to 3D dispersion modelling allow the handling of large volumes of risk results with known assumptions to assist in decision-making. The [[trade-off]] shifts as computer processing power increases.

The modeling of the consequences of hazardous events in a [[true 3D]] manner may require a different approach, for example using a computational fluid dynamics method to study cloud dispersion over hilly terrain. The creation of CFD models requires significantly more investment of time on the part of the modeling analyst (because of the increased complexity of the modeling), which may not be justified in all cases.

One major limitation of QRA in the safety field is that it is focussed primarily on the loss of containment of hazardous fluids and what happens when they are released. This renders QRA somewhat unworkable in hazardous industries that do not focus on fluid containment yet are still subject to catastrophic events (e.g. aviation, pharmaceuticals,  mining, water treatment, etc.)  This has led to the development of a risk process that draws on the experience of organisations and their employees to produce risk assessments that produce potential loss of life (PLL) outputs without fault and event tree modelling.  This process is probably most commonly known by the name 
SQRA which was the first methodology to enter the marketplace in the late 1990s but is perhaps more accurately described by the term Experience-based Quantification (EBQ).  Today there is a choice of software with which to undertake this methodology and it has been used extensively in the mining industry on a global basis.

In an effort to be more fair and to avoid adding to already high imprisonment rates in the US, courts across America have started using quantitative risk assessment software when trying to make decisions about releasing people on bail and sentencing, which are based on their history and other attributes.&lt;ref name=ProPublica2016/&gt;  It analyzed [[recidivism]] risk scores calculated by one of the most commonly used tools, the Northpointe COMPAS system, and looked at outcomes over two years, and found that only 61% of those deemed high risk actually committed additional crimes during that period and that African-American defendants were far more likely to be given high scores that white defendants.&lt;ref name=ProPublica2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirchner|first1=Julia Angwin, Surya Mattu, Jeff Larson, Lauren|title=Machine Bias: There’s Software Used Across the Country to Predict Future Criminals.

After the repair process has been completed, there is a loss in the structure or function of the injured tissue. In this type of repair, it is common that granulation tissue (stromal connective tissue) proliferates to fill the defect created by the necrotic cells. The necrotic cells are then replaced by scar tissue. | url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?contentID=493 | access-date = 2012-12-07 | dead-url = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131110180450/http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?contentID=493 | archive-date = 2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where after the necrotic tissue comes [[fibrosis]].&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt; At its most elementary level, regeneration is mediated by the molecular processes of [[gene regulation]].&lt;ref name="Himeno92"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Himeno Y, Engelman RW, Good RA | title = Influence of calorie restriction on oncogene expression and DNA synthesis during liver regeneration | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 89 | issue = 12 | pages = 5497–501 | date = June 1992 | pmid = 1608960 | pmc = 49319 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.12.5497 | bibcode = 1992PNAS...89.5497H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant88"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bryant PJ, Fraser SE | title = Wound healing, cell communication, and DNA synthesis during imaginal disc regeneration in Drosophila | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 127 | issue = 1 | pages = 197–208 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 2452103 | doi = 10.1016/0012-1606(88)90201-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration in biology, however, mainly refers to the [[Morphogenesis|morphogenic]] processes that characterize the [[phenotypic plasticity]] of [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] allowing multi-cellular organisms to repair and maintain the integrity of their physiological and morphological states. Above the genetic level, regeneration is fundamentally regulated by asexual cellular processes.&lt;ref name="Brokes08"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brockes JP, Kumar A | title = Comparative aspects of animal regeneration | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 24 | pages = 525–49 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18598212 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.24.110707.175336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration is different from reproduction. For example, [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] perform regeneration but reproduce by the method of [[budding]].

The [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] and the [[planarian]] flatworm have long served as model organisms for their highly [[adaptation|adaptive]] regenerative capabilities.&lt;ref name="Sánchez00"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez Alvarado A | title = Regeneration in the metazoans: why does it happen? | journal = BioEssays | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 578–90 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10842312 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(200006)22:6&lt;578::AID-BIES11&gt;3.0.CO;2-# | url = http://planaria.neuro.utah.edu/publications/BioEssays.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once wounded, their cells become activated and start to remodel tissues and organs back to the pre-existing state.&lt;ref name="Reddien04"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddien PW, Sánchez Alvarado A | title = Fundamentals of planarian regeneration | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 20 | pages = 725–57 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15473858 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.095114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caudata]] ("urodeles"; [[salamander]]s and [[newt]]s), an [[Order (biology)|order]] of tailed [[amphibia]]ns, is possibly the most adept [[vertebrate]] group at regeneration, given their capability of regenerating limbs, tails, jaws, eyes and a variety of internal structures.&lt;ref name="Carlson07" /&gt; The regeneration of organs is a common and widespread adaptive capability among [[metazoa]]n creatures.&lt;ref name="Sánchez00" /&gt; In a related context, some animals are able to reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] through [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]], [[budding]], or [[fission (biology)|fission]].&lt;ref name="Brokes08" /&gt; A planarian parent, for example, will constrict, split in the middle, and each half generates a new end to form two [[Clone (cell biology)|clones]] of the original.&lt;ref name="Campbell_1996"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Campbell NA | title=Biology | edition=4th | year = 1996 | publisher=The Benjamin Cummings Publishing Company, Inc. | place=California | pages=1206 | isbn = 978-0-8053-1940-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Echinoderms]] (such as the sea star), crayfish, many reptiles, and amphibians exhibit remarkable examples of tissue regeneration. The case of [[autotomy]], for example, serves as a defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture. After the limb or tail has been autotomized, cells move into action and the tissues will regenerate.&lt;ref name="Wilkie01"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkie IC | title = Autotomy as a prelude to regeneration in echinoderms | journal = Microscopy Research and Technique | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 369–96 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11782069 | doi = 10.1002/jemt.1185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maiorana77"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maiorana VC | title=Tail autotomy, functional conflicts and their resolution by a salamander | journal=Nature | volume=2265 | issue=5594 | pages=533–535 | year=1977 | doi=10.1038/265533a0| bibcode=1977Natur.265..533M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maginnis06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maginnis TL | title=The costs of autotomy and regeneration in animals: a review and framework for future research | journal=Behavioral Ecology | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=857–872 | year=2006 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arl010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited regeneration of limbs occurs in most fishes and salamanders, and tail regeneration takes place in larval frogs and toads (but not adults). The whole limb of a salamander or a triton will grow again and again after amputation. In reptiles, chelonians, crocodilians and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts, but many (not all) kinds of lizards, geckos and iguanas possess regeneration capacity in a high degree. Usually, it involves dropping a section of their tail and regenerating it as part of a defense mechanism. While escaping a predator, if the predator catches the tail, it will disconnect.&lt;ref name="UCSB Science Line"&gt;{{Cite web|title = UCSB Science Line|url = http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=1103|website = scienceline.ucsb.edu|access-date = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecosystems==
{{main|regeneration (ecology)}}

Ecosystems can be regenerative. Following a disturbance, such as a fire or pest outbreak in a forest, [[Pioneer species|pioneering species]] will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and [[Assembly rules|community assembly]] process is known as regeneration in [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Dietze08"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1890/07-0271.1 | vauthors = Dietze MC, Clark JS | title=Changing the gap dynamics paradigm: Vegetative regenerative control on forest response to disturbance | journal=Ecological Monographs | volume=78 | issue=3 | pages=331–347 | url=http://coweeta.uga.edu/publications/10300.pdf | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey02"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0378-1127(01)00564-3 | vauthors = Bailey J, Covington WW | title=Evaluation ponderosa pine regeneration rates following ecological restoration treatments in northern Arizona, USA | journal=Forest Ecology and Management | volume=155 | pages=271–278 | url= http://library.eri.nau.edu/gsdl/collect/erilibra/index/assoc/HASH0e9a.dir/doc.pdf | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular molecular fundamentals==
Pattern formation in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by [[Regulation of gene expression|genetic induction factors]] that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as [[GAP-43]], [[tubulin]], [[actin]], an array of novel [[neuropeptide]]s, and [[cytokines]] that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage.&lt;ref name="Fu97"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu SY, Gordon T | title = The cellular and molecular basis of peripheral nerve regeneration | journal = Molecular Neurobiology | volume = 14 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 67–116 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9170101 | doi = 10.1007/BF02740621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the genes that are involved in the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the [[Primordium|primordia]] of [[zebrafish]] fins, for example, express four genes from the [[homeobox]] ''msx'' family during development and regeneration.&lt;ref name="akimenko96"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akimenko MA, Johnson SL, Westerfield M, Ekker M | title = Differential induction of four msx homeobox genes during fin development and regeneration in zebrafish | journal = Development | volume = 121 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–57 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 7768177 | url = http://dev.biologists.org/content/121/2/347.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tissues==
"Strategies include the rearrangement of pre-existing tissue, the use of adult [[Somatic cell|somatic]] [[stem cells]] and the dedifferentiation and/or transdifferentiation of cells, and more than one mode can operate in different tissues of the same animal.&lt;ref name="Birbrair 2298–2314"/&gt; All these strategies result in the re-establishment of appropriate tissue polarity, structure and form."&lt;ref name="Alvarado06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez Alvarado A, Tsonis PA | title = Bridging the regeneration gap: genetic insights from diverse animal models | journal = Nature Reviews.

Development and regeneration involves the coordination and organization of populations cells into a [[blastema]], which is "a mound of stem cells from which regeneration begins".&lt;ref name="Kumar07"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar A, Godwin JW, Gates PB, Garza-Garcia AA, Brockes JP | title = Molecular basis for the nerve dependence of limb regeneration in an adult vertebrate | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5851 | pages = 772–7 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17975060 | pmc = 2696928 | doi = 10.1126/science.1147710 | bibcode = 2007Sci...318..772K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedifferentiation of cells means that they lose their tissue-specific characteristics as tissues remodel during the regeneration process. This should not be confused with the  transdifferentiation of cells which is when they lose their tissue-specific characteristics during the regeneration process, and then re-differentiate to a different kind of cell.&lt;ref name="Alvarado06" /&gt;

Many [[annelid]]s (segmented worms) are capable of regeneration.&lt;ref name=Bely2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bely AE | title = Distribution of segment regeneration ability in the Annelida | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 508–18 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 21672762 | doi = 10.1093/icb/icj051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[Chaetopterus variopedatus]]'' and ''[[Branchiomma nigromaculata]]'' can regenerate both anterior and posterior body parts after latitudinal bisection.&lt;ref name=Hill1972&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill SD | title = Caudal regeneration in the absence of a brain in two species of sedentary polychaetes | journal = Journal of Embryology and Experimental Morphology | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 667–80 | date = December 1972 | pmid = 4655324 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between [[somatic cell|somatic]] and [[germline]] stem cell regeneration has been studied at the molecular level in the annelid ''[[Capitella teleta]]''.&lt;ref name=Giani2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giani VC, Yamaguchi E, Boyle MJ, Seaver EC | title = Somatic and germline expression of piwi during development and regeneration in the marine polychaete annelid Capitella teleta | journal = EvoDevo | volume = 2 | issue =  | pages = 10 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21545709 | pmc = 3113731 | doi = 10.1186/2041-9139-2-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Leeches]], however, appear incapable of segmental regeneration.&lt;ref name="Zoran"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Regeneration in Annelids | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|date = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-470-01590-2 | doi = 10.1002/9780470015902.a0022103 | first = Mark J | last = Zoran | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their close relatives, the [[Branchiobdellida|branchiobdellids]], are also incapable of segmental regeneration.&lt;ref name="Zoran" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bely2006"/&gt; However, certain individuals, like the lumbriculids, can regenerate from only a few segments.&lt;ref name="Zoran" /&gt; Segmental regeneration in these animals is epimorphic and occurs through [[blastema]] formation.&lt;ref name="Zoran" /&gt; Segmental regeneration has been gained and lost during annelid evolution, as seen in [[oligochaetes]], where head regeneration has been lost three separate times.&lt;ref name="Zoran" /&gt;

Along with epimorphosis, some [[polychaetes]] like ''[[Sabella pavonina]]'' experience morphallactic regeneration.&lt;ref name="Zoran" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bely AE | title = Early events in annelid regeneration: a cellular perspective | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 688–99 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25122930 | doi = 10.1093/icb/icu109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morphallaxis involves the de-differentiation, transformation, and re-differentation of cells to regenerate tissues. How prominent morphallactic regeneration is in [[oligochaetes]] is currently not well understood. Although relatively under-reported, it is possible that morphallaxis is a common mode of inter-segment regeneration in annelids. Following regeneration in ''L. variegatus'', past posterior segments sometimes become anterior in the new body orientation, consistent with morphallaxis.

Following amputation, most annelids are capable of sealing their body via rapid muscular contraction. Constriction of body muscle can lead to infection prevention. In certain species, such as ''[[Limnodrilus]]'', [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] can be seen within hours after amputation in the [[ectoderm]] and [[mesoderm]]. Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug.

===Echinoderms===

Tissue regeneration is widespread among echinoderms and has been well documented in [[starfish]] ''(Asteroidea)'', [[sea cucumber]]s ''(Holothuroidea)'', and [[sea urchin]]s ''(Echinoidea).'' Appendage regeneration in echinoderms has been studied since at least the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Candia Carnevali MD, Bonasoro F, Patruno M, Thorndyke MC | title = Cellular and molecular mechanisms of arm regeneration in crinoid echinoderms: the potential of arm explants | journal = Development Genes and Evolution | volume = 208 | issue = 8 | pages = 421–30 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9799422 | doi = 10.1007/s004270050199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to appendages, some species can regenerate internal organs and parts of their central nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = San Miguel-Ruiz JE, Maldonado-Soto AR, García-Arrarás JE | title = Regeneration of the radial nerve cord in the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima | journal = BMC Developmental Biology | volume = 9 | pages = 3 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19126208 | pmc = 2640377 | doi = 10.1186/1471-213X-9-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to injury starfish can autotomize damaged appendages. Autotomy is the self-amputation of a body part, usually an appendage. &amp;nbsp;Depending on severity, starfish will then go through a four-week process where the appendage will be regenerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patruno M, Thorndyke MC, Candia Carnevali MD, Bonasoro F, Beesley PW | title = Growth factors, heat-shock proteins and regeneration in echinoderms | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 204 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 843–8 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11171408 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/5/843 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species must retain mouth cells in order to regenerate an appendage, due to the need for energy.&lt;ref name="Morgan_1900" /&gt;  The first organs to regenerate, in all species documented to date, are associated with the digestive tract. Thus, most knowledge about visceral regeneration in holothurians concerns this system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = García-Arrarás JE, Greenberg MJ | title = Visceral regeneration in holothurians | journal = Microscopy Research and Technique | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 438–51 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11782073 | doi = 10.1002/jemt.1189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planaria (Platyhelminthes)===

Regeneration research using [[Planarian]]s began in the late 1800s and was popularized by T.H. Morgan at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Morgan_1900"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Regeneration in Planarians | vauthors = Morgan TH | date = 1900 | journal = Archiv für Entwicklungsmechanik der Organismen | volume= 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–119 | doi = 10.1007/BF02156347 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado and Philip Newmark transformed planarians into a model genetic organism in the beginning of the 20th century to study the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration in these animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez Alvarado A, Newmark PA | title = The use of planarians to dissect the molecular basis of metazoan regeneration | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 413–20 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9824561 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals. In one experiment, T.H. Morgan found that a piece corresponding to 1/279th of a planarian&lt;ref name="Morgan_1900" /&gt; or a fragment with as few as 10,000 cells can successfully regenerate into a new worm within one to two weeks.&lt;ref name="Montgomery_1974"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montgomery JR, Coward SJ | title = On the minimal size of a planarian capable of regeneration | journal = Transactions of the American Microscopical Society | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | pages = 386–91 | date = July 1974 | pmid = 4853459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After amputation, stump cells form a [[blastema]] formed from neoblasts, pluripotent cells found throughout the planarian body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elliott SA, Sánchez Alvarado A | title = The history and enduring contributions of planarians to the study of animal regeneration | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–26 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23799578 | doi = 10.1002/wdev.82 | pmc = 3694279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New tissue grows from neoblasts with neoblasts comprising between 20 and 30% of all planarian cells.&lt;ref name="Montgomery_1974" /&gt; Recent work has confirmed that neoblasts are totipotent since one single neoblast can regenerate an entire irradiated animal that has been rendered incapable of regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner DE, Wang IE, Reddien PW | title = Clonogenic neoblasts are pluripotent adult stem cells that underlie planarian regeneration | journal = Science | volume = 332 | issue = 6031 | pages = 811–6 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21566185 | doi = 10.1126/science.1203983 | pmc = 3338249 | bibcode = 2011Sci...332..811W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent starvation a planarian will use their own cells for energy, this phenomenon is known as de-growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddien PW, Sánchez Alvarado A | title = Fundamentals of planarian regeneration | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 20 | issue =  | pages = 725–57 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15473858 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.095114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphibians===
Limb regeneration in the [[axolotl]] and [[newt]] has been extensively studied and researched. Urodele amphibians, such as salamanders and newts, display the highest regenerative ability among tetrapods.&lt;ref name="Brockes_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brockes JP, Kumar A, Velloso CP | title = Regeneration as an evolutionary variable | journal = Journal of Anatomy | volume = 199 | issue = Pt 1-2 | pages = 3–11 | date = 2001 | pmid = 11523827 | pmc = 1594962 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they can fully regenerate their limbs, tail, jaws, and retina via epimorphic regeneration leading to functional replacement with new tissue.&lt;ref name="Brockes_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brockes JP, Kumar A | title = Plasticity and reprogramming of differentiated cells in amphibian regeneration | journal = Nature Reviews.

[[File:AxolotlBE.jpg|thumbnail|[[Axolotl]]s can regenerate a variety of structures, including their limbs]]

After amputation, the epidermis migrates to cover the stump in  1–2 hours, forming a structure called the wound epithelium (WE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Satoh A, Bryant SV, Gardiner DM | title = Nerve signaling regulates basal keratinocyte proliferation in the blastema apical epithelial cap in the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 366 | issue = 2 | pages = 374–81 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22537500 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.03.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epidermal cells continue to migrate over the WE, resulting in a thickened, specialized signaling center called the apical epithelial cap (AEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christensen RN, Tassava RA | title = Apical epithelial cap morphology and fibronectin gene expression in regenerating axolotl limbs | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 217 | issue = 2 | pages = 216–24 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10706145 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1097-0177(200002)217:2&lt;216::aid-dvdy8&gt;3.0.co;2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several days there are changes in the underlying stump tissues that result in the formation of a [[blastema]] (a mass of dedifferentiated proliferating cells).

In spite of the historically few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable progress has been made recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') as a model genetic organism. This progress has been facilitated by advances in [[genomics]], [[bioinformatics]], and [[somatic cell]] [[transgenesis]] in other fields, that have created the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of important biological properties, such as limb regeneration, in the axolotl.&lt;ref name="stepwise"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Endo T, Bryant SV, Gardiner DM | title = A stepwise model system for limb regeneration | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 270 | issue = 1 | pages = 135–45 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15136146 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.02.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC) is a self-sustaining, breeding colony of the axolotl supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] as a Living Stock Collection. Located at the University of Kentucky, the AGSC is dedicated to supplying genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to laboratories throughout the United States and abroad. An [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]-funded NCRR grant has led to the establishment of the Ambystoma EST database, the Salamander Genome Project (SGP) that has led to the creation of the first amphibian gene map and several annotated molecular data bases, and the creation of the research community web portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Voss SR, Muzinic L, Zimmerman G | url = http://www.ambystoma.org | title = Sal-Site | work = Ambystoma.org | date = 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydra ===
[[Hydra (genus)|''Hydra'']] is a genus of freshwater [[polyp]] in the phylum [[Cnidaria]] with highly proliferative [[stem cells]] that gives them the ability to regenerate their entire body.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bosch TC | title = Why polyps regenerate and we don't: towards a cellular and molecular framework for Hydra regeneration | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 303 | issue = 2 | pages = 421–33 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17234176 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.12.012 | publisher = Elsevier }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any fragment larger than a few hundred [[epithelial]] cells that is isolated from the body has the ability to regenerate into a smaller version of itself.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; The high proportion of stem cells in the hydra supports its efficient regenerative ability.&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wenger Y, Buzgariu W, Reiter S, Galliot B | title = Injury-induced immune responses in Hydra | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 277–94 | date = August 2014 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2014.06.004 | publisher = Elsevier }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regeneration among hydra occurs as foot regeneration arising from the basal part of the body, and head regeneration, arising from the apical region.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; Regeneration tissues that are cut from the gastric region contain polarity, which allows them to distinguish between regenerating a head in the apical end and a foot in the basal end so that both regions are present in the newly regenerated organism.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; Head regeneration requires complex reconstruction of the area, while foot regeneration is much simpler, similar to tissue repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buzgariu W, Crescenzi M, Galliot B | title = Robust G2 pausing of adult stem cells in Hydra | journal = Differentiation; Research in Biological Diversity | volume = 87 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 83–99 | date = 2014 | doi = 10.1016/j.diff.2014.03.001 | publisher = Elsevier | others = Science Direct }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both foot and head regeneration, however, there are two distinct [[biochemical cascade|molecular cascades]] that occur once the tissue is wounded: early injury response and a subsequent, signal-driven pathway of the regenerating tissue that leads to [[cellular differentiation]].&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014" /&gt; This early-injury response includes epithelial cell stretching for wound closure, the migration of interstitial progenitors towards the wound, [[cell death]], [[phagocytosis]] of cell debris, and reconstruction of the extracellular matrix.&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014" /&gt;

===Aves (birds)===

Owing to a limited literature on the subject, birds are believed to have very limited regenerative abilities as adults.

Werber and Goldschmidt (1909) found that the goose and duck were capable of regenerating their beaks after partial amputation&lt;ref name="Vorontsova_1960" /&gt;  and Sidorova (1962) observed liver regeneration via hypertrophy in roosters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sidorova VF | title = Liver regeneration in birds | journal = Biulleten' Eksperimental'noi Biologii I Meditsiny | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 1426–9 | date = July 1962 | pmid = 14039265 | doi = 10.1007/BF00785312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds are also capable of regenerating the hair cells in their cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cotanche DA, Lee KH, Stone JS, Picard DA | title = Hair cell regeneration in the bird cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage | journal = Anatomy and Embryology | volume = 189 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8192233 | doi = 10.1007/BF00193125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this evidence, contemporary studies suggest reparative regeneration in avian species is limited to periods during embryonic development.

Similar to the physiological regeneration of hair in mammals, birds can regenerate their feathers in order to repair damaged feathers or to attract mates with their plumage. Typically, seasonal changes that are associated with breeding seasons will prompt a hormonal signal for birds to begin regenerating feathers. This has been experimentally induced using thyroid hormones in the Rhode Island Red Fowls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hosker | first = Anne | name-list-format = vanc | title = Regeneration of Feathers after Thyroid Feeding | date = 1936 | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 13 | pages = 344–351 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/13/3/344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, researchers discovered that two species of [[Spiny Mouse|African Spiny Mice]], ''Acomys kempi'' and ''Acomys percivali'', were capable of completely regenerating the [[autotomy|autotomically]] released or otherwise damaged tissue.

Despite these examples, it is generally accepted that adult [[mammal]]s have limited regenerative capacity compared to most [[vertebrate]] embryos/larvae, adult salamanders and fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Kevin | last = Xu | name-list-format = vanc | title = Humans' Ability To Regenerate Damaged Organs Is At Our Fingertips | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/how-regeneration-works-2013-7 | work = Business Insider | date = July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the regeneration therapy approach of [[Robert O.

Some researchers have also claimed that the [[Murphy Roths Large|MRL mouse]] strain exhibits enhanced regenerative abilities.

MRL mice are not protected against [[myocardial infarction]]; heart regeneration in adult mammals ([[neocardiogenesis]]) is limited, because heart muscle cells are nearly all [[G0 phase|terminally differentiated]].

{{main|Regeneration in humans}}

The regrowth of lost tissues or organs in the human body is being researched. Some tissues such as skin regrow quite readily; others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration, but ongoing research suggests that there is some hope for a variety of tissues and organs.&lt;ref name="Birbrair 2298–2314"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 = Su | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | name-list-format = vanc | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.2 complete regeneration: | work = Pathology | publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = After the repair process has been completed, the structure and function of the injured tissue are completely normal. This type of regeneration is common in physiological situations. Examples of physiological regeneration are the continual replacement of cells of the skin and repair of the endometrium after menstruation. Complete regeneration can occur in pathological situations in tissues that have good regenerative capacity. | url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?ContentID=492 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121207231322/http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?ContentID=492 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-12-07 | access-date = 2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human organs that have been regenerated include the bladder, vagina and the penis.&lt;ref name=regen2014104&gt;{{cite web | last =Mohammadi | first = Dara | name-list-format = vanc | title = Bioengineered organs: The story so far… | work = The Guardian | date = 4 October 2014 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/04/penis-transplants-anthony-atala-interview | access-date = 9 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As are all metazoans, humans are capable of physiological regeneration (i.e. the replacement of cells during homeostatic maintenance that does not necessitate injury). For example, the regeneration of red blood cells via erythropoiesis occurs through the maturation of erythrocytes from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, their subsequent circulation for around 90 days in the blood stream, and their eventual cell-death in the spleen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Principles of Regenerative Biology | vauthors = Carlson BM | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2007 | pages = 25–26 | isbn = 978-0-12-369439-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of physiological regeneration is the sloughing and rebuilding of a functional endometrium during each menstrual cycle in females in response to varying levels of circulating estrogen and progesterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferenczy A, Bertrand G, Gelfand MM | title = Proliferation kinetics of human endometrium during the normal menstrual cycle | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 133 | issue = 8 | pages = 859–67 | date = April 1979 | pmid = 434029 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(79)90302-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, humans are limited in their capacity for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury.&lt;ref name="Michalopoulos_1997"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michalopoulos GK, DeFrances MC | title = Liver regeneration | journal = Science | volume = 276 | issue = 5309 | pages = 60–6 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9082986 | doi = 10.1126/science.276.5309.60 | pmc = 2701258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taub_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taub R | title = Liver regeneration: from myth to mechanism | journal = Nature Reviews.

This response is considered cellular regeneration (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly hepatocytes), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained.&lt;ref name="Taub_2004" /&gt; This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways.&lt;ref name="Michalopoulos_1997" /&gt; The normal sequence of inflammation and regeneration does not function accurately in cancer. Specifically, cytokine stimulation of cells leads to expression of genes that change cellular functions and suppress the immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlahopoulos SA | title = Aberrant control of NF-κB in cancer permits transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity, to curtail dependence on host tissue: molecular mode | journal = Cancer Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–270 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28884042 | pmc = 5570602 | doi = 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult neurogenesis is also a form of cellular regeneration. For example, hippocampal neuron renewal occurs in normal adult humans at an annual turnover rate of 1.75% of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spalding KL, Bergmann O, Alkass K, Bernard S, Salehpour M, Huttner HB, Boström E, Westerlund I, Vial C, Buchholz BA, Possnert G, Mash DC, Druid H, Frisén J | title = Dynamics of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult humans | journal = Cell | volume = 153 | issue = 6 | pages = 1219–1227 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23746839 | pmc = 4394608 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiac myocyte renewal has been found to occur in normal adult humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergmann O, Bhardwaj RD, Bernard S, Zdunek S, Barnabé-Heider F, Walsh S, Zupicich J, Alkass K, Buchholz BA, Druid H, Jovinge S, Frisén J | title = Evidence for cardiomyocyte renewal in humans | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5923 | pages = 98–102 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19342590 | pmc = 2991140 | doi = 10.1126/science.1164680 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324...98B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at a higher rate in adults following acute heart injury such as infarction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beltrami AP, Urbanek K, Kajstura J, Yan SM, Finato N, Bussani R, Nadal-Ginard B, Silvestri F, Leri A, Beltrami CA, Anversa P | title = Evidence that human cardiac myocytes divide after myocardial infarction | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 344 | issue = 23 | pages = 1750–7 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11396441 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200106073442303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in adult myocardium following infarction, proliferation is only found in around 1% of myocytes around the area of injury, which is not enough to restore function of cardiac muscle. However, this may be an important target for regenerative medicine as it implies that regeneration of cardiomyocytes, and consequently of myocardium, can be induced.

Another example of reparative regeneration in humans is fingertip regeneration, which occurs after phalange amputation distal to the nail bed (especially in children)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McKim LH | title = REGENERATION OF THE DISTAL PHALANX | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 549–50 | date = May 1932 | pmid = 20318716 | pmc = 402335 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muneoka K, Allan CH, Yang X, Lee J, Han M | title = Mammalian regeneration and regenerative medicine | journal = Birth Defects Research.

'''Reproductive rights''' are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]] that vary amongst countries around the world.&lt;ref name="COOK"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2950752 |jstor=2950752 |title=Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=115–21 |year=1996 |last1=Cook |first1=Rebecca J. |last2=Fathalla |first2=Mahmoud F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] defines reproductive rights as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of [[discrimination]], [[coercion]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726150133/http://www.who.int//reproductive-health/gender/index.html |archivedate=2009-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Women's reproductive rights may include some or all of the following: the [[abortion-rights movements|right to legal and safe abortion]]; the right to [[birth control]]; freedom from [[compulsory sterilization|coerced sterilization]] and contraception; the right to access good-quality [[reproductive health]]care; and the right to [[family planning|education and access]] in order to make free and informed reproductive choices.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"/&gt; Reproductive rights may also include the right to receive [[sex education|education]] about [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] and other aspects of sexuality, and protection from practices such as [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/zavales4.html|title=Template|website=Nocirc.org|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights began to develop as a subset of [[human rights]] at the United Nation's 1968 International Conference on Human Rights.&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt; The resulting [[Non-binding resolution|non binding]] Proclamation of Tehran was the first international document to recognize one of these rights when it stated that: "Parents have a basic human right to determine [[Political freedom|freely]] and [[Moral responsibility|responsibly]] the number and the spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2939211 |pmid=8475521 |jstor=2939211 |title=Human Rights and Reproductive Choice |journal=Studies in Family Planning |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18–30 |year=1993 |last1=Freedman |first1=Lynn P. |last2=Isaacs |first2=Stephen L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teheran_proc&gt;{{cite web |title=Proclamation of Teheran|publisher=International Conference on Human Rights|year= 1968|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm|accessdate=2007-11-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017025912/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; States, though, have been slow in incorporating these rights in [[treaty|internationally legally binding instruments]]. Thus, while some of these rights have already been recognized in [[soft law|hard law]], that is, in legally binding [[international human rights instruments]], others have been mentioned only in non binding recommendations and, therefore, have at best the status of [[soft law]] in [[international law]], while a further group is yet to be accepted by the international community and therefore remains at the level of [[advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003):&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have been leaders in bringing arguments for a woman's right to choose abortion within the rubric of international human rights. However, there is no binding hard norm that recognizes women's right to terminate a pregnancy. (...) While there are hard norms prohibiting sex discrimination that apply to girl adolescents, these are problematic since they must be applied to a substantive right (i.e., the right to health) and the substantive reproductive rights of adolescents are not `hard' (yet!). There are no hard norms on age discrimination that would protect adolescents' ability to exercise their rights to reproductive health, sexual education, or reproductive decisionmaking. In addition, there are no hard norms prohibiting discrimination based on marital status, which is often an issue with respect to unmarried adolescents' access to reproductive health services and information. The soft norms support the idea that the hard norms apply to adolescents under 18. They also fill in the substantive gaps in the hard norms with respect to reproductive health services and information as well as adolescents' reproductive autonomy. (...) There are no hard norms in international human rights law that directly address HIV/AIDS directly. At the same time, a number of human rights bodies have developed soft norms to secure rights that are rendered vulnerable by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. (...) Practices with implications for women's reproductive rights in relation to HIV/AIDS are still not fully covered under existing international law, although soft norms have addressed them to some extent. (...) There is a lack of explicit prohibition of mandatory testing of HIV-positive pregnant women under international law. (...) None of the global human rights treaties explicitly prohibit child marriage and no treaty prescribes an appropriate minimum age for marriage. The onus of specifying a minimum age at marriage rests with the states' parties to these treaties. (...) We have to rely extensively on soft norms that have evolved from the TMBs and that are contained in conference documents to assert that child marriage is a violation of fundamental human rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues related to reproductive rights are some of the most vigorously contested rights' issues worldwide, regardless of the population's [[socioeconomic]] level, [[religion]] or [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of reproductive rights is frequently presented as being of vital importance in discussions and articles by [[List of population concern organizations|population concern organizations]] such as [[Population Matters]].&lt;ref name=popsearch&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Matters search on "reproductive rights"|url=http://populationmatters.org/search_results.php?q=%22reproductive+rights%22|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140627121618/http://populationmatters.org/search_results.php?q=%22reproductive+rights%22|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-06-27|website=Populationmatters.org/|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights are a subset of [[sexual and reproductive health and rights]].

==History==
===Proclamation of Tehran===
In 1945, the [[United Nations Charter]] included the obligation "to promote... universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race, sex, language, or religion". However, the Charter did not define these rights. Three years later, the [[United Nations|UN]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), the first international legal document to delineate [[human rights]]; the UDHR does not mention reproductive rights.  Reproductive rights began to appear as a subset of human rights in the 1968 Proclamation of Tehran, which states: "Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children".&lt;ref name=tehran_proc /&gt;

This right was affirmed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in the 1969 [[Declaration on Social Progress and Development]] which states "The family as a basic unit of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members, particularly children and youth, should be assisted and protected so that it may fully assume its responsibilities within the community. Parents have the exclusive right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/m_progre.htm|title=unhchr.ch|website=Unhchr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Women's Year#International|1975 UN International Women's Year Conference]] echoed the Proclamation of Tehran.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Cairo Programme of Action===
The twenty-year "Cairo Programme of Action" was adopted in 1994 at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]]. The [[Non-binding resolution|non-binding]] Programme of Action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals' reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. It recommended that [[family planning]] services be provided in the context of other reproductive health services, including services for healthy and safe childbirth, care for sexually transmitted infections, and post-abortion care. The ICPD also addressed issues such as [[violence against women]], [[sex trafficking]], and adolescent health.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=5–6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cairo Program is the first international policy document to define [[reproductive health]],&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/&gt; stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed [about] and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods for regulation of fertility which are not against the law, and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant [para. 72].&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike previous population conferences, a wide range of interests from grassroots to government level were represented in Cairo. 179 nations attended the ICPD and overall eleven thousand representatives from governments, [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]], international agencies and citizen activists participated.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/&gt; The ICPD did not address the far-reaching implications of the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS epidemic]]. In 1999, recommendations at the ICPD+5 were expanded to include commitment to AIDS education, research, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission, as well as to the development of vaccines and microbicides.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 7"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cairo Programme of Action was adopted by 184 UN member states. Nevertheless, many Latin American and Islamic states made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] to the programme, in particular, to its concept of reproductive rights and sexual freedom, to its treatment of abortion, and to its potential incompatibility with [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html|title=A/CONF.171/13: Report of the ICPD (94/10/18) (385k)|website=Un.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action varies considerably from country to country. In many countries, post-ICPD tensions emerged as the [[human rights]]-based approach was implemented. Since the ICPD, many countries have broadened their reproductive health programs and attempted to integrate maternal and child health services with family planning. More attention is paid to adolescent health and the consequences of unsafe abortion. Lara Knudsen observes that the ICPD succeeded in getting [[feminist]] language into governments' and population agencies' literature, but in many countries the underlying concepts are not widely put into practice.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 7"/&gt; In two preparatory meetings for the ICPD+10 in Asia and Latin America, the United States, under the George W. Bush Administration, was the only nation opposing the ICPD's Programme of Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beijing Platform===
The 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing, in its [[non-binding resolution|non-binding]] [[Beijing Declaration|Declaration]] and [[Beijing Platform for Action|Platform for Action]], supported the Cairo Programme's definition of reproductive health, but established a broader context of reproductive rights:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the integrity of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences [para. 96].&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Beijing Platform demarcated twelve interrelated critical areas of the human rights of women that require advocacy. The Platform framed women's reproductive rights as "indivisible, universal and inalienable human rights."&lt;ref name="BUNCH"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/495143 |jstor=3175048 |title=Beijing '95: Moving Women's Human Rights from Margin to Center |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=200–4 |year=1996 |last1=Bunch |first1=Charlotte |last2=Fried |first2=Susana }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yogyakarta Principles===
The [[Yogyakarta Principles]] on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, proposed by a group of experts in November 2006&lt;ref name=YOGYABOUT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en_about.htm|title=About the Yogyakarta Principles|website=Yogyakartaprinciples.org|accessdate=2017-08-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304122237/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en_about.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not yet incorporated by States in international law,&lt;ref&gt;International Service for Human Rights, [http://www.ishr.ch/archive-general-assembly/933-majority-of-ga-third-committee-unable-to-accept-report-on-the-human-right-to-sexual-education Majority of GA Third Committee unable to accept report on the human right to sexual education ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515111556/http://www.ishr.ch/archive-general-assembly/933-majority-of-ga-third-committee-unable-to-accept-report-on-the-human-right-to-sexual-education |date=2013-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; declares in its Preamble that "the [[international community]] has recognized the rights of persons to decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free from coercion, discrimination, and violence." In relation to reproductive health, Principle 9 on "The Right to Treatment with Humanity while in Detention" requires that "States shall... &lt;nowiki&gt;[p]rovide&lt;/nowiki&gt; adequate access to medical care and counseling appropriate to the needs of those in custody, recognizing any particular needs of persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity, including with regard to reproductive health, access to [[HIV/AIDS]] information and therapy and access to [[hormone therapy|hormonal]] or other therapy as well as to [[sex reassignment therapy|gender-reassignment treatments]] where desired."&lt;ref&gt;"The Yogyakarta Principles" Preamble and Principle 9. The Rights to Treatment with Humanity While in Detention&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, African, Caribbean and Islamic Countries, as well as the [[Russian Federation]], have objected to the use of these principles as Human Rights standards.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, Official Records, Third Committee, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/576/53/PDF/N0957653.pdf?OpenElement Summary record of the 29th meeting held in New York, on Monday, 25 October 2010, at 3 p.m] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927135721/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/576/53/PDF/N0957653.pdf?OpenElement |date=27 September 2012 }}. For instance, [[Malawi]], speaking on behalf of all African States, argued that the Yogyakarta Principles were "controversial and unrecognized," while the representative of the Russian Federation said that they "had not been agreed to at the intergovernmental level, and which therefore could not be considered as authoritative expressions of the opinion of the international community" (para. 9, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

===State abuses===
State abuses against reproductive rights have happened both under right-wing and left-wing governments. Such abuses include attempts to forcefully increase the birth rate - one of the most notorious [[natalist]] policies of the 20th century was that which occurred in [[communist Romania]] in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people - as well as attempts to decrease the fertility rate - [[China]]'s [[one child policy]] (1978-2015). State mandated [[forced marriage]] was also practiced by authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf |format=PDF|author=Natalae Anderson|title=Memorandum: Charging Forced Marriage as a Crime Against Humanity|date=September 22, 2010|website=D.dccam.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments have implemented [[eugenic]] policies of [[forced sterilizations]] of 'undesirable' population groups. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2148793.stm|title=BBC NEWS - World - Americas - Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2017-08-19|date=2002-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Human rights}}
Since most existing legally binding [[international human rights instruments]] do not explicitly mention sexual and reproductive rights, a [[Epistemic community (international relations)|broad coalition]] of NGOs, civil servants, and experts working in [[international organizations]] have been promoting a reinterpretation of those instruments to link the realization of the already internationally recognized human rights with the realization of reproductive rights.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/human-rights-defenders/issues/challenges/srr-defenders Defenders of Sexual and Reproductive Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002004052/http://www.amnesty.org/en/human-rights-defenders/issues/challenges/srr-defenders |date=2013-10-02 }}; [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3326&amp;Itemid=548 International Women’s Health Coalition and the United Nations],  [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=205&amp;Itemid=110 Campaign for an Inter-American Convention on Sexual and Reproductive Rights ], Women's Health Collection, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=105915323 Abortion as a human right: possible strategies in unexplored territory.

In this regard, the Center for Reproductive Rights has noted that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Our goal is to ensure that governments worldwide guarantee women's reproductive rights out of an understanding that they are bound to do so. The two principal prerequisites for achieving this goal are: (1) the strengthening of international legal norms protecting reproductive rights; and (2) consistent and effective action on the part of civil society and the international community to enforce these norms. Each of these conditions, in turn, depends upon profound social change at the local, national and international (including regional) levels. (...) Ultimately, we must persuade governments to accept reproductive rights as binding norms. Again, our approach can move forward on several fronts, with interventions both at the national and international levels. Governments' recognition of reproductive rights norms may be indicated by their support for progressive language in international conference documents or by their adoption and implementation of appropriate national-level legislative and policy instruments. In order to counter opposition to an expansion of recognized reproductive rights norms, we have questioned the credibility of such reactionary yet influential international actors as the United States and the Holy See. Our activities to garner support for international protections of reproductive rights include: Lobbying government delegations at UN conferences and producing supporting analyses/materials; fostering alliances with members of civil society who may become influential on their national delegations to the UN; and preparing briefing papers and factsheets exposing the broad anti-woman agenda of our opposition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this linkage is provided by the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized in national laws, international human rights documents and other relevant United Nations consensus documents. These rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence as expressed in human rights documents. In the exercise of this right, they should take into account the needs of their living and future children and their responsibilities towards the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.ca/Cairo/program/p07002.html |title=[programme&amp;#93; Basis for action |publisher=Iisd.ca |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similarly, [[Amnesty International]] has argued that the realisation of reproductive rights is linked with the realisation of a series of recognised [[human rights]], including the [[right to health]], the right to freedom from [[discrimination]], the [[right to privacy]], and the right not to be subjected to torture or ill-treatment.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |title=Stop Violence Against Women: Reproductive rights |accessdate=2007-12-08 |author=Amnesty International USA |year=2007 |work=SVAW |publisher=Amnesty International USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120140923/http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[World Health Organization]] states that:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/srh-rights-comment/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Sexual and reproductive health and rights encompass efforts to eliminate preventable maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, to ensure quality sexual and reproductive health services, including contraceptive services, and to address sexually transmitted infections (STI) and cervical cancer, violence against women and girls, and sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents. Universal access to sexual and reproductive health is essential not only to achieve sustainable development but also to ensure that this new framework speaks to the needs and aspirations of people around the world and leads to realisation of their health and human rights."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, not all states have accepted the inclusion of reproductive rights in the body of internationally recognized human rights. At the Cairo Conference, several states made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] either to the concept of reproductive rights or to its specific content.  [[Ecuador]], for instance, stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
With regard to the Programme of Action of the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and laws of Ecuador and the norms of international law, the delegation of Ecuador reaffirms, inter alia, the following principles embodied in its Constitution:  the inviolability of life, the protection of children from the moment of conception, freedom of conscience and religion, the protection of the family as the fundamental unit of society, responsible paternity, the right of parents to bring up their children and the formulation of population and development plans by the Government in accordance with the principles of respect for sovereignty. Accordingly, the delegation of Ecuador enters a reservation with respect to all terms such as "regulation of fertility", "interruption of pregnancy", "reproductive health", "reproductive rights" and "unwanted children", which in one way or another, within the context of the Programme of Action, could involve abortion.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similar reservations were made by [[Argentina]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Malta]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and the [[Holy See]]. Islamic Countries, such as [[Brunei]], [[Djibouti]], [[Iran]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Syria]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Yemen]] made broad reservations against any element of the programme that could be interpreted as contrary to the [[Sharia]]. Guatemala even questioned whether the conference could legally proclaim new human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html United Nations, Report of the Fourth International Conference on Population and Development, Cario, 5 - 13 September 1994]. Guatemala entered the following reservation:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chapter VII:  we enter a reservation on the whole chapter, for the General Assembly's mandate to the Conference does not extend to the creation or formulation of rights; this reservation therefore applies to all references in the document to "reproductive rights", "sexual rights", "reproductive health", "fertility regulation", "sexual health", "individuals", "sexual education and services for minors", "abortion in all its forms", "distribution of contraceptives" and "safe motherhood"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights==
{{see also|Women’s rights|Reproductive justice}}
{{Feminism sidebar}}
The [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) advocate for reproductive rights with a primary emphasis on [[women's rights]]. In this respect the UN and WHO focus on a range of issues from access to [[family planning]] services, sex education, [[menopause]], and the reduction of [[obstetric fistula]], to the relationship between reproductive health and economic status.

The reproductive rights of women are advanced in the context of the right to freedom from [[discrimination]] and the social and economic status of women. The group Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) explained the link in the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Control over reproduction is a basic need and a basic right for all women. Linked as it is to women's health and social status, as well as the powerful social structures of religion, state control and administrative inertia, and private profit, it is from the perspective of poor women that this right can best be understood and affirmed. Women know that childbearing is a social, not a purely personal, phenomenon; nor do we deny that world population trends are likely to exert considerable pressure on resources and institutions by the end of this century. But our bodies have become a pawn in the struggles among states, religions, male heads of households, and private corporations. Programs that do not take the interests of women into account are unlikely to succeed...&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Women's reproductive rights have long retained key issue status in the debate on [[overpopulation]].&lt;ref name=popsearch/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The only ray of hope I can see – and it's not much – is that wherever women are put in control of their lives, both politically and socially; where medical facilities allow them to deal with birth control and where their husbands allow them to make those decisions, birth rate falls. Women don't want to have 12 kids of whom nine will die." ''[[David Attenborough|David&amp;nbsp;Attenborough]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir David Attenborough on the roots of Climatic problems|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/sir-david-attenborough-this-awful-summer-weve-only-ourselves-to-blame-7942405.html|website=Independent.co.uk|publisher=The Independent, UK broadsheet newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[OHCHR]]: "Women’s sexual and reproductive health is related to multiple human rights, including the right to life, the right to be free from torture, the right to health, the right to privacy, the right to education, and the prohibition of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/women/wrgs/pages/healthrights.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts have been made to analyse the socioeconomic conditions that affect the realisation of a woman's reproductive rights. The term [[reproductive justice]] has been used to describe these broader social and economic issues. Proponents of reproductive justice argue that while the right to [[abortion law|legalized abortion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/gov/bl_roe_e.htm|title=Women's History|website=Womenshistory.about.com|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contraception applies to everyone, these choices are only meaningful to those with resources, and that there is a growing gap between access and affordability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Okazawa-Rey 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Men's rights==
{{see also|Men's rights}}
{{Masculism sidebar}}
Men's reproductive rights have been claimed by various organizations, both for issues of reproductive health, and other rights related to sexual reproduction.

Three international issues in men's reproductive health are [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, cancer and exposure to [[toxins]].&lt;ref name = "NETWORK"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/Network/v18_3/NW183ch2.htm |title=Men's Reproductive Health Risks: Threats to men's fertility and reproductive health include disease, cancer and exposure to toxins |accessdate=2008-01-02 |last1=Best |first1=Kim |date=Spring 1998 |journal=Network |pages=7–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently men's reproductive right with regards to paternity have become subject of debate in the U.S.  The term "[[male abortion]]" was coined by Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in a 1998 article.  The theory begins with the premise that when a woman becomes pregnant she has the option of abortion, adoption, or parenthood; it argues, in the context of legally recognized [[gender equality]], that in the earliest stages of pregnancy the putative (alleged) father should have the right to relinquish all future parental rights and financial responsibility, leaving the informed mother with the same three options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCulley Melanie G | year = 1998 | title = The male abortion: the putative father's right to terminate his interests in and obligations to the unborn child | url = | journal = The Journal of Law and Policy | volume = VII | issue =1 | pages =1–55 |pmid=12666677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been supported by a former president of the feminist organization [[National Organization for Women]], attorney [[Karen DeCrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2000/10/19/mens_choice|title=A man's right to choose|last1=Young|first1=Kathy|date=Oct 19, 2000|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate= May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminist]] argument for male reproductive choice contends that the uneven ability to choose experienced by men and women in regards to parenthood is evidence of a state-enforced [[coercion]] favoring traditional [[sex roles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lisa Lucile |last1=Owens |year=2013 |title=Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' |journal=Alabama Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=5 |pages=1–33 |ssrn=2439294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the National Center for Men brought a case in the US, ''[[Dubay v. Wells]]'' (dubbed by some "''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' for men"), that argued that in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, when an unmarried woman informs a man that she is pregnant by him, he should have an opportunity to give up all paternity rights and responsibilities.  Supporters argue that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women.&lt;ref&gt;Traister, Rebecca. (March 13, 2006).

The opportunity to give men the right for a [[Paper Abortion]] is heavily discussed.

==Intersex and reproductive rights==
{{see also|Intersex}}
Intersex, in [[human]]s and other [[animal]]s, is a variation in [[sex]] characteristics including [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that do not allow an individual to be distinctly identified as male or female. Such variation may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal [[genotype]] and sexual [[phenotype]] other than XY-male and XX-female.&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;{{cite book|last=Money |first=John |author2=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man &amp; Woman Boy &amp; Girl.

UN agencies have begun to take note. On 1 February 2013, Juan E Mendés, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, issued a statement condemning non-consensual surgical intervention on intersex people. His report stated, "Children who are born with atypical sex characteristics are often subject to irreversible sex assignment, involuntary sterilization, involuntary genital normalizing surgery, performed without their informed consent, or that of their parents, "in an attempt to fix their sex", leaving them with permanent, irreversible infertility and causing severe mental suffering".&lt;ref name="untorture"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture], [[Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement'' with the [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]].

===Minors===
{{See|Parental consent}}
In many jurisdictions minors require parental consent or parental notification in order to access various reproductive services, such as contraception, abortion, gynecological consultations,  testing for STDs etc. The requirement that minors have parental consent/notification for testing for [[HIV/AIDS]] is especially controversial, particularly in areas where the disease is endemic, and it is a sensitive subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/adolescent/hiv-testing-treatment/page/Informed_consent_and_HIV_testing|title=World Health Organization - HIV and Adolescents from Guidance to Action|first=World Health|last=Organization|website=apps.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/696753/doh-backs-bill-allowing-minor-to-get-hiv-aids-tests-without-parental-consent|title=DOH backs bill allowing minor to get HIV, AIDS tests without parental consent|first=Jocelyn R.|last=Uy|website=Newsinfo.inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2014/july/20140723_youth|title=Challenging parental consent laws to increase young people's access to vital HIV services - UNAIDS|website=Unaids.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balancing minors' rights versus parental rights is considered an [[ethical]] problem in medicine and law, and there have been many court cases on this issue in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/456472_6|title=Medscape Log In|website=Medscape.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important concept recognized since 1989 by the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] is that of the [[evolving capacities|
evolving capacities of a minor]], namely that minors should, in accordance with their maturity and level of understanding, be involved in decisions that affect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ippfwhr.org/sites/default/files/srrightsyoungen.pdf|title=Sexual and Reproductive Rights of Young People: Autonomous decision making and confidential services|work=International Planned Parenthood Federation|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Youth]] are often denied equal access to reproductive health services because [[health workers]] view adolescent sexual activity as unacceptable,&lt;ref name=Mugisha&gt;{{cite book |last=Mugisha|first=Frederick |editor-first=Andy|editor-last=Furlong|title=Handbook of Youth and Young Adulthood |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |pages=344–352 |chapter=Chapter 42: HIV and AIDS, STIs and sexual health among young people |isbn=978-0-415-44541-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or see sex education as the responsibility of parents.  Providers of reproductive health have little accountability to youth clients, a primary factor in denying youth access to reproductive health care.&lt;ref name=Mugisha /&gt; In many countries, regardless of legislation, minors are denied even the most basic reproductive care, if they are not accompanied by parents: in India, for instance, in 2017, a 17-year-old girl who was rejected by her family due to her pregnancy, was also rejected by hospitals and gave birth in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/india-chandil-homeless-street-jharkand-medical-centre-a7918611.html|title=Homeless girl in India forced to give birth on street metres away from health centre: She was shivering and unable to lift and cuddle her infant|date=August 29, 2017|first=Andrew|last=Lowry|work=The Independent|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the lack of reproductive rights for adolescents has been a concern of international organizations, such as [[UNFPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/adolescent-sexual-and-reproductive-health|title=Adolescent sexual and reproductive health - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandatory involvement of parents in cases where the minor has sufficient maturity to understand their situation is considered by health organization as a violation of minor's rights and detrimental to their health. The [[World Health Organization]] has criticized parental consent/notification laws:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women. Examples include specific individuals or groups being subjected to physical and verbal abuse or violence; involuntary treatment; '''breaches of confidentiality and/or denial of autonomous decision-making, such as the requirement of consent to treatment by parents, spouses or guardians'''; and lack of free and informed consent. [...] Laws and policies must respect the principles of autonomy in health care decision-making; guarantee free and informed consent, privacy and confidentiality; prohibit mandatory HIV testing; prohibit screening procedures that are not of benefit to the individual or the public; and ban involuntary treatment and '''mandatory third-party authorization and notification requirements'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/discrimination-in-health-care/en/|title=Joint United Nations statement on ending discrimination in health care settings — Joint WHO/UN statement|work=World Health Organization|date=June 27, 2017|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to UNICEF: "When dealing with sexual and reproductive health, the obligation
to inform parents and obtain their consent becomes a significant barrier with consequences for adolescents’ lives and for public health in general."&lt;ref name="UnicefBAJA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/lac/1._DIG._Min_age_of_medical_consent_PDF_BAJA_.pdf|title=Legal minimum ages and the realization of adolescents' rights|website=Unicef|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One specific issue which is seen as a form of hypocrisy of legislators is that of having a higher age of medical consent for the purpose of reproductive and sexual health than the [[age of sexual consent]] - in such cases the law allows youth to engage in sexual activity, but does not allow them to consent to medical procedures that may arise from being sexually active; UNICEF states that "On sexual and reproductive health matters, the minimum age of medical consent should never be higher than the age of sexual consent."&lt;ref name="UnicefBAJA" /&gt;

[[File:No Sex Signage in Ghana.jpg|thumb|Ad promoting abstinence in [[Ghana]]: ''No Sex Ad'' (Anti-[[HIV/AIDS]] ― [[signage]]). [[Abstinence-only sex education]] is a form of [[sex education]] that teaches [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]] outside of marriage, most often excluding other types of [[sexual and reproductive health]] education, such as [[birth control]] and [[safe sex]]. [[Comprehensive Sex Education|Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinence.]]

Many [[unintended pregnancies]] stem from traditional contraceptive methods or no [[contraceptive]] measures.&lt;ref name=Lukale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lukale|first=Nelly|title=Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights for Young People in Africa|journal=ARROWs for Change|year=2012|volume=18|issue=2|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth sexual education in Uganda is relatively low.  [[Comprehensive sex education]] is not generally taught in schools; even if it was, the majority of young people do not stay in school after the age of fifteen, so information would be limited regardless.&lt;ref name=Knudson&gt;{{cite book|last=Knudson|first=Lara|title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context: South Africa, Uganda, Peru, Denmark, United States, Vietnam, Jordan|year=2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|location=Nashville, TN}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] experiences high rates of unintended pregnancy, along with high rates of [[HIV/AIDS]].  Young women aged 15–24 are eight times more likely to have HIV/AIDS than young men. [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] is the world region most affected by HIV/AIDS, with approximately 25 million people living with HIV in 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for two-thirds of the global total of new HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids|title=HIV/AIDS Factsheet|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempted [[abortions]] and [[unsafe abortions]] are a risk for youth in Africa.  On average, there are 2.4 million unsafe abortions in East Africa, 1.8 million in Western Africa, over 900,000 in Middle Africa, and over 100,000 in Southern Africa each year.&lt;ref name=Lukale /&gt;

In [[Uganda]], abortion is illegal except to save the mother's life.  However, 78% of teenagers report knowing someone who has had an abortion and the police do not always prosecute everyone who has an abortion.  An estimated 22% of all [[maternal deaths]] in the area stem from illegal, unsafe abortions.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;

===European Union===
Over 85% of European women (all ages) have used some form of [[birth control]] in their lives.&lt;ref name=Irala /&gt;  Europeans as an aggregate report using [[Oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] and [[condoms]] as the most commonly used contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Irala&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.004 |pmid=22078183 |title=Choice of birth control methods among European women and the role of partners and providers |journal=Contraception |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=558–64 |year=2011 |last1=De Irala |first1=Jokin |last2=Osorio |first2=Alfonso |last3=Carlos |first3=Silvia |last4=Lopez-Del Burgo |first4=Cristina |hdl=10171/19110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Views on sexual practice vary throughout the region.  For example, in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), sex among youth is generally looked down upon and seen as a problem in need of solution.  In the [[Netherlands]], sex between youth is viewed as normal and therefore not discussed in terms of solutions, but rather in terms of ensuring safe practices.  That being said, the UK tends to focus on stopping sexual behavior, while the Netherlands focuses on building self-esteem and healthy relationships.&lt;ref name=Ketting /&gt;

[[Latin America]] has come to international attention due to its harsh anti-abortion laws. Latin America is home to some of the few countries of the world with a complete ban on abortion, without an exception for saving [[maternal mortality|maternal life]].&lt;ref name="ChileCourt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41005517|title=Chile abortion: Court approves easing total ban|date=August 21, 2017|work=BBC|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some of these countries, particularity in [[Central America]], the enforcement of such laws is very aggressive: [[Abortion in El Salvador|El Salvador]] and [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] have drawn international attention for strong enforcement of their complete bans on abortion. In 2017, [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]] relaxed its total ban, allowing abortion to be performed when the woman’s life is in danger, when a fetus is unviable, or in cases of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/chile-the-long-road-to-abortion-reform-a7917791.html|title=Chile: the long road to abortion reform — After a fierce debate, one of the most restrictive reproductive laws in the world has been eased|date=August 29, 2017|first=Cordelia|last=Freeman |work=The Independent|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ecuador]], education and class play a large role in the definition of which young women become pregnant and which do not - 50% of young women who are illiterate get pregnant, compared to 11% of girls with secondary education.  The same is true for poorer individuals - 28% become impregnated while only 11% of young women in wealthier households do.  Furthermore, access to reproductive rights, including contraceptives, are limited, due to age and the perception of female morality.  Health care providers often discuss contraception theoretically, not as a device to be used on a regular basis.  Decisions concerning sexual activity often involve secrecy and taboos, as well as a lack of access to accurate information.  Even more telling, young women have much easier access to maternal healthcare than they do to contraceptive help, which helps explain high pregnancy rates in the region.&lt;ref name=Goicolea&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goicolea|first=Isabel|title=Adolescent Pregnancies in the Amazon Basin of Ecuador: A Rights and Gender Approach to Adolescents' Sexual and Reproductive Health|journal=Global Health Action|year=2010|volume=3|pages=1–11|doi=10.3402/gha.v3i0.5280|pmid=20596248|pmc=2893010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of [[adolescent pregnancy]] in Latin America number over a million each year.&lt;ref name=Goicolea /&gt;

Among sexually experienced teenagers, 78% of teenage females and 85% of teenage males used contraception the first time they had sex; 86% and 93% of these same females and males, respectively, reported using contraception the last time they had sex.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet Guttmacher"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Contraceptive Use in the United States|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=2004-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The male [[condom]] is the most commonly used method during first sex, although 54% of young women in the United States rely upon the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|pill]].&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet Guttmacher" /&gt;

Young people in the U.S. are no more sexually active than individuals in other developed countries, but they are significantly less knowledgeable about contraception and safe sex practices.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt; As of 2006, only twenty states required [[sex education]] in schools - of these, only ten required information about contraception.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  On the whole, less than 10% of American students receive sex education that includes topical coverage of [[abortion]], [[homosexuality]], [[Intimate relationships|relationships]], [[pregnancy]], and STI prevention.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  [[Abstinence-only education]] was used throughout much of the United States in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  Based upon the moral principle that sex outside of marriage is unacceptable, the programs often misled students about their rights to have sex, the consequences, and prevention of pregnancy and STIs.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;

[[Abortion in the United States]] is legal since the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' which decriminalised abortion nationwide in 1973, and established a minimal period during which abortion is legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). That basic framework, modified in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), remains nominally in place, although the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state, as many counties have no abortion providers.&lt;ref name="Doan3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472069750|page=57|author1=Alesha Doan}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' held that a law cannot place legal restrictions imposing an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] for "the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."&lt;ref&gt;Casey, 505 U.S. at 877.&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion is a controversial political issue, and regular attempts to restrict it occur in most states. One such case, originating in [[Texas]], led to the Supreme Court case of ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'' (2016) in which several Texas restrictions were struck down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36641063|title=Strict Texas abortion law struck down|date=27 June 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of knowledge about rights==
One of the reasons why reproductive rights are poor in many places, is that the vast majority of the population does not know what the law is. Not only are ordinary people uninformed, but so are medical doctors. A study in Brazil on medical doctors found considerable ignorance and misunderstanding of the law on abortion (which is severely restricted, but not completely illegal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brazilian obstetrician-gynecologists and abortion: a survey of knowledge, opinions and practices|first1=Lisa A.|last1=Goldman|first2=Sandra G.|last2=García|first3=Juan|last3=Díaz|first4=Eileen A.|last4=Yam|date=15 November 2005|journal=Reproductive Health|volume=2|pages=10|doi=10.1186/1742-4755-2-10|pmid=16288647|pmc=1308861}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ghana, abortion, while restricted, is permitted on several grounds, but only 3% of pregnant women and 6% of those seeking an abortion were aware of the legal status of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/abortion-ghana|title=Abortion in Ghana|date=24 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal, abortion was legalized in 2002, but a study in 2009 found that only half of women knew that abortion was legalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/09/nepal-only-half-of-women-know-abortion-is-legal/|title=NEPAL: Only Half of Women Know Abortion is Legal - Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also do not understand the laws on [[sexual violence]]: in Hungary, where [[marital rape]] was made illegal in 1997, in a study in 2006, 62% of people did not know that marital rape was a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur27/002/2007/en/|title=Wayback Machine|date=8 June 2011|publisher=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/undp-cpr-8-point-agenda-practical-positive-outcomes-girls-women-crisis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states at Art. 4 (d) [...] "States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|first=United Nations General|last=Assembly|website=www.un-documents.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender equality and violence against women==
{{Further|Gender equality|Violence against women|Sexual violence|Forced marriage|Child marriage}}
Addressing issues of gender-based violence is crucial for attaining reproductive rights. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] refers to "'''''Equality and equity for men and women''', to enable individuals to make free and informed choices in all spheres of life, free from discrimination based on gender''" and "''Sexual and reproductive security, '''including freedom from sexual violence and coercion''', and the right to privacy,''" as part of achieving reproductive rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/rights/rights.htm |title=United Nations Population Fund &amp;#124; Supporting the Constellation of Reproductive Rights |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that the '''right to liberty and security of the person''' which is fundamental to reproductive rights obliges states to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/english/ch3/ch3_box9.htm |title=United Nations Population Fund &amp;#124; State of World Population 2005 |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Take measures to prevent, punish and eradicate all forms of gender-based violence
* Eliminate female genital mutilation/cutting

The WHO states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hhr/activities/GRR/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Gender and Reproductive Rights |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Gender and Reproductive Rights (GRR) aims to promote and protect human rights and gender equality as they relate to sexual and reproductive health by developing strategies and mechanisms for promoting gender equity and equality and human rights in the Departments global and national activities, as well as within the functioning and priority-setting of the Department itself."

Amnesty International writes that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/campaigns/stop-violence-against-women/issues/implementation-existing-laws/srr |title=Sexual and reproductive rights &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Violence against women violates women's rights to life, physical and mental integrity, to the highest attainable standard of health, to freedom from torture and it violates their sexual and reproductive rights."

One key issue for achieving reproductive rights is criminalization of [[sexual violence]]. If a woman is not protected from forced sexual intercourse, she is not protected from [[forced pregnancy]], namely [[pregnancy from rape]]. In order for a woman to be able to have reproductive rights, she must have the right to choose with whom and when to reproduce; and first of all, decide whether, when, and under what circumstances to be sexually active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/gender_rights/sexual_health/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Gender and human rights |publisher=Who.int |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, these rights of women are not respected, because women do not have a choice in regard to their partner, with [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]] being common in parts of the world; and neither do they have any rights in regard to sexual activity, as many countries do not allow women to refuse to engage in sexual intercourse when they do not want to (because [[marital rape]] is not criminalized in those countries) or to engage in consensual sexual intercourse if they want to (because sex outside marriage is illegal in those countries). In addition to legal barriers, there are also social barriers, because in many countries a complete sexual subordination of a woman to her husband is expected (for instance, in one survey 74% of women in Mali said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?rh04047 |title=Bioline International Official Site (site up-dated regularly) |publisher=Bioline.org.br |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while sexual/romantic relations disapproved by family members, or generally sex outside marriage, can result in serious violence, such as [[honor killings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/ |title=Ethics: Honour Crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the CDC, "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It weakens a person’s immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. No effective cure exists for HIV. But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/index.html|title=HIV Basics {{!}} HIV/AIDS {{!}} CDC|website=Cdc.gov|access-date=2016-10-05|date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HIV amelioration is an important aspect of reproductive rights because the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or birth, or via breast milk.

The WHO states that: "All women, including those with HIV, have the right “to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights”".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/11/08-059360/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Reproductive choices for women with HIV |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive rights of people living with HIV, and their health, are very important. The link between HIV and reproductive rights exists in regard to four main issues:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* prevention of unwanted pregnancy
* help to plan wanted pregnancy
* healthcare during and after pregnancy
* access to abortion services

==Child and forced marriage==
{{Main|Child marriage|Forced marriage}}
The WHO states that the reproductive rights and health of girls in child marriages are negatively affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/news/news/2012/12/child-marriage-a-threat-to-health|title=Child marriage – a threat to health|date=20 December 2012|website=www.euro.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations Population Fund|UNPF]] calls child marriage a "human rights violation" and states that in developing countries, one in every three girls is married before reaching age 18, and one in nine is married under age 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/child-marriage|title=Child marriage - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage in which one or more of the parties is married without his or her consent or against his or her will. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul convention]], the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women and domestic violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Convention of Belem do Para and the Istanbul Convention : A response to violence against women worldwide |publisher=Oas.org |accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires countries which ratify it to prohibit [[forced marriage]] (Article 37) and to ensure that forced marriages can be easily voided without further victimization (Article 32).&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/168046031c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual violence in armed conflict==
{{Main|Wartime sexual violence|Pregnancy from rape}}
Sexual violence in armed conflict is [[sexual violence]] committed by [[combatant]]s during [[armed conflict]], war, or [[military occupation]] often as [[War looting|spoils of war]]; but sometimes, particularly in [[ethnic conflict]], the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. It often includes [[gang rape]]. Rape is often used as a tactic of war and a threat to international security.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/rapeweaponwar.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence in armed conflict is a violation of reproductive rights, and often leads to [[forced pregnancy]]  and [[sexually transmitted infections]]. Such sexual violations affect mostly women and girls,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00981389.2016.1240134?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=wshc20&lt;/ref&gt; but [[rape of men]] can also occur, such as in [[ Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name=Melhado&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melhado|first=L|title=Rates of Sexual Violence Are High in Democratic Republic of the Congo|journal=International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|volume=36|number=4|year=2010|p=210|jstor=41038670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Autesserre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Autesserre|first=Séverine|title=Dangerous Tales: Dominant Narratives on the Congo and their Unintended Consequences|journal=African Affairs|volume=111|issue=443|year=2012|pages=202–222|doi=10.1093/afraf/adr080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal death is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of [[pregnancy]], irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/indmaternalmortality/en/|title=WHO - Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births)|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in 2015, about 303,000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth, and 99% of such deaths occur in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|title=Maternal mortality|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Birth control===
{{See|Forced pregnancy}}
[[Birth control]], also known as contraception and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Birth control|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=53351|work=MedicineNet|accessdate=August 9, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806234913/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=53351|archivedate=August 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Hopkins2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanson|first1=S.J.|last2=Burke|first2=Anne E.|date=December 21, 2010|chapter=Fertility control: contraception, sterilization, and abortion|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Sg5sXyiBvkC&amp;pg=PR232|editor1-last=Hurt|editor1-first=K.

All birth control methods meet opposition, especially [[religion|religious]] opposition, in some parts of the world. Opposition does not only target modern methods, but also 'traditional' ones : for example, the [[Quiverfull]] movement, a conservative Christian ideology, encourages the maximization of procreation, and opposes all forms of birth control, including [[natural family planning]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/arrows-war/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/protestant-group-advocates-leaving-fertility-in-gods-hands-no-birth-control&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===
{{Further|Abortion law}}
According to a study by WHO and the Guttmacher Institute worldwide, 25 million [[unsafe abortion]]s (45% of all abortions) occurred every year between 2010 and 2014. 97% of unsafe abortions occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. By contrast, most abortions that take place in Western and Northern Europe and North America are safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/unsafe-abortions-worldwide/en/|title=Worldwide, an estimated 25 million unsafe abortions occur each year|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states that: "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of  safe  abortion  and  post abortion  care,  forced  continuation  of pregnancy,  abuse  and mistreatment  of  women  and  girls  seeking  sexual  and  reproductive  health  information, goods and services, are forms of [[violence against women|gender based violence]] that, depending on   the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The same ''General Recommendation'' also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:
a) Provisions  that  allow,  tolerate  or  condone  forms  of  gender based  violence against women, including [...] legislation  that  criminalises  abortion".&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"/&gt;

An article from the World Health Organization calls safe, legal abortion a "[[fundamental right]] of women, irrespective of where they live" and [[unsafe abortion]] a "silent [[pandemic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|title=WHO: Unsafe Abortion - The Preventable Pandemic|accessdate=2010-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113104553/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|archivedate=2010-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article states "ending the silent pandemic of unsafe abortion is an urgent [[public health|public-health]] and [[human-rights]] imperative." It also states "access to safe abortion improves [[women’s health]], and vice versa, as documented in [[Romania]] during the regime of President [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]" and "legalisation of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women’s health" citing that in some countries, such as India where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers. WHO’s Global Strategy on Reproductive Health, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2004, noted: “As a preventable cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, unsafe abortion must be dealt with as part of the MDG on improving maternal health and other international development goals and targets." &lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/hrpwork/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Preventing unsafe abortion |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), whose research concerns people's sexual and reproductive health and lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/ |title=HRP &amp;#124; World Health Organization |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an overall strategy to combat unsafe abortion that comprises four inter-related activities:&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;
* to collate, synthesize and generate scientifically sound evidence on unsafe abortion prevalence and practices;
* to develop improved technologies and implement interventions to make abortion safer;
* to translate evidence into norms, tools and guidelines;

The UN has estimated in 2017 that repealing anti-abortion laws would save the lives of nearly 50,000 women a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55141|title=UN News - Repealing anti-abortion laws would save the lives of nearly 50,000 women a year – UN experts|first=United Nations News Service|last=Section|date=27 September 2016|website=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsafe abortions take place primarily in countries where abortion is illegal, but also occur in countries where it is legal, but women cannot access it because of various reasons ([[conscientious objector]]s among doctors, high prices, lack of knowledge that abortion is legal). Indeed, there are countries where the law  is liberal, but in practice it is very difficult to have an abortion, due to most doctors being  conscientious objectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages|title=Seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out abortions|journal=The Guardian|first1=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Pamela|last1=Duncan|first2=Alberto|last2=Nardelli|first3=Delphine|last3=Robineau|date=11 March 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017|title=Doctors' Refusal to Perform Abortions Divides Croatia :: Balkan Insight|website=www.balkaninsight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that is some countries where abortion is legal it is ''[[de facto]]'' very difficult to have access to one is controversial; the UN in its 2017 resolution on ''Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence'' urged states to guarantee access to "safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/170|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safe and legal abortion services are often very difficult to access by women from rural areas or from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. In 2008, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that "In fact, even where abortion is permitted by law, women often have severely limited access to safe abortion services because of lack of proper regulation, health services, or political will" and estimated that "Approximately 13 percent of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/women/abortion.html|title=Human Rights Watch: Women's Human Rights: Abortion|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maputo Protocol]], which was adopted by the [[African Union]] in the form of a protocol to the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], states at  Article 14 (Health and Reproductive Rights) that: "(2). States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to: [...] c) protect the reproductive rights of women by authorising medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the foetus." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/#14&lt;/ref&gt; The Maputo Protocol is the first international treaty to recognize abortion, under certain conditions, as a woman's human right.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.achpr.org/instruments/general-comment-two-rights-women/&lt;/ref&gt;

The  ''General comment No. 36 (2018) on article 6 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], on the right to life'', adopted by the [[Human Rights Committee]] in 2018, defines, for the first time ever, a human right to abortion - in certain circumstances (however these UN general comments are considered [[soft law]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/un-human-rights-treaty-bodies/general-comments-of-the-human-rights-committee-and-their-legitimacy/EF8328BB5B2B3EC932E44C45E192EB9B&lt;/ref&gt; and, as such, not legally binding).

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although   States   parties   may  adopt measures designed to regulate voluntary terminations of pregnancy, such measures must not result in violation of the right to life of a pregnant woman or girl, or her other rights under the Covenant. Thus, restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion must not, inter alia, jeopardize their lives, subject them  to  physical  or  mental  pain  or  suffering  which violates  article  7,  discriminate  against them  or  arbitrarily  interfere  with  their  privacy.  ''States  parties  must  provide  safe,  legal  and effective  access  to  abortion where  the  life  and  health  of  the  pregnant  woman  or girl  is  at risk,  and  where  carrying a pregnancy to term  would cause  the  pregnant  woman  or  girl substantial  pain  or  suffering,  most  notably  where  the  pregnancy  is  the  result  of  rape  or incest or is not viable.'' [8] In addition, States parties may not regulate pregnancy or abortion in all other cases in a manner that runs contrary to their duty to ensure that women and girls do  not  have  to  undertake  unsafe  abortions,  and  they should  revise  their  abortion  laws accordingly.  [9]  For  example,  they  should  not  take measures  such  as  criminalizing pregnancies  by  unmarried  women  or  apply  criminal  sanctions  against  women  and  girls undergoing  abortion  [10]  or  against  medical  service providers  assisting  them  in  doing  so, since  taking  such  measures  compel  women  and  girls  to  resort  to  unsafe  abortion.  States parties should not introduce new barriers and should remove existing barriers [11] that deny effective  access  by  women  and  girls  to  safe  and  legal  abortion  [12],  including  barriers caused  as  a  result  of  the  exercise  of  conscientious objection  by  individual  medical providers.

When negotiating the Cairo Programme of Action at the 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD), the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion, instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008 the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], a group comprising members from 47 European countries, adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures. The nonbinding resolution was passed on April 16 by a vote of 102 to 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2008/04/18/index.html |title=Council of Europe Urges Member States to Decriminalize Abortion |publisher=Guttmacher.org |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term ‘reproductive health’ in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference.
For the European Union, where legislation on abortion is certainly less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council’s commitment to promote ‘reproductive health’ did not include the promotion of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 4 December 2003: Oral Question (H-0794/03) for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Dana Scallon to the Council. In the written record of that session, one reads: Posselt (PPE-DE): “Does the term ‘reproductive health’ include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?” - Antonione, Council: “No.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:

''“The term ‘reproductive health’ was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of ‘reproductive health’ to that given in the Programme of Action, '''which makes no reference to abortion'''.”''&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 24 October 2002: Question no 86 by Dana Scallon (H-0670/02)&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the U.S., it should be noted that, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the U.S. delegation, Vice President Al Gore, had stated for the record:

''“Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning.”''&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti Shankar Singh, Creating a New Consensus on Population (London: Earthscan, 1998), 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years later, the position of the U.S. Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Ellen Sauerbrey, when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: ''“nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing  in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion”''.&lt;ref&gt;Lederer, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 1 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; She added: ''“There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition”''.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Reuters, 28 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative research from the [[Institute of Development Studies]] states that "access to safe abortion is a matter of human rights, democracy and public health, and the denial of such access is a major cause of death and impairment, with significant costs to [international] development".&lt;ref name=IDS2009&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121649491/issue | title = Unsafe Abortion: A Development Issue | journal = Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Bulletin | volume = 39 | date = July 2009 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research highlights the inequities of access to safe abortion both globally and nationally and emphasises the importance of global and national movements for reform to address this. The shift by campaigners of reproductive rights from an issue-based agenda (the right to abortion), to safe, legal abortion not only as a human right, but bound up with democratic and citizenship rights, has been an important way of reframing the abortion debate and reproductive justice agenda.&lt;ref name=IDS2009 /&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] complicated the question even more through a landmark judgment (case of ''[[A. B. and C. v. Ireland]]''), in which it is stated that the denial of abortion for health and/or well-being reasons is an interference with an individuals right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], an interference which in some cases can be justified.

===Population control===

[[File:Ceausescu_Anul_Nou.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], Romanian communist leader, enacted one of the most infamous [[natalist]] policies of the 20th century]]

A desire to achieve certain population targets has resulted throughout history in severely abusive practices, in cases where governments ignored human rights and enacted aggressive demographic policies. In the 20th century, several authoritarian governments have sought either to increase or to decrease the births rates, often through forceful intervention. One of the most notorious [[natalist]] policies is that which occurred in [[communist Romania]] in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people.  Ceaușescu's policy resulted in over 9,000 women who died due to [[illegal abortion]]s,&lt;ref name="Kligman short"&gt;Kligman, Gail.

The irony of Ceaușescu's aggressive natalist policy was a generation that may not have been born would eventually lead the [[Romanian Revolution]] which would overthrow and have him [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu#Execution|executed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freakonomics|last=Levitt &amp; Dubner|first=Steven &amp; Stephen|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2005|isbn=9780141019017|location=80 Strand, London WC2R ORL England|page=107|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark opposition with Ceaușescu's natalist policy was China's [[one child policy]], in effect from 1978 to 2015, which included abuses such as [[forced abortion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-18435126 |title=China forced abortion photo sparks outrage - BBC News |journal=BBC News |date= 2012-06-14|accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has also been deemed responsible for the common practice of [[sex selective abortion]] which led to an imbalanced [[sex ratio]] in the country.&lt;ref name="Bulte, Heerink, &amp; Zhang, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulte, E., Heerink, N., &amp; Zhang, X.|title=China's one-child policy and 'the mystery of missing women': ethnic minorities and male-biased sex ratios.|journal=Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics|year=2011|volume=73|issue=1|pages=0305–9049|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00601.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s to 1980s, tension grew between women's health activists who advance women's reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach on the one hand, and population control advocates on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1984 UN World Population Conference in Mexico City population control policies came under attack from women's health advocates who argued that the policies' narrow focus led to coercion and decreased quality of care, and that these policies ignored the varied social and cultural contexts in which family planning was provided in developing countries. In the 1980s the HIV/AIDS epidemic forced a broader discussion of sex into the public discourse in many countries, leading to more emphasis on reproductive health issues beyond reducing fertility. The growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant departure in the early 1990s from past population control policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=4–5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, abortion opponents have begun to foment [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about reproductive rights advocates, accusing them of advancing a [[Racism|racist]] agenda of [[eugenics]], and of trying to reduce the [[African American]] birth rate in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Dewan&gt;{{Cite news | last = Dewan | first = Shaila | author-link = | title = To Court Blacks, Foes of Abortion Make Racial Case | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = February 26, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/us/27race.html | accessdate = 7 June 2010 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bride kidnapping]] or marriage by abduction, is the practice whereby a woman or girl is abducted for the purpose of a [[forced marriage]]. Bride kidnapping has been practiced historically in many parts of the world, and it continues to occur today in some places, especially in [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]], in countries such as  Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Armenia, as well as in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kyrgyzstan-women-bride-kidnapping/one-in-five-girls-and-women-kidnapped-for-marriage-in-kyrgyzstan-study-idUSKBN1AH5GI | title=One in five girls and women kidnapped for marriage in Kyrgyzstan| journal=Reuters| date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-10913297 | title=Chechen stolen brides 'exorcised'| journal=BBC News| date=2010-08-10| last1=Ash| first1=Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/kidnapped-raped-married-the-extraordinary-rebellion-of-ethiopias-abducted-wives-1922263.html | title=Kidnapped.

Abducting of women may happen on an individual scale or on a mass scale. [[Raptio]] is a Latin term referring to the large-scale abduction of women, usually for marriage or sexual slavery, particularity during wartime.

[[Bride price]], also called bridewealth, is money, property, or other form of wealth paid by a groom or his family to the parents of the woman he marries. The practice of bride price sometimes leads to parents selling young daughters into marriage and to trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Human+rights+groups+ask+NWFP+Govt.+to+ban+%27bride+price%27+to+curb+women...-a0216984357 | title=Human rights groups ask NWFP Govt.

Leonard]], professor at Princeton University, describes American eugenics and sterilization as ultimately rooted in economic arguments and further as a central element of Progressivism alongside wage controls, restricted immigration, and the introduction of [[pension]] programs.&lt;ref name="Leonard2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leonard | first1 = Thomas C. | year = 2005 | title = Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era | url = https://www.princeton.edu/%7Etleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 207–224 | doi = 10.1257/089533005775196642 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161218214328/http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf | archivedate = 2016-12-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The heads of the programs were avid proponents of eugenics and frequently argued for their programs which achieved some success nationwide mainly in the first half of the 20th Century.

====Canada====
{{Main|Compulsory sterilization in Canada}}
Compulsory sterilization has been practiced historically in parts of Canada. Two Canadian provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]) performed compulsory sterilization programs in the 20th century with eugenic aims. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system.  However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.

The [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir’s case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|title=Alberta Apologizes for Forced Sterilization|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|accessdate=June 19, 2013|date=November 9, 1999|work=[[CBC News]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123020740/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1VoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kecFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397%2C1039102 Victims of sterilization finally get day in court.

==Criticisms==
Some [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|opponents of legalized abortion]] view the term "reproductive rights" as a [[euphemism]] to sway emotions in favor of abortion.  [[National Right to Life]] has referred to "reproductive rights" as a "fudge term" and "the code word for ''abortion'' rights."&lt;ref name=NRLC&gt;{{cite web|title=THE CHOICE "THAT DARE NOT SPEAK ITS NAME"|url=http://www.nrlc.org/news/2003/NRL02/pres.html|website=Nrlc.org|year=2003|accessdate=2017-08-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804230201/http://www.nrlc.org/news/2003/NRL02/pres.html|archivedate=2013-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''self-perceived quality-of-life scale'''&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenberg, E. C. (2008, August). ''Self-perceived quality of life scale: Theoretical framework and development''. Presentation at the annual meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]], [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenberg, E. C. (2009). ''What constitutes happiness? Self-perceived quality of life scale: Theoretical framework and development''. Saarbrücken, Germany: VDM. https://www.amazon.com/constitutes-happiness-Self-perceived-quality-scale/dp/3639207165&lt;/ref&gt; is a psychological assessment instrument which is based on a comprehensive theory of the self-perceived quality of life (SPQL)&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenberg, E. C. (2007, August). Enhancing ''the quality rather than intensity of subjective well-being.'' Presentation at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association, San Francisco, California.&lt;/ref&gt; and provides a multi-faceted measurement of health-related and non-health-related aspects of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenberg, E. C. (2008). Self-perceived quality of life scale: Theoretical framework and development ([[Thesis|Doctoral dissertation]], [[Institute of Transpersonal Psychology]], Palo Alto, CA). ''Dissertation Abstracts International, 69'' (3).&lt;/ref&gt; The scale has become an instrument of choice for monitoring quality of life in some clinical populations, for example, it was adopted by the Positively Sound network for women living with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;http://positivelysound.org/aboutus.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The improvement of [[Mental illness|mental disorders]] may have an effect on multiple domains of an individual's life which could be captured only through a comprehensive measurement. For example, the treatment of a phobia may reduce fear ([[mental health]] index), which could lead to the improvement of [[social relation]]s (social relations index) and, in turn, performance at work, resulting in an increase in salary (financial index). Hence, in order to detect all implications of a treatment (e.g., for a phobia), a comprehensive measurement across multiple domains of an individual's life is needed. The SPQL scale can provide such a comprehensive measurement.

The scale is designed in an electronic format. The software calculates scores automatically; this allows for advanced quantification methods. The automatic calculations and quantification methods allowed undertaking a comprehensive approach for assessing SPQL from multiple facets. A multi-facet approach, in turn, provided a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of mental health interventions (through pre- and post tests).

The scale emerged from synthesis of existing theories including: (a) subjective well-being, (b) developmental life-stages, (c) different categories of human needs, (d) quality of life, and (e) subjective evaluation processes. The scale consists of three axes: Subjective well-being, positive and [[Affect theory|negative affect]], and fulfillment of needs. See a model diagram below.

The scale can (a) identify possible [[side effect]]s of psychiatric or psychological interventions which could occur in multiple domains of an individual’s life, (b) detect the occurrence of relapses, (c) assist in evaluating the progress of recovery, (d) measure the effects of various non-normative positive and negative events (e.g., divorce, promotion at work, becoming a parent) on an individual’s life as a whole and trace the course of their development, (e) evaluate an individual’s SPQL throughout the lifespan, (f) predict depression, anxiety, and mood, and (g) assess the effectiveness of interventions intended to enhance well-being and improve quality of life on an individual level.

This scale could be used by individual [[mental health professional]]s to evaluate the progress of treatment. This is useful for clients as well because they themselves are able to compare their initial scores with scores after intervention. Because the scale is available online, clients are able to complete the questionnaire outside of the therapy sessions. The scale also could be used in medical settings to assess how medical treatment affects a patient’s life overall and in specific aspects over time, as well as allow detecting psychological side effects. The scale could be of use to insurers because it would help in evaluating the effectiveness of mental health interventions.

==Theory==
[[File:spql.jpg|thumb|right|SPQL model.]]
It is safe to postulate that all people want to have a good life. Although the meaning of “a good life” may vary from culture to culture and from individual to individual, this meaning revolves around the same aspects of life across cultures. What actually varies between cultures and individuals is the availability of certain aspects of a good life, the subjective significance people assign to these aspects, and the way people evaluate these aspects of a good life.

Everything we do or do not do, wish or do not wish, and have or do not have has an explicit or an implicit relevance to how good or not good we perceive our lives to be. Because the preference for a good life over a bad life underlies all facets of our lives, understanding what constitutes and influences a good life on an individual level has a significant value for all people.

During the past several decades researchers investigated the concept of “the good life” based on three theoretical approaches:

The comprehensive scale of the good life, the Self-Perceived Quality of Life (SPQL) scale, overcame the limitations of prior approaches by integrating measurements of SWB, QOL, and functionality on an individual level, and by utilizing innovative quantification methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hagerty |first1=M. |last2=Cummins |first2=R. |last3=Ferriss |first3=A. |last4=Land |first4=K. |last5=Michalos |first5=A. |last6=Peterson |first6=M. |author7=et al. |date=2001 |title=Quality of life indexes for national policy: Review and agenda for research |journal=Bulletin of Sociological Methodology |volume=71 |pages=58–78 | doi = 10.1177/075910630107100104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rapley |first=M. |date=2003 |title=Quality of life research: A critical introduction |location=London |publisher=Sage }}{{ISBN missing|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}} The scale focused on how individuals evaluate their lives and compare these measurements with the average good life of others. The SPQL scale includes well-being, emotions, and physical and mental health indices. The SPQL scale has implications for evaluating the effectiveness of a wide range of interventions intended to improve mental health and well-being.

===Conceptual model===
The SPQL construct consists of three axes, each compounded from several variables:
; Subjective well-being (SWB)
: Baseline average of overall happiness/unhappiness and transient deviations, which are measures of frequency and intensity of nonnormative transient experiences of happiness/unhappiness.
; Subjective affective experiences (SAE)
: Average of overall positive and negative affect.
; Fulfillment of needs
: A product of strength and fulfillment of a wide range of needs and preferences.

Because fluctuations within SPQL are likely to occur over time, a single-occasion measurement will not provide a comprehensive assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Diener, 2000.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, &amp; Schkade, 2005.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to capture a more comprehensive picture of SPQL, the SWB variable (axis) was measured retrospectively throughout three major [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|life stages]] of adult human development: Early-adulthood, mid-adulthood, and late-adulthood (see SPQL model diagram).

As people approach a life stage in their development, they face developmental tasks that they need to master in order for the transition to the next life stage to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, 1968.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harter, 1998, 1999.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of transition from one life stage to another is marked by three phases:
# Mastering or failing a task;
# Consequential reevaluation of life circumstances, values, and [[self-concept]]; and
# Adjustment and adaptation to new values and circumstances.
To a lesser degree, cycles of transitions occur continually within major life stages on annual and even on daily bases.

A curve of SWB throughout the lifespan can reflect the experience of an individual's good life. Ideally, all three SPQL axes should be evaluated for each life stage. However, this would make a questionnaire too long. Although the SPQL scale measures only one SPQL axis (SWB) for each life stage, the developed theoretical framework discusses the evaluation of all three SPQL axes throughout the major life stages. Thus, the framework can support the development of a next version of the scale that would accomplish this goal. Future research could explore possibilities for reducing the number of the evaluated scale items and include questions that will evaluate all three SPQL axes throughout the major life stages.

==Axes==
Participants' responses on the inventories for each of the three SPQL axes (see Appendixes) provided the data for the psychometric validation of the scale and for the quantitative analyses that allowed measuring the good life. The theoretical framework for the first two axes was based on the existing theories of SWB, positive affect and negative affect, and mood.&lt;ref name=Diener_et_al-1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, 1998.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson_2000/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Watson &amp; Clark, 1994.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical framework for the third axis was based on theories that conceptually differentiate between different categories of needs.&lt;ref name=Maslow_1970&gt;Maslow, 1970.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, 2000.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different categories of needs, in turn, are sorted into four general categories of needs composing the third axis. The measurement of an individual’s level of functionality across social, psychological, and health factors was integrated in the third axis. This integration was accomplished through evaluating the strength and fulfillment of an individual’s needs for optimal functioning across these factors.

===Axis I: subjective well-being ===
The subjective well-being (SWB) baseline is maintained by psychological and biological homeostasis.&lt;ref&gt;Brickman &amp; Campbell, 1971.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cummins &amp; Lau, 2004.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurement of overall happiness determined the SWB baseline. A higher SWB baseline indicates a higher SPQL. People who have experienced more positive and less negative intense experiences during their lives (i.e., transient deviations), have a higher SPQL. Intense experiences were assessed through measuring the frequency and intensity of nonnormative transient subjective experiences of happiness/unhappiness that deviate from the SWB baseline throughout time.

===Axis II: subjective affective experiences ===
People who have experienced more positive and less negative subjective affective experiences (SAE) during their lives (i.e., transient deviations), have a higher SPQL. The average of positive and negative SAE was used to measure overall SAE.

===Axis III: fulfillment of needs===
Individuals with the same score on SWB can differ in their evaluations of [[Standard of living|standards of living]] even if their objective life circumstances are alike. Accordingly, their self-perceived QOL may vary. Hence, in order to capture a more accurate measurement of SPQL, the strength and degree of fulfillment of a wide range of human needs and preferences for life circumstances was evaluated. However, felt needs are not the only kind of needs that a person may have.&lt;ref name=Maslow_1970/&gt; If a need is satisfied it may not be felt as intensely as an unsatisfied need of lesser importance in terms of overall happiness. Thus, the strength with which a need is felt at a certain point in time does not necessarily indicate that it makes a greater contribution to the overall SPQL than other needs, which are felt less intensely or unfelt at all at that point in time because they are satisfied. Hence, the strength of individual preferences and needs was evaluated not only through questions such as “how important is fulfillment of this need to your overall happiness?” but also with questions such as “if this need were unfulfilled, how would it affect your overall happiness?”

[[Model (abstract)|Conceptual model]] for axis III fulfillment of needs. In order to measure fulfillment of needs, a broad range of human needs was sorted into four conceptually distinct categories that are (a) contingent on corresponding stages of cognitive and [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|moral development]],&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, Levine, &amp; Hewer, 1983.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, 1952.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (b) constitute major components of self-concept,&lt;ref&gt;Marcia, 1980.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (c) correspond to the neural activity in different clusters of anatomical brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;Berridge, 2004.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 2000a.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because sometimes the same anatomical brain regions are involved in different ways in neural activity associated with the four categories of needs, implicated brain regions will be distinguished based on their dominance in related processes, and based on the chronological maturation of the dominant regions.

#Instinctual needs include (a) sensory stimulation needs that became linked with positive or negative affect without involvement of cognitive evaluations; (b) physiological needs such as hunger, thirst, and sex; and (c) other physiological needs, such as those related to digestion, [[fluid balance]], [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]], and [[blood pressure]], which could elicit positive or negative affect depending on whether the needs are met.
#Self-centered emotional needs include (a) needs for safety and security (e.g., financial stability, home), love and belonging (e.g., affectionate relationships, [[sense of community]]), esteem (e.g., recognition, confidence); (b) ego-centered self-conscious needs (underpinned by self-conscious emotions, that is, emotions which require self-conscious awareness and evaluations), such as pride and honor (e.g., from personal accomplishments vs. nurturing), and guilt and embarrassment (with a focus on how one’s status has been affected vs. focusing on how others have been affected); and (c) spiritual/religious needs motivated by ego inflation or belonging emotional needs.
#Humanistic and spiritual emotional needs include (a) a higher order of self-conscious altruistic needs that are not self-centered, such as pride and honor (e.g., from nurturing vs. from personal accomplishments), and guilt and embarrassment (with a focus on how others have been affected vs. focusing on how one’s status has been affected); (b) humanistic, [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|self-actualization]] needs, characterized by a desire to fulfill one’s potential, which are not ego-centered (e.g., desiring truth over dishonesty); and (c) spiritual/religious needs which are not motivated by ego inflation or belonging emotional needs.
#Cognitive needs include needs for harmony, organization, and coherence in (a) aesthetics (e.g., art, architecture, poetry, and music) and (b) intellect (sciences, information, and skills).

====Measuring axis III fulfillment of needs====
[[File:fig2spql.jpg|right|thumb|Two dimensions of motivational units: strength and fulfillment.]]
Because according to the SPQL theory an individual's motivations ensue from the idiosyncratic cluster of the four categories of needs, these four categories are proposed to compound an individual’s motivational framework (MF). In the following discussion, disparate preferences and needs will be referred to as motivational units (MU). Motivational units have two dimensions, importance of MU to the SPQL (strength) and the degree of fulfillment. The strength of a motivational unit (MU) was determined by evaluating the capacity for the fulfillment or unfulfillment of the MU to skew the SWB baseline.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6643">'''Systems medicine''' is an interdisciplinary field of study that looks at the systems of the human body as part of an integrated whole, incorporating biochemical, physiological, and environment interactions. Systems medicine draws on [[systems science]] and [[systems biology]], and considers complex interactions within the human body in light of a patient's [[genomics]], behavior and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Federoff |first1= Howard| last2= Gostin|first2= Lawrence O.| url= http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=184479 |title=Evolving from Reductionism to Holism: Is There a Future for Systems Medicine?| journal= Journal of the American Medical Association|volume= 302|issue=9 |year=2009| pages=994–996 | doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1264 | pmid=19724047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest uses of the term ''systems medicine'' appeared in 1992, in an article on systems medicine and pharmacology by B.J. Zeng &lt;ref&gt;Zeng (B.) J., On the holographic model of human body, 1st National Conference of Comparative Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine and West Medicine, Medicine and Philosophy, April, 1992 ( termed "systems medicine and pharmacology").&lt;/ref&gt; and in a paper on systems biomedicine by T. Kamada.&lt;ref&gt;Kamada T. ,System biomedicine: a new paradigm in biomedical engineering. Front Med Biol Eng. 1992;4(1):1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important topic in systems medicine and [[systems biomedicine]] is the development of computational models that  describe disease progression and the effect of therapeutic interventions.

It has provided and rolled out a set of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] management guidelines for doctors treating certain mental disorders within [[Texas|Texas']] publicly funded [[mental health]] care system, along with manuals relating to each of them.  The algorithms commence after diagnosis and cover pharmacological treatment (hence "Medication Algorithm").

==History==
TMAP was initiated in the fall of 1997 and the initial research covered around 500 patients.

TMAP arose from a collaboration that began in 1995 between the [[Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation]] (TDMHMR), [[pharmaceutical]] companies, and the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas|University of Texas Southwestern]].  The research was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Meadows Foundation, the Lightner-Sams Foundation, the Nanny Hogan Boyd Charitable Trust, TDMHMR, the Center for Mental Health Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Health Services Research and Development Research Career Scientist Award, the United States Pharmacopoeia Convention Inc. and Mental Health Connections.

Numerous companies that invent and develop antipsychotic medications provided use of their medications and furnished funding for the project. Companies did not participate in the production of the guidelines. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahrp.org/infomail/05/10/14.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 TMAP was mentioned as an example of a successful project in a paper regarding implementing mental health screening programs throughout the [[United States]], by the President [[George W. Bush| George W. Bush's ]]  [[New Freedom Commission on Mental Health]], which looks to expand the program federally.  The President had previously been Governor of Texas, in the period when TMAP was implemented.  Similar programs have been implemented in about a dozen States, according to a 2004 report in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.

Similar algorithms with similar prescribing advice have been produced elsewhere, for instance at the [[Maudsley Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhc.com/Algorithms/AlgoLinks.HTML] Lists of Psychopharmacology Algorithms.  Compiled by David N. Osser, M.D. and Robert D. Patterson, M.D.  (viewed 17 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; London.

'''Tropical diseases''' are [[Infectious disease|disease]]s that are prevalent in or unique to [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrar|first1=Jeremy|last2=Hotez|first2=Peter J|last3=Junghanss|first3=Thomas|last4=Kang|first4=Gagandeep|last5=Lalloo|first5=David|last6=White|first6=Nicholas|title=Manson's tropical diseases.|date=2013|publisher=Saunders [Imprint]|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780702051012|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diseases are less prevalent in [[temperate climate]]s, due in part to the occurrence of a cold [[season]], which controls the insect population by forcing hibernation. However, many were present in northern Europe and northern America in the 17th and 18th centuries before modern understanding of disease causation. The initial impetus for [[tropical medicine]] was to protect the health of colonialists, notably in India under the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farley|first1=John|title=Bilharzia : a history of imperial tropical medicine.|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0521530601|edition=1. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insects such as mosquitoes and flies are by far the most common disease carrier, or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. These insects may carry a parasite, bacterium or virus that is infectious to humans and animals. Most often disease is transmitted by an insect "bite", which causes transmission of the infectious agent through subcutaneous blood exchange. Vaccines are not available for most of the diseases listed here, and many do not have cures.

Human exploration of [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[deforestation]], rising [[immigration]] and increased international air travel and other [[tourism]] to tropical regions has led to an increased incidence of such diseases.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127962|title=Deforestation Boosts Malaria Rates, Study Finds|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103133648/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127962|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1751188.stm UK 'faces tropical disease threat'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615012659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1751188.stm |date=2006-06-15 }}, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health programmes ==
In 1975 the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) was established to focus on [[neglected tropical diseases|neglected infectious diseases]] which disproportionately affect poor and marginalized populations in developing regions of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. It was established at the [[World Health Organization]], which is the executing agency, and is co-sponsored by the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]], [[United Nations Development Programme]], the [[World Bank]] and the [[World Health Organization]].

TDR's vision is to foster an effective global research effort on infectious [[diseases of poverty]] in which disease endemic countries play a pivotal role. It has a dual mission of developing new tools and strategies against these diseases, and to develop the research and leadership capacity in the countries where the diseases occur. The TDR secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland, but the work is conducted throughout the world through many partners and funded grants.

Some examples of work include helping to develop new treatments for diseases, such as ivermectin for onchocerciasis (river blindness); showing how packaging can improve use of artemesinin-combination treatment (ACT) for malaria; demonstrating the effectiveness of bednets to prevent mosquito bites and malaria; and documenting how community-based and community-led programmes increases distribution of multiple treatments.

Its [[pathogen]]ic agent is a [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]]n named ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', which is [[Vector (epidemiology)|transmitted]] mostly by [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] '''[[assassin bug]]s''', however other methods of transmission are possible, such as ingestion of food contaminated with [[parasite]]s, [[blood transfusion]] and [[fetus|fetal]] transmission. Between 16 and 18 million people are currently infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm|title=Chagas Disease After Organ Transplantation --- United States, 2001|author=|date=|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104013805/https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm|archivedate=4 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[African trypanosomiasis]]
*: or '''sleeping sickness''', is a [[parasitic]] [[disease]], caused by protozoa called trypansomes. The two responsible for African trypanosomiasis are Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.These parasites are transmitted by the '''[[tsetse fly]]'''
* [[Leishmaniasis]]
*: caused by [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]s of the genus Leishmania, and transmitted by the bite of certain species of '''[[sand fly]]'''.
* [[Leprosy]]&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
*: (or '''Hansen's disease''') is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[infectious disease]] caused by [[Mycobacterium leprae]]. Leprosy is primarily a [[granuloma]]tous disease of the [[peripheral nerves]] and [[mucosa]] of the [[upper respiratory tract]]; skin lesions are the primary external symptom.&lt;ref name= Sherris&gt;Kenneth J. Ryan and C. George Ray, Sherris Medical Microbiology Fourth Edition McGraw Hill 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Left untreated, leprosy can be progressive, causing permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes. Contrary to popular conception, leprosy does not cause body parts to simply fall off, and it differs from [[tzaraath]], the malady described in the Hebrew scriptures and previously translated into English as ''leprosy''.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 13:59, Artscroll Tanakh and Metsudah Chumash translations, 1996 and 1994, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Filariasis|Lymphatic filariasis]]
*: is a [[parasite|parasitic]] disease caused by thread-like parasitic filarial worms called [[nematode]]s, all transmitted by '''[[mosquito]]es'''. [[Loa loa]] is another filarial parasite transmitted by the [[deer fly]]. 120 million people are infected worldwide. It is carried by over half the population in the most severe endemic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Supali, T. |author2=Ismid, I.S. |author3=Wibowo, H. |author4=Djuardi, Y. |author5=Majawati, E. |author6=Ginanjar, P. |author7=Fischer, P.  | title=Estimation of the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis by a pool screen PCR assay using blood spots collected on filter paper | journal=Tran R Soc Trop Med Hyg |date=Aug 2006 | volume=100 | issue=8 | pages=753&amp;ndash;9 | doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.10.005 | pmid=16442578  |issn=0035-9203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most noticeable symptom is [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]]: a thickening of the skin and underlying tissues.

Some tropical diseases are very rare, but may occur in sudden [[epidemic]]s, such as the [[Ebola]] hemorrhagic fever, [[Lassa fever]] and the [[Marburg virus]]. There are hundreds of different tropical diseases which are less known or rarer, but that, nonetheless, have importance for [[public health]].

==Relation of climate to tropical diseases==
The so-called "exotic" diseases in the tropics have long been noted both by travelers, explorers, etc., as well as by physicians. One obvious reason is that the hot climate present during all the year and the larger volume of [[rain]]s directly affect the formation of breeding grounds, the larger number and variety of [[natural reservoir]]s and animal diseases that can be transmitted to humans ([[zoonosis]]), the largest number of possible [[insect]] [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of diseases. It is possible also that higher temperatures may favor the replication of pathogenic agents both inside and outside biological organisms. Socio-economic factors may be also in operation, since most of the poorest nations of the world are in the tropics. Tropical countries like [[Brazil]], which have improved their socio-economic situation and invested in [[hygiene]], [[public health]] and the combat of transmissible diseases have achieved dramatic results in relation to the elimination or decrease of many [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] tropical diseases in their territory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

[[Climate change]], [[global warming]] caused by the [[greenhouse effect]], and the resulting increase in global [[temperature]]s, are possibly causing tropical diseases and vectors to spread to higher altitudes in mountainous regions, and to higher latitudes that were previously spared, such as the [[Southern United States]], the Mediterranean area, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/06/italy.climatechange Climate change brings malaria back to Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305222344/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/06/italy.climatechange |date=2016-03-05 }} ''The Guardian'' 6 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4827362.stm Climate link to African malaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616173736/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4827362.stm |date=2006-06-16 }} 20 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Monteverde cloud forest of Costa Rica, global warming enabled Chytridiomycosis, a tropical disease, to flourish and thus force into decline amphibian populations of the Monteverde Harlequin frog.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, J. Alan et al. "Widespread Amphibian Extinctions from Epidemic Deisease Driven by Global Warming." Nature 439.12 (2006) 161-67&lt;/ref&gt; Here, global warming raised the heights of orographic cloud formation, and thus produced cloud cover that would facilitate optimum growth conditions for the implicated pathogen, B. dendrobatidis.

Some of the strategies for controlling tropical diseases include: 
* Draining wetlands to reduce populations of [[insect]]s and other [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s, or introducing natural predators of the vectors.
* The application of [[insecticide]]s and/or [[insect repellent]]s) to strategic surfaces such as clothing, skin, buildings, insect habitats, and [[bed net]]s.
* The use of a [[mosquito net]] over a bed (also known as a "bed net") to reduce nighttime transmission, since certain species of tropical [[mosquito]]es feed mainly at night.
* Use of water [[Water well|well]]s, and/or [[water filtration]], [[water filter]]s, or [[water treatment]] with water tablets to produce drinking water free of parasites.
* [[Sanitation]] to prevent transmission through human waste.
* In situations where vectors (such as mosquitoes) have become more numerous as a result of human activity, a careful investigation can provide clues: for example, open dumps can contain stagnant water that encourage disease vectors to breed. Eliminating these dumps can address the problem.  An education campaign can yield significant benefits at low cost.
* Development and use of [[vaccine]]s to promote disease [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].
* Pharmacologic pre-exposure prophylaxis (to prevent disease before exposure to the environment and/or vector).
* Pharmacologic post-exposure prophylaxis (to prevent disease after exposure to the environment and/or vector).
* Pharmacologic treatment (to treat disease after infection or infestation).
* Assisting with economic development in endemic regions. For example, by providing [[microloan]]s to enable investments in more efficient and productive agriculture. This in turn can help [[subsistence farming]] to become more profitable, and these profits can be used by local populations for disease prevention and treatment, with the added benefit of reducing the poverty rate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==History==

===1960s===
The charity was established in 1964 by eminent obstetrician Professor Will Nixon, who was touched by the grief of a young man whose wife died during childbirth. It was originally called The Childbirth Research Centre. He gathered a group of illustrious founder members including Lord Brain, a neurologist who cared for Winston Churchill on his deathbed in 1965; Sir John Peel, the surgeon-gynaecologist to the Queen; Professor Dugald Baird and Sir George Pinker, an obstetrician who delivered nine royal babies including Princes William and Harry. The founders’ aim was to reduce the number of women and babies who died during pregnancy and childbirth.

An early donation established that a deficiency in folic acid was a factor in malformed babies.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellbeingofwomen.org.uk/research/success-stories/?menu=11c |title=Our achievements |publisher=Wellbeing of Women |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnant women across the world now take folic acid supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vitamins-minerals/Pages/Vitamin-B.aspx |title=Vitamins and minerals - B vitamins and folic acid - NHS Choices |website=Nhs.uk |date=2015-02-18 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity also funded crucial research into epidurals&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt; which means that millions of women now benefit from a relatively pain-free birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural-anaesthesia/pages/introduction.aspx |title=Epidural anaesthesia - NHS Choices |website=Nhs.uk |date=2016-11-24 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
In 1972 the charity was renamed Birthright.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wellbeingofwomen.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/our-history/?menu=2c |title=Our history |publisher=Wellbeing of Women |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research projects they funded created the ground rules that mean many thousands of women have safe laser treatment to treat cervical cancer. They also enabled breakthroughs into monitoring babies in the womb. One early pieces of research into the diagnosis of Down’s Syndrome in pregnant women helped make the amniocentesis test more accurate. The charity also discovered a link between smoking and pre-eclampsia and babies being born underweight.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt;

===1980s===
HRH Diana, Prince of Wales, became the patron of Birthright in 1984.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

She was devoted to the charity, explaining: "To long for a baby and not to be able to have one must be devastating. I don't know how I would cope with that. And if my work for Birthright can alleviate that suffering for just one couple, it will have been all worthwhile."

During her time as patron, the charity funded work into IVF and also investigated HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer leading to the cervical cancer screening programme. The charity’s research into recurrent miscarriage also meant that, out of a research group of 2000 women who had been told they would never have children, 79% went on to have babies.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt; Professor Stuart Campbell of King’s College, London, received funding from the charity for a project that developed an ultrasound that would identify babies at risk of stillbirth by finding out if they had abnormal blood flow.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt;

===1990s===
During the 1990s, the charity funded research which discovered that ultrasound could be used to detect abnormalities in early pregnancy. This resulted in pre-natal screening for Down's Syndrome. The charity enabled breakthroughs in IVF, by funding research into the optimum time for embryo transfer, and by looking at how eggs mature in the ovary. This was described at the time as ‘the biggest advance in fertility treatment’. They also funded research into gynaecological cancers; contraception; and the bone density of post-menopausal women.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt;

===2000s===
The charity was renamed ‘Wellbeing of Women’, in 2004.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Wellbeing of Women partnered with 100 Women in Hedge Funds to fund a project which advanced our understanding of the genetics of Cerebral Palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.100womeninhedgefunds.org/100WHFGenevaGardenParty2008Programme.pdf |title=100 WHF Late Summer Garden Party |website=100womeninhedgefunds.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity also funded research that helped reverse brain damage in newborn babies and a project that helped women suffering from recurrent miscarriage go on to have a successful pregnancy, by identifying ‘Natural Killer cells’ in the mother’s immune system.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt;

In 2007, then British Prime Minister's wife Sarah Brown became patron of Wellbeing of Women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2008, Wellbeing of Women was announced as one of the beneficiary charities of the Lord Mayor’s Appeal, along with ORBIS.&lt;ref name="princeofwales.gov.uk"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160308040919/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/media/press-releases/prince-william-become-patron-of-the-2008-lord-mayors-appeal] &lt;/ref&gt; Prince William was Patron of the appeal.&lt;ref name="princeofwales.gov.uk"/&gt; Funds raised from the appeal enabled Wellbeing of Women to establish the Baby Bio Bank, a unique international resource storing genetic data from ‘family trios’ of mother, father and baby. This bank of genetic information will facilitate on-going research into the persistent complications of pregnancy and birth, including miscarriage, premature birth and pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/tapb/sample-and-data-collections-at-ucl/biobanks-ucl/baby-biobank |title=Baby Biobank |website=Ucl.ac.uk |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
