The '''Age of Sail''' (usually dated as 1571–1862) was a period roughly corresponding to the [[early modern period]] in which [[international trade]] and [[naval warfare]] were dominated by [[sailing ship]]s, lasting from the 16th to the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |title=The Age of Sail |publisher=[[HMS Trincomalee|HMS ''Trincomalee'']] |accessdate=12 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316114603/http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |archive-date=2016-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==
Like most [[History by period|periodic eras]] the definition is inexact but close enough to serve as a general description. The age of sail runs roughly from the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, the last significant engagement in which [[oar]]-propelled [[galley]]s played a major role, to the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in 1862, in which the steam-powered [[ironclad]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] destroyed the sailing ships [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']] and [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']], demonstrating that the advance of [[steam power]] had rendered sail power in warfare obsolete.

The [[Suez Canal]], in the Middle-East, which opened in 1869, was impractical for sailing ships, and made steamboats faster on the [[European-Asian sea route]].

==Golden Age of Sail==
The period between 1850 and the early 20th century when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity is sometimes referred to as the "Golden Age of Sail".&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html "Sailing Ship Rigs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228161737/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html |date=2010-12-28 }}. [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the efficiency and use of commercial sailing vessels was at its peak&amp;mdash;immediately before [[steamboat]]s started to take trade away from sail.

==Decline==
Sailing ships sometimes continued to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s, even if steamships also were used for such transports and became more and more common. Sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered; thus they tended to be more independent from requiring a dedicated support base on the mainland. Crucially though, steam-powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam-powered vessels from the necessity of following [[trade wind]]s. As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in half the time it took a sailing ship. 

Sailing vessels were pushed into narrower and narrower economic niches and gradually disappeared from commercial trade. Today, sailing vessels are only economically viable for small scale coastal fishing, along with recreational uses such as [[yachting]] and passenger sail excursion ships.

[[File:Diagram of Holland Channel cable.png|thumb|300px|right|A period depiction of the Ambrose Channel pilot cable in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bond|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Ambrose Channel pilot cable''', also called the '''Ambrose Channel leader cable''', was a cable laid in [[Ambrose Channel]] at the entrance to the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]] that provided an audio tone for guiding ships in and out of port at times of low visibility. The cable was laid during 1919 and 1920;  it had been removed from the channel and replaced by wireless technology by the end of the 1920s.
&lt;!-- Note: this image needs 500px as it has detail which gets blurred out at lower resolution. --&gt;

==Background==
[[Ambrose Channel]] is the only shipping channel in and out of the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]], an important [[commercial port]]. Delays posed a major problem for shipping en route to [[New York City]], and bad weather could close the channel for days. Ships were forced to wait at the harbor's entrance for conditions to clear. These delays cost shipping companies substantial amounts of money, with each ship costing between $500 and $4000 per hour it was stopped (roughly $5,700 to $46,000 in 2013 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and operation==
[[File:Ambrose pilot cable cross section.png|thumb|The Cable was composed of several layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921b|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]The Ambrose leader cable was an armored cable with a single internal conductor (see picture) that acted like a long radio antenna laid on the channel floor. It originated at [[Fort Lafayette]] (near the present day [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]]), then extended 16 miles down the [[Ambrose Channel]] to the vicinity of [[Lightship Ambrose]] offshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=44–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was powered by a generator at Fort Lafayette that produced 500&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]] (cycles per second) current at 400&amp;nbsp;volts, resulting in an alternating electromagnetic field along the length of the cable that could be detected to approximately a thousand yards away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=51}}. Other voltages may have been used in subsequent operation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The current was mechanically keyed to send the word "NAVY" in [[Morse Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ship received by a pair of [[induction coil]]s hung on opposite sides of the ship, and fed through an amplifier into a headset (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared. The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=46–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
[[File:SE 1600 amplifier ckt.png|thumb|200px|Two-stage vacuum-tube amplifier alternately takes input from inductance coils (top) hung on each side of ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The pilot cable required a series of prior discoveries and inventions. In 1882,  A. R. Sennett patented the use of a submerged electrical cable to communicate with a ship at a fixed location. Around the same time Charles Stevenson patented a means of navigating ships over an electrically charge cable using a [[galvanometer]]. The method became practical when Earl Hanson adapted early [[vacuum tube]] circuits to amplify the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=34}}; {{Harvnb|Current History|1921|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert H. Marriott]] was a radio pioneer employed by the Navy in [[Puget Sound]], where he conducted early experiments with underwater pilot cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geselowitz|2009}}; {{Harvnb|Marriott|1924}}; {{Harvnb|Woods|1980|p=523}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His results were sufficiently promising that he recommended further development to Commander Stanford C. Hooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October, 1919 Commander Hooper instructed A. Crossley, an expert radio aid, to develop and test the concept on a larger scale at the [[Naval Submarine Base New London#History|New London Naval Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Crossley installed a longer version of the cable that Marriott had designed. He used a wooden hulled [[launch (ship)|launch]] for the first round of tests before moving to a steel-hulled [[submarine]] for later tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of vessel picked up the signal and followed the underwater test cable without problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation and testing==
[[File:Ambrose Channel pilot cable in action.PNG|frame|left|Commander R. F. McConnell on the USS ''Semmes'' with the "Hanson apparatus".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nautical Gazette|1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Following the successful tests at New London, the Navy proceeded to large scale testing in Ambrose Channel late in 1919. The [[Minelayer#Naval minelayers|minelayer]] ''Ord'' laid a pilot cable composed of 2,000 feet of leaded and armored cable, 2,000 feet of leaded cable, and 83,000 feet of standard rubber-insulated cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=38–39 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[USS O'Brien (DD-51)|USS ''O'Brien'']] was fitted with receiving equipment and attempted to follow the cable out of the channel. Unfortunately, it was unable to detect a signal past the 1,000 foot mark, where a break in the cable had prevented the signal from continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=40 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The break in the cable was repaired, but over the course of the winter of 1919-1920, crews found that the cable had broken in a total of fifty-two different places due to the strain placed on it while it was being laid. The damage was irreparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=40 }}; {{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Going back to the drawing board, engineers tested 150-foot segments of three different types of cable and used the results to design a new full-size pilot cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navy ordered 87,000 feet of cable from the Simplex Wire and Cable Company in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once complete, the cable was loaded onto the [[USS Pequot (ID-2998)|USS ''Pequot'']] in the [[Boston Navy Yard]]. The ship arrived in New York on July 31, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=43 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ambrose Channel was already crossed by three telegraph cables, owned by [[Western Union]], the [[United States Army|Army]], and the [[New York City Police Department|police]], all of which had to be raised to the surface so the pilot cable could be laid underneath them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=43 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation of the cable was completed on August 6, 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=38–39 }}; {{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and by August 28, electrical tests showed that both the sending and receiving circuits were functioning properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navy tested the cable using the seagoing tug [[USS Algorma (AT-34)|USS ''Algorma'']]. It then invited "representatives of various radio companies, shipping interests, [[Maritime pilot|pilots']] associations, governmental bureaus, naval attaches, and others" for a public demonstration on board the destroyer [[USS Semmes (DD-189)|USS ''Semmes'']] from October 6 through October 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship's windows were covered with canvas and the captains took turns navigating using only the audio cues from the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cable was well received. Even before the New London tests, the Washington Post called it "the greatest development in marine travel since the invention of the steam turbine"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Washington Post|1919|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Los Angeles Times declared the technology to be "one of the greatest peacetime gifts that science has devised."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once operational, the latter newspaper called it "the greatest safeguard devised for shipping in modern history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 1921 trade magazine, leader cables had five functions: "to enable a ship to make a good landfall in thick weather, to lead a ship up the harbor, to lead a ship from open water through a restricted channel to open water on the far side, to give warning of outlying dangers, and to assist a vessel to keep a straight course from port to port and thus save fuel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1921|p=951}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1922, the publication ''Radio World'' stated that the cable's first two years of operation had been successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|1922|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1922, ''Radio Broadcast'' boasted about the money saved by the cable as well as the ease of using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cable itself was paid for using public funds, but it was the responsibility of ship owners to outfit their vessels with receiving equipment. Installation of the cable cost roughly $50,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the listening apparatus installed on each ship using the channel cost $1,200,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; compared with hourly costs of delays that ranged from $500 to $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Radio Broadcast'' expressed the belief that navigation cables would become common for both ships and aircraft: "...there is a future for the audio cable... Its fullest usefulness at American ports and elsewhere waits, however, on that large appreciation of radio devices for sea as well as air navigation which pilots, both on the sea and in the air, expect, but do not as yet demand."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=251}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obsolescence and legacy ==
Despite the media hype, it appears that the Ambrose Channel pilot cable never met with large scale commercial success. Initially, some contemporaries of the cable proposed that it be extended several miles past the Ambrose light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such plans never came to fruition, as advances in technology rendered the pilot cable obsolete.  By 1929 the ''Baltimore Sun'' reported ships navigating the Channel blindly without making any reference to the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baltimore Sun|1929}}; {{Harvnb|Putnam|1924|p=215}}; {{Harvnb|Science|1924|p=xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Marriott publicly complained that navigation cables still had unrealized potential for guiding ships. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Science News-Letter|1929}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leader cable systems appear to have been made obsolete by the refinement of [[radio direction finding]] and the placement of [[Electric beacon|radio beacons]] (low-power radio transmitters) at strategic locations. Those beacons are analogous to lighthouses, but can be "seen" in all weather, and are used for navigation in the same way as regular lighthouses.  The first successful application of these radio beacons as "radio fog signals" were three stations installed near New York in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Putnam|1924}}; {{Harvnb|Radio Broadcast|1922|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, there were eleven stations in operation in the United States and nearly three hundred ships suitably equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Putnam|1924|p=213}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1930, an article in the ''Journal of the [[Royal Society of Arts]]'' declared that "wireless aids and echo sounding have superseded [the leader cable]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cooper|1930|pp=995–996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, more modern navigation tools such as [[radar]], [[global positioning system|GPS]], and lighted [[buoy]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s help ships navigate Ambrose Channel.



Earl Hanson, one of the key players in designing the Ambrose Channel cable, writing for ''Popular Mechanics,'' viewed it as a step toward applying radio cable technology in vast swaths of everyday life, including guiding aircraft and navigating and powering automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hanson|1934}}; {{Harvnb|Yates|Pacent|1922|p=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ambrose Channel cable was removed from the channel and used in testing an early system of [[autolanding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howeth|1963|loc= Chap. 28, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=367 §16]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cable found no more success in that role than it did in guiding ships. The [[Blind Landing Experimental Unit]] later tried a similar system briefly before also abandoning it in favor of wireless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|1930|p=13 }}; {{Harvnb|Davis|1922|p=5}}; {{Harvnb|Armstrong|1930|pp=1–2}}; {{Harvnb|Perry|2004|p=100}}; {{Harvnb|Hanson|1919|p=489}}; {{Harvnb|Current History|1921|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Puffinus puffinus -Iceland -flying-6 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Manx shearwater]]s can fly straight home when released, navigating thousands of miles over land or sea.]]

'''Animal navigation''' is the ability of many animals to find their way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the [[Arctic tern]], insects such as the [[Monarch (butterfly)|monarch butterfly]] and fish such as the [[salmon]] regularly [[Animal migration|migrate]] thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds,&lt;ref name="DingleDrake"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dingle, Hugh |author2=Drake, V. Alistair |year=2007 |title=What is migration? |journal=BioScience |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=113–121 |url= http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1641/B570206 |doi=10.1641/B570206}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.

[[Dead reckoning]], navigating from a known position using only information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1873 as a possible mechanism. In the 20th century, [[Karl von Frisch]] showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. [[William Tinsley Keeton]] showed that [[homing pigeons]] could similarly make use of a range of navigational cues, including the sun, [[earth's magnetic field]], [[olfaction]] and vision. [[Ronald Lockley]] demonstrated that a small seabird, the [[Manx shearwater]], could orient itself and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.

Several species of animal can integrate cues of different types to orient themselves and navigate effectively. Insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed direction (from the [[earth's magnetic field]] or from the sky) to identify where they are and so to navigate. Internal 'maps' are often formed using vision, but other senses including [[olfaction]] and [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] may also be used.

The ability of wild animals to navigate may be adversely affected by products of human activity. For example, there is evidence that pesticides may interfere with bee navigation, and that lights may harm turtle navigation.

==Early research==

[[File:Waggle dance.png|thumb|upright|[[Karl von Frisch]] (1953) discovered that [[European honey bee|honey bee]] workers can navigate, and indicate the range and direction to food to other workers with a [[waggle dance]].]]
In 1873, [[Charles Darwin]] wrote a letter to [[Nature (magazine)|''Nature'' magazine]], arguing that animals including man have the ability to navigate by dead reckoning, even if a magnetic 'compass' sense and the ability to navigate by the stars is present:&lt;ref name="DarwinNature"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=24 April 1873 |title=Origin of Certain Instincts |journal=Nature |volume=7 |pages=417–418 |doi=10.1038/007417a0 |issue=179| url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F1760&amp;pageseq=1 |bibcode=1873Natur...7..417D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|With regard to the question of the means by which animals find their way home from a long distance, a striking account, in relation to man, will be found in the English translation of the Expedition to North [[Siberia]], by [[Ferdinand von Wrangel|Von Wrangell]].{{efn|The book was ''A Journey on the Northern Coast of Siberia and the Icy Sea'' (2 vols.), London, 1841. ''Wrangel'' is variously spelt ''Vrangel'' or ''Wrangell''.}} He there describes the wonderful manner in which the natives kept a true course towards a particular spot, whilst passing for a long distance through hummocky ice, with incessant changes of direction, and with no guide in the heavens or on the frozen sea. He states (but I quote only from memory of many years standing) that he, an experienced surveyor, and using a compass, failed to do that which these savages easily effected. Yet no one will suppose that they possessed any special sense which is quite absent in us. We must bear in mind that neither a compass, nor the north star, nor any other such sign, suffices to guide a man to a particular spot through an intricate country, or through hummocky ice, when many deviations from a straight course are inevitable, unless the deviations are allowed for, or a sort of "dead reckoning" is kept. All men are able to do this in a greater or less degree, and the natives of Siberia apparently to a wonderful extent, though probably in an unconscious manner. This is effected chiefly, no doubt, by eyesight, but partly, perhaps, by the sense of muscular movement, in the same manner as a man with his eyes blinded can proceed (and some men much better than others) for a short distance in a nearly straight line, or turn at right angles, or back again. The manner in which the sense of direction is sometimes suddenly disarranged in very old and feeble persons, and the feeling of strong distress which, as I know, has been experienced by persons when they have suddenly found out that they have been proceeding in a wholly unexpected and wrong direction, leads to the suspicion that some part of the brain is specialised for the function of direction.}}

Later in 1873, Joseph John Murphy{{efn|JJ Murphy (d 1894), of [[County Antrim]], was treasurer and then president of the [https://archive.org/stream/belfastliterarys00belf/belfastliterarys00belf_djvu.txt Belfast Literary Society]. He attempted to harmonise evolution and religion, publishing a book ''The Scientific Bases of Faith'' in 1872.}} replied to Darwin, writing back to ''Nature'' with a description of how he, Murphy, believed animals carried out dead reckoning, by what is now called [[inertial navigation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J.J. ''Instinct: a Mechanical Analogy''. ''Nature'' 7:483. 24 April 1873. {{doi|10.1038/007483b0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If a ball is freely suspended from the roof of a railway carriage it will receive a shock sufficient to move it, when the carriage is set in motion: and the magnitude and direction of the shock … will depend on the magnitude and direction of the force with which the carriage begins to move … [and so] … every change in … the motion of the carriage … will give a shock of corresponding magnitude and direction to the ball. Now, it is conceivably quite possible, though such delicacy of mechanism is not to be hoped for, that a machine should be constructed … for registering the magnitude and direction of all these shocks, with the time at which each occurred … from these data the position of the carriage … might be calculated at any moment.}}

[[Karl von Frisch]] (1886–1982) studied the [[European honey bee]], demonstrating that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways: by the sun, by the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark [[beehive]].{{sfn|von Frisch|1953|pp=93–96}}

[[William Tinsley Keeton]] (1933–1980) studied [[Homing (biology)|homing]] pigeons, showing that they were able to navigate using the [[earth's magnetic field]], the sun, as well as both [[Olfactory navigation|olfactory]] and visual cues.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Keeton|Keeton, William]] (1974) ''The orientational and navigational basis of homing in birds''. pages 47–132 in ''Advances in the Study of Behavior'', Vol. 5. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Griffin]] (1915–2003) studied [[Animal echolocation|echolocation in bats]], demonstrating that it was possible and that bats used this mechanism to detect and track prey, and to "see" and thus navigate through the world around them.&lt;ref name=GriffinNYT&gt;Yoon, Carol Kaesuk. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/14/nyregion/donald-r-griffin-88-dies-argued-animals-can-think.html ''Donald R. Griffin, 88, Dies; Argued Animals Can Think''], [[The New York Times]], 14 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Lockley]] (1903–2000), among many studies of birds in over fifty books, pioneered the science of bird migration. He made a twelve-year study of shearwaters such as the [[Manx shearwater]], living on the remote island of [[Skokholm]].{{sfn|Lockley|1942}} These small seabirds make one of the longest migrations of any bird—10,000 kilometres—but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year. This behaviour led to the question of how they navigated.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|pp=114–117}}

==Mechanisms==

Lockley began his book ''Animal Navigation'' with the words:{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=9}}
{{quote|How do animals find their way over apparently trackless country, through pathless forests, across empty deserts, over and under featureless seas? ... They do so, of course, without any visible [[compass]], [[sextant]], [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] or [[Nautical chart|chart]]...}}

Many mechanisms have been proposed for animal navigation: there is evidence for a number of them. Investigators have often been forced to discard the simplest hypotheses - for example, some animals can navigate on a dark and cloudy night, when neither landmarks nor celestial cues like sun, moon, or stars are visible. The major mechanisms known or hypothesized are described in turn below.

=== Remembered landmarks ===

Animals including mammals, birds and insects such as bees and wasps (''[[Ammophila (Sphecidae)|Ammophila]]'' and ''[[Sphex]]''),{{sfn|Tinbergen|1984|pp=58–79}} are capable of learning landmarks in their environment, and of using these in navigation.&lt;ref&gt;Collett, Thomas S; Graham, Paul. "Animal Navigation: Path Integration, Visual Landmarks and Cognitive Maps" ''Current Biology'', Vol. 14, R475–R477, June 22, 2004. {{doi|10.1016/j.cub.2004.06.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orientation by the sun ===
{{main article|Sun compass in animals}}

[[File:Talitrus saltator 2c.jpg|thumb|The sandhopper, ''[[Talitrus saltator]]'', uses the sun and its [[Circadian rhythm|internal clock]] to determine direction.]]
Some animals can navigate using celestial cues such as the position of the sun. Since the sun moves in the sky, navigation by this means also requires an internal clock. Many animals depend on such a clock to maintain their [[circadian rhythm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dunlap, Jay C.; Loros, Jennifer; DeCoursey, Patricia J. |year=2003 |title=Chronobiology: Biological Timekeeping |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0878931491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that use sun compass orientation are [[fish]], birds, sea-turtles, [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[bee]]s, [[sandhopper]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[ant]]s.&lt;ref name=Alcock140&gt;{{cite book |last=Alcock |first=John |title=Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary Approach |year=2009 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0-87893-225-2 |pages=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[sandhopper]]s (such as ''[[Talitrus saltator]]'') are taken up a beach, they easily find their way back down to the sea. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving downhill or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=74}}

Experiments with [[Puffinus puffinus|Manx shearwater]]s showed that when released "under a clear sky" far from their nests, the seabirds first oriented themselves and then flew off in the correct direction. But if the sky was overcast at the time of release, the shearwaters flew around in circles.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|pp=114–117}}

[[Monarch butterfly|Monarch butterflies]] use the sun as a compass to guide their southwesterly autumn migration from Canada to Mexico.&lt;ref name=Alcock140/&gt;

=== Orientation by the night sky ===

In a pioneering experiment, Lockley showed that [[warbler]]s placed in a planetarium showing the night sky oriented themselves towards the south; when the planetarium sky was then very slowly rotated, the birds maintained their orientation with respect to the displayed stars. Lockley observes that to navigate by the stars, birds would need both a "sextant and chronometer": a built-in ability to read patterns of stars and to navigate by them, which also requires an accurate time-of-day clock.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=136}}

In 2003, the African [[dung beetle]] ''[[Scarabaeus zambesianus]]'' was shown to navigate using [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] patterns in [[moonlight]], making it the first animal known to use polarized moonlight for orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/424033a| title=Animal behaviour: Insect orientation to polarized moonlight| journal=Nature| volume=424| issue=6944| pages=33| year=2003| last1=Dacke | first1=M. | last2=Nilsson | first2=D.

=== Orientation by polarised light ===
[[File:degpolred.jpg|thumb| [[Rayleigh sky model]] shows how polarization of light can indicate direction to bees.]]
{{main article|Rayleigh sky model}}

Some animals, notably insects such as the [[honey bee]], are sensitive to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. [[Karl von Frisch]]'s work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the [[Beehive|hive]] to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a [[waggle dance]]. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction,{{sfn|von Frisch|1953|pp=93–96}} though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Grüter | first1=C. | last2=Balbuena | first2=M.| last3=Farina | first3=W. | title=Informational conflicts created by the waggle dance  | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B | year=2008 | volume=275 | issue=1640 | pages=1321–1327 | pmc=2602683 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0186 | pmid=18331980}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).{{sfn|von Frisch|1953|pp=93–96}}

=== Magnetoreception===
[[File:Homing pigeon.jpg|thumb|The [[homing pigeon]] can quickly return to its home, using cues such as the earth's magnetic field to orient itself.]]
{{main article|Magnetoreception}}

Some animals, including mammals such as blind mole rats (''[[Spalax]]'') &lt;ref name=Kimchi&gt;Kimchi, Tali; Etienne, Ariane S.; Terkel, Joseph (2004). [http://www.pnas.org/content/101/4/1105.full.pdf A subterranean mammal uses the magnetic compass for path integration.]  PNAS, 27 January, vol. 101, no. 4, 1105–1109.&lt;/ref&gt; and birds such as pigeons, are sensitive to the earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lindauer and H. Martin, in S.R. Galler et al. ''Animal Orientation and Navigation'' 559/1, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homing pigeons use magnetic field information with other navigational cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1996 |author=Walcott, C. |title=Pigeon homing: Observations, experiments and confusions |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |issue=1 |pages=21–27 |pmid=9317262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly on a clear sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer to rely on the direction of the sun, but switch to using a magnetic field cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Keeton | first1=W. T. | year=1971 | title=Magnets interfere with pigeon homing | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=68 | issue=1 | pages=102–6 | pmc=391171 | pmid=5276278 | doi=10.1073/pnas.68.1.102 | bibcode=1971PNAS...68..102K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olfaction ===

[[File:Salmon leaping at the Falls of Shin, Scotland.jpg|thumb|upright|Returning [[salmon]] may use [[olfaction]] to identify the river in which they developed.]]

[[Olfactory navigation]] has been suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the [[odours]] in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour.&lt;ref name=papi90&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ioalè |first=P. |author2=Nozzolini, M. |author3=Papi, F. |year=1990 |title=Homing pigeons do extract directional information from olfactory stimuli |journal=Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=301–305 |doi=10.1007/bf00171094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues that there is a steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However it is not clear that such stable gradients exist.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, H.G. (1974). ''Das Navigationssystem der Vögel. Ein theoretischer Beitrag zur Analyse ungeklärter Orientierungsleistungen.'' Schriftenreihe 'Kybernetik'. München, Wien: R. Oldenbourg Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.&lt;ref name=wil96&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiltschko |first=W. |author2= Wiltschko, R. |year=1996 |title=Magnetic Orientation in Birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=29–38|pmid=9317275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olfactory cues may be important in [[salmon]], which are known to return to the exact river where they hatched. Lockley reports experimental evidence that fish such as minnows can accurately tell the difference between the waters of different rivers.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=180}} Salmon may use their magnetic sense to navigate to within reach of their river, and then use olfaction to identify the river at close range.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, K. J.; Lohmann, C. M. F.; Endres, C. S. (2008). [http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/11/1719.full ''The sensory ecology of ocean navigation''] J Exp Biol, 211: 1719–1728.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravity receptors===
{{see|Gravity gradiometry}}

[[GPS]] tracing studies indicate that gravity anomalies could play a role in homing pigeon navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nicole Blaser |author2=Sergei I.

===Other senses===

Biologists have considered other senses that may contribute to animal navigation. Many marine animals such as seals are capable of [[hydrodynamic reception]], enabling them to track and catch prey such as fish by sensing the disturbances their passage leaves behind in the water.&lt;ref name="S-P 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jeb.02708 |pmid=17297138 |year=2007 |author1=Schulte-Pelkum |first1=N. |title=Tracking of biogenic hydrodynamic trails in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=210 |issue=5 |pages=781–7|last2=Wieskotten |first2=S. |last3=Hanke |first3=W. |last4=Dehnhardt |first4=G. |last5=Mauck |first5=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine mammals such as dolphins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schevill | first1=W.

F. | year=1956 | title=Evidence for echolocation by cetaceans |  journal=Deep-Sea Research | volume=3 | issue=2| pages=153–154 | doi=10.1016/0146-6313(56)90096-x | bibcode=1956DSR.....3..153S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and many species of bat,&lt;ref name=GriffinNYT/&gt; are capable of [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]], which they use both for detecting prey and for orientation by sensing their environment.

===Way-marking===

The [[wood mouse]] is the first non-human animal to be observed, both in the wild and under laboratory conditions, using movable landmarks to navigate. While foraging, they pick up and distribute visually conspicuous objects, such as leaves and twigs, which they then use as landmarks during exploration, moving the markers when the area has been explored.&lt;ref name="Stopka Macdonald 2003 p=3"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stopka | first=Pavel | last2=Macdonald | first2=David W. | title=Way-marking behaviour: an aid to spatial navigation in the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) | journal=BMC Ecology | volume=3 | issue=1 | year=2003 | doi=10.1186/1472-6785-3-3 | page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Path integration ==
[[File:Path integration diagram.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5&lt;!--width for readable text--&gt;|[[Path integration]] sums the [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]]s of distance and direction travelled from a start point to estimate current position, and so the path back to the start.]]
{{main article|Path integration}}

[[Dead reckoning]], in animals usually known as [[path integration]], means the putting together of cues from different sensory sources within the body, without reference to [[Visual perception|visual]] or other external landmarks, to estimate position relative to a known starting point continuously while travelling on a path that is not necessarily straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the task is to compute the [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animalbehavioronline.com/pathintegration.html | title=Path Integration | publisher=Animal Behavior Online | year=2001 | accessdate=10 December 2012 | author=Breed, Michael D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''On the Origins of Certain Instincts''&lt;ref name="DarwinNature"/&gt; (quoted above) in 1873, path integration has been shown to be important to navigation in animals including ants, rodents and birds.&lt;ref&gt;Gallistel. The Organization of Learning. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Whishaw | first1=I.Q. | last2=Hines | first2=D.J. | last3=Wallace | first3=D.G. | year=2001 | title=Dead reckoning (path integration) requires the hippocampal formation: evidence from spontaneous exploration and spatial learning tasks in light (allothetic) and dark (idiothetic) tests | url=http://hsinnamon.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/NSB-Psyc255/Readings/17.%20Spatial%20Limbic%20System/Whishaw.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Behavioural Brain Research | volume=127 | issue=1–2| pages=49–69 | doi=10.1016/s0166-4328(01)00359-x | pmid=11718884}}&lt;/ref&gt; When vision (and hence the use of remembered landmarks) is not available, such as when animals are navigating on a cloudy night, in the open ocean, or in relatively featureless areas such as sandy deserts, path integration must rely on ''[[idiothetic]]'' cues from within the body.&lt;ref&gt;Mittelstaedt, H.; Mittelstaedt, M.-L. (1973). ''Mechanismen der orientierung ohne richtende aussenreize''. Forschr. Zool., 21:46–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mittelstaedt | first1=M.-L. | last2=Mittelstaedt | first2=H. | year=1980 | title=Homing by path integration in a mammal | url=| journal=Naturwissenschaften | volume=67 | issue=11| pages=566–567 | doi=10.1007/bf00450672| bibcode=1980NW.....67..566M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by Wehner in the [[Sahara desert ant]] (''Cataglyphis bicolor'') demonstrate effective path integration to determine directional heading (by polarized light or sun position) and to compute distance (by monitoring leg movement or optical flow).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Desert ant navigation: how miniature brains solve complex tasks |author=Wehner R | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology |year=2003 |volume=189 |issue=8 |pages=579–588 |url=http://www.zool.uzh.ch/static/research/nb_wehner/literatur/pdf03/wehner20038.pdf | doi=10.1007/s00359-003-0431-1 | pmid=12879352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Path integration in mammals makes use of the [[vestibular organs]], which detect accelerations in the three [[dimension]]s, together with [[Efference copy|motor efference]], where the motor system tells the rest of the brain which movements were commanded,&lt;ref name=Kimchi/&gt; and [[optic flow]], where the visual system signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Perception of the Visual World | author=Gibson, J.J.| publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information from other senses such as echolocation and magnetoreception may also be integrated in certain animals. The [[hippocampus]] is the part of the brain that integrates linear and angular motion to encode a mammal's relative position in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Path integration and the neural basis of the 'cognitive map' |author1=McNaughton, BL |author2=Battaglia FP |author3=Jensen O |author4=Moser EI |author5=Moser MB | journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |date=August 2006 | volume=7 | issue=8 | pages=663–678 | pmid=16858394 | doi=10.1038/nrn1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Redish states that "The carefully controlled experiments of Mittelstaedt and Mittelstaedt (1980) and Etienne (1987) have demonstrated conclusively that [path integration in mammals] is a consequence of integrating internal cues from vestibular signals and motor efferent copy".{{sfn|Redish|1999|p=67}}

==Effects of human activity==

[[Neonicotinoid]] pesticides may impair the ability of bees to navigate. Bees exposed to low levels of [[thiamethoxam]] were less likely to return to their colony, to an extent sufficient to compromise a colony's survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17535769 | title=BBC News: Science &amp; Environment | publisher=BBC | work=Pesticides hit queen bee numbers | date=29 March 2012 | accessdate=30 March 2012 | author=Black, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light pollution]] attracts and disorients photophilic animals, those that follow light.  For example, hatchling sea turtles follow bright light, particularly bluish light, altering their navigation. Disrupted navigation in moths can easily be observed around bright lamps on summer nights.  Insects gather around these lamps at high densities instead of navigating naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Behavioral Approaches to Conservation in the Wild | publisher=Cambridge University Press | authors=Witherington, Blair E. in Clemmons, Janine Rhea, and Buchholz, Richard (editors)| year=1997 | pages=301–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Base station''' (or '''base radio station''') is – according to the [[International Telecommunication Union]]'s (ITU) [[ITU Radio Regulations|Radio Regulations]] (RR)&lt;ref&gt;ITU Radio Regulations, Section IV. Radio Stations and Systems – Article 1.71, definition: "base station / base radio station"&lt;/ref&gt; – a "[[land station]] in the [[land mobile service]]."

The term is used in the context of [[mobile telephony]], [[wireless computer networking]] and other [[wireless communications]] and in [[land surveying]]. In surveying, it is a [[GPS receiver]] at a known position, while in wireless communications it is a [[transceiver]] connecting a number of other devices to one another and/or to a wider area.
In mobile telephony, it provides the connection between [[mobile phone]]s and the wider [[telephone network]]. In a [[computer network]], it is a transceiver acting as a [[switch (computing)|switch]] for [[computer]]s in the network, possibly connecting them to a/another [[local area network]] and/or the [[Internet]]. In traditional wireless communications, it can refer to the hub of a [[dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] fleet such as a [[taxi]] or [[delivery (commerce)|delivery]] fleet, the base of a [[TETRA]] network as used by [[government]] and [[emergency services]] or a [[Citizen’s band radio|CB]] [[radio shack|shack]].

== Land surveying ==

In the context of external land surveying, a base station is a [[GPS]] receiver at an accurately-known fixed location which is used to derive correction information for nearby portable GPS receivers.  This correction data allows [[radio propagation|propagation]] and other effects to be corrected out of the position data obtained by the mobile stations, which gives greatly increased location precision and accuracy over the results obtained by uncorrected GPS receivers.

== Computer networking ==

{{see also|Wireless access point}}
In the area of wireless computer networking, a base station is a radio receiver/transmitter that serves as the hub of the local wireless network, and may also be the gateway between a wired network and the wireless network. It typically consists of a low-power transmitter and [[wireless router]].

== Wireless communications ==

In radio communications, a base station is a wireless communications station installed at a fixed location and used to communicate as part of one of the following:

* a [[Push to talk|push-to-talk]] [[two-way radio]] system, or;
* a [[Radiotelephone|wireless telephone]] system such as [[Mobile phone|cellular]] [[CDMA]] or [[GSM]] [[cell site]].
* [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio]]

=== Two-way radio ===

==== Professional ====

In professional two-way radio systems, a base station is used to maintain contact with a [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] fleet of [[Walkie talkie|hand-held]] or [[Mobile radio|mobile]] radios, and/or to activate one-way paging receivers. The base station is one end of a communications link. The other end is a movable vehicle-mounted radio or walkie-talkie.&lt;ref&gt;"Evaluating Regional Alternatives: Systems Design Considerations," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Local/Regional Level Planning Guide'', (Washington, D.C.: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, US Department of Transportation, 1995) pp. 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of base station uses in two-way radio include the dispatch of [[tow truck]]s and [[taxicab]]s.

[[File:Base station 2 channel block diagram.svg|left|thumb|500px|Basic base station elements used in a remote-controlled installation. [[Selective calling]] options such as CTCSS are optional.]]Professional base station radios are often one channel. In lightly used base stations, a multi-channel unit may be employed.&lt;ref&gt;Block diagram is from: "Figure 2: Two Channel VHF Base Station," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Local/Regional Level Planning Guide'', (Washington, D.C.: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, US Department of Transportation, 1995) pp. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In heavily used systems, the capability for additional channels, where needed, is accomplished by installing an additional base station for each channel. Each base station appears as a single channel on the dispatch center control console. In a properly designed dispatch center with several staff members, this allows each dispatcher to communicate simultaneously, independently of one another, on a different channel as necessary. For example, a taxi company dispatch center may have one base station on a high-rise building in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and another on a different channel in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. Each taxi dispatcher could communicate with taxis in either Boston or Providence by selecting the respective base station on his or her console.&lt;ref&gt;Base stations in land mobile systems are often located at remote sites such as hilltops or water towers. Some are controlled from two or more locations. For example, a base station used to communicate with taxis may be connected to remote control consoles at both a taxi company office and an answering service for after-hours calls. The taxi company and answering service may be miles apart. Single channel base stations reduce confusion by eliminating the possibility that the wrong channel may be selected.&lt;/ref&gt;

In dispatching centers it is common for eight or more radio base stations to be connected to a single dispatching console. Dispatching personnel can tell which channel a message is being received on by a combination of local protocol, unit identifiers, volume settings, and busy indicator lights. A typical console has two speakers identified as ''select'' and ''unselect''. Audio from a primary selected channel is routed to the select speaker and to a headset. Each channel has a busy light which flashes when someone talks on the associated channel.&lt;ref&gt;To read more about multi-channel consoles, look at the service manual for a relatively simple console: ''8-Channel Remote Console, 120, 220, 240 V AC or 12 V DC T16167 AM or BM'', 68-81021E80, (Schaumburg, Illinois: Motorola, Inc. 1980.) This is a relatively simple analog console compared to large, enterprise-level Centracom-series units.&lt;/ref&gt;

Base stations can be local controlled or remote controlled. Local controlled base stations are operated by front panel controls on the base station cabinet. Remote control base stations can be operated over tone- or [[4-20 mA#Two-way radio use|DC-remote]] circuits. The dispatch point console and remote base station are connected by leased private line telephone circuits, (sometimes called ''RTO circuit''s), a [[Digital Signal 1|DS-1]], or radio links.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''RTO circuit'' is legacy jargon and comes from Bell System billing terminology. RTO circuits refer to analog radio remote control and radio broadcast leased telephone circuits.&lt;/ref&gt; The consoles multiplex transmit commands onto remote control circuits. Some system configurations require duplex, or four wire, audio paths from the base station to the console. Others require only a two-wire or half duplex link.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief discussion of remote controlled base stations, see: "Evaluating Regional Alternatives: Systems Design Considerations," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Local/Regional Level Planning Guide'', (Washington, D.C.: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, US Department of Transportation, 1995) pp. 39–41. Tone remote controls are described in this section.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Base station antenna network.svg|right|thumb|230px|The diagram shows a [[band-pass filter]] used to reduce the base station [[Receiver (radio)|receiver's]] exposure to unwanted signals. It also reduces the transmission of undesired signals. The [[Circulator|isolator]] is a one-way device which reduces the ease of signals from nearby transmitters going up the antenna line and into the base station [[transmitter]]. This prevents the unwanted mixing of signals inside the base station transmitter which can generate interference.]] Interference could be defined as receiving any signal other than from a radio in your own system. To avoid interference from users on the same channel, or interference from nearby strong signals on another channel, professional base stations use a combination of:&lt;ref&gt;Block diagram is from: "Figure 8: Bandpass Cavity/Isolator Location," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Local/Regional Level Planning Guide'', (Washington, D.C.: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, US Department of Transportation, 1995) pp. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulleted items condensed from, "EMS Communications," "System Coordination," and "Site Engineering," in ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Local/Regional Level Planning Guide'', (Washington, D.C.: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, US Department of Transportation, 1995) pp. 10–19, 55–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Base stations are sometimes called ''control'' or ''fixed'' stations in US [[Federal Communications Commission]] licensing. These terms are defined in regulations inside Part 90 of the commissions regulations. In US licensing jargon, types of base stations include:
* A '''fixed''' station is a base station used in a system intended only to communicate with other base stations. A ''fixed'' station can also be radio link used to operate a distant base station by remote control. (No mobile or hand-held radios are involved in the system.)
* A '''control''' station is a base station used in a system with a repeater where the base station is used to communicate through the repeater.
* A '''temporary base''' is a base station used in one location for less than a year.
* A '''[[Radio repeater|repeater]]''' is a type of base station that extends the range of hand-held and mobile radios.

==== Amateur and hobbyist use ====

In [[amateur radio]], a base station also communicates with [[mobile rig]]s but for hobby or family communications. Amateur systems sometimes serve as dispatch radio systems during disasters, search and rescue mobilizations, or other emergencies.

An [[Australia]]n [[UHF CB]] base station is another example of part of a system used for hobby or family communications.

=== Wireless telephone ===

[[Radiotelephone|Wireless telephone]] differ from two-way radios in that:

* wireless telephones are circuit switched: the communications paths are set up by dialing at the start of a call and the path remains in place until one of the callers hangs up.
* wireless telephones communicate with other telephones usually over the [[public switched telephone network]].

A wireless telephone base station communicates with a mobile or hand-held phone. For example, in a wireless telephone system, the signals from one or more mobile telephones in an area are received at a nearby base station, which then connects the call to the land-line network. Other equipment is involved depending on the system architecture. Mobile telephone provider networks, such as European GSM networks, may involve [[multiplexing|carrier]], [[microwave radio]], and [[Telephone exchange|switching facilities]] to connect the call. In the case of a portable phone such as a US cordless phone, the connection is directly connected to a wired land line.

=== Emissions issues ===
[[File:GaffneySC-CellTower.jpg|thumb|A cell tower near Thicketty, South Carolina.]]
While low levels of radio-frequency power are usually considered to have negligible effects on health, national and local regulations restrict the design of base stations to limit exposure to [[electromagnetic field]]s. Technical measures to limit exposure include restricting the radio frequency power emitted by the station, elevating the antenna above ground level, changes to the [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] pattern, and barriers to foot or road traffic.  For typical base stations, significant electromagnetic energy is only emitted at the antenna, not along the length of the antenna tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Warren PM|title=IEEE C95.1-2005 "IEEE Standard for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz" Sources: US Department of Health; The World Health Organization|editor= |publisher=IEEE |location= |year=2006|pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because mobile phones and their base stations are two-way radios, they produce radio-frequency ([[Radio frequency|RF]]) radiation in order to communicate, exposing people near them to [[RF radiation]] giving concerns about [[mobile phone radiation and health]]. Hand-held mobile telephones are relatively low power so the RF radiation exposures from them are generally low.

The [[World Health Organization]] has concluded that "there is no convincing scientific evidence that the weak RF signals from base stations and wireless networks cause adverse health effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs304/en/ |title=Electromagnetic fields and public health: Base stations and wireless technologies |work=World Health Organisation |accessdate=2014-09-08}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consensus of the scientific community is that the power from these mobile phone base station antennas is too low to produce health hazards as long as people are kept away from direct access to the antennas. However, current international exposure guidelines ([[ICNIRP]]) are based largely on the ''thermal'' effects of base station emissions, NOT considering the [[Non-thermal microwave effect|''non-thermal'' effects]] harmless.

=== Emergency power===
[[Fuel cell]] [[backup power]] systems are added to critical base stations or [[cell site]]s to provide emergency power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.chfca.ca/itoolkit.asp?pg=BALLARD_07132009 Ballard fuel cells to power telecom backup power units for motorola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172302/http://fr.chfca.ca/itoolkit.asp?pg=BALLARD_07132009 |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cleantech.com/news/3674/india-telecom-get-fuel-cells India telecoms to get fuel cell power] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126130543/http://cleantech.com/news/3674/india-telecom-get-fuel-cells |date=November 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old Bedford River at Welney - geograph.org.uk - 688607.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Old Bedford River, photographed from the bridge at Welney, Norfolk (2008); the camera is looking downstream, south-west of the bridge]]

The '''Bedford Level experiment''' is a series of [[observation]]s carried out along a {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in|adj=on}} length of the [[Old Bedford River]] on the Bedford Level of the [[Cambridgeshire]] Fens in the [[United Kingdom]], during the 19th and early 20th centuries, to measure the [[figure of the Earth|curvature]] of the [[Earth]].  [[Samuel Birley Rowbotham]], who conducted the first observations starting in 1838, claimed he had proven the Earth to be [[Flat Earth|flat]]. However, in 1870, after adjusting Rowbotham's method to avoid the effects of [[atmospheric refraction]], [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] found a curvature consistent with a [[spherical Earth]].&lt;ref name=garwood /&gt;

== The Bedford Level ==

At the point chosen for all the experiments, the river is a slow-flowing drainage canal running in an uninterrupted straight line for a {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in|adj=on}} stretch to the north-east of the village of [[Welney]].  This makes it an ideal location to directly measure the curvature of the Earth, as Rowbotham wrote in ''[[Zetetic Astronomy]]:''

: IF the earth is a globe, and is 25,000 English statute miles in circumference, the surface of all standing water must have a certain degree of convexity—every part must be an arc of a circle. From the summit of any such arc there will exist a curvature or declination of 8 inches in the first statute mile. In the second mile the fall will be 32 inches; in the third mile, 72 inches, or 6 feet, as shown in the following diagram:

: [[File:Fig01.jpg|thumb|right|Earth's rate of curvature as shown in ''Zetetic Astronomy''. [[Vertical exaggeration]] 1000x.]]

: ...[A]fter the first few miles the curvature would be so great that no difficulty could exist in detecting either its actual existence or its proportion...In the county of Cambridge there is an artificial river or canal, called the "Old Bedford." It is upwards of twenty miles in length, and ... passes in a straight line through that part of the Fens called the "Bedford Level." The water is nearly stationary—often completely so, and throughout its entire length has no interruption from locks or water-gates of any kind; so that it is, in every respect, well adapted for ascertaining whether any or what amount of convexity really exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

Samuel Birley Rowbotham) |publisher=via sacred-texts.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiments ==

[[File:Rowbotham–curvature.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of Rowbotham's experiment on the Bedford Level, taken from his book "Earth not a globe"]]
The first experiment at this site was conducted by Rowbotham in the summer of 1838.  He waded into the river and used a telescope held {{convert|8|in|cm|spell=in}} above the water to watch a boat, with a flag on its mast {{convert|3|ft|m|spell=in}} above the water, row slowly away from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zetetic Astronomy|first=Samuel|last=Rowbotham|year=1863|url=https://archive.org/details/zeteticastronom00rowbgoog|page=11|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that the vessel remained constantly in his view for the full {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} to Welney bridge, whereas, had the water surface been curved with the accepted circumference of a spherical earth, the top of the mast should have been some {{convert|11|ft|m}} below his line of sight. He published this observation using the pseudonym ''Parallax'' in 1849 and subsequently expanded it into a book, ''Earth Not a Globe'', published in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Samuel Birley (writing as "Parallax") |last= Rowbotham |year= 1881 |title= Earth Not a Globe |publisher= Simpkin, Marshall |location= London |isbn= 0-7661-4945-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:wallace-bedford-level.png|thumb|The view through Wallace's level as reproduced in his autobiography]]
Rowbotham repeated his experiments several times over the years but his claims received little attention until, in 1870, a supporter by the name of John Hampden offered a wager that he could show, by repeating Rowbotham's experiment, that the earth was flat. The noted naturalist and qualified surveyor [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] accepted the wager. Wallace, by virtue of his surveyor's training and knowledge of physics, avoided the errors of the preceding experiments and won the bet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date= 7 April 1870|volume=1|doi=10.1038/001581a0|page=581|issue=23|title=The Rotundity of the Earth|bibcode = 1870Natur...1..581. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title= The Form of the Earth: A Shock of Opinions |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 10 August 1871 |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1871/08/10/78770850.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The crucial steps were to
# Set a sight line 13 feet (4&amp;nbsp;m) above the water, and thereby reduce the effects of [[atmospheric refraction]], and
# Add a pole in the middle that could be used to see the "bump" caused by the curvature of the earth between the two end points.&lt;ref name=garwood&gt;{{cite book |first= Christine |last= Garwood |title= Flat Earth |publisher= Macmillan |year= 2007 |pages= 104–125 |isbn= 0-312-38208-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite Hampden initially refusing to accept the demonstration, Wallace was awarded the bet by the referee, editor of ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'' sports magazine.
Hampden subsequently published a pamphlet alleging that Wallace had cheated and sued for his money. Several protracted court cases ensued, with the result that Hampden was imprisoned for threatening to kill Wallace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life|first=Alfred Russel|last=Wallace|year=1908|pages=368–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OA9IeEYUwYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[libel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hampden |first= John |year= 1870 |title= The Bedford Canal Swindle Detected &amp; Exposed |publisher= A. Bull |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Correspondent |date= 8 March 1875 |title= Spring Assizes |newspaper= [[The Times]] |location= London |page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same court ruled that the wager had been invalid because Hampden retracted the bet and required that Wallace return the money to Hampden.
Wallace, who had been unaware of Rowbotham's earlier experiments, was criticized by his peers for "his 'injudicious' involvement in a bet to 'decide' the most fundamental and established of scientific facts".&lt;ref name=garwood /&gt;

In 1901, [[Henry Yule Oldham]], a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in geography at [[King's College, Cambridge]], reproduced Wallace's results using three poles fixed at equal height above water level.  When viewed through a [[theodolite]] (a precision instrument for measuring angles), the middle pole was found to be almost {{convert|3|ft|m|spell=in}} higher than the poles at each end.&lt;ref name=BA1901&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correspondent|date=25 September 1901|title=The British Association|journal=[[The Times]]|location=London|issue=36569|page=12|quote=Mr Yule Oldham on his re-measurement of the curvature of the Earth along the Bedford Level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oldham|first=H.

Advocates of a flat Earth, however, were not deterred: on 11 May 1904 Lady Elizabeth Anne Blount, who would go on to be influential in the formation of the [[Flat Earth Society]], hired a commercial photographer to use a telephoto lens camera to take a picture from Welney of a large white sheet she had placed, the bottom edge near the surface of the river, at Rowbotham's original position {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} away. The photographer, Edgar Clifton from [[Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer|Dallmeyer's studio]], mounted his camera two feet above the water at Welney and was surprised to be able to obtain a picture of the target, which he believed should have been invisible to him given the low mounting point of the camera. Lady Blount published the pictures far and wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Michell |first=John |year= 1984 |title= Eccentric Lives and Peculiar Notions |publisher= [[Thames and Hudson]] |location= London |isbn= 0-500-01331-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These controversies became a regular feature in the ''[[The English Mechanic and World of Science|English Mechanic]]'' magazine in 1904–05, which published Blount's photo and reported two experiments in 1905 that showed the opposite results. One of these, by Clement Stratton on the [[Ashby Canal]], showed a dip on a sight-line only above the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=[[The English Mechanic and World of Science]]|date=20 January 1905|author=Clement Stratton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refraction==

[[Atmospheric refraction]] can produce the results noted by Rowbotham and Blount. Because the density of air in the Earth's atmosphere decreases with height above the Earth's surface, all light rays travelling nearly horizontally bend downward (assuming a curve or change in air temperature along the line of sight). This phenomenon is routinely allowed for in [[Levelling#Refraction and Curvature|levelling]] and [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celnav.de/page2.htm|title=A short guide to Celestial Navigation|first=Henning|last= Umland|accessdate=14 November 2010|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Posn_Setting_Sun.jpg|thumb|250px|Atmospheric refraction causing an object below the horizon to be visible]]
If the measurement is close enough to the surface, light rays can curve downward at a rate equal to the mean curvature of the Earth's surface. In this case, the two effects of assumed curvature and refraction could cancel each other out and the Earth will appear flat in optical experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Umland|pp=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This would have been aided, on each occasion, by a [[Inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]] in the atmosphere with temperature increasing with altitude above the canal, similar to the phenomenon of the [[Superior mirage|superior image mirage]]. Temperature inversions like this are common. An increase in air temperature or [[lapse rate]] of 0.11 degrees [[Celsius]] per metre of altitude would create an illusion of a flat canal, and all optical measurements made near ground level would be consistent with a completely flat surface. If the lapse rate were higher than this (temperature increasing with height at a greater rate), all optical observations would be consistent with a concave surface, a "bowl-shaped earth". Under average conditions, optical measurements are consistent with a spherical Earth approximately 15% less curved than its true diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lynch |first=David K |last2= Livingston |first2= William |title= Color and Light in Nature|year=2001 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-521-77504-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repetition of the atmospheric conditions required for each of the many observations is not unlikely, and warm days over still water can produce favourable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naylor|first=John|title=Out of the Blue A 24-Hour Skywatcher's Guide|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2002|chapter=Mirages|isbn=0-521-80925-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar experiments conducted elsewhere==
On 25 July 1896, Ulysses Grant Morrow, a newspaper editor, conducted a similar experiment on the Old Illinois Drainage Canal, [[Summit, Illinois]]. Unlike Rowbotham, he was seeking to demonstrate that the surface of the earth was curved: when he too found that his target marker, {{convert|18|in|cm}} above water level and {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} distant, was clearly visible he concluded that the Earth's surface was [[Hollow_Earth#Concave_Hollow_Earths|''concavely'']] curved, in line with the expectations of his sponsors, the [[Koreshan Unity]] society. The findings were dismissed by critics as the result of atmospheric refraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Simanek |first= Donald E. |title= Turning the Universe Inside-Out |work=  |publisher= Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania |year= 2003 |url= http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/hollow/morrow.htm |accessdate= 2 November 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071121045617/http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/hollow/morrow.htm |archivedate= 21 November 2007 |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Teed|first=Cyrus|authorlink=Cyrus Teed|last2=Morrow |first2= Ulysses Grant|title=The Earth a Concave Sphere|publisher=Guiding Star|location=Estero, FL|year=1905|page=160|isbn=0-87991-026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">'''Ex-meridian''' is a [[celestial navigation]] method of calculating an observer’s position on [[Earth]]. The method gives the observer a position line on which the observer is situated. It is usually used when the [[Sun]] is obscured at [[noon]], and as a result, a [[meridian altitude]] is not possible. The navigator measures the altitude of the Sun as close to noon as possible and then calculates where the position line lies.

==Methodology==
This method uses an assumed [[longitude]] and calculates the [[latitude]] that a position line crosses it. The position line obtained is actually part of a [[small circle]], as opposed to [[great circle]], where any observer can stand and the heavenly object would have the same altitude in the sky. When plotting the small segment of this circle on a chart it is drawn as a straight line, the resulting tiny errors are too small to be significant.

The assumed longitude is usually obtained from the DR or Dead Reckoning position run up from a morning sight taken at around 9.00 am. This is worked out by applying the distance from that position either by log or by the estimated speed over time with the course steered. A sight is taken, that is the distance above the horizon of a heavenly object, in this case nearly always the sun, is measured with a [[sextant]] and the exact time noted in [[UTC]]. The sextant angle obtained is corrected for dip (the error caused by the observers height above the sea) and refraction to obtain the true altitude of the object above the horizon. This is then subtracted from 90° to obtain the angular distance from the position directly above, the zenith. This is referred to as the True Zenith Distance. The true zenith distance of the object is also the distance (in arc) on the Earth's surface from the observer to where that object is overhead, the geographical position of the object.

Using a [[nautical almanac]], the [[declination]] (celestial latitude), and the [[Greenwich]] [[hour angle]] (celestial longitude) are obtained of the observed object for the time of observation. The  assumed longitude is now added or subtracted to the Greenwich Hour Angle of the object to obtain the local hour angle, that is the difference in longitude between the DR position and the geographical position of the object.

With this information it is possible using the [[haversine]] formula to calculate the latitude where the position line crosses the assumed longitude. The formula is:

&lt;math&gt;hav(MZD) = hav(TZD) - hav(LHA) cos(Lat) cos(Dec)&lt;/math&gt;

Where

&lt;math&gt;MZD&lt;/math&gt; = Meridian Zenith Distance

&lt;math&gt;TZD&lt;/math&gt; = True Zenith Distance

&lt;math&gt;LHA&lt;/math&gt; = Local Hour Angle

&lt;math&gt;Lat&lt;/math&gt; = DR Latitude

&lt;math&gt;Dec&lt;/math&gt; = Declination

Once the value of the [[meridian (astronomy)|Meridian]] Zenith Distance is obtained the algebraic sum of it with the declination of the object gives the latitude of a point where the position line crosses the meridian of DR longitude.

To draw the position line on a chart the [[azimuth]] or bearing of the heavenly object must be known. It is usually calculated but could have been observed. A line at right angles to the azimuth is drawn through the calculated position which is where the calculated latitude and the DR longitude cross. The observer is somewhere on this line.

To obtain a fix (a position) this line must be crossed with another position line either from another sight or from elsewhere. In the case of ex-meridian the position line is usually crossed with the position line obtained earlier which has been run up.

==Ex-Meridian Tables==
The first of these tables applies corrections to the altitude taken with the argument of ''Change of Altitude in one minute from Meridian Passage''. Two other tables apply more corrections until the correct latitude is arrived at. 

== Accuracy and Versatility ==
The Ex-Meridian method of calculating sights is at its most accurate when the azimuth of the object is near to south or north. As the azimuth changes towards the east or west the cross of the position line with the assumed longitude becomes more and more oblique and the position obtained is therefore less accurate. For this reason it is a less versatile method of calculating sights than the [[intercept method]] which can be used for all azimuths. The tables are a quick and easy way to correct the altitude when the object is fairly low in the sky and the observer has only missed noon by a few minutes but if noon has been missed by more than that or the sun is high in the sky it is better to work out a sight by the intercept method.

{{Other uses|Frame of reference (disambiguation)}}
{{Classical mechanics |Fundamentals}}

In [[physics]], a '''frame of reference''' (or '''reference frame''') consists of an abstract [[coordinate system]] and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.

In n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates]], a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes.

In [[Theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]], reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes "'''observational frame of reference'''" (or "'''observational reference frame'''"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [[coordinate time]], which does not correspond across different frames [[relative motion|moving relatively]] to each other. The situation thus differs from [[Galilean relativity]], where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.

== Different aspects of "frame of reference" ==
The need to distinguish between the various meanings of "frame of reference" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in ''Cartesian frame of reference''. Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in ''[[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]]''. Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in ''[[Galilean frame of reference]]''. Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in ''macroscopic'' and ''microscopic frames of reference''.&lt;ref name=macroscopic&gt;The distinction between macroscopic and microscopic frames shows up, for example, in electromagnetism where [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] of various time and length scales are used to determine the current and charge densities entering [[Maxwell's equations]]. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Electromagnetic and Optical Pulse Propagation 1: Spectral Representations in Temporally Dispersive Media |author=Kurt Edmund Oughstun |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=behRnNRiueAC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame++electromagnetism|isbn=0-387-34599-X |year=2006 |publisher=Springer}}. These distinctions also appear in thermodynamics. See {{cite book |title=Classical Theory |author=Paul McEvoy |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj0wFIxn-PoC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame#PPA205,M1 |isbn=1-930832-02-8 |year=2002 |publisher=MicroAnalytix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article, the term ''observational frame of reference'' is used when emphasis is upon the ''state of motion'' rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a ''coordinate system'' may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs ''[[generalized coordinates]]'', ''[[normal modes]]'' or ''[[eigenvectors]]'', which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:

*An observational frame (such as an [[inertial frame]] or [[non-inertial frame of reference]]) is a physical concept related to state of motion.
*A coordinate system is a mathematical concept, amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations.&lt;ref name =Pontriagin&gt;

In very general terms, a coordinate system is a set of arcs ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (''t'') in a complex [[Lie group]]; see {{cite book |author=Lev Semenovich Pontri͡agin |title=L.S. Pontryagin: Selected Works Vol. 2: Topological Groups |page= 429 |year=  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JU0DT_wXu2oC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=2-88124-133-6 |publisher=Gordon and Breach|edition=3rd }}. Less abstractly, a coordinate system in a space of n-dimensions is defined in terms of a basis set of vectors {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}; see {{cite book |title=Linear Algebra: A Geometric Approach |author1=Edoardo Sernesi |author2=J. Montaldi |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dZOuFo1QYMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=0-412-40680-2 |year=1993 |publisher=CRC Press   }} As such, the coordinate system is a mathematical construct, a language, that may be related to motion, but has no necessary connection to motion.

&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, an observer in an observational frame of reference can choose to employ any coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, curvilinear, generalized, …) to describe observations made from that frame of reference. A change in the choice of this coordinate system does not change an observer's state of motion, and so does not entail a change in the observer's ''observational'' frame of reference. This viewpoint can be found elsewhere as well.&lt;ref name=Johansson&gt;
{{cite book |title=Unification of Classical, Quantum and Relativistic Mechanics and of the Four Forces |author1=J X Zheng-Johansson |author2=Per-Ivar Johansson |page=13

|publisher=Nova Publishers 
|year=2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Which is not to dispute that some coordinate systems may be a better choice for some observations than are others.

*Choice of what to measure and with what observational apparatus is a matter separate from the observer's state of motion and choice of coordinate system.

Here is a quotation applicable to moving observational frames &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; and various associated Euclidean three-space coordinate systems [''R'', ''R′'', ''etc.'']:&lt;ref name=Lyle &gt;{{cite book  |title=Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity |page= 9 |author1=Jean Salençon |author2=Stephen Lyle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3xIED8ctfUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=physical+%22frame+of+reference%22|isbn=3-540-41443-6 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|We first introduce the notion of ''reference frame'', itself related to the idea of ''observer'': the reference frame is, in some sense, the "Euclidean space carried by the observer". Let us give a more mathematical definition:… the reference frame is... the set of all points in the Euclidean space with the rigid body motion of the observer. The frame, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, is said to move with the observer.… The spatial positions of particles are labelled relative to a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; by establishing a ''coordinate system'' ''R'' with origin ''O''. The corresponding set of axes, sharing the rigid body motion of the frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, can be considered to give a physical realization of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;. In a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, coordinates are changed from ''R'' to ''R′'' by carrying out, at each instant of time, the same coordinate transformation on the components of ''intrinsic'' objects (vectors and tensors) introduced to represent physical quantities ''in this frame''.| Jean Salençon, Stephen Lyle ''Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity'' p. 9}}

{{Cquote|As noted by Brillouin, a distinction between mathematical sets of coordinates and physical frames of reference must be made.

{{Cquote|The idea of a reference frame is really quite different from that of a coordinate system. Frames differ just when they define different ''spaces'' (sets of ''rest'' points) or times (sets of simultaneous events). So the ideas of a space, a time, of rest and simultaneity, go inextricably together with that of frame. However, a mere shift of origin, or a purely spatial rotation of space coordinates results in a new coordinate system. So frames correspond at best to ''classes'' of coordinate systems.|Graham Nerlich: ''What Spacetime Explains'', p. 64}}

{{Cquote|In traditional developments of special and general relativity it has been customary not to distinguish between two quite distinct ideas. The first is the notion of a coordinate system, understood simply as the smooth, invertible assignment of four numbers to events in spacetime neighborhoods. The second, the frame of reference, refers to an idealized system used to assign such numbers …  To avoid unnecessary restrictions, we can divorce this arrangement from metrical notions. … Of special importance for our purposes is that each frame of reference has a definite state of motion at each event of spacetime.…Within the context of special relativity and as long as we restrict ourselves to frames of reference in inertial motion, then little of importance depends on the difference between an inertial frame of reference and the inertial coordinate system it induces. This comfortable circumstance ceases immediately once we begin to consider frames of reference in nonuniform motion even within special relativity.…More recently, to negotiate the obvious ambiguities of Einstein’s treatment, the notion of frame of reference has reappeared as a structure distinct from a coordinate system.|John D.

In a [[Robotics|robot design]], they could be angles of relative rotations, linear displacements, or deformations of [[linkage (mechanical)|joints]].&lt;ref name=Yamane&gt;{{cite book |author=Katsu Yamane |title=Simulating and Generating Motions of Human Figures |isbn=3-540-20317-6 |year=2004 |publisher=Springer  |pages=12–13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNrMiIx3fToC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=generalized+coordinates+%22kinematic+chain%22#PPA13,M1   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here we will suppose these coordinates can be related to a [[Cartesian coordinate]] system by a set of functions:
:&lt;math&gt;x^j = x^j (x,\  y,\  z,\  \dots)\ , &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp; &amp;ensp; &lt;math&gt; j = 1, \ \dots \ , \ n\  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''etc.'' are the ''n'' Cartesian coordinates of the point. Given these functions,  '''coordinate surfaces''' are defined by the relations:
:&lt;math&gt; x^j (x, y, z, \dots) = \mathrm{constant}\ , &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp; &amp;ensp; &lt;math&gt; j = 1, \ \dots \ , \ n\  .&lt;/math&gt;
The intersection of these surfaces define '''coordinate lines'''. At any selected point, tangents to the intersecting coordinate lines at that point define a set of '''basis vectors''' {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;} at that point.

An important aspect of a coordinate system is its [[metric tensor]] ''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'', which determines the [[arc length]] ''ds'' in the coordinate system in terms of its coordinates:&lt;ref name=Borisenko&gt;{{cite book |title=Vector and Tensor Analysis with Applications |author1=A.

where repeated indices are summed over.

As is apparent from these remarks, a coordinate system is a [[Model theory|mathematical construct]], part of an [[axiomatic system]]. There is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality). However, coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate, and can be used to describe motion. Thus, [[Lorentz transformation]]s and [[Galilean transformation]]s may be viewed as [[Coordinate system#Transformations|coordinate transformation]]s.

General and specific topics of coordinate systems can be pursued following the [[#See also|See also]] links below.

===Observational frames of reference===
{{main|Inertial frame of reference}}
[[File:Minkowski diagram - 3 systems.svg|thumb|right|256px|Three frames of reference in special relativity. The black frame is at rest. The primed frame moves at 40% of light speed, and the double primed frame at 80%. Note the scissors-like change as speed increases.]]

An '''observational frame of reference''', often referred to as a ''physical frame of reference'', a ''frame of reference'', or simply a ''frame'', is a physical concept related to an [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the observer's state of motion. Here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve: an observational frame of reference is characterized ''only by its state of motion''.&lt;ref name=Kubar&gt;See {{cite book |author1=Arvind Kumar |author2=Shrish Barve |page=115 |title=How and Why in Basic Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czlUPz38MOQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22characterized+only+by+its+state+of+motion%22+inauthor:Kumar|isbn=81-7371-420-7 |year= 2003 |publisher =Orient Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is lack of unanimity on this point. In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an ''observer'' and a ''frame''. According to this view, a ''frame'' is an ''observer'' plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector. See Doran.&lt;ref name=Doran&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780521715959&amp;qt=owc_search |title=Geometric Algebra for Physicists |author1=Chris Doran |author2=Anthony Lasenby |page= §5.2.2, p. 133 |isbn=978-0-521-71595-9 |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This restricted view is not used here, and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity.&lt;ref name=Moller&gt;For example, Møller states: "Instead of Cartesian coordinates we can obviously just as well employ general curvilinear coordinates for the fixation of points in physical space.…we shall now introduce general "curvilinear" coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; in four-space…." {{cite book |author=C.

|page=211 |isbn=0-8247-1749-X |year=1983 |publisher=CRC Press   }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

There are two types of observational reference frame: [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial]]. An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In [[special relativity]] these frames are related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which are parametrized by [[rapidity]]. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that [[Newton's first law]] holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a [[free particle]] travels in a [[straight line]] at constant [[speed]], or is at rest. These frames are related by [[Galilean transformation]]s. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of [[Representation theory|representations]] of the [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Poincaré group]] and of the [[Representation theory of the Galilean group|Galilean group]].

In contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which [[fictitious force]]s must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the [[Coriolis force]], [[centrifugal force]], and [[gravitational force]]. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)

===Measurement apparatus===
A further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the [[metrology|measurement apparatus]] (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see [[measurement problem]]).

In physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the [[laboratory frame]] or simply "lab frame." An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the [[center of momentum frame]] "COM frame" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.

In this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect [[metrology]] that is connected to the nature of the [[vacuum]], and uses [[atomic clocks]] that operate according to the [[standard model]] and that must be corrected for [[gravitational time dilation]].&lt;ref name= Wolfson&gt;{{cite book |author=  Richard Wolfson |title=Simply Einstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUJWKdlFKeQC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=%22gravitational+time+dilation+%22|page=216 |isbn=0-393-05154-4 |publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co. |year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[second]], [[meter]] and [[kilogram]]).

In fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.&lt;ref name=Rizzi&gt;See {{cite book |title=Relativity in rotating frames |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PGrlCLkkIgC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=centrifugal+%22+%22+relativity+OR+relativistic#PPA33,M1

==Examples of inertial frames of reference==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

=== Simple example ===
[[File:Two reference frames.PNG|thumb|320px|Figure 1: Two cars moving at different but constant velocities observed from stationary inertial frame ''S'' attached to the road and moving inertial frame ''S′'' attached to the first car.]]
Consider a situation common in everyday life. Two cars travel along a road, both moving at constant velocities. See Figure 1. At some particular moment, they are separated by 200 metres. The car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious "frames of reference" that we could choose.

First, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road. We define our "frame of reference" ''S'' as follows. We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance ''d'' =  200 m apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where &lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position in meters of car one after time ''t'' in seconds and &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position of car two after time ''t''.

:&lt;math&gt; x_1(t)= d + v_1 t = 200\ + \ 22t\ ; \quad x_2(t)=  v_2 t = 30t &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these formulas predict at ''t'' = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we set &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;200 + 22 t = 30t \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;8t = 200 \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 25 \quad \mathrm{seconds}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could choose a frame of reference ''S′'' situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of {{math|1=''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 m / s}}. In order to catch up to the first car, it will take a time of {{math|1={{sfrac|''d''|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{sfrac|200|8}} s}}, that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at 8 m / s.

It would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. It is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).

===Additional example===
[[File:Wikipage pic.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Simple-minded frame-of-reference example]]
For a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south.  For the person facing east, the car was moving towards the right.  However, for the person facing west, the car was moving toward the left.  This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.

For a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right.  In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the x-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y-axis.  To him, the car moves along the ''x'' axis with some [[velocity]] ''v'' in the positive x-direction. Alfred's frame of reference is considered an [[inertial frame of reference]] because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as Earth's rotation and gravity).

Now consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive ''y''-axis.  In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving – for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity ''v'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  If she is driving north, then north is the positive ''y''-direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive ''y''-direction.

Finally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car.  As she passes by him, Alfred measures her [[acceleration]] and finds it to be ''a'' in the negative x-direction.  Assuming Candace's acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure?  If Betsy's velocity ''v'' is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, ''a'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  However, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace's acceleration to be ''a′'' = ''a'' − ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction - a smaller value than Alfred has measured.  Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the positive y-direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace's acceleration as ''a′'' = ''a'' + ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction – a larger value than Alfred's measurement.

Frames of reference are especially important in [[special relativity]], because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.

===Remarks===
{{see also|Special theory of relativity|General theory of relativity}}
It is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference. Newton, for instance, employed universal time, as explained by the following example. Suppose that you own two clocks, which both tick at exactly the same rate. You synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time. The two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train, traveling at constant velocity towards the other. According to Newton, these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time. Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another. That is, there exists a "universal" time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity. This concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by Einstein in his [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression ([[Lorentz transformations]]).

It is also important to note that the definition of inertial reference frame can be extended beyond three-dimensional Euclidean space. Newton's assumed a Euclidean space, but [[general relativity]] uses a more general geometry. As an example of why this is important, let us consider the [[geometry]] of an ellipsoid. In this geometry, a "free" particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a [[geodesic]] path. Two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface, traveling with the same constant speed in different directions. After a length of time, the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid. Both "free" particles traveled with a constant speed, satisfying the definition that  no forces were acting. No acceleration occurred and so Newton's first law held true. This means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference. Since no forces were acting, it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again. In a similar way, it is now common to describe&lt;ref name="caveatondescription"&gt;That is, both descriptions are equivalent and can be used as needed.  This equivalence does not hold outside of general relativity, e.g., in [[entropic gravity]].&lt;/ref&gt; that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as [[spacetime]]. In this picture, the curvature of this 4D space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting. This curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.

==Non-inertial frames==
{{main|Fictitious force|Non-inertial frame|Rotating frame of reference}}
Here the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.

An accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the "primed" frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. ''x′'', ''y′'', ''a′''.

The vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as  '''R'''.  Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called '''r''', and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called '''r′'''.
From the geometry of the situation, we get
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf R + \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time, we obtain
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \mathbf V + \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf A + \mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;
where '''V''' and '''A''' are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system  and '''v''' and '''a''' are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame.

These equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, we can now write [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law]] as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = m\mathbf a = m\mathbf A + m\mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;

When there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion, the [[Coriolis effect]]).

A common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried). This arrangement leads to the equation (see [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation):

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf a' + \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' + 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' + \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') + \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

or, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a' = \mathbf a - \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' - 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' - \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') - \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying through by the mass ''m'' gives
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F' = \mathbf F_\mathrm{physical} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{centripetal} - m\mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} = -m\dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt; ([[Euler force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} = -2m\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;  ([[Coriolis force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{centrifugal} = -m\boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r')=m(\omega^2 \mathbf r'- (\boldsymbol\omega \cdot \mathbf r')\boldsymbol\omega) &lt;/math&gt;  ([[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]])

== Description ==

=== Wilsdorf ===
The farming community of Gross-Wilsdorf consists of two [[villages]]. It is an example of a circular village structure in the [[Slav]]-[[Germans|German]] settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Namenkundliche Beiträge zur Siedlungsgeschichte des Saale- und Mittelelbegebietes bis zum Ende des 9.

The entrance of the high medieval village was traditionally marked by a [[pond]]. This pond was kept for use as service water in everyday life and for fire fighting in cases of emergency. In the village of Gross-Wilsdorf, you can also find a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower church, which had been erected between the two high medieval settlement nucleuses of Gross-Wilsdorf and Kleinwilsdorf and which has partly been preserved. The [[tombstones]] of the church were ornamented with engraved crosses and a stick-like image deemed to be a walking stick. Since medieval tombstones in places other than large [[cathedral]]s and [[minsters]] have rarely been preserved, the tombstones in Gross-Wilsdorf can be considered special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg.

The villages of Großwilsdorf demonstrate the cultural exchange of neighboring [[settler]]s in the region, who all relied at first on their traditional settlement forms.  [[Sorbs]], [[Thuringians]], and other groups created three individual round villages in the [[12th century]], that all shared the same village church built right in the middle between these settlements.  During the [[High Middle Ages]] these settlers from different regions and ethnicities mixed and the villages grew together, forming nowaday Großwilsdorf. The layouts of houses and streets are still well preserved and dated to the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Siedlungsformen und -entwicklung – neue analytische, systematische und planungsrelevante Aspekte.|date=2012|language=German|trans-title=Forms of settlement and development - new analystical relevant aspects.|author=Liesenberg, Carsten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rödel ===

Adjoining the village lies the Rödel [[Plateau]] with its porous [[limestone]] layers. The important limestone quarry “Rödel” served for producing large-sized cut stones of highest quality and supplied the [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut|Naumburg Cathedral]] with building material. [[Neuenburg Castle]] was almost entirely built using the local shell limestone. Structural elements of higher quality were made using shell limestone from the surrounding quarries. This [[quarry]] also is visible and unchanged until today, as are the transport paths for the limestone to Naumburg.

In the year 1032, [[Conrad II|King Conrad II]] gave the royal court of Balgstädt to the Cathedral of Naumburg, including all accessories such as rocks and cliffs (molis). The monastery was granted the permission to dig out suitable rock material there freely, to break it up, roll it out and carry it away. The great number of pits identified by way of laser scans clearly reflect that there was likely a multitude of entitled parties and producers because of the highly fragmented nature of medieval stone [[quarrying]].  Parcels could be identified in the forests on the Rödel Plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geologie von Thüringen.|date=1974|publisher=Haack|pages=15–79|language=German|trans-title=Geology of Thuringia.|author=Seidel, Gerd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hansen's problem''' is a problem in planar [[surveying]], named after the astronomer [[Peter Andreas Hansen]] (1795&amp;ndash;1874), who worked on the geodetic survey of Denmark. There are two known points ''A'' and ''B'', and two unknown points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. From ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; an observer measures the angles made by the lines of sight to each of the other three points.  The problem is to find the positions of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. See figure; the angles measured are&amp;nbsp;(''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Since it involves observations of angles made at unknown points, the problem is an example of [[Resection (orientation)|resection]] (as opposed to intersection).

== Solution method overview==

Define the following angles: 
''&amp;gamma;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''AP''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;delta;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''BP''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;phi;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''AB'', ''&amp;psi;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''BA''.
As a first step we will solve for ''&amp;phi;'' and ''&amp;psi;''.
The sum of these two unknown angles is equal to the sum of ''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, yielding the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\phi+\psi=\beta_1+\beta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

A second equation can be found more laboriously, as follows.  The [[law of sines]] yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_2 B}=\frac{\sin \alpha_2}{\sin \phi}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_2 B}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \phi \sin \delta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Entirely analogous reasoning on the other side yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}{\sin \psi \sin \gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Setting these two equal gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin \phi}{\sin \psi}=\frac{\sin \gamma \sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta \sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2} = k.&lt;/math&gt;

Using a known [[trigonometric identity]] this ratio of sines can be expressed as the tangent of an angle difference:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\phi - \psi}{2}=\frac{k-1}{k+1}\tan\frac{\phi+\psi}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the second equation we need. Once we solve the two equations for the two unknowns &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, we can use either of the two expressions above for &lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}&lt;/math&gt; to find ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; since ''AB'' is known.  We can then find all the other segments using the law of sines.&lt;ref&gt;Udo Hebisch: Ebene und Sphaerische Trigonometrie, Kapitel 1, Beispiel 4 (2005, 2006)[http://www.mathe.tu-freiberg.de/~hebisch/skripte/sphaerik/strigo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solution algorithm ==
We are given four angles (''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the distance ''AB''.  The calculation proceeds as follows:

* Calculate &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\pi-\alpha_1-\beta_1-\beta_2,\quad \delta=\pi-\alpha_2-\beta_1-\beta_2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate &lt;math&gt;k=\frac{\sin \gamma \sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta \sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;s=\beta_1+\beta_2, \quad d=2 \arctan \left[ \frac{k-1}{k+1}\tan(s/2)\right]&lt;/math&gt; and then &lt;math&gt;\phi=(s+d)/2, \quad \psi=(s-d)/2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate 
::&lt;math&gt;P_1 P_2 = AB \frac{\sin \phi \sin \delta}{\sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}&lt;/math&gt;

: or equivalently

::&lt;math&gt;P_1 P_2 = AB \frac{\sin \psi \sin \gamma}{\sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

: If one of these fractions has a denominator close to zero, use the other one.

The '''head of the valley''' or, less commonly, the '''valley head''', refers to the uppermost part of a [[valley]].&lt;ref name=Leser&gt;Leser (2005), p. 935.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Description ==
The head of a valley may take widely differing forms;&lt;ref name=Leser/&gt; for example, in [[highland]] regions the valley often ends in a broad, evenly sloping hollow. The higher the head of the valley, the more likely it is to resemble the geomorphological shape of a [[cirque]]. In [[glacial valley]]s or [[trough valley]]s, it may be referred to as the [[trough head]] or [[trough end]].&lt;ref&gt;Leser (2005), p. 978.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mountains with predominantly [[crystalline rock]] the heads of the valleys are generally very wet, sometimes [[bog]]gy and often support lush [[alpine meadow]]s, whilst those made of [[limestone]] are usually dry and covered in [[Scree|talus]] or [[gravel]]. Where there has been [[ice age]] glaciation, the valley bottoms are modified by [[moraine]]s and mountain lakes are common.

division of [[Earth]] by the [[Equator]] and [[prime meridian]]]]

In [[geography]] and [[cartography]], the '''hemispheres of Earth''' refer to any division of [[Earth|the globe]] into two [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemispheres]] (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἡμισφαίριον}} {{lang|grc-Latn|hēmisphairion}}, meaning "half of a sphere").

The most common such divisions are by [[latitude|latitudinal]] or [[longitude|longitudinal]] markers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/hemisphere/ | title=Hemisphere| date=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* North–South
** [[Northern Hemisphere]], the half that lies north of the [[Equator]]
** [[Southern Hemisphere]], the half that lies south of the Equator
* East–West
** [[Eastern Hemisphere]], the half that lies east of the [[prime meridian]] and west of the [[180th meridian]]
** [[Western Hemisphere]], the half that lies west of the prime meridian and east of the 180th meridian

The East–West division can also be seen in a cultural sense, as a division into two [[East–West dichotomy|cultural hemispheres]].

However, other schemes have sought to divide the planet in a way that maximizes the preponderance of one geographic feature or another in each division:

'''Land systems''' constitute the terrestrial component of the Earth system and encompass all processes and activities related to the human use of land, including socioeconomic, technological and organizational investments and arrangements, as well as the benefits gained from land and the unintended social and ecological outcomes of societal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verburg|first=Peter H|last2=Erb|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Mertz|first3=Ole|last4=Espindola|first4=Giovana|date=2013-10-01|title=Land System Science: between global challenges and local realities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000936|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=433–437|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.08.001|pmc=4018982|pmid=24851141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes  in land systems have large consequences for the local environment and human well-being and are at the same time pervasive factors of global environmental change. Land provides vital resources to society, such as food, fuel, fibres and many other [[ecosystem services]] that support production functions, regulate risks of natural hazards, or provide cultural and spiritual services.  By using the land, society alters and modifies the quantity and quality of the provision of these services.

Land system changes are the direct result of human decision making at multiple scales ranging from local land owners decisions to national scale land use planning and global trade agreements. The aggregate impact of many local land system changes has far reaching consequences for the Earth System, that feedback on ecosystem services, human well-being and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crossman|first=Neville D|last2=Bryan|first2=Brett A|last3=de Groot|first3=Rudolf S|last4=Lin|first4=Yu-Pin|last5=Minang|first5=Peter A|date=2013-10-01|title=Land science contributions to ecosystem services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000729|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=509–514|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, land system change is both a cause and consequence of socio-ecological processes.

A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined [[landform]]s such as (ice-capped) [[mountains]], [[hills]], [[water bodies]] such as [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, ponds and the [[sea]], living elements of [[land cover]] including indigenous [[vegetation]], human elements including different forms of [[land use]], buildings and [[structure]]s, and transitory elements such as [[lighting]] and [[weather]] conditions.

Combining both their physical origins and the [[Culture|cultural]] overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and [[national identity]]. The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions. It is the dynamic backdrop to people’s lives. Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a [[English landscape park|landscape park]], or [[wilderness]].

The [[Earth]] has a vast range of landscapes, including the icy landscapes of [[polar region]]s, [[mountain]]ous landscapes, vast arid [[desert]] landscapes, [[island]]s and [[coast]]al landscapes, densely [[forest]]ed or [[wooded]] landscapes including past [[boreal forests]] and [[tropical rainforests]], and [[agricultural]] landscapes of [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] regions.

The activity of modifying the visible features of an area of land is referred to as ''[[landscaping]]''.

==Definition and etymology==
[[File:Stanisław Masłowski (1853-1926), Autumn landscape in Rybiniszki, 1902.jpeg|left|thumb|Autumn landscape in [[Riebini|Rybiniszki]], [[Latvia]], [[watercolor]] by [[Stanisław Masłowski]], 1902 ([[National Museum in Warsaw]], Poland)]]
There are several definitions of what constitutes a landscape, depending on context. In common usage however, a landscape refers either to all the visible features of an area of land (usually rural), often considered in terms of [[aesthetic]] appeal, or to a pictorial representation of an area of countryside, specifically within the genre of [[landscape painting]]. When people deliberately improve the aesthetic appearance of a piece of land—by changing contours and vegetation, etc.—it is said to have been [[Landscaping|landscaped]],&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; though the result may not constitute a landscape according to some definitions.

The word ''landscape'' (''landscipe'' or ''landscaef'') arrived in [[England]]—and therefore into the [[English language]]—after the fifth century, following the arrival of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]; these terms referred to a system of human-made spaces on the land. The term ''landscape'' emerged around the turn of the sixteenth century to denote a painting whose primary subject matter was natural scenery.&lt;ref name="olw1"&gt;[[Kenneth Olwig|Olwig K.R.]], Recovering the Substantive Nature of Landscape, ''Annals of the A.A.G''(1996),86,4,630-653&lt;/ref&gt; ''Land'' (a word from Germanic origin) may be taken in its sense of something to which people belong (as in England being the land of the English).&lt;ref name= "olwig3" /&gt; The suffix ''&amp;#8209;scape'' is equivalent to the more common English suffix ''&amp;#8209;ship.''&lt;ref name="olwig3"&gt;Olwig K.R., Representation and Alienation in the Political Landscape, ''cultural geographies'' (2005)12,19-40&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of ''&amp;#8209;ship'' are etymologically akin to Old English ''sceppan'' or ''scyppan'', meaning ''to shape''. The suffix ''&amp;#8209;schaft'' is related to the verb ''schaffen'', so that ''&amp;#8209;ship'' and ''shape'' are also etymologically linked. The modern form of the word, with its connotations of scenery, appeared in the late sixteenth century when the term ''landschap'' was introduced by Dutch painters who used it to refer to paintings of inland natural or rural scenery. The word ''landscape'', first recorded in 1598, was borrowed from a Dutch painters' term.&lt;ref&gt;Makhzoumi J. and Pungetti G., Ecological Landscape Design and Planning, Spon Routledge,(1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The popular conception of the ''landscape'' that is reflected in dictionaries conveys both a particular and a general meaning, the particular referring to an area of the Earth's surface and the general being that which can be seen by an observer. An example of this second usage can be found as early as 1662 in the [[Book of Common Prayer]]:
::Could we but climb where Moses stood,
::And view the landscape over.
::: (General Hymns, verse 536).&lt;ref&gt;Found via Google Ngram&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Kukle,Czech Republic..jpg|thumb|163x163px|Kukle, Czech Republic.]]

There are several words that are frequently associated with the word landscape:
* Scenery: The natural features of a landscape considered in terms of their appearance, esp. when picturesque: spectacular views of mountain scenery.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt;
* [[Setting (narrative)|Setting]]: In works of narrative (especially [[fiction]]al), it includes the [[time|historical moment in time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] in which a [[storytelling|story]] takes place, and helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] for a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, p. 1, 65, 115, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Picturesque]]: The word literally means "in the manner of a picture; fit to be made into a picture", and used as early as 1703 (''Oxford English Dictionary''), and derived from an Italian term ''pittoresco'', "in the manner of a painter". [[William Gilpin (priest)|Gilpin]]’s ''Essay on Prints'' (1768) defined ''picturesque'' as "a term expressive of that peculiar kind of beauty, which is agreeable in a picture" (p. xii).
* A view: "A sight or prospect of some landscape or extended scene; an extent or area covered by the eye from one point" (OED).
* [[Wilderness]]: An uncultivated, uninhabited, and inhospitable region.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; See also [[Natural landscape]].
* [[Cityscape]] (also townscape): The urban equivalent of a landscape. In the [[visual arts]] a cityscape (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[Publishing|print]] or [[photograph]], of the physical aspects of a [[city]] or urban area.
* [[Seascape]]: A [[photograph]], [[painting]], or other [[work of art]] which depicts the [[sea]], in other words an example of [[marine art]].

==Physical landscape==

===Geomorphology: The physical evolution of landscape===
[[Geomorphology]] is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of [[topographic]] and [[bathymetric]] features  created by physical or chemical processes operating at or near Earth's surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and [[landscape evolution model|numerical modeling]]. Geomorphology is practiced within [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geodesy]], [[engineering geology]], [[archaeology]] and [[geotechnical engineering]]. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, M.A., 1991, ''Global Geomorphology'', Pearson Education Ltd,  {{ISBN|0-582-30156-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of [[Earth]] is modified by a combination of surface processes that sculpt landscapes, and geologic processes that cause [[tectonic uplift]] and [[subsidence]], and shape the [[coastal geography]]. Surface processes comprise the action of [[water]], [[wind]], [[ice]], [[wildfire|fire]], and living things on the surface of the Earth, along with chemical reactions that form [[soil]]s and alter material properties, the stability and rate of change of [[topography]] under the force of [[gravity]], and other factors, such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape. Many of these factors are strongly mediated by [[climate]]. Geologic processes include the uplift of [[mountain range]]s, the growth of [[volcano]]es, [[isostasy|isostatic]] changes in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep [[sedimentary basins]] where the surface of Earth drops and is filled with material [[erosion|eroded]] from other parts of the landscape.  The Earth surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic, [[hydrology|hydrologic]], and [[biology|biologic]] action with geologic processes.

===Landscape ecology===
[[Landscape ecology]] is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape is a central concept in landscape ecology. It is, however, defined in quite different ways. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T., Trepl, L. and V. Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research online first.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carl Troll]] conceives of landscape not as a mental construct but as an objectively given ‘organic entity’, a ‘‘harmonic individuum of space’’.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 2007: The geographic landscape and its investigation. In: Wiens, J.A., Moss, M.R., Turner, M.G. &amp; Mladenoff, D.J. (eds): Foundation papers in landscape ecology. New York, Columbia University Press:71–101 [First published as: Troll, C. 1950: Die geographische Landschaft und ihre Erforschung. Studium Generale 3(4/5):163–181].&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ernst Neef]]&lt;ref&gt;Neef, E. 1967: Die theoretischen Grundlagen der Landschaftslehre. Haack, Gotha; cf. Haase, G. and H. Richter 1983: Current trends in landscape research. GeoJournal 7(2):107–119.&lt;/ref&gt; defines landscapes as sections within the uninterrupted earth-wide interconnection of geofactors which are defined as such on the basis of their uniformity in terms of a specific land use, and are thus defined in an anthropocentric and relativistic way.

According to [[Richard Forman]] and [[Michael Godron]],&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10):733–740; Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; a landscape is a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that is repeated in similar form throughout, whereby they list woods, meadows, marshes and villages as examples of a landscape’s ecosystems, and state that a landscape is an area at least a few kilometres wide.

Springer, New York:371–383.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes the traditional view expounded by [[Carl Troll]], Isaak S. Zonneveld, Zev Naveh, Richard T. T. Forman/Michel Godron and others that landscapes are arenas in which humans interact with their environments on a kilometre-wide scale; instead, he defines 'landscape'—regardless of scale—as "the template on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes".&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1999: The science and practice of landscape ecology.

In: Wiens, J.A. and M.R. Moss (eds): Issues and perspectives in landscape ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge:365–373.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some define 'landscape' as an area containing two or more [[ecosystem]]s in close proximity.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"&gt;Sanderson, J. and L. D. Harris (eds.).  2000.  Landscape Ecology: A Top-Down Approach.  Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated landscape management===
[[Integrated landscape management]] is a way of managing a landscape that brings together multiple stakeholders, who collaborate to integrate policy and practice for their different land use objectives, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes.&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Deakin|first2=E|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=What are ‘Integrated Landscape Approaches’ and how effectively have they been implemented in the tropics: a systematic map protocol|journal=Environmental Evidence|date=2015|volume=4:2|url=http://www.cifor.org/library/5422/what-are-integrated-landscape-approaches-and-how-effectively-have-they-been-implemented-in-the-tropics-a-systematic-map-protocol/|issn=2047-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LSLB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denier|first1=L|last2=Scherr|first2=S|last3=Shames|first3=S|last4=Chatterton|first4=P|last5=Hovani|first5=L|last6=Stam|first6=N|title=The Little Sustainable Landscapes Book|date=2015|publisher=Global Canopy Programme|location=Oxford|url=http://globalcanopy.org/sustainablelandscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognises that, for example, one river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for smallholders and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; the way in which each one of these sectors pursues its goals can have impacts on the others. The intention is to minimise conflict between these different land use objectives and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; This approach draws on landscape ecology, as well as many related fields that also seek to integrate different land uses and users, such as [[watershed management]].&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt;

Proponents of integrated landscape management argue that it is well-suited to address complex global challenges, such as those that are the focus of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="SDG briefing"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landscapes for People Food and Nature|title=Integrated Landscape Management: The Means of Implementation for the Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Landscapes for People Food and Nature briefing|date=2015|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ILM-for-the-SDGs-Two-Page-Statement-Sept-21-2015-FINAL-FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated landscape management is increasingly taken up at the national,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GMS Workshop on Landscape Approaches|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/events/gms-workshop-on-landscape-approaches|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IINDC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Republic of Indonesia|title=Intended Nationally Determined Contribution|url=http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Indonesia/1/INDC_REPUBLIC%20OF%20INDONESIA.pdf|website=UNFCCC submissions}}&lt;/ref&gt; local&lt;ref&gt;Landscapes for People Food and nature case studies http://peoplefoodandnature.org/analysis/all-publications/case-studies/&lt;/ref&gt; and international level, for example the [[UN Environment Programme]] states that "UNEP champions the landscape approach de facto as it embodies the main elements of integrated ecosystem management".

===Landscape archaeology===

[[File:Medieval Ridge and Furrow above Wood Stanway - geograph.org.uk - 640050.jpg|220px|left|thumb|[[Medieval]] Ridge and Furrow above [[Wood Stanway]], [[Gloucestershire]], England.]]
Landscape archaeology or [[landscape history]] is the study of the way in which humanity has changed the physical appearance of the environment - both present and past. Landscape generally refers to both natural environments and environments constructed by human beings.&lt;ref name="Nicole"&gt;Branton, Nicole (2009) Landscape Approaches in Historical Archaeology: The Archaeology of Places. In International Handbook of Historic Archaeology, Majewski, Teresita and David Gaimster, eds. Springer:&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Natural landscape]]s are considered to be environments that have not been altered by humans in any shape or form.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;Hood, Edward J. (1996)  "Social Relations and the Cultural Landscape". In Landscape Archaeology:Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. Yamin, Rebecca and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds. Knoxville:The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cultural landscapes]], on the other hand, are environments that have been altered in some manner by people (including temporary structures and places, such as campsites, that are created by human beings).&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Spencer-Wood, Suzanne M. and Sherene Baugher. (2010) "Introduction to the Historical Archaeology of Powered Cultural Landscapes." International Journal of Historical Archaeology 14, pp. 463-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Among archaeologists, the term landscape can refer to the meanings and alterations people mark onto their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garden" /&gt;  As such, landscape archaeology is often employed to study the human use of land over extensive periods of time.&lt;ref name="garden"&gt;Gleason, Kathryn L. (1994). "To Bound and to Cultivate: An Introduction to the Archaeology of Gardens and Fields. In The Archaeology of Garden and Field. Miller, Naomi F. and Kathryn L. Gleason, eds. Philadelphia:University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erika Martin Seibert. [http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/guidance/NR_workshop_3-11-09/Archeol_and_landscapes_Erika.doc "Archaeology and Landscape"], Accessed December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Landscape archaeology can be summed up by Nicole Branton's statement: 
:"the landscapes in landscape archaeology may be as small as a single household or garden or as large as an empire", and "although resource exploitation, class, and power are frequent topics of landscape archaeology, landscape approaches are concerned with spatial, not necessarily ecological or economic, relationships. While similar to [[settlement archaeology]] and ecological archaeology, landscape approaches model places and spaces as dynamic participants in past behavior, not merely setting (affecting human action), or artifact (affected by human action)".&lt;ref name="Nicole" /&gt;

===Cultural landscape===
[[File:Inside the Batad rice terraces.jpg|thumb|The Batad rice terraces, The [[Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras]], the first site to be included in the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] cultural landscape category in 1995.&lt;ref name=not-danger&gt;{{cite news|last=Malig|first=Jojo|title=Philippine rice terraces no longer in danger|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/06/26/12/philippine-rice-terraces-no-longer-danger|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The concept of [[cultural landscapes]] can be found in the European tradition of [[landscape art|landscape painting]].&lt;ref&gt;PANNELL, S (2006) Reconciling Nature and Culture in a Global Context: Lessons form the World Heritage List. James Cook University. Cairns, Australia. Page 62&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 16th century onwards, many European artists painted landscapes in favor of people, diminishing the people in their paintings to figures subsumed within broader, regionally specific landscapes.&lt;ref name="GIBS1989"&gt;GIBSON, W.S (1989) Mirror of the Earth: The World Landscape in Sixteenth-Century Flemish Painting.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographer [[Otto Schlüter]] is credited with having first formally used  "cultural landscape" as an academic term in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Schlüter argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) this would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ELKINS, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. ENTRIKEN, J. Nicholas &amp; BRUNN, Stanley D (Eds) Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC. Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;  He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (transl. original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (transl. 'cultural landscape') a landscape created by human culture. The major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.''

It was [[Carl O. Sauer]], a [[human geography|human geographer]], who was probably the most influential in promoting and developing the idea of cultural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York. Page 321-324.&lt;/ref&gt; Sauer was determined to stress the agency of culture as a force in shaping the visible features of the Earth’s surface in delimited areas. Within his definition, the physical environment retains a central significance, as the medium with and through which human cultures act.&lt;ref name ="SAUE1925"&gt;SAUER, C (1925) ''The Morphology of Landscape''. University of California Publications in Geography. Number 22. Pages 19-53&lt;/ref&gt;  His classic definition of a 'cultural landscape' reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultural landscape is fashioned from a [[natural landscape]] by a cultural group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape is the result.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A cultural landscape, as defined by the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Committee]], is the "cultural properties [that] represent the combined works of nature and of man."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2012) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention [http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide12-en.pdf]. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage Committee identifies three categories of cultural landscape, ranging from (i) those landscapes most deliberately 'shaped' by people, through (ii) full range of 'combined' works, to (iii) those least evidently 'shaped' by people (yet highly valued).  The three categories extracted from the Committee's Operational Guidelines, are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2005) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "A landscape designed and created intentionally by man";
# an "organically evolved landscape" which may be a "[[relict (geology)|relict (or fossil) landscape]]" or a "continuing landscape"; and
# an "associative cultural landscape" which may be valued because of the "religious, artistic or cultural associations of the natural element".

{{See also|Landscaping|Landscape design|Landscape architecture|Garden|Park}}
The [[Chinese garden]] is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the Imperial Family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world.  They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Baridon, ''Les Jardins - paysagistes, jardiners, poḕts''. p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, [[scholar's rock]]s, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Records of the 21st conference of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, describing Classical Chinese garden design and the gardens of Suzhou.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English landscape garden]], also called English landscape park or simply the 'English garden', is a style of parkland garden intended to look as though it might be a natural landscape, although it may be very extensively re-arranged.  It emerged in England in the early 18th century, and spread across Europe, replacing the more formal, symmetrical ''[[jardin à la française]]'' of the 17th century as the principal style for large parks and gardens in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'', Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The English garden (and later [[French landscape garden]]) presented an idealized view of nature. It drew inspiration from paintings of landscapes by [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]], and from the classic [[Chinese gardens]] of the East,&lt;ref name=Boults/&gt; which had recently been described by European travellers and were realized in the Anglo-Chinese garden,&lt;ref name=Boults&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated History of Landscape Design|author=Boults, Elizabeth and Chip Sullivan|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2010|isbn=0-470-28933-3|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712 – 1778).

The English garden usually included a lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. The work of [[Capability Brown|Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] and [[Humphry Repton]] was particularly influential. By the end of the 18th century the English garden was being imitated by the French landscape garden, and as far away as St. Petersburg, Russia, in [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], the gardens of the future [[Emperor Paul]]. It also had a major influence on the form of the [[public parks]] and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Impelluso, ''Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes'', Mondatori Electra, Milan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape architecture===
[[File:Central park manhattan 2 New York photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US, designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. ]]
[[Landscape architecture]] is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[geology]] and the [[earth sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], and [[ecology]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on all types of structures and external space&amp;nbsp;– large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while paying attention to ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].

For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] and at the [[Palace of Versailles]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]]. The first person to write of making a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828 and was first used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in 1863. During the latter 19th century, the term [[landscape architect]] became used by professional people who designed landscapes. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] used the term 'landscape architecture' as a profession for the first time when designing [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US. Here the combination of traditional landscape gardening and the emerging field of city planning gave landscape architecture its unique focus. This use of the term landscape architect became established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899.

===Landscape and literature===
{{See also|Pastoral|British regional literature|American literary regionalism}}

====The earliest landscape literature====
[[File:Damarri001.jpg|thumb|The [[Djabugay people|Djabugay]] language group's mythical being, ''Damarri'', transformed into a mountain range, is seen lying on his back above the [[Barron Gorge National Park|Barron River Gorge]], looking upwards to the skies, within north-east Australia's wet tropical forested landscape]]
Possibly the earliest landscape literature is found in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|Australian aboriginal myths]]  (also known as [[Dreamtime]] or Dreaming stories, [[songlines]], or Aboriginal [[oral literature]]), the stories [[ritual|traditionally performed]] by [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. (1994) "Oral Literature" in Horton, David (General Editor)&lt;/ref&gt; within each of the [[language group]]s across Australia. All such myths variously tell significant truths within each Aboriginal group's local [[cultural landscape|landscape]]. They effectively layer the whole of the Australian continent's topography with cultural nuance and deeper meaning, and empower selected audiences with the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back to [[time immemorial]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. (1995) "An Approach to Ensure Continuity and Transmission of the Rainforest Peoples' Oral Tradition", in Fourmile, H; Schnierer, S.; &amp; Smith, A. (Eds) ''An Identification of Problems and Potential for Future Rainforest Aboriginal Cultural Survival and Self-Determination in the Wet Tropics.'' Centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Participation Research and Development. Cairns, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western culture|West]] [[pastoral]] poetry represent the earliest form of landscape literature, though this literary genre presents an idealized landscape peopled by shepherds and shepherdesses, and creates "an image of a peaceful uncorrupted existence; a kind of [[fall of man|prelapsarian]] world".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, P. 644.&lt;/ref&gt; The pastoral has its origins in the works of the Greek poet [[Theocritus]] (c. 316 - c. 260 BC). The [[Romanticism|Romantic period]] poet [[William Wordsworth]] created a modern, more realistic form of pastoral with ''[[Michael (poem)|Michael, A Pastoral Poem]]'' (1800).&lt;ref&gt;Peter V. Marinetti, ''Pastoral''. London: Methuen, 1971, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early form of landscape poetry, [[Shanshui poetry]], developed in China during the third and fourth centuries A.D.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hambledon Hill towards Stourton Tower 20070730.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vale of Blackmore]], the main setting for [[Thomas Hardy]]'s novel ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]''. [[Hambledon Hill]] towards [[King Alfred's Tower|Stourton Tower]] ]]

====Topographical poetry====
[[Topographical poetry]]  is a [[genre]] of poetry that describes, and often praises, a landscape or place. [[John Denham (poet)|John Denham]]'s 1642 poem "Cooper's Hill" established the genre, which peaked in popularity in 18th-century England. Examples of [[Topography|topographical]] verse date, however, to the [[Late Classical]] period, and can be found throughout the [[Medieval]] era and during the [[Renaissance]]. Though the earliest examples come mostly from continental Europe, the topographical poetry in the tradition originating with Denham concerns itself with the classics, and many of the various types of topographical verse, such as river, ruin, or hilltop poems were established by the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aubin, Robert Arnold. ''Topographical Poetry in XVIII-Century England''. New York: The Modern Language Association of America, 1936, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Pope]]'s "Windsor Forest" (1713) and [[John Dyer]]'s "[[Grongar Hill]]' (1762) are two other familiar examples. [[George Crabbe]], the [[Suffolk]] regional poet, also wrote topographical poems, as did  [[William Wordsworth]], of which ''[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]'' is an obvious example.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Cuddon, ''Dictionary of Literary Terms''. London: Penguin, 1999, p. 922&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Matthew Arnold]]'s "[[The Scholar Gipsy]]" (1853) praises the [[Oxfordshire]] countryside, and [[W. H. Auden]]'s "[[In Praise of Limestone]]" (1948) uses a [[limestone]] landscape as an allegory.&lt;ref name="France"&gt;{{cite journal|author=France, Alan W.|title=Gothic North and the Mezzogiorno in Auden's 'In Praise of Limestone'|journal=[[Renascence (journal)|Renascence]]|volume=42|issue=3|year=1990|pages=141–148|doi=10.5840/renascence199042319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subgenres of topographical poetry include the [[country house poems|country house poem]], written in 17th-century England to compliment a wealthy patron, and the [[prospect poem]], describing the view from a distance or a temporal view into the future, with the sense of opportunity or expectation.  When understood broadly as landscape poetry and when assessed from its establishment to the present, topographical poetry can take on many formal situations and types of places. Kenneth Baker, in his "Introduction to ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry'', identifies 37 varieties and compiles poems from the 16th through the 20th centuries—from [[Edmund Spenser]] to [[Sylvia Plath]]—correspondent to each type, from "Walks and Surveys," to "Mountains, Hills, and the View from Above," to "Violation of Nature and the Landscape," to "Spirits and Ghosts."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common aesthetic registers of which topographical poetry makes use include [[pastoral]] imagery, the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], and the [[picturesque]], which include images of rivers, ruins, moonlight, birdsong, and clouds, peasants, mountains, caves, and waterscapes.

Though describing a landscape or scenery, topographical poetry often, at least implicitly, addresses a political issue or the meaning of [[nationalism|nationality]] in some way.  The description of the landscape therefore becomes a poetic vehicle for a political message.  For example, in John Denham's "Cooper's Hill," the speaker discusses the merits of the recently executed [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;John Denham, "Cooper's Hill", (ll.111-119)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Vision on Mount [[Snowdon]]'''

…………………………...and on the shore
I found myself of a huge sea of mist,
Which meek and silent rested at my feet.
A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved
All over this still ocean, and beyond,
Far, far beyond, the vapours shot themselves
In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes, Into the sea, the real sea, that seemed
To dwindle and give up its majesty,
Usurped upon as far as sight could reach.

&lt;/poem&gt;|source =from ''[[The Prelude]]'' (1805), Book 13, lines 41-51.&lt;br&gt;by [[William Wordsworth]]
}}
One important aspect of British [[Romantic poetry|Romanticism]]&amp;nbsp;– evident in painting and literature as well as in politics and philosophy&amp;nbsp;– was a change in the way people perceived and valued the landscape. In particular, after [[William Gilpin (priest)|William Gilpin]]'s ''Observations on the River Wye'' was published in 1770, the idea of the [[picturesque]] began to influence artists and viewers. Gilpin advocated approaching the landscape "by the rules of picturesque beauty,"&lt;ref&gt;Gilpin, William, quoted in Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasized contrast and variety. [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1757) was also an influential text, as was [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''On the Sublime'' (early A.D., Greece), which was translated into English from the French in 1739. From the 18th century, a taste for the sublime in the natural landscape emerged alongside the idea of the sublime in language; that is elevated rhetoric or speech.&lt;ref&gt;In the late 17th century in England, [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]] brought attention to Longinus' argument for the emotive power of figurative language in poetry.&lt;/ref&gt; A topographical poem that influenced the Romantics, was [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]'s ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'' (1726–30).&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, Tim. ''Landscape, LIberty, and Authority: Poetry, Criticism, and Politics from Thomson to Wordsworth.''  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996., p.21'&lt;/ref&gt;
The changing landscape, brought about by the [[Industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]]s, with the expansion of the city and depopulation of the countryside, was another influences on the growth of the [[Romantic movement]] in Britain. The poor condition of workers, the new class conflicts, and the pollution of the environment all led to a reaction against urbanism and industrialisation and a new emphasis on the beauty and value of [[nature]] and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. "Romanticism". Retrieved 30 January 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Britannica.com. Retrieved 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], as well a reaction against the scientific [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Casey, (October 30, 2008). ""Grecian Grandeurs and the Rude Wasting of Old Time": Britain, the Elgin Marbles, and Post-Revolutionary Hellenism". ''Foundations''. Volume III, Number 1. Retrieved 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[William Wordsworth]] was a major contributor to the literature of landscape,&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Drabble, ''A Writer's Britain'' (originally subtitled "Landscape in literature", 1979).  New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; as was his contemporary poet and novelist [[Walter Scott]]. Scott's influence was felt throughout Europe, as well as on major [[Victorian novel]]ists in Britain, such as [[Emily Bronte]], [[Mrs Gaskell]], [[George Eliot]], and [[Thomas Hardy]], as well as [[John Cowper Powys]] in the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottsabbotsford.co.uk/history/ |title=Walter Scott was the foremost literary figure of his days |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drabble,, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Drabble]] in ''A Writer's Britain'' suggests that Thomas Hardy "is perhaps the greatest writer of rural life and landscape" in English.&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
Among European writers influenced by Scott were Frenchmen [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]] and Italian [[Alessandro Manzoni]].&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p. 166; [http://www.france.fr/en/literature-and-french-language/alexandre-dumas-1802-1870.html/ "Alexandre Dumas": The official French site]&lt;/ref&gt; Manzoni's famous novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' was inspired by [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;From Georg Lukàcs, "The Historical Novel" (1969): "In Italy Scott found a successor who, though in a single, isolated work, nevertheless broadened his tendencies with superb originality, in some respect surpassing him. We refer, of course, to Manzoni's ''I Promessi Sposi'' (The Betrothed). Scott himself recognized Manzoni's greatness. When in Milan Manzoni told him that he was his pupil, Scott replied that in that case Manzoni's was his best work. It is, however, very characteristic that while Scott was able to write a profusion of novels about English and Scottish society, Manzoni confined himself to this single masterpiece."&lt;/ref&gt;

====North America====
Also influenced by Romanticism's approach to landscape was the American novelist [[Fenimore Cooper]], who was admired by [[Victor Hugo]] and Balzac and characterized as the "American [[Walter Scott|Scott]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Phillips|Phillips, 1913]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====China====
Landscape in [[Chinese poetry]] has often been closely tied to Chinese landscape painting, which developed much earlier than in the West. Many poems evoke specific paintings, and some are written in more empty areas of the scroll itself. Many painters also wrote poetry, especially in the [[scholar-official]] or literati tradition.  Landscape images were present in the early ''[[Shijing]]'' and the ''[[Chuci]]'', but in later poetry the emphasis changed, as in painting]] to the ''[[Shan shui]]'' ({{zh|山水}} lit. "mountain-water") style featuring wild mountains, rivers and lakes, rather than landscape as a setting for a human presence.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"/&gt;  [[Shanshui poetry]] {{CJKV|t=山水詩|s=山水诗}} developed in China during the third and fourth centuries AD&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt; and left most of the varied landscapes of China largely unrepresented. ''Shan shui'' painting and poetry shows imaginary landscapes, though with features typical of some parts of South China; they remain popular to the present day.

[[Fields and Gardens poetry]] ({{zh|t=田園詩|s=田园诗|p=tiányuán shī|w=t'ien-yuan-shih|l=fields and gardens poetry}}), in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]) was a contrasting poetic movement which lasted for centuries, with a focused on the nature found in gardens, in backyards, and in the cultivated countryside. Fields and Gardens poetry is one of many [[Classical Chinese poetry genres]].  One of the main practitioners of the Fields and Gardens poetry genre was Tao Yuanming (also known as [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] (365–427), among other names or versions of names).&lt;ref&gt;Yip, 163-169&lt;/ref&gt; Tao Yuanming has been regarded as the first great poet associated with the Fields and Gardens poetry genre.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Many landscape photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, unsullied depiction of [[nature]]&lt;ref name="Photography: A Cultural History 136"&gt;Mary Warner Marien (2006). ''Photography: A Cultural History''. Laurence King Publishing. Page 136.&lt;/ref&gt; devoid of human influence, instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light. As with most forms of art, the definition of a landscape photograph is broad, and may include urban settings, industrial areas, and [[nature photography]]. Notable landscape photographers include [[Ansel Adams]], [[Galen Rowell]], [[Edward Weston]], [[Ben Heine]], Mark Gray and [[Judges Postcards|Fred Judge]].

====Landscape painting====
{{Main article|Landscape painting|Aerial landscape art}}
[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Salomon van Ruisdael]], "View of Deventer" (1657). ]]
The earliest forms of art around the world depict little that could really be called [[Landscape painting|landscape]], although ground-lines and sometimes indications of mountains, trees or other natural features are included. The earliest "pure landscapes" with no human figures are [[fresco]]s from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Greece]] of around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 53. The only very complete example is now in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting scenes, especially those set in the enclosed vista of the reed beds of the [[Nile Delta]] from Ancient Egypt, can give a strong sense of place, but the emphasis is on individual plant forms and human and animal figures rather than the overall landscape setting. For a coherent depiction of a whole landscape, some rough system of perspective, or scaling for distance, is needed, and this seems from literary evidence to have first been developed in [[Ancient Greece]] in the [[Hellenistic]] period, although no large-scale examples survive. More [[Ancient Roman art|ancient Roman]] landscapes survive, from the 1st century BCE onwards, especially frescos of landscapes decorating rooms that have been preserved at archaeological sites of [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]] and elsewhere, and [[mosaic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese [[Ink and wash painting|ink painting]] tradition of [[shan shui]] ("mountain-water"), or "pure" landscape, in which the only sign of human life is usually a sage, or a glimpse of his hut, uses sophisticated landscape backgrounds to figure subjects, and landscape art of this period retains a classic and much-imitated status within the Chinese tradition.

Both the Roman and Chinese traditions typically show grand panoramas of imaginary landscapes, generally backed with a range of spectacular mountains – in China often with waterfalls and in Rome often including sea, lakes or rivers. These were frequently used to bridge the gap between a foreground scene with figures and a distant panoramic vista, a persistent problem for landscape artists.

A major contrast between landscape painting in the West and East Asia has been that while in the West until the 19th century it occupied a low position in the accepted [[hierarchy of genres]], in East Asia the classic Chinese mountain-water ink painting was traditionally the most prestigious form of visual art. However, in the West, history painting came to require an extensive landscape background where appropriate, so the theory did not entirely work against the development of landscape painting – for several centuries landscapes were regularly promoted to the status of history painting by the addition of small figures to make a narrative scene, typically religious or mythological.

[[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of the 17th century saw the dramatic growth of landscape painting, in which many artists specialized, and the development of extremely subtle realist techniques for depicting light and weather. The popularity of landscapes in the [[Netherlands]] was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a [[Calvinist]] society, and the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe combined with [[Romanticism]] to give landscapes a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than they had assumed before.

In England, landscapes had initially been mostly backgrounds to portraits, typically suggesting the parks or estates of a landowner, though mostly painted in London by an artist who had never visited the site. the English tradition was founded by [[Anthony van Dyck]] and other, mostly [[Flemish people|Flemish]], artists working in England. By the beginning of the 19th century the English artists with the highest modern reputations were mostly dedicated landscapists, showing the wide range of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] interpretations of the English landscape found in the works of [[John Constable]], [[J.M.W. Turner]] and [[Samuel Palmer]]. However all these had difficulty establishing themselves in the contemporary art market, which still preferred history paintings and portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74-75, 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Cole]] "The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State", US, 1836. ]]

In Europe, as [[John Ruskin]] said,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Modern Painters]]'', volume three, "Of the novelty of landscape".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] confirmed, landscape painting was the "chief artistic creation of the nineteenth century", and "the dominant art", with the result that in the following period people were "apt to assume that the appreciation of natural beauty and the painting of landscape is a normal and enduring part of our spiritual activity"&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romantic movement intensified the existing interest in landscape art, and remote and wild landscapes, which had been one recurring element in earlier landscape art, now became more prominent.  The German [[Caspar David Friedrich]] had a distinctive style, influenced by his [[Art of Denmark|Danish training]]. To this he added a quasi-mystical Romanticism. French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and other painters in the [[Barbizon School]] established a French landscape tradition that would become the most influential in Europe for a century, with the [[Impressionist]]s and [[Post-Impressionist]]s for the first time making landscape painting the main source of general stylistic innovation across all types of painting.

In the [[United States]], the [[Hudson River School]], prominent in the middle to late 19th century, is probably the best-known native development in landscape art. These painters created works of mammoth scale that attempted to capture the epic scope of the landscapes that inspired them. The work of [[Thomas Cole]], the school's generally acknowledged founder, has much in common with the philosophical ideals of European landscape paintings — a kind of secular faith in the spiritual benefits to be gained from the contemplation of natural beauty. Some of the later Hudson River School artists, such as [[Albert Bierstadt]], created less comforting works that placed a greater emphasis (with a great deal of Romantic exaggeration) on the raw, even terrifying power of nature. The best examples of Canadian landscape art can be found in the works of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], prominent in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;"Landscapes" in [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=Landscape&amp;PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454 Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Carr]] was also closely associated with the Group of Seven, though was never an official member. Although certainly less dominant in the period after World War I, many significant artists still painted landscapes in the wide variety of styles exemplified by [[Neil Welliver]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Peter Doig]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[David Hockney]] and [[Sidney Nolan]].

The term [[neo-romanticism]] is applied in British art history, to a loosely affiliated school of landscape painting that emerged around 1930 and continued until the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;It was first labeled in March 1942 by the critic [[Raymond Mortimer]] in the ''New Statesman''.&lt;/ref&gt; These painters looked back to 19th-century artists such as [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]], but were also influenced by French cubist and post-cubist artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[André Masson]], and [[Pavel Tchelitchew]] ({{harvnb|Clark and Clarke|2001}}; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2001}}). This movement was motivated in part as a response to the threat of invasion during World War II. Artists particularly associated with the initiation of this movement included [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Ivon Hitchens]], and especially [[Graham Sutherland]]. A younger generation included [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], [[Michael Ayrton]], [[John Craxton]], [[Keith Vaughan]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], and [[Robert MacBryde]] {{harv|Button|1996}}.

In [[cave diving|cave]] (and occasionally wreck) diving, '''line markers''' are used for orientation as a visual and tactile reference on a permanent guideline. Directional markers (commonly a notched acute isosceles triangle in basic outline), are also known as line arrows or Dorff arrows, and point the way to an exit. Line arrows may mark the location of a "jump" location in a cave when two are placed adjacent to each other. Two adjacent arrows facing away from each other, mark a point in the cave where the diver is equidistant from two exits. Arrow direction can be identified by feel in low visibility.

Non-directional markers ("cookies") are purely personal markers that mark specific spots, or the direction of one's chosen exit at line intersections where there are options. Their shape does not provide a tactile indication of direction as this could cause confusion in low visibility. One important reason to be adequately trained before cave diving is that incorrect marking can confuse and fatally endanger not only oneself, but also other divers.

==History==
The line arrow was invented by Lewis Holzendorf and developed by Forrest Wilson at the [[Cave diving]] [[National Speleological Society|NSS]] workshop, inspired by [[Sheck Exley]] and other cave diving pioneers, and later, a few hundreds of the handmade markers were sold through Branford Dive Center in North Florida. Soon they became very popular and today are commonly used by underwater cave explorers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.diverite.com/products/catalog/reels/ac2015|title=Line Arrow|accessdate=20 October 2011|author=Dive Rite|publisher=Dive Rite website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Line markers are generally used on permanent guidelines to provide critical information to divers following the line. The slots and notches provided are used to wrap the line to secure the marker in place. A simple passage of the line through the enlarged area at the base of the two slots will allow the marker to slide along the line, or even fall off if brushed by a diver. To more securely fasten the marker, an extra wrap may be added at each slot. The basic function of these markers is fairly consistent internationally, but procedures may differ by region, and between teams. The protocol for placement and removal should be well understood by the members of a specific team. Temporary line markers are only for the use of the team who placed them and are removed during exit to avoid littering a cave system with irrelevant and potentially confusing information.&lt;ref name="Keiren 2016"/&gt;

Cave markers may be carried on a short length of bungee with a knot at one end and a clip at the other, but other methods are also used. Reasonable security and easy access are all that is required.

===Directional Markers===
Line arrows are used to indicate the direction along the line to the nearest air source. In cave systems with only one opening, line arrows will always indicate the route back to the entry, but in cave systems with multiple openings, they may not point to the entry used by the dive team, and in some cases this may not be a usable exit.&lt;ref name=Riordan&gt;Daniel Riordan, Awareness: Recipe For Successful Cave Navigation, DirQuest Vol. 3, No. 2 - Summer 2002, http://www.funteqdiving.nl/website/Downloads/grotduiken/Riordan%20-%20Cave%20Awareness%20Navigation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Some popular cave diving systems have permanent line arrows at regular intervals pointing to the nearest exit, and may be marked with a distance to the exit. Permanent arrows may also be used to identify secondary passages and midpoints in a cave.&lt;ref name="Keiren 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tdisdi.com/cave-diving-directional-and-non-directional-markers-101/|title=Cave Diving: Directional and Non-directional Markers 101|last=Kieren|first=Lauren|year=2016|work=tdisdi.com|publisher=SDI - TDI - ERDI|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Line arrows are placed to help the divers to establish the direction they come from, when they later need to find the way out, but should not alter the general navigation information of the system, so line arrows are added only where they cannot cause other groups to become confused about the direction to the nearest air source.&lt;ref name=Riordan /&gt; An arrow would be added at the point of attachment of a reel line when tying off to explore new areas, and may be removed after return and removal of the temporary line. If the place is to be marked for future reference, the arrow may be left in place.

===Non-directional markers===
The original non-directional markers in cave diving were clothes pegs, but the circular plastic "cookies" were developed later, based on the successful line-arrow design, and are more secure when placed on a guideline. They can be used to mark reference points, to distinguish lines at an intersection, or can be placed by each member of a team on a jump or gap line to identify who is still on the line if the team gets separated. As they are commonly used to identify the presence of a diver, they generally have some kind of personal identification, such as initials or drawings and may have notches, or holes added so they can be identified by feel.&lt;ref name="Keiren 2016"/&gt; 

A non-directional marker indicates the presence of a diver or team beyond a point and is mainly useful for that team. They may be used to indicate the direction the team came from and intend to exit by when the intersection is already marked by arrows, particularly if there are alternatives available which the team does not want to use. To avoid confusing other divers, these temporary markers are removed on the way out.&lt;ref name=Riordan /&gt;

===Hybrid markers=== 
A hybrid marker, also known as a referencing exit marker or REM, is a more recently developed line marker used as a directional marker by the diver placing it, and seen as a cookie by others. They are rectangular with slots like the arrow and cookie forms for attachment to a line, and have a relatively large blank space on one end to add identification on one side and to write on the other side. Referencing exit markers are asymmetrical so can be used to show the direction which the diver came from. They are personal markers, and should not be used by others to judge the suitability of a route as the practicability of an exit may depend on the size of the diver and the equipment carried.&lt;ref name="Keiren 2016"/&gt;

==Manufacture==
Originally hand made from available materials. Commercially marketed line markers are commonly injection-moulded plastic and are available in a few colours. Small variations in size and shape allow personal markers to be identified more easily, and unique markings may be added by the user.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="97798">'''Lists of foods named after places''' have been compiled by writers, sometimes on travel websites or food-oriented websites, as well as in books.

Since all of these names are words derived from place names, they are all [[toponymy|toponyms]]. This article covers English language food toponyms which may have originated in English or other languages.

According to Delish.com, "[T]here's a rich history of naming foods after cities, towns, countries, and even the moon."&lt;ref name=delish1&gt;Web page titled [http://www.delish.com/food-fun/foods-named-after-places#fbIndex1 "On the Map: Why Some Foods Are Named After Places"], retrieved August 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The following foods and drinks were named after places. Each non-obvious etymology is supported by a reference on the linked Wikipedia page. Food names are listed by country of the origin of the word, not necessarily where the food originated or was thought to have originated.

'''Station-keeping''' in a nautical situation is when a vessel is to:
* maintain a position in relation to another moving vessel or vessels, such as when
** conducting [[underway replenishment]] or
** part of a [[task force]] or [[convoy]]
* maintaining a fixed position in relation to a fixed object or
* patrolling a defined sector in relation to a fixed object.

'''OpenSeaMap''' is a [[Free Software|software project]] collecting freely usable nautical information and [[geospatial]] data to create a worldwide  [[nautical chart]]. This chart is available on the OpenSeaMap website, and can also be downloaded for use as an electronic chart for offline applications.&lt;ref name="Hydro International"&gt;[http://openseamap.org/fileadmin/user_upload/inhalt/PDF/Artikel_Hydro_International-2013-02.pdf Hydro International: OpenSeaMap - the Free Nautical Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is part of [[OpenStreetMap]]. OpenSeaMap uses the same database, and complements the spatial data with nautical information. Such data may be used in accordance with the [[Open Database License]]. This ensures integration into printed materials, websites and applications is possible, without being limited by restrictive [[licenses]], or having to pay fees.

== History ==
The idea for the project was born at an OpenStreetMap developer conference in autumn 2008 at the Linux Hotel in [[Essen]], [[Germany]]. A group of boaters and programmers decided to extend the coverage of OpenStreetMap to the seas and fresh water bodies. From the start the project has been worldwide and multilingual. By the end of 2009, the design and architecture of the project had been created, and a sample harbor "[[Warnemünde]]" was created to serve as an example chart. Since autumn 2009, a dedicated server has been available and the project is engaged in several collaborations with other free projects and organizations.
In January 2010 OpenSeaMap was given a stand at [[boot Düsseldorf]], Europe's largest boat show, allowing volunteers to present the project to a large audience of specialists for the first time.

== Contents of the chart ==
[[Image:OpenSeaMap-Warnemünde.png|180px|left]]

Charts will show [[lighthouses]], [[lateral buoy]], [[cardinal mark]]s and other [[navigational aids]]. In the ports, facilities will be mapped (port wall, pier, walkways, docks, fueling stations, loading cranes, access roads, railway lines, ferry lines). Similarly, public authorities, shipbuilders and repairers, as well as sanitation and utility facilities will be displayed. The navigational attributes correspond to the international standard [[IHO]] S-57.

Water depths are not yet covered, because the database is not designed for three-dimensional coordinates.  However, the plan is to eventually integrate a [[Bathymetry|bathymetric]] model to describe the [[ocean floor|seabed]].

The data are presented in multiple levels with [[OpenLayers]] on the base map of OpenStreetMap. The base map contains all the possible objects from OpenStreetMap.&lt;ref&gt;[[OpenStreetmap: EN: Map Features|map elements "Map Features "]]&lt;/ref&gt; OpenSeaMap includes additional layers such as aids to navigation, ports and temporary racing events.

== Applications ==
The chart is for planning [[sailing]] and boat trips. It will also be useful as a guide for tourists. It is not intended to replace official [[charts]].

; Online Map
: The map is available to any computer with an internet connection from the website OpenSeaMap.org. This map is updated daily.

; Offline Map
: The map can also be loaded on local [[computer data storage|data storage]] and can be used on any PC without internet access. This map will also permit use on other devices, such as GPS devices from Garmin and Lowrance, phones, and PDAs. The off-map is regularly updated, usually every week.

; App for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch
: The free [[Mobile app|App]] for OpenSeaMap works on [[iPad]], iPhone und iPod touch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/openseamap/id495210783?mt=8 App for OpenSeaMap for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch]&lt;/ref&gt; The actual position is shown on the chart. Each downloaded chart is cached on the device and can be used without internet connection. With internet connection the app checks if there is a newer version of the chart. The Apple location search finds the fitting map section. The app works worldwide.

; Navigation
: With certain navigation programs, it is possible to display the current position directly on the chart via a connected [[GPS]] device, tracking a vessel's movement. An [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA interface]] can run an [[autopilot]] and thus  control the ship. Also, the display of [[Automatic Identification System|AIS signals]] on the chart is possible. Appropriate navigation tools from the open source area are [http://www.sping.com/seaclear/ SeaClear], [[OpenCPN]] and [https://sourceforge.net/projects/gpsangler/ GPSANGLER].

== Internationalization ==
The site is translated into six languages: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Russian. The tools and the legends are available with a German, English and French interface. On the map the place names are always written in local language and script. The geographical coverage is worldwide. Depending on the region and the active [[cartographer]]s, the coverage varies but is growing daily.

== Timeliness ==
Data is stored in the database as soon as it has been entered, and is immediately available worldwide. Base map data is visible on the map after a few minutes. Navigational data is currently (2010) visible on the chart about two days after it has been entered.

== Editing tools ==
[[Image:JOSM-ss.png| thumb | [[JOSM]] Editor]]

; Offline Editor JOSM with navigational enhancements
: [[JOSM]] is the default editor for OpenStreetMap. It has been extended for use on navigational charts with a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]]. It is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and runs on multiple desktop platforms &lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/de:JOSM JOSM Editor]&lt;/ref&gt;

To edit you must register with a verified email address. Registration is free and will encourage high data quality. Read access  does not require registration.

Other programs can access the [[XML-RPC]] interface to the data on the server in order to read and write OpenSeaMap data.

== Harbor pilots ==
On the map are the world [[port]], [[marina]] and [[anchorage]].  Via a pop-up window these are linked with a port guide containing detailed port information. This guide is organized as a [[Wiki]] and is shaped by the users. Included is the free wikiproject "SkipperGuide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://SkipperGuide.de port manual "SkipperGuide"]&lt;/ref&gt;  5000 ports are accessible worldwide, including detailed descriptions of 600 marinas.&lt;div style="clear:both;"  &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Weather information ==
[[Image:Wetter Luftdruck.jpg|thumb|Air pressure]]
In worldwide [[weather chart]]s there are shown weather data like wind speed, air pressure (isobars), etc., each actualised two to three times per day, and with weather forecast up to three days.

For each harbor there is a [[Meteogram]] with detailed wind forecasts and weather information for eight days. Available weather data for wind direction, wind speed, air temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, cloudiness, precipitation. From this worldwide available data the captains can predict the marine weather. &lt;div style="clear:both;"  &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Bathymetric data ==
[[File:GEBCO-Waterdepth-OpenSeaMap-Atlanitct-1024x513.jpg|thumb|Bathymetric data]]
Worldwide, depths between 100 and 10,000 m are shown in a blue colour scale of 23 steps, together with depth shading. At higher zoom levels [[Isobath|depth contours]] are also displayed. The data is given through cooperation with [[General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans|GEBCO]] and its bathymetric GEBCO_08-database.

See also [https://sourceforge.net/projects/osmdcon/ OSMDCON]. &lt;div style="clear:both;"  &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Water depths by crowdsourcing ==
[[File:Tiefen-Tracks Palma.jpg|thumb|Depth tracks near Palma (ES)]]
[[File:15-11-01-Schweriner See-RalfR-WMA 3263.jpg|thumb|OpenSeaMap Data Logger]]
OpenSeaMap measures water depths by [[Crowdsourcing]]. Sailors, motor boaters, commercial shipping, divers, fishermen collect water depths between 0 and 100m with sounder and GPS. Divers work with a [[dive computer]]. Coastal water, lakes and rivers are surveyed. Result wil be an elevation model and derived depth lines.&lt;ref name="Hydro International" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhyg.de/images/hn_ausgaben/HN095.pdf OpenSeaMap – Wassertiefen per Crowdsourcing].

The '''philosophy of environment''' is a trend of [[Freethought|free thought]] located between [[philosophy]], [[epistemology]] and [[anthropology]]. It combines various schools of philosophy such as humanist ecology, philosophy of evolution and environmental [[humanism]]. It is also meant to be a cultural trend having an influence in society.

==Environment and evolution==

The philosophical current indicated under the name philosophy of evolution has been developed since the 1970s by Humanist Ecology (also called Environmental or Evolutive Humanism) and by the [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-darwinian]] school. Its purpose is the long-term evolution of the complex [[Organism|living being]] in its universal environment, analysed through its Human cultural expression.

This trend is unique to the quasi religious Evolutionist Humanism advocated by [[Julian Huxley]], notably during the founders congress of the IHEU ([[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]) in 1952.

Further than the basic [[Theory|scientific theory]] of evolution (notably neo-[[darwinian]], Evolutive Humanism, developed by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]),  looks at the necessity for Man of a permanent adaptation of both his organism and his thoughts to his universal [[natural environment|environment]]. And from there to the relativized relation to belief and to uncertainty, because human ideas evolve and are transformed, as are physical qualities, in a universal process of [[evolution]] and adaptive improvement in their environment. But this does not suppose [[determinism]], genetic or cultural, it refers to the evolutive interactivity and reactivity, partly random, of the living being with his surroundings. According to [[Marc Carl]], "Man must necessarily learn to manage the insufficient appearance and the uncertainty of information to fit and to develop in his relational interactions with his environment, as well as physically and culturally". In a universal environment still as much as 90% unknown, this evolutive cogitation therefore tries not to be locked in premature schemata and answers. It encourages humility in proposals and intuitive boldness in investigations.
A subjacent humanist thought encourages human beings to deliberately take his destiny in his hands, in careful correlation with his environment, knowing that human thought is one of the most impacting manifestations of the living being, as an agent of transformation of the environment, and consequently not only of the Earth's environment. In terms of philosophy of evolution, the organized collective thought of humanity, and in general his evolutive culture, appears as the key to development of our [[species]] in its universal environment, and the key to a possibly significant interactive modification, in the long term, of this environment. It is principally a prospective step.

This cultural trend seems to have emerged because the concept of progressive permanent adaptation, which is no longer appreciated only by its scientific aspects, also took a metaphysical dimension (in a sense of research of the essence of the human), which consequently encourages analysis of [[human evolution]], an agent which potentially modifies our environment, in philosophical terms. The possibilities and the risks of this evolution, [[Nondeterministic algorithm|non-deterministic]] because of its integration into a dynamic complex living system, gives the human existence and destiny a new sense. And to be involved in such a cogitation opens a philosophical way in which curious minds could not miss advancing sooner or later, a way which rests on a regenerated [[metaphysics]], encouraging us to take back in an evolutive way Aristoteles original concept of physis and its substance, and to search with modern conceptual tools the essence and the sense of our life.

==Humanist ecology (environmental humanism)==

Supported by the philosophy of evolution, this international emerging concept has expressed since the 1970s an evolutive humanism, extending the naturalist tradition of ancient Greek philosophers. Humanist ecology encourages us to better understand and situate the place and the destiny of humanity in its environment in permanent evolution. Human destiny is put in perspective in a universal context where many things remain to be learned.  Because it encourages every human in a responsibility in front of his conscience, humanist ecology  can be defined too as a will of ethical responsibility of civilized humanity, favouring its permanent improvement and its happiness, in useful interaction with its evolutive environment, in a beneficial way as much for a human being particularly as for mankind in general, and in common symbiosis with their local and global bioscape in evolution. That serves to optimize [[Society|human society]] in its own interactions and in its interactions with its bioscape, notably by preserving the planetary equilibrium of the Earth. This solidarity of all of mankind is necessary to preserve its environment and its best development in this environment inspired a particular political expression of humanist ecology, taken up notably by Statesmen such as [[Jacques Chirac]] (France) or Mohammed VI (Morocco) in the main meetings of the United Nations.

==Evolution and its relativisation==

Humanist ecology naturally favours the permanent adaptation and the best possible development of humanity, and of the human being, in an uncertain universal environment in permanent evolution, with a mind open enough to consider all the possibilities. In humanist ecological comprehension, it is vain to want to freeze an arbitrary cultural schemata and choose the apparent equilibrium and the supposed future of one moment of evolution. A permanent evolutive adaptation is necessary, as much biologically as mentally. That requires relativity and a caution in the analysis. According to this concept, for the [[Mind|human mind]], any representation belongs to the domain of belief, considering the uncertainty of the relation of man to the universe, and the natural imperfection of his senses to represent his environment and his interactions with this environment; the reality perceived by Man being only one representation of reality, particular in mankind. Humanist ecology admits this relativized relation with [[belief]] but refutes any final and locking form, knowing that no truth can be final for the human mind without upsetting its natural evolutive necessity. This [[School (discipline)|school of thought]] accepts belief in the present, for want of anything better, but dictates that you must take care to verify and update beliefs.

'''Political geography''' is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of [[politics|political]] processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Conventionally, for the purposes of analysis, political geography adopts a three-scale structure with the study of [[State (polity)|the state]] at the centre, the study of [[international relations]] (or [[geopolitics]]) above it, and the study of localities below it. The primary concerns of the subdiscipline can be summarized as the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.

== History ==

The British geographer [[Halford Mackinder]] was also heavily influenced by environmental determinism and in developing his concept of the 'geographical pivot of history'  or the [[The Geographical Pivot of History|Heartland Theory]] (in 1904) he argued that the era of sea power was coming to an end and that land based powers were in the ascendant, and, in particular, that whoever controlled the heartland of 'Euro-Asia' would control the world.  This theory involved concepts diametrically opposed to the ideas of [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] about the significance of ''sea power'' in world conflict.  The heartland theory hypothesized the possibility of a huge empire being created which didn't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to supply its [[military–industrial complex]], and that this empire could not be defeated by the rest of the world allied against it.  This perspective proved influential throughout the period of the [[Cold War]], underpinning military thinking about the creation of [[buffer state]]s between East and West in central Europe.

The heartland theory depicted a world divided into a ''Heartland'' (Eastern Europe/Western Russia); ''World Island'' (Eurasia and Africa); ''Peripheral Islands'' (British Isles, Japan, Indonesia and Australia) and ''New World'' (The Americas). Mackinder argued that whoever controlled the Heartland would have control of the world. He used these ideas to politically influence events such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]], where buffer states were created between the [[USSR]] and [[Germany]], to prevent either of them controlling the Heartland.  At the same time, Ratzel was creating a theory of states based around the concepts of Lebensraum and [[Social Darwinism]].  He argued that states were analogous to 'organisms' that needed sufficient room in which to live.  Both of these writers created the idea of a political and geographical [[science]], with an [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] view of the world.  Prior to [[World War II]] political geography was concerned largely with these issues of global power struggles and influencing state policy, and the above theories were taken on board by German geopoliticians (see [[Geopolitik]]) such as [[Karl Haushofer]] who - perhaps inadvertently - greatly influenced [[Nazism|Nazi]] political theory, which was a form of politics seen to be legitimated by such 'scientific' theories.

The close association with environmental determinism and the freezing of political boundaries during the Cold War led to a significant decline in the perceived importance of political geography, which was described by Brian Berry in 1968 as a 'moribund backwater'.  Although at this time in most other areas of human geography new approaches, including quantitative spatial science, behavioural studies, and structural Marxism, were invigorating academic research these were largely ignored by political geographers whose main point of reference remained the regional approach.  As a result, most of the political geography texts produced during this period were descriptive, and it was not until 1976 that Richard Muir could argue that political geography was no longer a dead duck, but could in fact be a phoenix.

== Areas of study ==
[[File:13.8 scharf.png|thumb|right|The [[Brandenburg Gate]] of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961.]]

From the late-1970s onwards, political geography has undergone a renaissance, and could fairly be described as one of the most dynamic of the sub-disciplines today. The revival was underpinned by the launch of the journal ''Political Geography Quarterly'' (and its expansion to bi-monthly production as ''Political Geography''). In part this growth has been associated with the adoption by political geographers of the approaches taken up earlier in other areas of human geography, for example, [[Ron J. Johnston]]'s (1979) work on electoral geography relied heavily on the adoption of quantitative spatial science, Robert Sack's (1986) work on territoriality was based on the behavioural approach, [[Henry Bakis]] (1987) showed the impact of information and telecommunications networks on political geography, and Peter Taylor's (e.g. 2007) work on World Systems Theory owed much to developments within structural Marxism.  However, the recent growth in vitality and importance of this sub-discipline is also related to the changes in the world as a result of the end of the Cold War.  With the emergence of a new world order (which as yet, is only poorly defined) and the development of new research agendas, such as the more recent focus on social movements and political struggles, going beyond the study of nationalism with its explicit territorial basis. There has also been increasing interest in the geography of green politics (see, for example, David Pepper's (1996) work), including the geopolitics of environmental protest, and in the capacity of our existing state apparatus and wider political institutions, to address any contemporary and future environmental problems competently.

Political geography has extended the scope of traditional political science approaches by acknowledging that the exercise of power is not restricted to states and bureaucracies, but is part of everyday life.  This has resulted in the concerns of political geography increasingly overlapping with those of other human geography sub-disciplines such as economic geography, and, particularly, with those of social and cultural geography in relation to the study of the politics of place (see, for example, the books by David Harvey (1996) and Joe Painter (1995)).  Although contemporary political geography maintains many of its traditional concerns (see below) the multi-disciplinary expansion into related areas is part of a general process within human geography which involves the blurring of boundaries between formerly discrete areas of study, and through which the discipline as a whole is enriched&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2011. Kinds of environments—a framework for reflecting on the possible contours of a better world. The Canadian Geographer/Le Géographe canadien, 55(3), pp. 383-386.  https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0064.2010.00334.x &lt;/ref&gt;.

In particular, contemporary political geography often considers:
* How and why states are organized into regional groupings, both formally (e.g. the [[European Union]]) and informally (e.g. the [[Third World]])
* The relationship between states and former colonies, and how these are propagated over time, for example through [[neo-colonialism]]
* The relationship between a [[government]] and its people
* The relationships between states including international trades and treaties
* The functions, demarcations and policing of boundaries
* How [[imagined geographies]] have political implications
* The influence of political power on geographical space
* The political implications of modern media (e.g. radio, TV, ICT, Internet, social networks)
* The study of election results (electoral geography)

===Critical political geography===
{{See also|Critical geopolitics}}

Critical political geography is mainly concerned with the criticism of traditional political geographies vis-a-vis modern trends.  As with much of the move towards 'Critical geographies', the arguments have drawn largely from [[postmodern]], [[post structural]] and [[postcolonial]] theories&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning. D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp. 388-396. https://doi.org/10.1068/d2310&lt;/ref&gt;.  Examples include:
* [[Feminist geography]], which argues for recognition of the power relations as [[patriarchal]] and attempts to theorise alternative conceptions of [[Personal identity|identity]] and [[identity politics]]&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, J., 2007. Geography and gender: Finding feminist political geographies. Progress in Human Geography, 31(3), pp.381-387.&lt;/ref&gt;. Alongside related concerns such as [[Queer theory]] and [[Youth studies]]
* [[Postcolonial]] theories which recognise the [[Imperialistic]], universalising nature of much political geography, especially in [[Development geography]]&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J., 2003. Political geography in a postcolonial context. Political Geography, 22(6), pp.647-651.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Environmental justice]] which addresses the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Justice and Environmentalism: The Social Justice Challenge to the Environmental Movement|last=|first=|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2007|isbn=0262195526|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is a human right for all people to share equally in the benefits bestowed by a healthy environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Environmental Justice Reader: Politics, Poetics, &amp; Pedagogy|last=|first=|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|year=2002|isbn=0816522065|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pravda Coast''' ({{lang-ru|Берег Правды}}) is a coast of the [[Davis Sea]] in the [[Eastern Antarctica]]. It is situated between 88° and 100° E. Pravda Coast was described in 1956 by [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]]. The coast was named in honor of the newspaper [[Pravda]]. Also there is a Russian polar [[Mirny Station]] here. An edge of the mainland ice sheet, the Pravda Coast becomes the [[West Ice Shelf]] in the west and the [[Shackleton Ice Shelf]] in the east. It rises abruptly to the south, and 100 km from the coast reaches an elevation of more than 1.5 km; the ice is 1,000 m thick. Bedrock is rare and insignificant in area.

[[File:1311_portolan_of_Pietro_Vesconte.jpg|thumb|250px | Windrose network -16 vertex/Portolan]]
[[File:Cartographer Pietro Vesconte (1318).jpg|thumb|250px | Image of Petrus Vesconte]]
A '''''rhumbline network''''', or more properly called, a '''windrose network''', is a navigational aid drawn on [[portolan chart]]s. This network is like a web (see picture) forming a grid on the [[map]]. The grid can be easily spotted (as parchment is quite translucent) by observing the map from its rear face, with a light source illuminating the other side. The hole in the center of the circle, origin of the whole network, is also clearly visible from the rear.&lt;ref name="Harvey1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. D. A. Harvey|title=Medieval maps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7QLAAAAYAAJ|year=1991|publisher=British Library|isbn=978-0-7123-0232-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines are not true [[rhumb line]]s in the modern sense (reason to put the title in italics), since these can only be drawn on modern [[map projection]]s and not on 13th century charts.&lt;ref name="Bagrow2010"/&gt; They were close to true rhumb lines in the Mediterranean area but highly inaccurate in the [[Teixeira planisphere]] and the other planispheres drawn in any pre-[[Mercator projection]].

== Rhumblines vs. windrose lines ==

[[Image:Europe Mediterranean Catalan Atlas.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|A part of the Catalan Atlas. Copied from the [[Catalan Atlas|Catalan Atlas Wiki Page]]]]

All [[portolan map]]s share this characteristic "windrose networks", which emanate out from [[compass rose]]s located at various points on the map (or mapamundi). These better called "windrose lines" are generated "by observation and the compass", and designated today: "lines of course" or "lines of rhumb" ("rhumb lines" in the fourteenth century, traced on portolan's particular projection, though not to be confused with modern [[rhumb line]]s, [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]s or [[isoazimuthal]]s).

To understand that those lines should be better called "windrose lines", one has to know that [[portolan map]]s are characterized by the lack of [[map projection]], for cartometric investigation has revealed that no projection was used in portolans, and those straight lines they could be [[loxodrome]]s only if the chart was drawn on a suitable projection.&lt;ref name="Bagrow2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo Bagrow|title=History of Cartography|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=OBeB4tDmJv8C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=portolans+only+when+the+chart+is+drawn+on+a+suitable+projection+projection&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI1Jii2vXkyAIVA7oaCh2VGwgb#v=onepage&amp;q=portolans%20only%20when%20the%20chart%20is%20drawn%20on%20a%20suitable%20projection%20projection&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-2518-4|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As leo Bagrow states:''"..the word ("Rhumbline") is wrongly applied to the sea-charts of this period, since a loxodrome gives an accurate course only when the chart is drawn on a suitable projection. Cartometric investigation has revealed that no projection was used in the early charts, for which we therefore retain the name 'portolan'."''&lt;ref name="Bagrow2010"/&gt;

Pujades in his book "Les cartes portolanes" has a chapter with all known theories and, with the aim to clarify the controversial arguments, he shows an image of [[Petrus Vesconte]] drawing a [[portolan]] in one of his maps in which it is visible how he started by drawing first the rhumbline grid.

The [[circle]] is divided into sixteen equal parts defining an [[hexadecagon]], then the network of sailing directions "for a [[Compass rose|16 winds rose]]" is represented by groups of 16 "straight lines" called rhumblines. From each [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]], 7 rhumblines are projected towards the hexadecagon's interior connecting "in an alternated pace" to 7 of the vertex opposite to it, but without routing any line to connect that vertex to the other 8 intermixed vertex. The remaining 9 rhumblines (to complete the 16 winds) are projected from each vertex towards the exterior of the hexadecagon, although in some portolans those 9 lines do not appear.&lt;ref name = "Pujades2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramon J.Pujades i Bataller|title=Les cartes portolanes: la representació medieval d'una mar solcada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6F-NwAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Institut Cartogràfic de Catalunya|isbn=978-84-9785-414-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines of the [[course (navigation)|courses]] for the eight main directions (or winds) are drawn with black ink (or sometimes [[gold]]); the eight intermediate directions (half-winds) are drawn in green; and in the case of a 32 winds rose,  the sixteen remaining (quarter-winds) are drawn in red. The intersection of this set of "rhumblines"  determine on the portolans a varied pattern of symmetrical squares, parallelograms, trapezoids and triangles.&lt;ref name="Harvey1991"/&gt;

== Vellum map creation process  ==

The process for a vellum chart creation used to be as follows:

* They prepared a [[vellum]] of good size, or several of them glued together .
* They drew a well-centered [[hexadecagon]] (or two linked by a vertex) with a network of 16 lines per vertex (with the different colors mentioned above: black, green and red) &lt;ref name="Pujades2007" /&gt;
* They copied on top of the grid the [[coast]]s lines trying to let the 16 vertex in visible places, as shown in Vescomte's portolan picture with its rhumbline network drawing  a 16 vertex  regular polygon (hexadecagon) that is perfectly centered on the parchment.
* In the case of the [[Mediterranean]] sometimes contained two hexadecagons and has the two opposite corners matching what is called the "portolan diaphragm " (axis of the Mediterranean .. or parallel of [[Rhodes]])
* Finally they labeled and decorated the whole [[vellum]] with more or less profusion.

== Planispheres with double hexadecagon ==
In large planispheres, especially those containing the oceans ([[World Map]]), the cartographer used to draw two hexadecagons with the two opposite corners superimposed in the center of the vellum. There are plenty of [[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]] that use the double-hexadecagon rhumbline networks but they can not be considered portolan charts since they do not have any ports indicated on them.

In the [[Cresques planisphere]] one is able to read the names of those lines which were winds: tramontana, levante, ponente, mezzogiorno, greco, sirocco, and lebegio. When limited to small seas, planispheres approximately follow both rhumb lines and great circles. But on big oceans they do not follow either of them, due to the imprecision of the map making of that time, corresponding more or less accurately to [[rhumb lines]] only in the Mediterranean [[portolan chart]]s and deviating greatly in the [[Texeira planisfere]] (among others).

== Use of rhumblines ==

To calculate on a [[portolan chart]] the course to follow from a [[Coordinate origin|point of origin]] to a point of destination, one should transfer &amp;mdash; using a [[parallel rule]] &amp;mdash; the "line of course" drawn from the point of origin to the point of destination, on top of the ''[[Compass rose]]'' closest to the ship's position, obtaining on it the theoretical course to be followed when sailing towards the destination. This theoretical course may have to be modified (as many times as needed) when tacking if the wind is right ahead of you, or to correct the effects of [[leeway]], [[tide|current]]s, etc... that a sailor with experience should be able to calculate empirically.

A '''rutter''' is a mariner's handbook of written sailing directions.  Before the advent of [[nautical chart]]s, rutters were the primary store of geographic information for maritime [[navigation]].

It was known as a ''[[periplus]]'' ("sailing-around" book) in [[classical antiquity]] and a ''[[Portolan chart|portolano]]'' ("port book") to [[medieval]] Italian sailors in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  Portuguese navigators of the 16th century called it a ''roteiro'', the French a ''routier'', from which the English word "rutter" is derived.  In Dutch, it was called a ''leeskarte'' ("reading chart"), in German a ''Seebuch'' ("sea book"), and in Spanish a ''derroterro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Kemp|editor-first=Peter|title=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|year=1993|page=242|isbn=0192820842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Before the advent of nautical charts in the 14th century, navigation at sea relied on the accumulated knowledge of [[navigator]]s and [[maritime pilot|pilot]]s. Plotting a course at sea required knowing the direction and distance between point A and point B. Knowledge of where places lay relative to each other was acquired by mariners during their long experience at sea.

The earliest [[periplus]]es of classical antiquity were not necessarily written as practical navigational handbooks. Some were more akin to an adventure travelogue, to celebrate a famous voyage.  Others were disguised as such, notably the ''[[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]]'' from the 4th century BCE, which described the harbors and landmarks along the north African coast west of the [[Nile delta]].  Still others were designed as commercial guides for merchants, such as the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', written around 100 CE by a Greek merchant in Egypt, as a guide to the market ports of the [[Red Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean]].

The re-emergence of maritime commerce in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during the [[Middle Ages]] (12th–13th centuries), spearheaded by Italian ports like [[Amalfi]], [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]], led to the rise of a new set of handbooks, known as ''[[Portolan chart|portolani]]'' ("port books"), designed for the practical use of mariners.  These were likely first compiled by professional mariners and pilots, probably as a mnemonic set of notes for their own personal use.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, (1956: p. 103); Parry (1963: p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt;  These notes were probably passed secretly within their profession ranks, from master to apprentice. Only a few of these Italian handbooks were made public, and even fewer have survived to this day.  The most complete surviving portolano is the famous ''Il compasso da navigare'', written c. 1250 and published in [[Genoa]] in 1296.

In their sailing instructions, Medieval portolan handbooks distinguished between various types of routes, e.g. ''per starea'' (coastal [[cabotage]]), ''per peleggio'' (open-sea sailing between two points).  Portolan handbooks expressed their sailing directions in terms [[compass rose]] points and distances.  The reliance on the [[magnetic compass]] (an instrument that only really began being used for navigation in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aczel (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;) distinguishes the Medieval portolano from the earlier Classical periplus.

It is believed that the [[nautical chart]]s that suddenly emerged in [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Majorca]] and other maritime centers after the late 13th century were constructed from the written information contained in contemporary written pilot handbooks, hence the term ''[[portolan chart]]''s.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1949: p. 103), Taylor (1956: pp. 111–12). See also Lanman (1987) and Campbell (1987, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  The wealth of detail contained in portolano handbooks is reflected in the portolan charts, stunningly accurate even by modern standards.

Handbooks often contained a wealth of information beyond sailing directions.  For instance, they frequently had detailed physical descriptions of shorelines, harbors, islands, channels, notes about tides, landmarks, reefs, shoals and difficult entries, instructions on how to use [[navigational instrument]]s to determine position and plot routes, calendars, astronomical tables,  mathematical tables and calculation rules (notably the [[rule of marteloio]]), lists of customs regulations at different ports, medical recipes, instructions on ship repair, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Edson (2007: 51)&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the nautical chart never fully replaced the handbook, but remained supplementary to it.

Among notable rutters is the ''Grand Routier'', written by the French pilot [[Pierre Garcie]], c. 1483 and published in 1502–03, which focused on the shores of the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the [[English Channel]], and its peculiarities.  Translated into English as the ''Rutter of the Sea'' in 1528, it was reprinted many times, and remained the pre-eminent rutter used by English sailors for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Waters (1985: p. 241); also Markham (1880: [https://books.google.com/books?id=BAoVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA355#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 355]). The first English edition (1528) of Garcie was entitled ''The Rutter of the Sea, with the laws of the yle of Auleron'' and translated by Robert Copeland.  Copies of the third edition (1541) contained "A rutter of the northe, compyled by Rychard Proude".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another frequently used rutter was the work ''Portolano'' by [[Pietro Coppo]], published in Venice in 1528, which included a collection of sea charts and the description of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istrianet.org/istria/illustri/coppo/index.htm |title=Prominent Istrians: Pietro Coppo |work=Istria on the Internet |publisher=Istrian American Charities Association, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coppo was among the last to consider North America an archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.si/books?id=cv9-AAAAIAAJ |title=Narrative and Critical History of America ...: Spanish explorations and settlements in America from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century. |page=128 |editor-first=Edward |editor-last=Channing|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and co. |year=1886|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most dramatic rutter was the 1595 ''Reysgheschrift'' by Dutch sailor [[Jan Huygen van Linschoten]].  Having sailed to the Asia aboard Portuguese ships, Linschoten publicized the sailing directions to the East Indies that had been assiduously kept secret by the Portuguese for nearly a century. The publication of Lischoten's rutter was an explosive sensation, and launched the race by a myriad of Dutch and English companies for the East Indies in its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;Koeman (1985), Schmidt (2001: p. 153)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scott Polar Research Institute''' ('''SPRI''') is a centre for research into the [[polar region]]s and [[glaciology]] worldwide. It is a sub-department of the [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|Department of Geography]] in the [[University of Cambridge]], located on [[Lensfield Road]] in the south of [[Cambridge]] ({{coord|52|11|54.40|N|0|07|34.45|E}}).

==Purpose==
[[File:Bust Scott Geograph-1422431-by-Keith-Edkins.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Robert Falcon Scott]] by [[Kathleen Scott]]]]
[[File:Youth-lawrence-cambridge-2017.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The statue of 'Youth' (1920) by Kathleen Scott for which [[A. W. Lawrence]] was the model]]
SPRI was founded by [[Frank Debenham]] in 1920 as the national memorial to Captain [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and his companions, who died on their return journey from the [[South Pole]] in 1912. It investigates issues relevant to the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] in the [[environmental science]]s, [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]. The institute has some 60 personnel, consisting of academic, library and support staff plus postgraduate students, associates and fellows attached to research programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/ Welcome to SPRI] Scott Polar Research Institute. Accessed 28 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute also hosts the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]], and is part of the [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling.

==Resources==
The Grade II listed main building  (1933–34) is by [[Sir Herbert Baker]]. The  small halls have shallow domed ceilings painted with the aspect of the globe from north and south poles, by [[MacDonald Gill]].&lt;ref name="NHLE"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England entry| num=1268369 |desc=Scott Polar Research Institute |grade=II |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Scott Polar Research Institute houses the world's most comprehensive polar library and archives.&lt;ref name= "SPRI website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/overview.html|title=Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge » Library|author=|date=|website=www.spri.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's [[Thomas Henry Manning|Thomas H. Manning]] Archive contains an unparalleled collection of manuscript material relating to the polar regions, research and exploration. For scientists and scholars, the library offers a collection developed since the 1920s covering all subjects relating to the Arctic, the Antarctic, and to ice and snow wherever found. For industry, it is a prime information source on such subjects as exploration and exploitation of natural resources and on the environmental implications of such activities in the polar regions; on the design of ice-strengthened shipping and selection of sea routes; and on problems of construction and transportation in cold environments. The library also offers an unrivalled resource for the needs of international relations and strategic defence.

The Picture Library contains a photograph collection from both the Arctic and Antarctic, mainly depicting the history of exploration in the polar regions, including much material from the expeditions of Scott and Shackleton. Its [[Thomas Henry Manning|Thomas H. Manning]] Polar Archives are named in honour of the British-Canadian Arctic researcher, a university alumnus.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/25/world/thomas-manning-86-explorer-known-as-lone-wolf-of-arctic.html|title=Thomas Manning, 86, Explorer Known as Lone Wolf of Arctic|last=Kaufman|first=Michael T.|date=25 November 1998|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its work includes an [[oral history]] programme which interviews people who have worked in the polar regions over the years. Due to high demand, the Polar Archives runs a booking scheme for anyone wishing to consult material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/archives/|title=Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge » Polar Archives|author=|date=|website=www.spri.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most recent addition to the library is the [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] Memorial Library, which in 1999 won a regional award from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/building/ The Shackleton Memorial Library] Scott Polar Research Institute. Accessed 28 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the building holds much of the library's Antarctic collection, as well as some of its subject-based material.

The library is part of the Inspire Libraries scheme&lt;ref&gt;http://inspire-libraries.org.uk/participating-libraries/?task=view&amp;id=1558&lt;/ref&gt; and is open to anyone with a polar interest to use for reference work and research.

==Research==
SPRI has several research groups.

===Glaciology and Climate Change Group===
This group's work involves quantifying the state of the [[cryosphere]] using remote sensing by satellites, plus accurate field measurements and computer simulations, to understand the processes in detail. In particular, the group has been able to observe the melting of the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]], the rapid retreat of ice in western Antarctica, and increased summer melting in northern Canada. This work has contributed greatly to understanding [[global warming|climate change]].

===Glacimarine Environments Group===
This group's work focuses on the dynamics of ice-sheets and delivery of sediment to the marine environment. The group uses geophysical and geological evidence gathered by [[icebreaker]]s in the polar seas.

===Polar Landscape and Remote Sensing Group===
This group's work focuses on the processes which modify the polar and sub-polar environments, such as Arctic vegetation, and snow and ice cover. Improving techniques for measuring vegetation from satellite data is an important part of the work.

===Polar Social Science and Humanities Group===
This is an interdisciplinary group covering the anthropology, history and art of the Arctic. Its work includes looking at politics and environmental management in the polar regions, with particular expertise in the religion, culture and politics of the [[Russia]]n North.

[[Image:Rivinletto Light.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Rivinletto Light]] on Kaasanmatala rock at the mouth of [[Kiiminkijoki]] in [[Haukipudas]], [[Finland]] is a typical sector light beacon.]][[Image:Leitfeuer_001.svg|thumb|Example of a sector light. The ship is navigating in the safe sector (white light is commonly marked as yellow in nautical charts).]]

A '''sector light''' is a man-made [[pilotage]] and [[position fixing]] aid that consists of strictly de-limited horizontal angle light beams to guide water-borne traffic through a safe channel at night in reasonable visibility. Sector lights are most often used for safe passage through shallow or dangerous waters. This may be when leaving or entering harbour. Nautical charts (paper and electronic) give all the required information.

Sectors of colored glass (or plastic) are placed in the lanterns of these lights. The light will then show these colors when observed certain bearings. Bearings referring to a sector are given in degrees true as observed from sea. Though the colors of the light will change, the characteristics will not. The change of color is not abrupt. The transition is made through an arc of uncertainty of 2° or greater.

The colors that are used, are conform to the IALA Maritime Bouyage system that is designed by the [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities]]:
* white - this sector is in the middle of the safe channel
* red - indicates the [[port (nautical)|port]] edge of the channel for vessels approaching the light source
* green - indicates the [[starboard]] edge of the channel for vessels approaching the light source.
A ship that is sailing in safe water and then sees the red (or green) color of the light has to make an alteration in course.

The world has different navigation stereotypes managed by IALA (International Association of Lighthouse Authorities). For example, the United States uses a signalling stereotype which is the opposite of Europe. In USA, the red light indicates the starboard side of the channel for harbour bound vessels, while the green light indicates the port side of the same channel. An expression to remind of this is "red right returning".
[[File:Diego Garcia PEL.jpg|thumb|Diego Garcia PEL Sector Light. 3.5 million candela which is visible for over 18.5km by day. Total beam width of 1.6° with white sector of 0.2°.]]

== Example of a sector light ==
An example of a sector light is the light of the [[Fisgard Lighthouse National Historic Site|Fisgard Lighthouse]] in [[British Columbia]]. The lighthouse as built to guide ships through the entrance of Esquimalt harbour. The white sector is an isophase light of 2s from 322° to 195°. If the ship sees this white light, it can pass safely. The rest shows a red light from 195 to 322°. If a vessel sees this light, it should alter its course.

Another example is the [[PEL sector light]] at [[Diego Garcia]]. The PEL sector light was constructed to guide US Navy vessels into the Diego Garcia port through a narrow entrance in the lagoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.msc.navy.mil/sealift/2003/March/diegogarcia.htm|title = US Navy Military Sealift Command|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PEL sector light produces 3.5 million candela and is visible for 10 nautical miles (18.5&amp;nbsp;km) by day. The beam with 3 colors is narrow at 1.6°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://vega.co.nz/price-list/gallery/case-study-diego-garcia/|title = PEL-6 Diego Garcia|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was required because the PEL sector light was built over 7NM (13&amp;nbsp;km) from the atoll entrance and it had to illuminate a safe entrance which is only 228 meters wide.

[[File:-BLMcareers (21678771368) crop.jpg|thumb|alt= A woman holding a notebook crouches next to a theodolite on a tripod. The instrument is set up on a bank in a forest.|A surveyor using a [[total station]]]]
'''Surveying''' or '''land surveying''' is the technique, profession, and science of determining the terrestrial or three-dimensional positions of points and the distances and angles between them. A land surveying professional is called a '''land surveyor'''. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish maps and boundaries for [[ownership]], locations, such as building corners or the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales.

Surveyors work with elements of [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[regression analysis]], [[physics]], engineering, [[metrology]], [[programming language]]s, and the law. They use equipment, such as [[total station]]s, robotic total stations, [[theodolites]], GPS receivers, [[retroreflector]]s, [[3D scanner]]s, radios, handheld tablets, digital levels, subsurface locators, drones, [[Geographic information system|GIS]], and surveying software.

Surveying has been an element in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history. The planning and execution of most forms of construction require it. It is also used in transport, communications, mapping, and the definition of legal boundaries for land ownership. It is an important tool for research in many other scientific disciplines.

==Definition==
The [[International Federation of Surveyors]] defines the function of surveying as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Definition |url=http://www.fig.net/about/general/definition/index.asp |website=''fig.net'' |access-date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A surveyor is a professional person with the academic qualifications and technical expertise to conduct one, or more, of the following activities;
* to determine, measure and represent land, three-dimensional objects, point-fields and trajectories;
* to assemble and interpret land and geographically related information,
* to use that information for the planning and efficient administration of the land, the sea and any structures thereon; and,
* to conduct research into the above practices and to develop them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Ancient surveying===
[[File:Cc&amp;j-fig23--plumb rule.png|upright=0.4|thumb|alt=refer to caption |A plumb rule from the book Cassells' Carpentry and Joinery]]
Surveying has occurred since humans built the first large structures. In [[ancient Egypt]], a [[rope stretcher]] would use simple geometry to re-establish boundaries after the annual floods of the [[Nile River]]. The almost perfect squareness and north-south orientation of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], built c. 2700 BC, affirm the Egyptians' command of surveying. The ''[[Groma surveying|Groma]]'' instrument originated in [[Mesopotamia]] (early 1st millennium BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=International Symposium on History of Machines and Mechanisms: Proceedings of HMM 2008|author=Hong-Sen Yan &amp; Marco Ceccarelli|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=2009|isbn=1-4020-9484-1|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prehistoric monument at [[Stonehenge]] (c. 2500 BC) was set out by prehistoric surveyors using peg and rope geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Anthony, ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''. (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-500-05155-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician [[Liu Hui]] described ways of measuring distant objects in his work ''[[Haidao Suanjing]]'' or ''The Sea Island Mathematical Manual'', published in 263 AD.

The Romans recognized land surveying as a profession. They established the basic measurements under which the Roman Empire was divided, such as a tax register of conquered lands (300 AD).&lt;ref name="Lewis2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=M. J. T.|title=Surveying Instruments of Greece and Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Izau5_ihmsC|accessdate=30 August 2012|date=23 April 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521792974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman surveyors were known as ''[[Gromatici]]''.

In medieval Europe, [[beating the bounds]] maintained the boundaries of a village or parish. This was the practice of gathering a group of residents and walking around the parish or village to establish a communal memory of the boundaries. Young boys were included to ensure the memory lasted as long as possible.

In England, [[William the Conqueror]] commissioned the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086. It recorded the names of all the land owners, the area of land they owned, the quality of the land, and specific information of the area's content and inhabitants. It did not include maps showing exact locations.

===Modern surveying===
[[File:Table of Surveying, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Printed image of surveying equipment. | Table of Surveying, 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]

Abel Foullon described a [[plane table]] in 1551, but it is thought that the instrument was in use earlier as his description is of a developed instrument.

[[Gunter's chain]] was introduced in 1620 by English mathematician [[Edmund Gunter]]. It enabled plots of land to be accurately surveyed and plotted for legal and commercial purposes.

[[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]] described a [[Theodolite]] that measured horizontal angles in his book ''A geometric practice named Pantometria'' (1571). Joshua Habermel ([[Erasmus Habermehl]]) created a theodolite with a compass and tripod in 1576. Johnathon Sission was the first to incorporate a telescope on a theodolite in 1725.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, Gerard L'E. ''Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments'', Sotheby Publications, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85667-170-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, modern techniques and instruments for surveying began to be used. [[Jesse Ramsden]] introduced the first precision [[theodolite]] in 1787. It was an instrument for measuring [[angle]]s in the horizontal and vertical planes. He created his [[Ramsden theodolite|great theodolite]] using an accurate [[dividing engine]] of his own design. Ramsden's theodolite represented a great step forward in the instrument's accuracy. [[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] invented an instrument that used a [[telescope]] with an installed [[crosshair]] as a target device, in 1640. [[James Watt]] developed an optical meter for the measuring of distance in 1771; it measured the [[parallactic angle]] from which the distance to a point could be deduced.

Dutch mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius]] (a.k.a. Snel van Royen) introduced the modern systematic use of [[Triangulation (surveying)|triangulation]]. In 1615 he surveyed the distance from [[Alkmaar]] to [[Breda]], approximately 72 miles (116,1 kilometres). He underestimated this distance by 3.5%. The survey was a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all. Snell showed how planar formulae could be corrected to allow for the curvature of the earth. He also showed how to [[resection (orientation)|resection]], or calculate, the position of a point inside a triangle using the angles cast between the vertices at the unknown point. These could be measured more accurately than bearings of the vertices, which depended on a compass. His work established the idea of surveying a primary network of control points, and locating subsidiary points inside the primary network later. Between 1733 and 1740, [[Jacques Cassini]] and his son [[César-François Cassini de Thury|César]] undertook the first triangulation of France. They included a re-surveying of the [[meridian arc]], leading to the publication in 1745 of the first map of France constructed on rigorous principles. By this time, triangulation methods were by then well established for local map-making.

[[File:1870 Index Chart to GTS India-1.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of triangulation network covering India.| A map of India showing the Great Trigonometrical Survey, produced in 1870]]

It was only towards the end of the 18th century that detailed triangulation network surveys mapped whole countries. In 1784, a team from General [[William Roy]]'s [[Ordnance Survey]] of Great Britain began the [[Principal Triangulation of Britain]]. The first Ramsden theodolite was built for this survey. The survey was finally completed in 1853. The [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of India began in 1801. The Indian survey had an enormous scientific impact. It was responsible for one of the first accurate measurements of a section of an arc of longitude, and for measurements of the geodesic anomaly. It named and mapped [[Mount Everest]] and the other Himalayan peaks. Surveying became a professional occupation in high demand at the turn of the 19th century with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The profession developed more accurate instruments to aid its work. Industrial infrastructure projects used surveyors to lay out [[canal]]s, roads and rail.

In the US, the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] created the [[Public Land Survey System]]. It formed the basis for dividing the western territories into sections to allow the sale of land. The PLSS divided states into township grids which were further divided into sections and fractions of sections.

[[Napoleon]] Bonaparte founded [[continental Europe]]'s first [[cadastre]] in 1808. This gathered data on the number of parcels of land, their value, land usage, and names. This system soon spread around Europe.
[[File:Camp of surverying party at Russel's Tank, Arizona, on eastern slope of Laja Range, 1,271 miles from Missouri River. (Boston Public Library) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|A railroad surveying party at Russel's Tank, [[Arizona]] in the 1860s]]
[[Robert Torrens]] introduced the [[Torrens system]] in South Australia in 1858. Torrens intended to simplify land transactions and provide reliable titles via a centralized register of land. The Torrens system was adopted in several other nations of the English-speaking world.
Surveying became increasingly important with the arrival of railroads in the 1800s. Surveying was necessary so that railroads could plan technologically and financially viable routes.

===20th century===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S12054, Vermessungstruppe bei Fernaufnahmen.jpg|thumb|alt=Soldier standing next to a Telescopic instrument on a tripod. |A German engineer surveying during the [[First World War]], 1918]]

At the beginning of the century surveyors had improved the older chains and ropes, but still faced the problem of accurate measurement of long distances. [[Trevor Wadley|Dr Trevor Lloyd Wadley]] developed the [[Tellurometer]] during the 1950s. It measures long distances using two microwave transmitter/receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sturman|first1=Brian|last2=Wright|first2=Alan|title=The History of the Tellurometer|url=http://www.fig.net/pub/fig2008/papers/hs01/hs01_03_sturman_wright_2833.pdf|publisher=International Federation of Surveyors|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the late 1950s Geodimeter introduced [[electronic distance measurement]] (EDM) equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cheves |first1=Marc |title=Geodimeter-The First Name in EDM |url=http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=394 |accessdate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310225310/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=394 |archivedate=10 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EDM units use a multi frequency phase shift of light waves to find a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahun|first1=Jerry|title=Electronic Distance Measurement|url=http://jerrymahun.com/library/Distance/a.htm|website=''Jerrymahun.com''|accessdate=20 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729013241/http://jerrymahun.com/library/Distance/a.htm|archivedate=29 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These instruments saved the need for days or weeks of chain measurement by measuring between points kilometers apart in one go.

Advances in electronics allowed miniaturization of EDM. In the 1970s the first instruments combining angle and distance measurement appeared, becoming known as [[total station]]s. Manufacturers added more equipment by degrees, bringing improvements in accuracy and speed of measurement. Major advances include tilt compensators, data recorders, and on-board calculation programs.

The first satellite positioning system was the [[US Navy]] [[Transit (satellite)|TRANSIT system]]. The first successful launch took place in 1960. The system's main purpose was to provide position information to [[Polaris missile]] submarines. Surveyors found they could use field receivers to determine the location of a point. Sparse satellite cover and large equipment made observations laborious, and inaccurate. The main use was establishing benchmarks in remote locations.

The US Air Force launched the first prototype satellites of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) in 1978. GPS used a larger constellation of satellites and improved signal transmission to provide more accuracy. Early GPS observations required several hours of observations by a static receiver to reach survey accuracy requirements. Recent improvements to both satellites and receivers allow [[Real Time Kinematic]] (RTK) surveying. RTK surveys get high-accuracy measurements by using a fixed base station and a second roving antenna. The position of the roving antenna can be tracked.

===21st century===
The [[theodolite]], [[total station]], and [[Real Time Kinematic|RTK]] [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] survey remain the primary methods in use.

Remote sensing and satellite imagery continue to improve and become cheaper, allowing more commonplace use. Prominent new technologies include three-dimensional (3D) scanning and use of [[lidar]] for topographical surveys. [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] technology along with [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] image processing is also appearing.

The main surveying instruments in use around the world are the [[theodolite]], [[Tape measure|measuring tape]], [[total station]], [[3D scanner]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]/[[GNSS]], [[dumpy level|level]] and [[Philadelphia rod|rod]]. Most instruments screw onto a [[Tripod (surveying)|tripod]] when in use. Tape measures are often used for measurement of smaller distances. 3D scanners and various forms of aerial imagery are also used.

The theodolite is an instrument for the measurement of angles. It uses two separate ''circles'', ''protractors'' or ''alidades'' to measure angles in the horizontal and the vertical plane. A telescope mounted on trunnions is aligned vertically with the target object. The whole upper section rotates for horizontal alignment. The vertical circle measures the angle that the telescope makes against the vertical, known as the zenith angle. The horizontal circle uses an upper and lower plate. When beginning the survey, the surveyor points the instrument in a known direction (bearing), and clamps the lower plate in place. The instrument can then rotate to measure the bearing to other objects. If no bearing is known or direct angle measurement is wanted, the instrument can be set to zero during the initial sight. It will then read the angle between the initial object, the theodolite itself, and the item that the telescope aligns with.

The [[gyrotheodolite]] is a form of theodolite that uses a gyroscope to orient itself in the absence of reference marks. It is used in underground applications.

The [[total station]] is a development of the theodolite with an electronic distance measurement device (EDM). A total station can be used for leveling when set to the horizontal plane. Since their introduction, total stations have shifted from optical-mechanical to fully electronic devices.{{citation needed|date = December 2013}}

Modern top-of-the-line total stations no longer need a reflector or prism to return the light pulses used for distance measurements. They are fully robotic, and can even e-mail point data to a remote computer and connect to [[satellite positioning system]]s, such as [[Global Positioning System]]. [[Real Time Kinematic]] GPS systems have increased the speed of surveying, but they are still only horizontally accurate to about 20&amp;nbsp;mm and vertically to 30–40&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fbiZz-37XIYC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=RTK+GPS+accuracy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=pZ3H0k-hm1&amp;sig=Ml6Pyrt-tQzIaByRhOnzE_h_gcI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result National Cooperative Highway Research Program: ''Collecting, Processing and Integrating GPS data into GIS'', p. 40.

GPS surveying differs from other GPS uses in the equipment and methods used. Static GPS uses two receivers placed in position for a considerable length of time. The long span of time lets the receiver compare measurements as the satellites orbit. The changes as the satellites orbit also provide the measurement network with well conditioned geometry. This produces an accurate [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] that can be over 20&amp;nbsp;km long. RTK surveying uses one static antenna and one roving antenna. The static antenna tracks changes in the satellite positions and atmospheric conditions. The surveyor uses the roving antenna to measure the points needed for the survey. The two antennas use a radio link that allows the static antenna to send corrections to the roving antenna. The roving antenna then applies those corrections to the GPS signals it is receiving to calculate its own position. RTK surveying covers smaller distances than static methods. This is because divergent conditions further away from the base reduce accuracy.

Surveying instruments have characteristics that make them suitable for certain uses. Theodolites and levels are often used by constructors rather than surveyors in first world countries. The constructor can perform simple survey tasks using a relatively cheap instrument. Total stations are workhorses for many professional surveyors because they are versatile and reliable in all conditions. The productivity improvements from a GPS on large scale surveys makes them popular for major infrastructure or data gathering projects. One-person robotic-guided total stations allow surveyors to measure without extra workers to aim the telescope or record data. A fast but expensive way to measure large areas is with a helicopter, using a GPS to record the location of the helicopter and a laser scanner to measure the ground. To increase precision, surveyors place [[beacons]] on the ground (about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} apart). This method reaches precisions between 5–40&amp;nbsp;cm (depending on flight height).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isprs.org/commission3/annapolis/pdf/Schenk.pdf Toni Schenk, Suyoung Seo, Beata Csatho: ''Accuracy Study of Airborne Laser Scanning Data with Photogrammetry'', p. 118] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325194334/http://www.isprs.org/commission3/annapolis/pdf/Schenk.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveyors use ancillary equipment such as tripods and instrument stands; staves and beacons used for sighting purposes; [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]]; vegetation clearing equipment; digging implements for finding survey markers buried over time; hammers for placements of markers in various surfaces and structures; and portable radios for communication over long lines of sight.

===Software===
Land surveyors, construction professionals and civil engineers using [[total station]], [[GPS]], [[3D scanner]]s and other collector data use Land Surveying Software to increase efficiency, accuracy and productivity. Land Surveying Software is a staple of contemporary land surveying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/4843/|title=View DigitalGlobe Imagery Solutions @ Geospatial Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveying techniques==
[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|alt= A compass with extra sights for measuring bearings. |A standard Brunton Geo [[compass]], still used commonly today by geographers, geologists and surveyors for field-based measurements]]

Surveyors determine the position of objects by measuring angles and distances. The factors that can affect the accuracy of their observations are also measured. They then use this data to create vectors, bearings, coordinates, elevations, areas, volumes, plans and maps. Measurements are often split into horizontal and vertical components to simplify calculation.
GPS and astronomic measurements also need measurement of a time component.

===Distance measurement===
[[File:Field-Map birdie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt= A Woman with a backpack holding a laser rangefinder, a handheld GPS and a Tablet computer. |Example of modern equipment for surveying ([[Field-Map]] technology): [[GPS]], [[laser rangefinder]] and field computer allows surveying as well as [[cartography]] (creation of map in real-time) and field data collection.]]
Before EDM devices, [[distance]]s were measured using a variety of means. These included chains with links of a known length such as a [[Gunter's chain]], or measuring tapes made of steel or [[invar]]. To measure horizontal distances, these chains or tapes were pulled taut to reduce sagging and slack. The distance had to be adjusted for heat expansion. Attempts to hold the measuring instrument level would also be made. When measuring up a slope, the surveyor might have to "break" (break chain) the measurement- use an increment less than the total length of the chain. [[Surveyor's wheel|Perambulators]], or measuring wheels, were used to measure longer distances but not to a high level of accuracy. [[Tacheometry]] is the science of measuring distances by measuring the angle between two ends of an object with a known size. It was sometimes used before to the invention of EDM where rough ground made chain measurement impractical.

===Angle measurement===
Historically, horizontal angles were measured by using a [[compass]] to provide a magnetic bearing or azimuth. Later, more precise scribed discs improved angular resolution. Mounting telescopes with [[reticle]]s atop the disc allowed more precise sighting (see [[theodolite]]). Levels and calibrated circles allowed measurement of vertical angles. [[Vernier scale|Vernier]]s allowed measurement to a fraction of a degree, such as with a turn-of-the-century [[Transit (surveying)|transit]].

The plane table provided a graphical method of recording and measuring angles, which reduced the amount of mathematics required. In 1829 [[Francis Ronalds]] invented a [[Reflecting instrument#Surveying sector|reflecting instrument]] for recording angles graphically by modifying the [[Octant (instrument)|octant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By observing the bearing from every vertex in a figure, a surveyor can measure around the figure. The final observation will be between the two points first observed, except with a 180° difference. This is called a ''close''. If the first and last bearings are different, this shows the error in the survey, called the ''angular misclose''. The surveyor can use this information to prove that the work meets the expected standards.

===Levelling===
{{main article|Levelling}}
[[File:Tide station leveling.jpg|thumbnail|alt= A woman setting up an optical level on a tripod. |Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services staff member conducts tide station leveling in support of the US Army Corp of Engineers in Richmond, Maine.]]

The simplest method for measuring height is with an [[altimeter]]&amp;nbsp;using air pressure to find height. When more precise measurements are needed, means like precise levels (also known as differential leveling) are used. When precise leveling, a series of measurements between two points are taken using an instrument and a measuring rod. Differences in height between the measurements are added and subtracted in a series to get the net difference in elevation between the two endpoints. With the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), elevation can be measured with satellite receivers. Usually GPS is somewhat less accurate than traditional precise leveling, but may be similar over long distances.

When using an optical level, the endpoint may be out of the effective range of the instrument. There may be obstructions or large changes of elevation between the endpoints. In these situations, extra setups are needed. ''Turning'' is a term used when referring to moving the level to take an elevation shot from a different location. To "turn" the level, one must first take a reading and record the elevation of the point the rod is located on. While the rod is being kept in exactly the same location, the level is moved to a new location where the rod is still visible. A reading is taken from the new location of the level and the height difference is used to find the new elevation of the level gun. This is repeated until the series of measurements is completed. The level must be horizontal to get a valid measurement. Because of this, if the horizontal crosshair of the instrument is lower than the base of the rod, the surveyor will not be able to sight the rod and get a reading. The rod can usually be raised up to 25 feet high, allowing the level to be set much higher than the base of the rod.

===Determining position===
The primary way of determining one's position on the earth's surface when no known positions are nearby is by astronomic observations. Observations to the sun, moon and stars could all be made using navigational techniques. Once the instrument's position and bearing to a star is determined, the bearing can be transferred to a reference point on the earth. The point can then be used as a base for further observations. Survey-accurate astronomic positions were difficult to observe and calculate and so tended to be a base off which many other measurements were made. Since the advent of the GPS system, astronomic observations are rare as GPS allows adequate positions to be determined over most of the surface of the earth.

===Reference networks===
{{main article|Geodetic network}}
[[File:Traversing and Offsetting DP 79152.png|thumb|alt= A diagram of survey markers running along a shoreline. |A survey using traverse and offset measurements to record the location of the shoreline shown in blue. Black dashed lines are traverse measurements between reference points (black circles). The red lines are offsets measured at right angles to the traverse lines.]]

Few survey positions are derived from first principles. Instead, most surveys points are measured relative to previous measured points. This forms a reference or ''control'' network where each point can be used by a surveyor to determine their own position when beginning a new survey.

Survey points are usually marked on the earth's surface by objects ranging from small nails driven into the ground to [[Trig beacon|large beacons]] that can be seen from long distances. The surveyors can set up their instruments on this position and measure to nearby objects. Sometimes a tall, distinctive feature such as a steeple or radio aerial has its position calculated as a reference point that angles can be measured against.

''[[Triangulation]]'' is a method of horizontal location favoured in the days before EDM and GPS measurement. It can determine distances, elevations and directions between distant objects. Since the early days of surveying, this was the primary method of determining accurate positions of objects for [[topographic]] maps of large areas. A surveyor first needs to know the horizontal distance between two of the objects, known as the [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]]. Then the heights, distances and angular position of other objects can be derived, as long as they are visible from one of the original objects. High-accuracy transits or theodolites were used, and angle measurements repeated for increased accuracy. See also [[Triangulation in three dimensions]].

''Offsetting'' is an alternate method of determining position of objects, and was often used to measure imprecise features such as riverbanks. The surveyor would mark and measure two known positions on the ground roughly parallel to the feature, and mark out a baseline between them. At regular intervals, a distance was measured at right angles from the first line to the feature. The measurements could then be plotted on a plan or map, and the points at the ends of the offset lines could be joined to show the feature.

[[Traverse (surveying)|''Traversing'']] is a common method of surveying smaller areas. The surveyor starts from an old reference mark or known position and places a network of reference marks covering the survey area. They then measure bearings and distances between the reference marks, and to the target features. Most traverses form a loop pattern or link between two prior reference marks so the surveyor can check their measurements.

====Datum and coordinate systems====
Many surveys do not calculate positions on the surface of the earth, but instead measure the relative positions of objects. However, often the surveyed items need to be compared to outside data, such as boundary lines or previous survey's objects. The oldest way of describing a position is via latitude and longitude, and often a height above sea level. As the surveying profession grew it created Cartesian coordinate systems to simplify the mathematics for surveys over small parts of the earth. The simplest coordinate systems assume that the earth is flat and measure from an arbitrary point, known as a 'datum' (singular form of data). The coordinate system allows easy calculation of the distances and direction between objects over small areas. Large areas distort due to the earth's curvature. North is often defined as true north at the datum.

For larger regions, it is necessary to model the shape of the earth using an ellipsoid or a geoid. Many countries have created coordinate-grids customized to lessen error in their area of the earth.

===Errors and accuracy===

A basic tenet of surveying is that no measurement is perfect, and that there will always be a small amount of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahmen|first1=Heribert|last2=Faig|first2=Wolfgang|title=Surveying|date=1988|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=3-11-008303-5|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5AFNBqbiLzoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=surveying&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_jHnU6G6J87zoASz84CwBg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=surveying&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three classes of survey errors:
*''Gross errors or blunders:'' Errors made by the surveyor during the survey. Upsetting the instrument, misaiming a target, or writing down a wrong measurement are all gross errors. A large gross error may reduce the accuracy to an unacceptable level. Therefore, surveyors use redundant measurements and independent checks to detect these errors early in the survey.
*''Systematic:'' Errors that follow a consistent pattern. Examples include effects of temperature on a chain or EDM measurement, or a poorly adjusted spirit-level causing a tilted instrument or target pole. Systematic errors that have known effects can be compensated or corrected.
*''Random:'' Random errors are small unavoidable fluctuations. They are caused by imperfections in measuring equipment, eyesight, and conditions. They can be minimized by redundancy of measurement and avoiding unstable conditions. Random errors tend to cancel each other out, but checks must be made to ensure they are not propagating from one measurement to the next.

Surveyors avoid these errors by calibrating their equipment, using consistent methods, and by good design of their reference network. Repeated measurements can be averaged and any outlier measurements discarded. Independent checks like measuring a point from two or more locations or using two different methods are used. Errors can be detected by comparing the results of the two measurements.

Once the surveyor has calculated the level of the errors in his or her work, it is [[adjustment of observations|adjusted]]. This is the process of distributing the error between all measurements. Each observation is weighted according to how much of the total error it is likely to have caused and part of that error is allocated to it in a proportional way. The most common methods of adjustment are the [[Nathaniel Bowditch|Bowditch]] method, also known as the compass rule, and the [[least squares|principle of least squares]] method.

The surveyor must be able to distinguish between [[accuracy and precision]]. In the United States, surveyors and civil engineers use units of feet wherein a survey foot breaks down into 10ths and 100ths. Many deed descriptions containing distances are often expressed using these units (125.25&amp;nbsp;ft). On the subject of accuracy, surveyors are often held to a standard of one one-hundredth of a foot; about 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch. Calculation and mapping tolerances are much smaller wherein achieving near-perfect closures are desired. Though tolerances will vary from project to project, in the field and day to day usage beyond a 100th of a foot is often impractical.

==Types of surveys==
{{see also|Survey (disambiguation)|Survey (disambiguation)#Earth sciences}}

Local organisations or regulatory bodies class specializations of surveying in different ways. Broad groups are:
* ''As-built survey'': a survey that documents the location of recently constructed elements of a construction project. As-built surveys are done for record, completion evaluation and payment purposes. An as-built survey is also known as a 'works as executed survey'. As built surveys are often presented in red or redline and laid over existing plans for comparison with design information.
* ''[[Cadastral surveying|Cadastral or boundary surveying]]'': a survey that establishes or re-establishes boundaries of a parcel using a [[Land description|legal description]]. It involves the setting or restoration of monuments or markers at the corners or along the lines of the parcel. These take the form of iron [[rod (shaft)|rods]], [[Pipe (material)|pipes]], or concrete monuments in the ground, or [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] set in concrete or asphalt. The ''ALTA/ACSM'' Land Title Survey is a standard proposed by the [[American Land Title Association]] and the [[American Congress on Surveying and Mapping]]. It incorporates elements of the boundary survey, mortgage survey, and topographic survey.
* ''Control surveying'': Control surveys establish reference points to use as starting positions for future surveys. Most other forms of surveying will contain elements of control surveying.
* ''[[Construction surveying]]
* ''[[Deformation Monitoring|Deformation survey]]:'' a survey to determine if a structure or object is changing shape or moving. First the positions of points on an object are found. A period of time is allowed to pass and the positions are then re-measured and calculated. Then a comparison between the two sets of positions is made.
* ''[[Dimensional control survey]]:'' This is a type of survey conducted in or on a non-level surface. Common in the oil and gas industry to replace old or damaged pipes on a like-for-like basis, the advantage of dimensional control survey is that the instrument used to conduct the survey does not need to be level. This is useful in the off-shore industry, as not all platforms are fixed and are thus subject to movement.
* ''Engineering surveying'': topographic, layout, and as-built surveys associated with engineering design. They often need geodetic computations beyond normal civil engineering practice.
* ''Foundation survey'': a survey done to collect the positional data on a foundation that has been poured and is cured. This is done to ensure that the foundation was constructed in the location, and at the elevation, authorized in the ''plot plan'', ''site plan'', or ''subdivision plan''.
* ''[[Hydrographic survey]]'': a survey conducted with the purpose of mapping the shoreline and bed of a body of water. Used for navigation, engineering, or resource management purposes.
* ''[[Leveling]]'': either finds the elevation of a given point or establish a point at a given elevation.
* ''[[National Flood Insurance Program#Removal from NFIP|LOMA survey]]'': Survey to change base flood line, removing property from a [[Special Flood Hazard Area|SFHA]] special flood hazard area.
* ''Measured survey'' : a building survey to produce plans of the building. such a survey may be conducted before renovation works, for commercial purpose, or at end of the construction process.
* ''[[Mine survey|Mining surveying]]'': Mining surveying includes directing the digging of mine shafts and galleries and the calculation of volume of rock. It uses specialised techniques due to the restraints to survey geometry such as vertical shafts and narrow passages.
* ''Mortgage survey:''  A ''mortgage survey'' or ''physical survey'' is a simple survey that delineates land boundaries and building locations. It checks for ''[[Structural encroachment|encroachment]]'', building setback restrictions and shows nearby flood zones. In many places a mortgage survey is a precondition for a mortgage loan.
* ''[[Photogrammetry|Photographic control survey]]'': A survey that creates reference marks visible from the air to allow [[Aerial photography|aerial photographs]] to be [[Orthophoto|rectified]].
* ''Stakeout, layout or setout'': an element of many other surveys where the calculated or proposed position of an object is marked on the ground. This can be temporary or permanent. This is an important component of engineering and cadastral surveying.
* ''Structural survey'': a detailed inspection to report upon the physical condition and structural stability of a building or structure. It highlights any work needed to maintain it in good repair.
* ''Subdivision'': A boundary survey that splits a property into two or more smaller properties.
* ''Topographic survey'': a survey that measures the elevation of points on a particular piece of land, and presents them as [[contour line]]s on a plot.

===Plane and geodetic surveying===
Based on the considerations and true shape of the earth, surveying is broadly classified into two types.

''Plane surveying'' assumes the earth is flat. Curvature and spheroidal shape of the earth is neglected. In this type of surveying all triangles formed by joining survey lines are considered as plane triangles. It is employed for small survey works where errors due to the earth's shape are too small to matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Surveying.html?id=EM-sLyVmMwIC | title=Surveying by BC Punmia | access-date=9 December 2014 | author=BC Punmia | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''geodetic surveying'' the curvature of the earth is taken into account while calculating reduced levels, angles, bearings and distances. This type of surveying is usually employed for large survey works. Survey works up to 100 square miles (260 square kilometers ) are treated as plane and beyond that are treated as geodetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIvvAwAAQBAJ | title=Surveying and Levelling | accessdate=28 July 2016 | author=N N Basak | pages=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; In geodetic surveying necessary corrections are applied to reduced levels, bearings and other observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Surveying.html?id=EM-sLyVmMwIC | title=Surveying by BC Punmia | access-date=9 December 2014 | author=BC Punmia | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic principles of surveying have changed little over the ages, but the tools used by surveyors have evolved. Engineering, especially civil engineering, often needs surveyors.

Surveyors help determine the placement of roads, railways, reservoirs, dams, [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, [[retaining wall]]s, bridges, and buildings. They establish the boundaries of legal descriptions and political divisions. They also provide advice and data for ''[[Geographic information system|geographical information system]]s'' (GIS) that record land features and boundaries.

Surveyors must have a thorough knowledge of [[algebra]], basic [[calculus]], [[geometry]], and [[trigonometry]]. They must also know the laws that deal with surveys, [[real property]], and contracts.

Most jurisdictions recognize three different levels of qualification:

* ''Survey assistants'' or ''chainmen'' are usually unskilled workers who help the surveyor. They place target reflectors, find old reference marks, and mark points on the ground. The term 'chainman' derives from past use of [[measuring chain]]s. An assistant would move the far end of the chain under the surveyor's direction.

* ''Survey technicians''  often operate survey instruments, run surveys in the field, do survey calculations, or draft plans. A technician usually has no legal authority and cannot certify his work. Not all technicians are qualified, but qualifications at the certificate or diploma level are available.

* ''Licensed, registered, or chartered surveyors'' usually hold a degree or higher qualification. They are often required to pass further exams to join a professional association or to gain certifying status. Surveyors are responsible for planning and management of surveys. They have to ensure that their surveys, or surveys performed under their supervision, meet the legal standards. Many [[Principal (commercial law)|principals of surveying firms]] hold this status.

=== Licensing ===
Licensing requirements vary with jurisdiction, and are commonly consistent within national borders. Prospective surveyors usually have to receive a degree in surveying, followed by a detailed examination of their knowledge of surveying law and principles specific to the region they wish to practice in, and undergo a period of on-the-job training or portfolio building before they are awarded a license to practise. Licensed surveyors usually receive a [[post nominal letters|post nominal]], which varies depending on where they qualified. The system has replaced older apprenticeship systems.

A licensed land surveyor is generally required to sign and seal all plans. The state dictates the format, showing their name and registration number.

In many jurisdictions, surveyors must mark their registration number on [[survey monument]]s when setting boundary corners. Monuments take the form of capped iron rods, concrete monuments, or nails with washers.

===Surveying institutions===
[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|thumb|alt= Uniformed group poses with theodolites, level staves and octant. |Surveying students with their professor at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in the late 19th century]]

Most countries' governments regulate at least some forms of surveying. Their survey agencies establish regulations and standards. Standards control accuracy, surveying credentials, monumentation of boundaries and maintenance of [[geodetic network]]s. Many nations devolve this authority to regional entities or states/provinces. Cadastral surveys tend to be the most regulated because of the permanence of the work. Lot boundaries established by cadastral surveys may stand for hundreds of years without modification.

Most jurisdictions also have a form of professional institution representing local surveyors. These institutes often endorse or license potential surveyors, as well as set and enforce ethical standards. The largest institution is the [[International Federation of Surveyors]] (Abbreviated FIG, for {{lang-fr|link=no|Fédération Internationale des Géomètres}}). They represent the survey industry worldwide.

===Building surveying===
{{Main article|Building surveying#Profession}}

Most English-speaking countries consider building surveying a distinct profession. They have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. Building surveyors focus on investigating the condition of buildings as well as legal compliance work.

===Cadastral surveying===
{{main article|Cadastral surveying}}One of the primary roles of the land surveyor is to determine the boundary of real property on the ground. The surveyor must determine where the adjoining landowners wish to put the boundary. The boundary is established in legal documents and plans prepared by attorneys, engineers, and land surveyors. The surveyor then puts monuments on the corners of the new boundary. They might also find or resurvey the corners of the property monumented by prior surveys.

'''Cadastral land surveyors''' are licensed by governments.
The cadastral survey branch of the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) conducts most cadastral surveys in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Rectangular Survey System by C. Albert White, 1983, Pub: Washington, D.C. : U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management : For sale by Supt. of Docs., U.S. G.P.O.,&lt;/ref&gt; They consult with [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]], [[National Park Service]], [[US Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], [[US Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]], [[US Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]], and others. The BLM used to be known as the [[General Land Office]] (GLO).

In states organized per the [[Public Land Survey System]] (PLSS), surveyors must carry out BLM cadastral surveys under that system.

Cadastral surveyors often have to work around changes to the earth that obliterate or damage boundary monuments. When this happens, they must consider evidence that is not recorded on the title deed. This is known as extrinsic evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, D., &amp; Hermansen, K. (1995). Use of extrinsic evidence to aid interpretation of deeds. Journal of Surveying Engineering, (121), 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noteworthy surveyors ===
Three of the four U.S. Presidents on [[Mount Rushmore]] were land surveyors. [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]] [[Surveying in early America|surveyed]] colonial or frontier territories prior to serving office.

[[David T. Abercrombie]] practiced land surveying before starting an [[outfitter]] store of [[excursion]] goods. The business would later turn into [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] lifestyle clothing store.

[[Percy Fawcett|Percy Harrison Fawcett]] is a British surveyor that explored the jungles of South America attempting to find the [[Lost City of Z]]. His biography and expeditions were recounted in the book [[The Lost City of Z (book)|''The Lost City of Z'']] and were later adapted on [[The Lost City of Z (film)|film screen]].

[[Inō Tadataka]] produced the first map of Japan using modern surveying techniques starting in 1800, at the age of 55.

The '''terminology of the British Isles''' refers to the various words and phrases that are used to describe the different (and sometimes overlapping) geographical and political areas of the islands of [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], and the smaller islands which surround them. The terminology is often a source of confusion, partly owing to the similarity between some of the actual words used, but also because they are often used loosely. In addition, many of the words carry both geographical and political connotations which are affected by the history of the islands. 

The purpose of this article is to explain the meanings of and relationships among the terms in use; however many of these classifications are contentious and are the subject of disagreement {{Crossreference|(See the [[British Isles naming dispute]])}}.

==Summary==
The use of terminology depends on context; words and phrases can generally be grouped into four main areas: geographical, political, linguistic and sporting terms. In brief&lt;!-- note that these are not intended to be full explanations of the terms; that is for later portions of the article --&gt;, the main terms and their simple explanations are as follows:

*Geographical terms:
**The [[British Isles]] is a group of islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of [[Continental Europe]]. It includes [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Shetland]], [[Orkney]], and [[List of islands of the British Isles|thousands of smaller islands]]. Traditionally the [[Channel Islands]] are included, though these specific islands are geographically closer to mainland continental Europe, being positioned off the French coast of [[Normandy]]. This, in part, has resulted in the term being [[British Isles naming dispute|disputed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Alan | first1 = Lew |last2 = Colin |first2 = Hall |last3 = Dallen |first3 = Timothy |title = World Geography of Travel and Tourism: A Regional Approach |publisher=Elsevier |place = Oxford |year = 2008 |quote = The British Isles comprise more than 6,000 islands off the northwest coast of continental Europe, including the countries of the United Kingdom of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland. The group also includes the United Kingdom crown dependencies of the Isle of Man, and by tradition, the Channel Islands (the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey), even though these islands are strictly speaking an archipelago immediately off the coast of Normandy (France) rather than part of the British Isles. |isbn = 978-0-7506-7978-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Written Answers - Official Terms"&gt;"[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html Written Answers – Official Terms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006211200/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html |date=2012-10-06 }}, [[Dáil Éireann]], Volume 606, 28 September 2005. In his response, the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that "The British Isles is not an officially recognised term in any legal or inter-governmental sense. It is without any official status. The Government, including the Department of Foreign Affairs, does not use this term. Our officials in the Embassy of Ireland, London, continue to monitor the media in Britain for any abuse of the official terms as set out in the Constitution of Ireland and in legislation. These include the name of the State, the President, [[Taoiseach]] and others."&lt;/ref&gt;
*** '''[[Great Britain]]''' is the largest island of the [[archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;"Britain", Oxford English Dictionary: "More fully Great Britain.  The term [[Great Britain]] includes [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]; it does not include [[Northern Ireland]]. As a geographical and political term: (the main island and smaller offshore islands making up) England, Scotland, and Wales, sometimes with the [[Isle of Man]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary: "Britain: an island that consists of England, Wales, and Scotland. The name is broadly synonymous with Great Britain, but the longer form is more usual for the political unit."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Britain", Oxford English Dictionary (Online Edition): "Britain: 1a – The proper name of the whole island containing England, Wales, and Scotland, with their dependencies; more fully called Great Britain; now also used for the British state or empire as a whole."&lt;/ref&gt;
***'''[[Ireland]]''' is the second largest island of the archipelago and lies directly to the west of Great Britain. The island of Ireland itself has its own '''[[List of islands of Ireland|list of Irish Isles]]'''.
***The full '''[[list of islands of the British Isles]]''' includes over 6,000 islands,&lt;ref&gt;There are no official definitions, but Scotland has over 790 offshore islands – see {{cite book| author=Haswell-Smith, Hamish| year=2004| title=The Scottish Islands| location=Edinburgh| publisher=Canongate| isbn=1-84195-454-3}} plus numerous freshwater islands so a complete list of the British Isles would probably have between 1,000 and 2,000 entries.{{better source|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 51 have an area larger than {{convert|20|km2|abbr=on}}.
* Political terms:
** The '''[[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]''' is the [[constitutional monarchy]] occupying the island of Great Britain, the small nearby islands (but not the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands), and the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland. Usually, it is shortened to ''United Kingdom'' or ''the UK'', though ''Britain''{{cn|date=June 2018}} is also an officially recognised short form.&lt;ref name="PCGN-uk-guide"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Permanent Committee on Geographical Names |title=Toponymic guidelines for the United Kingdom |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/toponymic-guidelines |website=gov.uk |publisher=UK Government |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Great Britain" is sometimes used as a short form, and is the name used by the UK in some international organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BOA|url=http://www.teamgb.com/about-boa|publisher=British Olympic Authority|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviation ''GB'' is frequently used for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in international agreements, e.g. [[Universal Postal Union]] and [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic|Road Traffic Convention]], as well as in the [[ISO 3166]] country codes (GB and GBR). "England" was also formerly used [[Synecdoche|synecdochically]] to refer to the whole United Kingdom, but this usage became rare early in the 20th century.
** '''[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]''' is the sovereign republic occupying the larger portion of the island of Ireland. However, to distinguish the state from the island, or to distinguish either of these from [[Northern Ireland]], it is also called "the Republic of Ireland" or simply "the Republic". Occasionally, its [[Irish language|Irish-language]] name, ''[[Éire]]'' (or ''Eire'' without the diacritic), will be used in an English-language context to distinguish it from "Northern Ireland", even though the word ''Éire'' directly translates as "Ireland".
**[[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are the four [[countries of the United Kingdom]], though they are also referred to, especially in sporting contexts, as the [[home nations]] of the United Kingdom.
**[[England and Wales]], Scotland, and Northern Ireland are legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="walesjurisdiction"&gt;Though the [[Contemporary Welsh Law#Wales as a jurisdiction|statute law applicable in Wales]] has diverged further from that applicable in England since devolution from the UK government to the [[National Assembly for Wales]], "England and Wales" remains a single jurisdiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Great Britain#Political definition|Great Britain]] means the countries of England, Wales and Scotland considered as a unit.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;"Great Britain", New Oxford American Dictionary: "Great Britain: England, Wales, and Scotland considered as a unit. The name is also often used loosely to refer to the United Kingdom."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page823.asp |title=Countries within a country |publisher=Number-10.gov.uk |date=2003-01-10 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[British Islands]] consists of the United Kingdom, the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. These are the [[Polity|polities]] within the British Isles that have the [[British monarch]] as head of state.
*Linguistic terms:
**The two [[sovereign states]] in the region, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], are frequently referred to as ''countries''. So too are [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Northern Ireland]] (as is the whole [[island of Ireland]]).
**British is an adjective pertaining to the United Kingdom; for example, a [[citizen]] of the UK is called a [[British citizen]]—but for citizenship purposes "British" includes the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
**[[Anglo-]] is often used as an adjectival prefix referring to the United Kingdom (notwithstanding that its original meaning is "English") particularly in the field of diplomatic relations.  It can also refer to the English language, to anglophone peoples and can have a variety of other shades of meaning.
**Wales is sometimes called the ''[[Principality of Wales]]'', although this has no modern constitutional basis.
**Northern Ireland is often referred to as a ''province'' or called ''Ulster'', after the [[Provinces of Ireland|traditional Irish province]] of [[Ulster]] within which it is located.
*Sport
**Forms of national representation vary from sport to sport. England, Scotland and Wales often compete separately as ''nations''.&lt;ref name="worldpeoples"&gt;{{citation|title=World and Its Peoples|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|location=Terrytown (NY)|year=2010|quote=In most sports, except soccer, Northern Ireland participates with the Republic of Ireland in a combined All-Ireland team.|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sports—such as [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[cricket]]—the island of Ireland competes as a nation; in others, most notably [[association football]], Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland field separate teams. In these contexts England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland/Northern Ireland  are sometimes described as ''the [[home nations]]''.
**[[Rugby union]] players from both Ireland and Great Britain play for [[British and Irish Lions]] representing the four "Home Unions" of [[Rugby Football Union|England]], [[Irish Rugby Football Union|Ireland]], [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scotland]] and [[Welsh Rugby Union|Wales]].
**[[Great Britain]] is sometimes used to mean [[United Kingdom]].  For example, at the [[Olympic Games]], the team called "Great Britain" represents Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympics.org.uk/contentpage.aspx?page=127 British Olympic Association, Team GB] retrieved 2 Jan. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irishand"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/olympics_2012/3433557.stm 'Irish and GB in Olympic row' BBC Sport 27 January, 2004] retrieved 1 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  However, athletes from Northern Ireland have, by virtue of their entitlement to dual nationality, the choice of participating in either the Great Britain team or the Republic of Ireland team.&lt;ref name="Irishand" /&gt;
**In the majority of individual sports (e.g. [[tennis]] and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]]), at international level competitors are identified as GB if they are from Great Britain or Northern Ireland. A small number of sports (e.g. [[golf]], [[darts]], [[snooker]]) identify participants as representing their constituent country. In the [[Commonwealth Games]], England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each compete as separate nations, as do each of the three Crown Dependencies (Ireland is not part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and is not eligible to participate).

==Terminology in detail==

*'''[[Britain (name)|Britain]]''' is a political and geographic term which can refer to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref name="num10"&gt;"the term 'Britain' is used informally to mean the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"&amp;nbsp;— quote from [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080909013512/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page823 British Government website]&lt;/ref&gt; or the island of [[Great Britain]].
*'''[[Great Britain]]''' is the [[List of islands by area|largest island]] in Europe and the [[political union]] of three nations, these being:
::*'''[[England and Wales]]''' is a political and administrative term referring to the two [[home countries]] of England and Wales, which share the same legal system.  Between [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746|1746]] and [[Welsh Language Act 1967|1967]] the term "England" did legally include Wales.
:::*'''[[England]]''' (see also the historical [[Kingdom of England]]).
:::*'''[[Wales]]''' (see also the historical [[Principality of Wales]]).
::*'''[[Scotland]]''' (see also the historical [[Kingdom of Scotland]])

:*The historical '''[[Kingdom of Great Britain]]''' is Britain for the period 1707–1801.
:*'''Britannia''' is the [[Roman Britain|Roman province of Britain]], or a poetic reference to later Britain, or a [[Britannia|personification of Britain]].
*The '''[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]''', usually shortened to the '''United Kingdom''' (abbreviation '''UK'''),&lt;ref name="PCGN-uk-guide"/&gt; is the [[sovereign state]] comprising [[Great Britain#Political definition|Great Britain]] plus '''Northern Ireland''' since 1927. (The Partition of Ireland took place in 1922, but the consequent change in the official title of the UK was only made by Act of Parliament five years later.) The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] is often shortened to  '''Britain''', even on official websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Gtgl1/GuideToGovernment/AboutBritain/index.htm |title=UK Government's "Guide to Government" |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714142445/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Gtgl1/GuideToGovernment/AboutBritain/index.htm |archivedate=July 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/lib2000/index.html |title=Office for National Statistics |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005160325/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/lib2000/index.html |archivedate=2009-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where such use is described as "informal".&lt;ref name="dgov-keyfacts"&gt;{{cite web |title=Key facts about the United Kingdom |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_10012517 |website=Directgov |publisher=British Government |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121003003526/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_10012517 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=3 October 2012 |date=3 October 2012 |quote='Britain' is used informally, usually meaning the United Kingdom.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="num10"/&gt; A proposal to rename the political entity as the "[[Alternative names for Northern Ireland|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ulster]]" was formally recommended by civil servants to the Cabinet in 1949 but ultimately rejected.&lt;ref&gt;British Archives, Catalogue Reference:CAB/129/32 (Memorandum by PM Attlee to Cabinet appending Working Party Report); Quoted at length on the [[Alternative names for Northern Ireland]] page.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*The historical '''[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]''' was [[Great Britain#Political definition|Great Britain]] plus [[Ireland]], for the period 1801 to 1922, although the name change after the secession of the Irish Free State only took place in 1927.
:N.B.: While "United Kingdom" is normally abbreviated '''UK''', the official [[ISO 3166]] two-letter country code is '''GB''' and the three letter code is '''GBR''' ([[Ukraine]] has the two letter code UA and the three letter code UKR). Due to a pre-existing convention originating in the UK's [[JANET]] academic computer network,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mech-eng.leeds.ac.uk/www_vms/mail_changes.html "Electronic Mail address changes"] On the transition form big-endian to little-endian notation (Dept of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Leeds&lt;/ref&gt; the UK's [[Country code top-level domain|Internet top-level domain]] is '''[[.uk]]''', a break from the [[TCP/IP]] practice of following ISO 3166 (a '''[[.gb]]''' domain has also been used to a limited extent in the past but is now defunct). '''GB''' is also used on car number plates to indicate the United Kingdom.

*'''[[Ireland]]'''  (in [[Irish language|Irish]], '''''Éire''''') refers, geographically, to the island of Ireland, or to any of the following:
&lt;!-- on this line, the only valid wikilink for Éire is to the page on ga:wiki.  But see the political context below.  --&gt;
:''Historically:''
:*The '''[[Kingdom of Ireland]]'''  was Ireland for the period 1541–1801. (The [[King of Ireland]] remained Head of State in the Irish Free State and Ireland/Éire until the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]] abolished that status).
:*The '''[[Irish Republic]]''', established by the [[Irish Declaration of Independence]], was a 32-county republic encompassing the entire island, during the period 1919–22—though its ''de facto'' rule did not encompass all of the island. During this period, according to British law, Ireland remained part of the UK though its independence was recognised by [[Russia]].
:*'''[[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]]''' was a  proposed [[Home Rule]] 26-county state under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. It never came into practical existence, being superseded by:
:*The '''[[Irish Free State]]''' is Ireland excepting Northern Ireland during the period 1922–37.
:''Present'':
:*'''Ireland''' (in [[Irish language|Irish]], ''[[Éire]]'') is the political entity consisting of the island of Ireland excepting Northern Ireland, 1937–present. This is the name of the state according to the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish Constitution]] and the United Nations.
:*The '''[[Republic of Ireland]]''' is a commonly used description of Ireland excepting Northern Ireland, 1949–present. It is also the name used by the international [[Association Football]] team.
::The terms ''Irish Republic'', ''Southern Ireland'', the ''Irish Free State'', the ''Free State'', the ''26 Counties'' and ''Éire'' (in English-language texts) have been used synonymously with the ''Republic of Ireland''. Of these, ''Southern Ireland'' and ''Irish Free State'', in particular, are seen as outdated. "Eire" (spelt without the Irish ''[[Acute accent|fada]]'') was the British legal spelling from the [[Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938]] until the [[Ireland Act 1949]], and informally for some years after.
:*'''[[Northern Ireland]]''' 1922–present. That part of the island of Ireland northeast of the line of partition of 1922, and which is still part of the United Kingdom. [[Alternative names for Northern Ireland|Various alternative names]] have been used or proposed for Northern Ireland. It is sometimes referred to as "the North of Ireland", "the Six Counties" or (in extremist usage) the "occupied six counties", especially by [[Irish Nationalism|Irish Nationalists]].
:*'''[[Ulster]]'''. The name of one of Ireland's four traditional [[Provinces of Ireland|provinces]]. The area contains nine northern counties, six of which make up [[Northern Ireland]], and three of which are part of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It is also often used by [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] to refer to the smaller [[Northern Ireland]]. Though [[Ulster]] has not been a political entity since the ancient Gaelic provincial kingdoms, it remains associated with a geographical area and is used in sporting and cultural contexts. See [[Ulster (disambiguation)]].
:''In sport''
:*In [[Gaelic games]], no distinction is recognised between the [[GAA county|GAA counties]] of the Republic and those of Northern Ireland. County teams play in their provincial championships (where the six counties of Ulster within Northern Ireland and three within the Republic all play in the Ulster championship) and the winners of these play in the All-Ireland championship. Even within Northern Ireland, a tricolour, the [[Flag of Ireland|flag of the Republic of Ireland]], is flown at all games. At bigger games, where an anthem is played, it is always [[Amhrán na bhFiann|the national anthem of the Republic]]. In the case of the [[International rules football|International Rules]] series against [[Australia international rules football team|Australia]], an Irish national team is chosen from all 32 counties.
:*In Association Football, the teams correspond to political entities: Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In accordance with [[UEFA]] and [[FIFA]]'s rules, each of these countries has its own football league: the [[Irish Football League|Irish League]] and the [[League of Ireland]] respectively.
:*In [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[field hockey]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[golf]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] and others  the ''Ireland'' team is drawn from the whole island (i.e. both the Republic and Northern Ireland). Many sports organisations are subdivided along provincial lines e.g. [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], [[golf]].
*The '''[[British Isles]]''' is a term used to mean the island of Great Britain plus the island of Ireland and many smaller surrounding islands, including the [[Isle of Man]] and, in some contexts, the [[Channel Islands]] ([[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]]). See [[British Isles naming dispute]] for details of the conflict over use of this term.
*''Great Britain and Ireland'', or variants like "Britain and Ireland" or "The UK and Ireland" are sometimes used as alternatives to the term [[British Isles]].
*'''Anglo-Celtic Isles''' is an alternative term (in limited use) for the geographic region comprising Britain &amp; Ireland, more commonly referred to as the 'British Isles'. 'Anglo-Celtic Islands' is a derivative of this. It is intended as a geographic term free of any political implication and uses the macro-cultural grouping term [[Anglo-Celtic]], referring to the peoples from which the majority of the island group's population are descended—the [[Anglo-Saxons]] and the [[Celt]]s (it can also be inclusive of the [[Anglo-Normans]]).
*'''[[Islands of the North Atlantic]]''' is another suggested replacement term for 'British Isles', without the same political connotations. However, its convolution and impracticality due to implying inclusion of fellow North Atlantic islands such as Iceland have made it unworkable and it has not come into common use. The term was used as part of the Strand 3 level of negotiations for the Belfast agreement. (Its acronym, IONA, is also the name of the small but historically important island of [[Iona]] off the coast of Scotland.)
*'''[[British Islands]]''' (a legal term not in common usage) is the UK, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.
*'''[[Brittany]]''', itself a corruption of 'Britain', and sometimes formerly known as 'Little Britain' is a historical [[Duchy]] in the West of [[France]], now a French region; for this modern administrative sense, see [[Brittany (administrative region)]].

==Geographical distinctions==

===The British Isles===
{|
|-
| [[File:British Isles all.svg|50px]]
|
The [[British Isles]] is a group of islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of [[Continental Europe]]. It includes [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Shetland]], [[Orkney]], and [[List of islands of the British Isles|thousands of smaller islands]]. Traditionally the [[Channel Islands]], are included, however these specific islands are geographically part of mainland continental Europe, as they are positioned off the French coast of Normandy. The term is disputed (see [[British Isles naming dispute]]).
|}

====Great Britain====
{|
|-
| [[File:Great Britain.svg|50px]]
| [[Great Britain]] is the largest of the British Isles. On Great Britain are located three constituent countries of the United Kingdom: [[Scotland]] in the north, [[England]] in the south and east and [[Wales]] in the west. There are also [[List of islands of the British Isles|numerous smaller islands]] off its coast (''not'' coloured red on the attached map) that are administered as part of England, Scotland and Wales.  The inclusion of these smaller islands means political 'Great Britain' covers a slightly larger area than the island of Great Britain.
|}

====Ireland====
{|
|-
| [[File:Island of Ireland.svg|50px]]
| The second largest island in the group is [[Ireland]]. Most of the island is in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The north east of the island ([[Northern Ireland]]) is part of the [[United Kingdom]]. There are also [[List of islands of Ireland|numerous smaller islands]] off the coast of Ireland.
|}

====Isle of Man====
{|
|-
| [[File:British Isles Isle of Man.svg|50px]]
| The [[Isle of Man]] lies between Great Britain and Ireland. It is governed as a British [[Crown dependency]], having its own parliament, but with the United Kingdom responsible for its defence and external relations.
|}

====Channel Islands====
{|
|-
| [[File:British Isles Channel Islands.svg|50px]]
| Although the [[Channel Islands]] are associated with the United Kingdom politically as [[Crown dependencies]], they are geographically an outcrop of the nearby French mainland (specifically, the [[Armorican massif]]), and historically they are the last remaining parts of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], the Duke of Normandy being a title belonging to the British monarch.

==Political terms in more detail==

===The United Kingdom===
[[File:United Kingdom in the British Isles.svg|left|80px]]
[[File:British passport 2002.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A UK passport]]
''The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'' is the official full title of the state. This name appears on official documentation such as [[British passport]]s. For convenience, the name is usually shortened to ''United Kingdom'', ''UK'' or ''Britain''.&lt;ref name="PCGN-uk-guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dgov-keyfacts"/&gt;

The '''United Kingdom''' is a [[sovereign state]]. Its four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] are sometimes considered to be of different status. This view may be supported by the existence of [[Devolution|devolved]] governments with different levels of power in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales (see [[Asymmetrical federalism]]).

Wales is also often erroneously&lt;ref name="Wales FAQ page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wales.com/en/content/cms/FAQs|title=Wales FAQ Page|publisher=Wales.com|accessdate=2011-07-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414171808/http://www.wales.com/en/content/cms/faqs/|archivedate=2011-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described as a [[principality]] of the United Kingdom. The title of [[Prince of Wales]] is usually given to the [[heir apparent]] to the [[British throne]] but it has no political or other role in respect of Wales. The [[International Organization for Standardisation]] (ISO) has defined Wales as a "country" rather than a "principality" since 2011, following a recommendation by the [[British Standards Institute]] and the [[Welsh Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/international-body-grants-wales-country-1813629|title=International body grants Wales country status after principality error|date=1 August 2011|work=WalesOnline|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Northern Ireland]] is sometimes described by [[United Kingdom]] citizens as a [[province]] of the United Kingdom, which derives from the Irish [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]], of which [[Northern Ireland]] is a part. Northern Ireland also had, until 1972, a far greater degree of [[self-government]] than the other constituent parts of the UK.

''Great Britain'' is both a geographical and a political entity. Geographically, it is one island, but [[Great Britain#Political definition|as a political entity]] it also includes the smaller offshore islands that are administered as part of its constituent nations – England, Wales and Scotland – such as England's [[Isle of Wight]], Wales' [[Anglesey]] and Scotland's [[Inner Hebrides]], [[Outer Hebrides]], [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]].

The abbreviation ''GB'' is sometimes officially used for the United Kingdom, for example in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], or as the [[vehicle registration plate#International codes|vehicle registration plate]] [[List of international license plate codes|country identification code]] for UK-registered cars ''(see also [[British car number plates]])''. ''SCO'' in Scotland, ''CYM'' for Wales (Cymru), ''NI'' for Northern Ireland, or ''ENG'' for England can also be used.&lt;ref name="numberplates"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[internet code]] ''[[.gb]],'' although allocated to the UK, is virtually unused and UK web domains use ''[[.uk]]''.

The four constituent parts of the UK are also known, particularly in sporting contexts, as ''[[Home Nations]]'' or the "Four Nations". The BBC refers to its UK-wide broadcasting operation as ''Nations and Regions'' &lt;ref name="bbcnations"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/nationsregions.shtml
|title=BBC Nations &amp; Regions
|author=BBC Press Office
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("regions" referring to geographic regions of England. Thus the UK naming conventions tend towards describing distinct ''regions'' or ''nations'' which exist within a single sovereign ''state''.

In sport, the UK Nations mostly have their own separate national teams – England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, for example in [[football (soccer)|football]]. Sporting contests between the Four Nations are known as "Home internationals" (an example is the [[British Home Championship]] in football).

The governing body for football in Northern Ireland is called the [[Irish Football Association]] (the IFA), having been in existence since some forty years before [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]]. Its counterpart in the Republic (plus [[Derry City FC]]) is the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (the FAI). The [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland national team]] retained the name "Ireland" for some fifty years after partition. Since around 1970 the two teams have been consistently referred to as "Northern Ireland" and "[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]" respectively. The UK competes as Great Britain at the Olympic Games. According to the Olympic Charter the Olympic Council of Ireland represents the entire island of Ireland.&lt;ref name="olympicrow"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Olympic athletes from Northern Ireland may choose whether to represent the UK or the [[Republic of Ireland]].

Since the [[Good Friday Agreement]] and the subsequent implementation legislation, sporting organisation (and several other organisations, e.g. [[Tourism in Ireland|tourism]], [[Irish Gaelic]] and [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] language boards) on the island of Ireland has increasingly been cross-border.

Citizens of the UK are called ''British'', ''Brits'', ''Britons'' or ''Britisher'' (archaic). The term ''Unionists'' may also be used, sometimes [[pejoratively]], for example by supporters of [[Scottish independence]] when referring to supporters of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Union]]. Some older slang names for Britons are ''Tommy'' (for British soldiers) and ''Anglo''. [[Anglo]] properly refers only to England, but it is sometimes used as a broader reference as an element in compound adjectives: for example, "Anglo-French relations" may be used in newspaper articles when referring to relations between the political entities [[France]] and the United Kingdom. ''Anglo-Saxon'' may be used (particularly in Continental European languages) when referring to the whole [[English-speaking world]].

===Ireland===
{{Main article|Names of the Irish state}}
[[File:Republic of Ireland.svg|left|80px]]
[[File:Eirepas.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|An Irish passport]]
Since the adoption of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, '''[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]''' has been the [[English (language)|English]] name of the state which covers approximately five-sixths of the island of [[Ireland]]. The name '''[[Éire]]''' is used when writing in [[Irish (language)|Irish]].

Since the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], the term "Republic of Ireland" is the term used as the additional ''description'' of the state. This term is useful in avoiding ambiguity between the name of the island and the name of the state.  However, the term "Ireland" is always used in formal diplomatic contexts such as the [[European Union]] or the [[United Nations]]. The passport of the Republic of Ireland bears the name ''Éire – Ireland''.

Before the introduction of the 1937 constitution and the new name, the [[Irish Free State]] occupied the same territory as the modern state of Ireland. The Irish Free State became an autonomous [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]] in 1922 when it seceded from the United Kingdom through the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. The King ceased to be its Head of State [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|in 1936]] and the state ceased to be a Dominion and left the Commonwealth [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|in 1948]].

Traditionally, the island of Ireland is divided into four [[Provinces of Ireland|province]]s – [[Leinster]], [[Connacht]], [[Munster]] and [[Ulster]], with each of the provinces further divided into counties. The Republic of Ireland takes up 83% of the island, twenty-six of the thirty-two traditional counties of Ireland. Northern Ireland takes up the remaining area, six of the traditional nine counties of Ulster.

On the island of Ireland the naming of places often raises political issues. The usage of "Ireland" as the [[Constitution of Ireland|official name]] of the state causes offence to some [[unionists (Ireland)|Unionists]] in [[Northern Ireland]], who believe it implies that the state [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|still]] has a territorial claim to the whole island – the terminology of "Republic of Ireland" or "[[Éire]]" is much preferred by Northern Irish unionists when referring to that political state. Similarly, some [[Nationalists (Ireland)|Nationalists]] in Northern Ireland also prefer to reserve the usage of "Ireland" to refer to the whole island.

In Northern Ireland, Irishness is a highly contested identity, with fundamentally different perceptions of national identity between unionists (who generally perceive themselves as being British) and nationalists (who generally consider both communities to be part of the Irish nation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/dd/report7/report7c.htm CAIN: Democratic Dialogue: With all due respect – pluralism and parity of esteem (Report No. 7)] by Tom Hennessey and Robin Wilson, Democratic Dialogue (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Ireland is often referred to by the [[Irish nationalists|Nationalist]] and [[Irish Republicans|Republican]] communities by the term "the Twenty-six Counties", with the connotation that the state constituted as such forms only a portion of the ideal political unit of the [[Irish Republic]], which would consist of all of the [[Counties of Ireland|thirty-two counties]] into which the island is divided.  The term "the Six Counties" (of Northern Ireland) is also used. Other Nationalist terms in use include "the North of Ireland" and "the North". These latter are terms also used by the Irish national broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  More extreme terms for Northern Ireland include "the occupied six counties" or "occupied Ireland", which are often used by people who reject the idea of Northern Ireland as a separate entity from the Republic of Ireland.

The [[Irish passport]] is available to Irish citizens and can also be applied for abroad through Irish Consular services and the local Irish Embassy. As per the [[Irish nationality law]], any person born on the island of Ireland before 2005, or otherwise a first generation descendant of such a person, is allowed to apply for an Irish passport. As such, people born in Northern Ireland and their children may be Irish citizens and hold an Irish passport if they choose.

===British Islands===
[[File:British Islands.svg|left|80px]]
[[File:Jersey passport new.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A Jersey passport]]
Under the Interpretation Act 1978 of the United Kingdom, the legal term '''''British Islands''''' (as opposed to the geographical term ''British Isles'') refers to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], together with the [[Crown dependencies]]: the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and of [[Guernsey]] (which in turn includes the smaller islands of [[Alderney]], [[Herm]] and [[Sark]]) in the [[Channel Islands]]; and the [[Isle of Man]].

Special British passports are issued to citizens of the Crown dependencies. On the front of passports issued to residents of the Crown dependencies, the words ''"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"'' are replaced with ''"British Islands"'' followed by the name of the issuing state or island. This design applies to [[Jersey passport]], [[Guernsey passport]] and [[Isle of Man passport]].  Like UK passports, Crown dependency also bear the title ''"European Union"'' for customs purposes. However, Crown dependency citizens who have no family ties to the United Kingdom are granted a special limited "Islander Status" under EU law (article 6 of Protocol 3 in the [[Treaty of Accession 1972|Treaty of Accession of the UK to the European Community]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/article/2822/What-is-Islander-status|title=What is Islander status?  |year=2013  |website=States of Guernsey  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007233859/http://www.gov.gg/article/2822/What-is-Islander-status  |archivedate= 7 October 2013  |deadurl=yes  |accessdate=8 December 2017  |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jersey|first1=States of|title=Islander status and your right to live and work in Europe|url=https://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/ApplyFirstAdult/Pages/islanderstatus.aspx|website=www.gov.je|accessdate=8 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208112536/https://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/ApplyFirstAdult/Pages/islanderstatus.aspx|archivedate=8 December 2017|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical aspects==
{{Further information|Britain (name)}}
Some suggest an early known  for the term might be  from [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] writings. Though some of the original texts have been lost, excerpts were quoted or paraphrased by later authors. Parts of the [[Massaliote Periplus]], a merchants' handbook describing searoutes of the sixth century BC, were used in translation in the writings of [[Avienus]] around AD 400. Ireland was referred to as ''Ierne'' (''Insula sacra'', the ''sacred island'', as the Greeks interpreted it) "inhabited by the race of ''Hiberni''" (''gens hiernorum''), and Britain as ''insula Albionum'', "island of the [[Albion]]s".&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{cite book

Greek writers called the peoples of these islands the {{lang|grc|Πρεττανοί}}, later {{lang|grc|Bρεττανοί}} (alternative spellings of this and of all relative words have a single [[tau]] or a double [[Nu (letter)|nu]]), a name that possibly corresponds to the ''[[Priteni]]''.&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt; These names may have derived from a "[[Celtic languages|Celtic language]]" term which may have reached Pytheas from the [[Gaul]]s&lt;ref name=ohi/&gt; who may have used it as their term for the inhabitants of the islands.

The Romans called the inhabitants of Gaul (modern [[France]]) ''Galli'' or ''Celtae'', the latter term deriving from the Greek name {{lang|grc|Κελτοί}} for a central European people.  Antiquarians of the seventeenth century who found language connections developed the idea of a race of [[Celt]]s inhabiting the islands, but this term was not used by the Greeks or Romans for the inhabitants of Britain or Ireland,&lt;ref name=ece&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walespast.com/article.shtml?id=36 |title=The earliest Celts in Europe |publisher=WalesPast |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041011133701/http://www.walespast.com/article.shtml?id=36 |archivedate=2004-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; nor is there any record of the inhabitants of the British Isles referring to themselves as such. Nevertheless, Roman administration later incorporated the province of Britannia into the [[praetorian prefecture of Gaul]], in common with Hispania, which had Celtiberians. [[Armorica]], where the Bretons would settle{{when|date=June 2014}}, was part of ''Gallia Celtica'', so there were tertiary relations between the Britons and Gallic Celts at least. In addition, the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] of Gallia Celtica are thought to have founded Aldborough in Britain. [[Belgae]] and [[Silures]] also came from Gallic areas, although not strictly "Celtic", but from ''Gallia Belgica'' and ''Aquitainia''.

''Priteni'' is the source of the [[Welsh language]] term [[Prydain]], ''Britain'',&lt;ref name=ohi/&gt; and has the same source as the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] term [[Cruithne (people)|Cruithne]]. The latter referred to the early [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] speaking inhabitants of the [[Scottish highlands]] and the north of Scotland,&lt;ref name=ohi/&gt; who are known as the Cruithne in [[Scottish Gaelic]], and who the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called [[Picts]] or [[Caledonians]].

===Romans===
[[File:Roman britain 400.jpg|thumb|Roman Britain in 410]]
[[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] brought descriptions of the peoples of what he called ''Britannia pars interior'', "inland Britain", in 55 BC. Throughout Book 4 of his ''Geography'', [[Strabo]] is consistent in spelling the island Britain (transliterated) as ''Prettanikē''; he uses the terms ''Prettans'' or ''Brettans'' loosely to refer to the islands as a group – a common generalisation used by classical geographers. For example, in Geography 2.1.18, ''…οι νοτιώτατοι των Βρεττανών βορειότεροι τούτων εισίν'' ("…the most southern of the Brettans are further north than this").&lt;ref name="Roseman"&gt;Translation by Roseman, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; He was writing around AD 10, although the earliest surviving copy of his work dates from the 6th century.
[[Pliny the Elder]] writing around AD 70 uses a Latin version of the same terminology in section 4.102 of his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Naturalis Historia]]''. He writes of Great Britain: ''Albion ipsi nomen fuit, cum Britanniae vocarentur omnes de quibus mox paulo dicemus.'' ("Albion was its own name, when all [the islands] were called the Britannias; I will speak of them in a moment"). In the following section, 4.103, Pliny enumerates the islands he considers to make up the Britannias, listing Great Britain, Ireland, and many smaller islands.
In his ''Geography'' written in the mid 2nd century and probably describing the position around AD 100,&lt;ref name=ohi/&gt; [[Ptolemy]] includes both Great Britain (Albion) and Ireland ([[Hibernia|Iwernia]]) in the so called ''Bretanic'' island group. He entitles Book II, Chapter 1 of as ''[[Hibernia|Iwernia]], Bretanic Island'', and Chapter 2 as ''Alwion [sic], Bretanic Island''.&lt;ref&gt;Greek text [http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/ptolemy/Claudii_Ptolemaei_GeographiaVOL_I.pdf Ptolemy's ''Geography'', Books I-IV], pg 59&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Albion'' for [[Great Britain]] fell from favour, and the island was described in Greek as Πρεττανία or Βρεττανία, in [[Latin]] ''Britannia'', an inhabitant as Βρεττανός, ''Britannus'', with the adjective Βρεττανικός, ''Britannicus'', equating to "British".&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt; With the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] the name [[Britannia]] was used for the province of [[Roman Britain]]. The Emperor [[Claudius]] was honoured with the [[Roman naming convention|agnomen]] ''Britannicus'' as if he were the conqueror, and coins were struck from AD 46 inscribed &lt;small&gt;DE BRITAN, DE BRITANN, DE BRITANNI,&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;DE BRITANNIS&lt;/small&gt;. With the visit of [[Hadrian]] in AD 121 coins introduced a female figure with the label &lt;small&gt;BRITANNIA&lt;/small&gt; as a personification or goddess of the place. These and later Roman coins introduced the seated figure of Britannia which would be reintroduced in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html|title=Britannia on British Coins|work=24carat.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later years of Roman rule Britons who left Latin inscriptions, both at home and elsewhere in the Empire, often described themselves as ''Brittanus'' or ''Britto'', and where describing their citizenship gave it as ''cives'' of a British tribe or of a ''patria'' (homeland) of ''Britannia'', not ''Roma''.&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt; From the 4th century, many Britons migrated from Roman Britain across the [[English Channel]] and founded [[Brittany]].

===Mediaeval period===
[[File:Britain 802.jpg|Map of Britain with part of Ireland in 802|thumb]]
[[File:Hereford Mappa Mundi 1300.jpg|Hereford Mappa Mundi with the isles in the lower left hand corner.|thumb]]
While Latin remained the language of learning, from the early [[mediaeval]] period records begin to appear in native languages. The earliest [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] source to use a collective term for the archipelago is the ''[[Life of Saint Columba]]'', a [[hagiography]] recording the missionary activities of the sixth century Irish monk [[Saint Columba]] among the peoples of what is now Scotland. It was written in the late seventh century by [[Adomnán of Iona|Adomnán]] of [[Iona]], an Irish monk living on the [[Inner Hebridean]] island. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is '''Oceani Insulae''' meaning "Islands of the Ocean" (Book 2, 46 in the Sharpe edition = Book 2, 47 in Reeves edition), it is used sparingly and no ''Priteni''-derived collective reference is made.

Another early native source to use a collective term is the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' of [[Bede]] written in the early eighth century. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is ''insularum'' meaning "islands" (Book 1, 8) and it too is used sparingly. He stated that Britain "studies and confesses one and the same knowledge of the highest truth in the tongues of five nations, namely the Angles, the Britons, the Scots, the Picts, and the Latins", distinguishing between the [[Brythonic languages]] of the "ancient Britons" or [[Old Welsh]] speakers and other language groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/institutes/sassi/spns/watsloth.htm General survey of Lothian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925082819/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/institutes/sassi/spns/watsloth.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Viking]] kingdoms such as [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], [[Wessex]], and [[Scandinavian York|Jórvík]] amalgamated, leading to the formation of [[Scotland]], and [[England]]. [[Wales]] was sometimes united under princes or kings such as [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]]. Between 854 and 1171, a kingship of Ireland was established by kings of the regional kingdoms such as [[Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid]], [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain]], [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]], and [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]], something not achieved in Britain until 1707. In subsequent [[Norman Ireland]], local lords gained considerable autonomy from the [[Lordship of Ireland]] until it became the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] under direct English rule.

===Renaissance mapmakers===
[[File:Blaeu - Atlas of Scotland 1654 - INSULAE ALBION ET HIBERNIA - Old Great Britain.jpg|thumb|right|The 1654 Blaeu Atlas of Scotland, ''Insulae Albion Et Hibernia'']]
[[Abraham Ortelius]] makes clear his understanding that England, Scotland and Ireland were politically separate in 1570  by the full title of his map: ''Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae, sive Britannicar. insularum descriptio'' ('A representation of England, Scotland and Ireland, or the Britannic islands'). [[George Lily]]'s 1546 map divides Britain into the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, with Ireland alongside. Some maps from this period also appear to mark Wales, and sometimes Cornwall, as separate areas within Britain, while the history of England created by [[Polydore Vergil]]&lt;ref&gt;Map Collectors' Series, Issue 9, Map Collectors' Circle, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Henry VIII]] states, "The whole country of Britain is divided into four parts, whereof the one is inhabited by Englishmen, the other of Scots, the third Welshmen and the fourth of Cornish people."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kingston Derry, Michael G. Blakeway, J. Murray, The making of pre-industrial Britain: life and work between the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Payton, The Making of Modern Cornwall: Historical Experience and the Persistence of "Difference", Dyllansow Truran, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maps of the Mediaeval, Renaissance and later periods often referred to ''[[Albion]]''. This archaic term was originally used by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] to mean the island of Great Britain. In later centuries its meaning changed to refer only to the area we now call Scotland (''Albany'', or ''[[Alba]]'' in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]). ''Albion'' has survived as a poetic name for Britain but it is not in everyday use.

===18th and 19th centuries===
[[File:Moll - The north part of Great Britain called Scotland.png|thumb|A 1726 map showing "The north part of Great Britain called Scotland"]]
Following the [[Acts of Union 1707]], a fashion arose, particularly in Scotland, for referring to Scotland and England as ''[[North Britain]]'' and ''[[South Britain]]'' respectively. These terms gained in popularity during the 19th century. The most lasting example of this usage was in the name of the [[North British Railway]], which became part of the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] in 1923, and in the name of the North British Hotel, built by the railway in [[Edinburgh]] in 1902, which retained the name until it reopened in 1991 as the Balmoral Hotel.

===Evolution of kingdoms and states===
[[File:Nations of the UK.png|400px|thumb|right|A timeline of [[Sovereign state|states]] in the British Isles. (''Ireland'' continues to exist, but the description "Republic of Ireland" is used as a disambiguator in this case).]]
The diagram on the right gives an indication of the further evolution of kingdoms and states. In 1603 the [[Scottish King]] [[James I of England|James VI]] inherited the [[English throne]] as "James I of England". He styled himself as ''James I of Great Britain'', although both states retained their sovereignty and independent parliaments, the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the [[Parliament of England]]. (The term "Great Britain" itself reportedly dates from as early as 1474, and was in common usage from the mid-16th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/royalstyle_uk.htm Royal Styles and Titles in England and Great Britain], heraldica.org&lt;/ref&gt;)

The 1707 [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]] united England and Scotland in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], then in 1800 Ireland was brought under British government control by the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Irish unrest culminated in the [[Anglo-Irish War|Irish War of Independence]] and the 1922 separation of the [[Irish Free State]], which later became a republic with the name Ireland. The majority Protestant [[Northern Ireland|northeast]] continued to be part of what became the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].

[[British overseas territories]] such as [[Bermuda]], [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Falkland Islands]] have various relationships with the UK. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]], initially formalised in 1931 (the British Commonwealth until 1949), is an association of independent states roughly corresponding to the former [[British Empire]]. (This has no connection with the [[Commonwealth of England]], a short-lived [[republic]] replacing the previous kingdoms during the [[English Interregnum]] (1649–1660).)

==Adjectives==
The [[adjectives]] used to describe the contents and attributes of the various constituent parts of the British Isles also cause confusion.

In the absence of a single adjective to refer to the [[United Kingdom]], ''British'' is generally used to refer to the [[United Kingdom]] as a whole. However, in a specifically physical geographical sense, ''British'' is used to refer to the island of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/british?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The adjectival phrase ''Great British'' is very rarely used to refer to [[Great Britain]], other than to contrive a [[pun]] on the word ''great'', as in "Great British Food".

''Irish'', refers to people or a characteristic "of Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/irish?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, its meaning is contextual on the meaning of "Ireland" being used: it can relate both to the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish state]], and to the [[Ireland (island)|island of Ireland]]. [[Northern Ireland]], as a constituent part of the [[United Kingdom]], can thus be both ''British'' or ''Irish'', reflected in the ability  for residents of Northern Ireland to take either British or Irish citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British-Irish Agreement|url=http://www.britishirishcouncil.org/about/british-irish-agreement|publisher=British-Irish|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to be more specific, ''Northern Irish'' is therefore in common usage. Members of the [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalist]] communities would not describe themselves as ''British'' and would only use the terms ''Irish'', or specifically ''Northern Irish'' where needed.

The term ''Ulster'' can also be used as an adjective (e.g. "[[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]"), but this is more likely to be used by [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionists]] and has political connotations in the same fashion as its use as a proper noun (because only six of the traditional nine counties of [[Ulster]], namely [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Down|Down]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], are included in Northern Ireland with the remaining three counties [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] forming part of the Republic).  The term ''Ulsterman'' (or ''Ulsterwoman'') is common and holds no such political connotation. Likewise, [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalists]] might describe, say, a lake in Northern Ireland as ''Irish''.

Note that the geographical term [[Irish Sea]] thus far appears to have escaped political connotations, even though territorial control of the waters of the Irish Sea is divided between both the Republic of Ireland and the UK, and also includes a British [[Crown dependency]], the [[Isle of Man]]—as yet there appears to be no controversy with the term’s usage to mirror that of "British Isles". The "Northern" in "Northern Ireland" is not completely accurate.  The most northerly point on the island, [[Malin Head]], is in the Republic of Ireland—in [[County Donegal]]'s [[Inishowen]] Peninsula.

==Problems with use of terms==

===British Isles===
{{Main article|British Isles naming dispute}}

The dictionary definition of [[British Isles]] is that it is a geographical term that refers to the whole of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]] as well as the surrounding islands. It is sometimes incorrectly used as if identical to the UK;{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} or to refer to [[Great Britain]] and the surrounding islands, excluding the island of [[Ireland]] entirely.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.megalithics.com/] Website on Megalithic Monuments in the British Isles and Ireland. Ireland in this site includes Fermanagh, which is politically in Northern Ireland."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/FHMpaper/ The website uses the term "British Isles" in various ways, including ways that use Ireland as all of Ireland, while simultaneously using the term "The British Isles and Ireland", e.g. "Anyone using GENUKI should remember that its name is somewhat misleading — the website actually covers the British Isles and Ireland, rather than just the United Kingdom, and therefore includes information about the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, as well as England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ngrs.demon.co.uk.guide.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Guide to Narrow Gauge rail in the British Isles and Ireland which includes Belfast lines under the section on Ireland."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] and ''[[The Times]]'' have style guides that mandate the dictionary definition but occasional misuse can be found on their web sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/britain_01.shtml British Weather (Part One)] This BBC article referred to "a small '''country''' such as the British Isles" between at least April 2004 and January 2007 (checked using the Wayback Machine at https://web.archive.org.  Last accessed and checked 01/01/07. It was changed in February 2007 and now reads 'a small '''area''' such as the British Isles'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Google searches of

The term ''[[British Isles]]'' can also be considered irritating or offensive by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2010/may/11/snooker-british-isles-mind-your-language | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2011-08-23 | title = Snooker and the geography of the British Isles | location=London | first=David | last=Marsh | date=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the modern association of the term ''British'' with the [[United Kingdom]] makes its application to Ireland inappropriate.

The term ''[[British Isles]]'' can also be considered to imply a proprietary title on the entire archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Trevor Montague |title=A to Z of Britain and Ireland (A to Z series) |publisher=Little, Brown Book Group |year=2009 |page=introduction |isbn=1-84744-087-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of the government of [[Ireland]] is that no branch of government should use the term,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html Written Answers – Official Terms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006211200/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html |date=2012-10-06 }}, [[Dáil Éireann]] – Volume 606 – 28 September 2005. In his response, the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs added that "Our officials in the Embassy of Ireland, London, continue to monitor the media in Britain for any abuse of the official terms as set out in the Constitution of Ireland and in legislation. These include the name of the State, the President, Taoiseach and others."&lt;/ref&gt; and although it is on occasion used in a geographical sense in Irish parliamentary debates, this is often done in a way that excludes the Republic of Ireland. In October 2006, ''The Times'' quoted a spokesman for the Irish Embassy in London as saying that they would discourage its use.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2385403.html New atlas lets Ireland slip shackles of Britain"] A spokesman for the Irish Embassy in London said: “The British Isles has a dated ring to it, as if we are still part of the Empire. We are independent, we are not part of Britain, not even in geographical terms. We would discourage its useage.{{sic}}”&lt;/ref&gt;

During a stop-over visit to the Republic of Ireland in 1989, the leader of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], indicated that he assumed Ireland's [[head of state]] was [[Queen Elizabeth II]], given that she was the British Queen and his officials said that Ireland was a part of the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;Eamon Delaney, 2001, ''An Accidental Diplomat: My Years in the Irish Foreign Service'', New Island Books, Dublin, {{ISBN|1-902602-39-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Northern Ireland]], some [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] reject the term and instead use ''these islands'', ''these isles'' or "Britain and Ireland" as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guelke| first=Adrian |chapter=Northern Ireland and Island Status |title=Northern Ireland and the Divided World: The Northern Ireland Conflict and the Good Friday Agreement in Comparative Perspective |editor=[[John McGarry]] ed. |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several suggestions for replacements for the term ''British Isles''. Although there is no single accepted replacement, the terms ''Great Britain and Ireland'', ''The British Isles and Ireland'' and ''Britain and Ireland'' are all used.

===England===
[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 12.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A still from the 1943 US propaganda film series ''[[Why We Fight]]'', which suggests that the name "England" applies to the whole of Great Britain]]

The word "England" is often used synecdochically to refer to Great Britain—or the United Kingdom as a whole&lt;ref name="gmikes"&gt;"When people say England, they sometimes mean Great Britain,  sometimes the United Kingdom, sometimes the British Isles — but never England." — {{citation |author=George Mikes |title=How To Be An Alien |publisher=Penguin |year=1946 }} {{ISBN|0-582-41686-8}}

In a similar way, references to England as an island,&lt;ref name="islandofEngland"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; are examples of this usage of the term "England".

Because of the offence likely to be taken by Scots, Welsh and Irish at this usage, most politicians and official figures have avoided this usage since the early 20th century. However, there are frequent examples of this usage from earlier times.&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;[[England expects that every man will do his duty]] — Horatio Nelson, message to the British Fleet 1805&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="disraeli"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mlincoln"&gt;"The more formal use of 'Great-Britain and Ireland' and colloquial use of 'Old England' and 'old English spirit' in this description is evidence of the process of forging a national identity..." page 99 — {{citation |author=Margarette Lincoln |title=Representing the Royal Navy: British Sea Power, 1750–1815 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=1946 }} {{ISBN|0-7546-0830-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time it was common for fans of the [[England national football team|England football team]] to wave the British [[Union Flag]]—with the use of the specifically English [[St George's Cross]] flag only gaining popularity at the [[UEFA Euro 96|Euro 96]] tournament.&lt;ref name="englandpassport"/&gt;

The colloquial usage of "England" as a synonym for "Britain" is still widespread outside the UK. In [[Germany]], the term "England" is often used to mean Great Britain or even the entire United Kingdom. In many other languages, such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean, the word for "English" is synonymous with "British"—see the article on [[Alternative words for British#Other languages|Alternative words for British]] for more detail.

===Europe===
The term "[[Europe]]" may be used in one of several different contexts by British and Irish people: either to refer to the whole of the European continent, to refer to only to [[Mainland Europe]], sometimes called "continental Europe" or simply "the Continent" by some people in the archipelago. ''Europe'' may also be used in reference to the [[European Union]] (or, historically, to the [[European Economic Community]]). A comedic treatment of the different uses of this word appears in an episode of the BBC sitcom ''[[To the Manor Born]]''. When tradesmen are taking measurements in metric, and Audrey fforbes-Hamilton objects on the grounds that the house was built "in feet and inches", a tradesman says "We're in Europe now", referring to the European Economic Community. Audrey fforbes-Hamilton retorts "Well you may be, but I'm staying here!" - implying that to her, the word "Europe" referred only to mainland Europe, excluding Britain and Ireland.

===Great Britain===

The word "Great" means "larger", in comparison with [[Brittany]] in modern-day [[France]].  One historical term for the [[peninsula]] in France that largely corresponds to the modern French province is ''Lesser'' or ''Little Britain''.  That region was settled by many British immigrants during the period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] migration into Britain, and named "Little Britain" by them. The [[French language|French]] term "Bretagne" now refers to the French "Little Britain", not to the British "Great Britain", which in French is called ''Grande-Bretagne''. In classical times, the [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] geographer [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' also called the larger island ''megale Brettania'' (great Britain). At that time, it was in contrast to the smaller island of [[Ireland]], which he called ''mikra Brettania'' (little Britain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Claudii Ptolemaei Opera quae exstant omnia|author=Claudius Ptolemy|authorlink=Ptolemy|editor1-last=Heiberg|editor1-first=J.L.|publisher=in aedibus B.G.Teubneri|location=Leipzig|date=1898|volume=vol.1 Syntaxis Mathematica|url=http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/HeibergAlmagestComplete.pdf|pages=112–113|chapter=Ἕκθεσις τῶν κατὰ παράλληλον ἰδιωμάτων: κβ', κε'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later work ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', Ptolemy refers to Great Britain as ''Albion'' and to Ireland as ''[[Hibernia|Iwernia]]''. These "new" names were likely to have been the native names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, [[Exonym and endonym|in contrast]], were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'', University of Texas Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===

The word ''Britain'' is ambiguous, being used variously to mean Great Britain,&lt;ref name="Britain-CED"&gt;{{cite web |title=Britain Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/britain |website=dictionary.cambridge.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britain-OLD"&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of Britain in English by Oxford Dictionaries |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/britain |website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britain-Col"&gt;{{cite web |title=Britain definition and meaning |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/britain |website=www.collinsdictionary.com |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="Britain-MW"&gt;{{cite web |title=Britain - Definition for English-Language Learners |url=http://learnersdictionary.com/definition/Britain |website=learnersdictionary.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britain-Col"/&gt; and for some, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Birch |first1=Anthony H. |title=British System of Government |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134670567 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e2WFAgAAQBAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of ''Britain'' can be contentious, with many people in Northern Ireland objecting to its application to their province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alphabetical checklist |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/radio_newsroom/1099593.stm |publisher=BBC |date=19 August 2002 |quote=many people in Northern Ireland object strongly ... to the idea that they live in Britain.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some organisations including the BBC and British Government prefer to use ''Britain'' as shorthand for Great Britain,&lt;ref name="checklist-bbc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alphabetical checklist |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/news-style-guide/article/art20130702112133551 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=2018-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717052327/http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/news-style-guide/article/art20130702112133551 |archive-date=2018-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="style-guide-govuk"&gt;{{cite web |title=A to Z - Style guide |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#B |website=www.gov.uk |publisher=UK Government |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; others prefer, where precision is not required, to use ''Britain'' to mean the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Places and people |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/style-book/places-and-people/ |website=The Telegraph |date=23 January 2018 |quote=The United Kingdom or the abbreviation UK is to be avoided ... unless the story has a specific relevance to Northern Ireland that would make the use of "Britain" or "British" wrong.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Style Guide |url=https://bordeure.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/the-economist-style-guide.pdf |publisher=The Economist |page=38 |date=2005 |quote=favour simplicity over precision and use Britain rather than Great Britain or the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The word ''Ireland'' has two meanings.

# It is the official name of [[Republic of Ireland|the state]] that occupies five sixths of the island, formally named the Republic of Ireland.
# It is a geographical term for [[Ireland|the whole island]], which may be referred to as "the island of Ireland" to avoid ambiguity.

===Ulster===
[[File:IrelandUlster.svg|thumb|right|The traditional province of Ulster on the island of Ireland, showing the modern-day border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland]]

The terminology and usage of the name ''Ulster'' in Irish and British culture varies. Many within the [[unionist (Ireland)|unionist]] community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Glossary of Terms Related to the Conflict|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/glossary.htm#U|website=CAIN Web service|publisher=[[Ulster University]]|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much of the UK press refer to [[Northern Ireland]] as ''Ulster''{{spaced ndash}}whereas the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] community refer to the traditional [[Provinces of Ireland|Irish province]] of [[Ulster]], which is a nine-county entity that incorporates the three counties of [[County Donegal|Donegal]], [[County Cavan|Cavan]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]]  (which are in the Republic) along with the counties of [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Down|Down]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[Tyrone]] in Northern Ireland.

Thus, the word ''Ulster'' has two usages:
# It is the name of [[Ulster|one]] of the four [[Provinces of Ireland]], consisting of the nine northern counties of the island, that was partitioned between the United Kingdom (six counties) and the Republic of Ireland (three counties).
# It is an alternative name for [[Northern Ireland]], used by many in the [[Irish Unionism|Unionist]] community.  It consists of the six north-eastern counties of the island that remain part of the United Kingdom.

===Isle of Man and Channel Islands===
The Isle of Man and the two [[bailiwick]]s of the Channel Islands are [[Crown dependencies]]; that is, non-sovereign [[nation]]s, self-governing but whose sovereignty is held by the British [[The Crown|Crown]]. They control their own internal affairs, but not their defence or foreign relations. They are not part of the United Kingdom or part of the [[European Union]].
*The [[Isle of Man]] is part of the [[British Isles]], situated in the [[Irish Sea]] between Great Britain and Ireland.
*The [[Channel Islands]] consist politically of two self-governing [[bailiwick]]s: the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] and the [[Jersey|Bailiwick of Jersey]]. They are the remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which was once in [[personal union]] with the Kingdom of England. They are sometimes, despite their location next to mainland [[France]], considered part of the British Isles.  This usage is political rather than geographic.
*The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are [[British Islands]] in United Kingdom law.

===Celtic names===
There are five living [[Celtic languages]] in the region. Each has names for the islands and countries of the British Isles. They are divided into two branches:

*[[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] – which includes [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]]
*[[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] – which includes [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]

The English word ''Welsh'' is from a common [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root meaning "Romanised foreigner" ([[cognate]] with [[Wallonia]] and [[Wallachia]], and also cognate with the word used in Mediaeval German to refer to the French and [[Italy|Italian]]s).&lt;ref name="Wales Hist 69"&gt;{{cite book|last =Davies|first=John|authorlink =John Davies (historian)|title = A History of Wales|publisher =Penguin|year =1994|location =London| pages =69|isbn =0-14-014581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English names ''[[Albion]]'' and ''[[Scotland|Albany]]'' are related to ''Alba'' and used poetically for either England or Scotland, or the whole island of Great Britain.

English ''[[Erin]]'' is a poetic name for Ireland derived from ''Éire'' (or rather, from its dative form ''Éirinn'').

===Terms for the British Isles in the Irish language===
In Irish, the term ''Oileáin Bhriotanacha'' is a translation of the English term ''British Isles''. Another translation is ''Oileáin Bhreataineacha'', which was used in the 1937 translation from English to Irish of a 1931 geography book.&lt;ref&gt;''Tír-Eóluíocht na h-Éireann'' (translation by Toirdhealbhach Ó Raithbheartaigh of ''Macmillan's General and Regional Geography of Ireland'' by T. J. Dunne), Government Publications Office, Dublin&lt;blockquote&gt;''Tá Éire ar cheann de na h-oileáin a dtugar na &lt;u&gt;h-Oileáin Bhreataineacha&lt;/u&gt; ortha agus atá ar an taobh Thiar-Thuaidh de'n Eóraip. Tá siad tuairim a's ar chúig mhíle oileán ar fad ann. (Oileánradh an t-ainm a bheirtear ar áit ar bith i n-a bhfuil a lán oileán agus iad i n-aice a chéile mar seo.) Éire agus an Bhreatain Mhór (Sasain, an Bhreatain Bheag, agus Alba) an dá oileán is mó de na h-Oileáin Bhreataineacha.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Ireland is one of the islands which are called the British Isles and which are on the North-Western side of Europe. It is thought that there are five thousand islands in total there. (Archipelago is the name which is borne by a place in which there are many islands next to each other like these.) Ireland and Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland) are the two largest islands of the British Isles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier dictionaries&lt;ref&gt;Patrick S. Dinneen, ''Foclóir Gaeilge Béarla, Irish-English Dictionary'', Dublin, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; give ''Oileáin Iarthair Eorpa'' as the translation, literally meaning ''West European Isles''. Today the most common term ''Éire agus an Bhreatain Mhór'' is used, meaning literally as ''Ireland and Great Britain'', as provided by terminological dictionaries.&lt;ref name=tearma&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=the+British+Isles | title = the British Isles | work = téarma.ie – Dictionary of Irish Terms | publisher = [[Foras na Gaeilge]] and [[Dublin City University]] | accessdate = 18 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slang==
''[[Blighty]]'' is a slang word for Britain derived from the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''bilāyatī'' ("foreign"). Depending on the user, it is meant either affectionately or archly. It was often used by British soldiers abroad in the [[First World War]] to refer to home.

[[File:SovietTheodolite.jpg|thumb|A direct readout  theodolite, manufactured in the Soviet Union in 1958 and used for topographic surveying]]

A '''theodolite''' {{IPAc-en|θ|iː|ˈ|ɒ|d|ə|l|aɪ|t}} is a precision optical instrument for measuring [[angle]]s between designated visible points in the [[horizontal and vertical]] planes. The traditional use has been for [[surveying|land surveying]], but they are also used extensively for [[Construction|building and infrastructure construction]], and some specialized applications such as [[meteorology]] and [[rocket launch]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Double Theodolite Pibal Evaluation by Computer |first=Norman |last=Thyer |date=March 1962 |journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=66–68 |publisher=American Meteorological Society |doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1962)001&lt;0066:DTPEBC&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It consists of a moveable [[telescope]] mounted so it can rotate around horizontal and vertical [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] and provide angular readouts. These indicate the orientation of the telescope, and are used to relate the first point sighted through the telescope to subsequent sightings of other points from the same theodolite position. These angles can be measured with great accuracy, typically to [[milliradian]] or [[Minute and second of arc|seconds of arc]]. From these readings a plan can be drawn, or objects can be positioned in accordance with an existing plan. The modern theodolite has evolved into what is known as a [[total station]] where angles and distances are measured electronically, and are read directly to computer memory.   

In a transit theodolite, the telescope is short enough to rotate through the [[zenith]], otherwise for non-transit instruments vertical (or altitude), rotation is restricted to a limited arc. 

The [[optical level]] is sometimes mistaken for a theodolite, but it does not measure vertical angles, and is used only for [[levelling]] on a [[horizontal plane]].

== Principles of operation ==
[[File:theodolite vermeer.svg|thumb|The axes and circles of a theodolite]]
[[File:Optical Theodolite.jpg|thumb|Diagram of an optical readout theodolite]]
===Preparation for making sightings===
{{main|Temporary adjustments of theodolites}}
Temporary adjustments are a set of operations necessary in order to make a theodolite ready for taking observations at a station. These include its setting up, centering, leveling up and elimination of parallax, and are achieved in four steps:

* Setting up - fixing the theodolite onto a tripod along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. 
* Centering - bringing the vertical axis of theodolite immediately over station mark using a centering plate also known as a [[tribrach (instrument)|tribrach]].
* Levelling - leveling of the base of the instrument to make the vertical axis vertical usually with an in-built bubble-level.
* Focusing - removing [[parallax]] error by proper focusing of objective and eye-piece. The eye-piece only requires adjustment once at a station. The objective will be re-focused for each subsequent sightings from this station because of the different distances to the target.

===Sightings===
Sightings are taken by the surveyor, who adjusts the telescope's vertical and horizontal angular orientation so the [[cross-hairs]] align with the desired sighting point. Both angles are read either from exposed or internal scales and recorded. The next object is then sighted and recorded without moving the position of the instrument and tripod.

The earliest angular readouts were from open [[vernier scale]]s directly visible to the eye. Gradually these scales were enclosed for physical protection, and finally became an indirect optical readout, with convoluted light paths to bring them to a convenient place on the instrument for viewing. The modern digital theodolites have electronic displays.

=== Errors in measurement ===
'''Index error -''' The angles in the vertical axis should read 90[[degree (angle)|°]] (100 [[grad (angle)|grad]]) when the sight axis is horizontal, or 270° (300 grad) when the instrument is transited. Half of the difference between the two positions is called the "index error". This can only be checked on transit instruments.

'''Horizontal axis error''' - The horizontal and vertical axes of a theodolite must be perpendicular; if not then a "horizontal axis error" exists. This can be tested by aligning the tubular spirit bubble parallel to a line between two footscrews and setting the bubble central. A horizontal axis error is present if the bubble runs off central when the tubular spirit bubble is reversed (turned through 180°). To adjust, the operator removes 1/2 the amount the bubble has run off using the adjusting screw, then re-level, test and refine the adjustment.

'''Collimation error -''' The optical axis of the telescope, must also be perpendicular to the horizontal axis. If not, then a "collimation error" exists.

Index error, horizontal-axis error ('trunnion-axis error') and collimation error are regularly determined by [[calibration]] and are removed by mechanical adjustment. Their existence is taken into account in the choice of measurement procedure in order to eliminate their effect on the measurement results of the theodolite.

== {{anchor|Half|Simple|Plain}}History ==
[[File:Universaltheodolit.14Zoll.Pistor&amp;Martins.Berlin.1851.jpg|thumb|A theodolite of 1851, showing the open construction, and the altitude and azimuth scales which are read directly.]]
[[Image:Sectioned_theodolite.jpg|thumb|Sectioned theodolite showing the complex light paths for optical readout, and the enclosed construction.]]

The term ''diopter'' was sometimes used in old texts as a synonym for theodolite.&lt;ref&gt;''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, 1971 - see entry for ''diopter''&lt;/ref&gt; This derives from an older astronomical instrument called a [[dioptra]].

Prior to the theodolite, instruments such as the [[Groma surveying|groma]], [[geometric square]] and various other graduated circles (see [[circumferentor]]) and semicircles (see [[graphometer]]) were used to obtain either vertical or horizontal angle measurements. It was only a matter of time before someone put two measuring devices into a single instrument that could measure both angles simultaneously. [[Gregorius Reisch]] showed such an instrument in the appendix of his book ''Margarita Philosophica'', which he published in [[Strasbourg|Strasburg]] in 1512.&lt;ref name="daumas"&gt;Daumas, Maurice, ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989 {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described in the appendix by [[Martin Waldseemüller]], a German [[topographer]] and [[cartographer]], who made the device in the same year.&lt;ref name="geomaticaonline"/&gt; Waldseemüller called his instrument the ''polimetrum''.&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;Mills, John FitzMaurice, ''Encyclopedia of Antique Scientific Instruments'', Aurum Press, London, 1983, {{ISBN|0-906053-40-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occurrence of the word "theodolite" is found in the [[surveying]] textbook ''A geometric practice named Pantometria'' (1571) by [[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]], which was published posthumously by his son, Thomas Digges.&lt;ref name="daumas"/&gt; The [[etymology]] of the word is unknown. The first part of the [[New Latin]] ''theo-delitus'' might stem from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:θεάομαι|θεᾶσθαι]]'', "to behold or look attentively upon"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchgodsword.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=2300 Theaomai - Greek Lexicon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[wikt:θέω|θεῖν]]'' "to run",&lt;ref name="Wordnik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordnik.com/words/theodolite/etymologies|title=Wordnik|work=Wordnik.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402191341/https://www.wordnik.com/words/theodolite/etymologies|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the second part is more puzzling and is often attributed to an unscholarly variation of one of the following Greek words: ''[[wikt:δῆλος|δῆλος]]'', meaning "evident" or "clear",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001935.php|title=languagehat.com :   THEODOLITE.|work=languagehat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takeourword.com/Issue016.html|title=Take Our Word For It Issue 16|work=takeourword.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[wikt:δολιχός|δολιχός]]'' "long", or ''[[wikt:δοῦλος|δοῦλος]]'' "slave", or an unattested Neolatin compound combining ''[[wikt:ὁδός|ὁδός]]'' "way" and ''[[wikt:λιτός|λιτός]]'' "plain".&lt;ref name="Wordnik"/&gt; It has been also suggested that ''-delitus'' is a variation of the Latin [[supine]] ''[[wikt:deletus|deletus]]'', in the sense of "crossed out".&lt;ref name="Wordnik"/&gt;

There is some confusion about the instrument to which the name was originally applied. Some identify the early theodolite as an [[azimuth]] instrument only, while others specify it as an [[altazimuth mount|altazimuth]] instrument. In Digges's book, the name "theodolite" described an instrument for measuring horizontal angles only. He also described an instrument that measured both altitude and azimuth, which he called a ''topographicall instrument'' {{sic}}.&lt;ref name="turnerEIM"&gt;Turner, Gerard L'E., ''Elizabethan Instrument Makers: The Origins of the London Trade in Precision Instrument Making'', Oxford University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-19-856566-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the name originally applied only to the azimuth instrument and only later became associated with the altazimuth instrument. The 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' compares "[[graphometer]]" to "half-theodolite".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', vol. 2 p. 50 for "Semi-Circle"&lt;/ref&gt; Even as late as the 19th century, the instrument for measuring horizontal angles only was called a ''simple theodolite'' and the altazimuth instrument, the ''plain theodolite''.&lt;ref name="turner"/&gt;

The first instrument more like a true theodolite was likely the one built by [[Joshua Habermel]] ([[Erasmus Habermehl]]) in Germany in 1576, complete with compass and tripod.&lt;ref name="geomaticaonline"&gt;[http://www.geomatica.it/strumenti_antichi/estratto.htm Geomatica Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113052943/http://geomatica.it/strumenti_antichi/estratto.htm |date=2007-11-13 }} Colombo, Luigi, Selvini, Attilio, ''Sintesi di una storia degli strumenti per la misura topografica''&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest altazimuth instruments consisted of a base graduated with a full circle at the [[wikt:limb#Etymology 2|limb]] and a vertical angle measuring device, most often a semicircle. An [[alidade]] on the base was used to sight an object for horizontal angle measurement, and a second alidade was mounted on the vertical semicircle. Later instruments had a single alidade on the vertical semicircle and the entire semicircle was mounted so as to be used to indicate horizontal angles directly. Eventually, the simple, open-sight alidade was replaced with a sighting [[telescope]]. This was first done by [[Jonathan Sisson]] in 1725.&lt;ref name="turner"/&gt;

The theodolite became a modern, accurate instrument in 1787, with the introduction of [[Jesse Ramsden]]'s famous [[Ramsden theodolite|great theodolite]], which he created using a very accurate [[dividing engine]] of his own design.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, Gerard L'E. ''Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments'', Sotheby Publications, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85667-170-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand could not be met by foreign theodolites owing to their inadequate precision, hence all instruments meeting high precision requirements were made in England. Despite the many German instrument builders at the turn of the century, there were no usable German theodolites available. A transition was brought about by Breithaupt and the symbiosis of Utzschneider, Reichenbach and Fraunhofer.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Kern: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit/Band 4: Perfektion von Optik und Mechanik. Cologne, 2010, pp. 349–360.&lt;/ref&gt;
As technology progressed, in the 1840s, the vertical partial circle was replaced with a full circle, and both vertical and horizontal circles were finely graduated. This was the ''transit theodolite''. Theodolites were later adapted to a wider variety of mountings and uses. In the 1870s, an interesting waterborne version of the theodolite (using a pendulum device to counteract wave movement) was invented by [[Edward Samuel Ritchie]].&lt;ref&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences, ''Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'', Vol. XXIII, May 1895 - May 1896, Boston: University Press, John Wilson and Son (1896), pp. 359–360&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by the U.S. Navy to take the first precision surveys of American harbors on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.&lt;ref&gt;American Academy, pp. 359–360&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early part of the 20th century, [[Heinrich Wild]] produced theodolites that became popular with surveyors. His Wild T2, T3, and A1 instruments were made for many years, and he would go on to develop the DK1, DKM1, DM2, DKM2, and DKM3 for Kern Aarau company. With continuing refinements, instruments steadily evolved into the modern theodolite used by surveyors today.

=== Operation in surveying ===
{{main|Triangulation (surveying)}}
[[Image:theb1982.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]] technicians observing with a 0.2 [[arcsecond]] (≈ 0.001 [[Milliradian|mrad]] or 1 µrad) resolution Wild T3 theodolite mounted on an observing stand. Photo was taken during an Arctic field party (c. 1950).]]

[[Triangulation (surveying)|Triangulation]], as invented by [[Gemma Frisius]] around 1533, consists of making such direction plots of the surrounding landscape from two separate standpoints. The two graphing papers are superimposed, providing a scale model of the landscape, or rather the targets in it. The true scale can be obtained by measuring one distance both in the real terrain and in the graphical representation.

Modern triangulation as, e.g., practised by [[Willebrord Snell|Snellius]], is the same procedure executed by numerical means. Photogrammetric block adjustment of stereo pairs of aerial photographs is a modern, three-dimensional variant.

In the late 1780s, [[Jesse Ramsden]], a Yorkshireman from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], England who had developed the [[dividing engine]] for dividing angular scales accurately to within a second of arc (≈ 0.0048 [[Milliradian|mrad]] or 4.8 µrad), was commissioned to build a new instrument for the British [[Ordnance Survey]]. The [[Ramsden theodolite]] was used over the next few years to map the whole of southern [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by triangulation.

In network measurement, the use of forced centering speeds up operations while maintaining the highest precision. The theodolite or the target can be rapidly removed from, or socketed into, the forced centering plate with sub-millimeter precision. Nowadays [[GPS]] antennas used for [[geodetic positioning]] use a similar mounting system. The height of the reference point of the theodolite—or the target—above the ground [[benchmark (surveying)|benchmark]] must be measured precisely.

===Transit theodolite===
The term '''transit theodolite''', or '''transit''' for short, refers to a type of theodolite that was developed in the early 19th century. It was popular with American railroad engineers pushing west, and it replaced the [[railroad compass]], [[sextant]] and [[Octant (instrument)|octant]]. It features a vertical circle which is graduated through the full 360 degrees and a telescope that could "flip over" ("transit the scope").  By reversing the telescope and at the same time rotating the instrument through 180 degrees about the vertical axis, the instrument can be used in 'plate-left' or 'plate-right' modes ('plate' refers to the vertical protractor circle).  By measuring the same horizontal and vertical angles in these two modes and then averaging the results, centering and collimating errors in the instrument can be eliminated. Some transit instruments are capable of reading angles directly to thirty arc-seconds (≈ 0.15 [[Milliradian|mrad]]). Modern theodolites are usually of the transit-theodolite design, but engraved plates have been replaced with glass plates designed to be read with [[light-emitting diodes]] and computer circuitry, greatly improving accuracy.

== {{anchor|Pibal}}Use with weather balloons ==
There is a long history of theodolite use in measuring winds aloft, by using specially-manufactured theodolites to track the horizontal and vertical angles of special weather balloons called ''[[ceiling balloon]]s'' or ''pilot balloons'' (''pibal''). Early attempts at this were made in the opening years of the nineteenth century, but the instruments and procedures weren't fully developed until a hundred years later. This method was extensively used in World War II and thereafter, and was gradually replaced by radio and GPS measuring systems from the 1980s onward.

The pibal theodolite uses a prism to bend the optical path by 90 degrees so the operator's eye position does not change as the elevation is changed through a complete 180 degrees. The theodolite is typically mounted on a rugged steel stand, set up so it is level and pointed north, with the altitude and azimuth scales reading zero degrees. A balloon is released in front of the theodolite, and its position is precisely tracked, usually once a minute. The balloons are carefully constructed and filled, so their rate of ascent can be known fairly accurately in advance. Mathematical calculations on time, rate of ascent, azimuth and angular altitude can produce good estimates of wind speed and direction at various altitudes.&lt;ref name="Brenner"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csulb.edu/~mbrenner/balloon.htm |title=Pilot Weather Balloon (Pibal) Optical Theodolites |last=Brenner |first=Martin |work=Martin Brenner's Pilot Balloon Resources |publisher=California State University, Long Beach |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Electronic}}Modern electronic theodolites ==
[[Image:Teodolit nikon 520.jpg|thumb|150px|A typical modern electronic theodolite: [[Nikon]] DTM-520]]
In modern electronic theodolites, the readout of the horizontal and vertical circles is usually done with a [[rotary encoder]]. These produce signals indicating the altitude and azimuth of the telescope which are fed to a microprocessor. [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] sensors have been added to the [[focal plane]] of the [[telescope]] allowing both auto-targeting and the automated measurement of residual target offset. All this is implemented in embedded software of the processor.

Many modern theodolites are equipped with integrated electro-optical distance measuring devices, generally [[infrared]] based, allowing the measurement in one step of complete three-dimensional [[vector (geometry)|vector]]s—albeit in instrument-defined polar co-ordinates, which can then be transformed to a pre-existing co-ordinate system in the area by means of a sufficient number of [[control point (surveying)|control point]]s. This technique is called a [[resection (orientation)|resection]] solution or [[free station position surveying]] and is widely used in mapping surveying.

Such instruments are "intelligent" theodolites called self-registering [[Tacheometry|tacheometers]] or colloquially "[[total station]]s", and perform all the necessary angular and distance calculations, and the results or raw data can be downloaded to external processors, such as ruggedized [[laptops]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s or [[programmable calculator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The End of An Era - On the genesis, life and death of the HP 48 | first=Joseph V. | last=Paiva | date=2004-10-01 | website=Point of Beginning (PoB) | publisher=BNP Media | url=http://www.pobonline.com/articles/85345-the-end-of-an-era | accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gyrotheodolites ==
{{Main|gyrotheodolite}}
A '''gyrotheodolite''' is used when the north-south reference bearing of the meridian is required in the absence of astronomical star sights. This occurs mainly in the underground mining industry and in tunnel engineering. For example, where a conduit must pass under a river, a vertical shaft on each side of the river might be connected by a horizontal tunnel. A gyrotheodolite can be operated at the surface and then again at the foot of the shafts to identify the directions needed to tunnel between the base of the two shafts. Unlike an artificial horizon or inertial navigation system, a gyrotheodolite cannot be relocated while it is operating. It must be restarted again at each site.

The gyrotheodolite comprises a normal theodolite with an attachment that contains a gyroscope mounted so as to sense rotation of the Earth and from that the alignment of the meridian. The meridian is the plane that contains both the axis of the Earth's rotation and the observer. The intersection of the meridian plane with the horizontal contains the true north-south geographic reference bearing required. The gyrotheodolite is usually referred to as being able to determine or find true north.

A gyrotheodolite will function at the equator and in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The meridian is undefined at the geographic poles. A gyrotheodolite cannot be used at the poles where the Earth's axis is precisely perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the spinner, indeed it is not normally used within about 15 degrees of the pole because the east-west component of the Earth's rotation is insufficient to obtain reliable results. When available, astronomical star sights are able to give the meridian bearing to better than one hundred times the accuracy of the gyrotheodolite. Where this extra precision is not required, the gyrotheodolite is able to produce a result quickly without the need for night observations.

'''UN/LOCODE''', the '''United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations''', is a [[geocode|geographic coding scheme]] developed and maintained by [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE). UN/LOCODE assigns codes to locations used in [[trade]] and [[transport]] with functions such as [[port|seaports]], [[rail terminal|rail]] and road terminals, [[airport]]s, Postal Exchange Office and [[border crossing point]]s. The first issue in 1981 contained codes for 8,000 locations. The version from 2011 contained codes for about 82,000 locations.&lt;ref name="Note 2011-1" /&gt;

==Structure==
UN/LOCODEs have five characters. The first two letters code a country by the table defined in [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]. The three remaining characters code a location within that country. Letters are preferred, but if necessary digits 2 through 9 may be used, excluding "0" and "1" to avoid confusion with the letters "O" and "I" respectively.

For each country there can be a maximum of 17,576 entries using only letters (26×26×26), or 39,304 entries using letters and digits (34×34×34).

For the US, the letter combinations have almost all been exhausted. So in 2006, the Secretariat added 646 entries with a digit as the last character.

==Loose consistency with existing IATA airport codes==
For airports, the three letters following the [[country code]] are not always identical to the [[IATA airport code]]. According to the Secretariat note for Issue 2006-2, there are 720 locations showing a different IATA code.&lt;ref name="Note 2006-2" /&gt;

==Official UN/LOCODE tables==
UN/LOCODEs are released as a table. An individual revision is officially referred to as an "issue". A discussion of the table's structure follows.

;Explanations:

* &lt;tt&gt;US NYC&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for New York City in the United States. Subdivision is the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] (see [[ISO 3166-2:US]]). Function: port, rail, road, airport, postal. IATA code is NYC. Coordinates: {{coord|40|42|N|074|00|W}}.
*&lt;tt&gt;DE BER&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for Berlin (city) in Germany. Subdivision is the [[German state]] of Berlin (see [[ISO 3166-2:DE]]). Function: port, rail, road, airport, postal. IATA code is BER. Coordinates: {{coord|52|31|N|013|23|E}}.
*&lt;tt&gt;DE TXL&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for [[Berlin-Tegel International Airport|Berlin-Tegel Airport]] in Germany. Function: airport. IATA code is TXL.
*&lt;tt&gt;FR PAR&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for Paris (city) in France. Subdivision is the [[French department]] of Paris (see [[ISO 3166-2:FR]]). Function: port, rail, road, postal.
*&lt;tt&gt;GB PAR&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for [[Par, Cornwall|Par]] in United Kingdom. Subdivision is the [[English county]] of [[Cornwall]] (see [[ISO 3166-2:GB]]). Function: port.
*&lt;tt&gt;SE GOT&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for [[Göteborg]] (Goteborg without diacritics) in Sweden. Subdivision is the [[Swedish county]] of [[Västra Götaland]] (see [[ISO 3166-2:SE]]). Function: port, airport, postal. The IATA code of XWL indicated in the table is that of a train station in the city centre of [[Göteborg]] (though not the Central Station), while the IATA code for the main airport ([[Göteborg Landvetter Airport]]) is actually GOT. It also has a separate reference entry showing an alternate spelling of ''Gothenburg''.

===Data fields===
The fields are listed in the official order.

====Ch (Changes)====
:A change from the previous issue is indicated by one of the following characters in the first column:&lt;ref name="Note 2006-2" /&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Marked for deletion in the next issue
: &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Change in location name (usually spelling)
: &lt;tt&gt;¦&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Other changes in the entry (not location)
: &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Entry added to the current issue
: &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Reference entry
: &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Retained for certain entries in the USA code list ("controlled duplications")

====Locode====
:The code is represented with a space between the alpha-2 codes of ISO 3166-1 country code and the 3-character element.

====Name====
:Names of locations should be shown using the 26 letters of the Roman alphabet with, where appropriate, diacritic signs as contained in ISO 10646-1/1993 or ISO 8859-1/1987.

====Name Without Diacritics====
:The name of the location, but non-practicable Diacritics may be ignored and should not be converted into additional characters(e.g., Göteborg may be read as Goteborg,  rather than Goeteborg, Gothenburg, Gotembourg, etc.).
:Can contain an apostrophe, e.g. [[L'viv]]

====SubDiv (Subdivision)====
:The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 1 to 3 character alphabetic and/or numeric code for the administrative division (state, province, department, etc.) of the country, as included in [[ISO 3166-2]]/1998. Only the latter part of the complete ISO 3166-2 code element (after the hyphen) is shown.

====Function====
:Each defined function gets a classifier; the most important are:
:* 1 = port (for any kind of waterborne transport)
:* 2 = rail terminal
:* 3 = road terminal
:* 4 = airport
:* 5 = postal exchange office
:* 6 = Inland Clearance Depot – ICD or "Dry Port", "Inland Clearance Terminal", etc.
:* 7 = fixed transport functions (e.g. oil platform)"; the classifier "7" is reserved for this function. Noting that the description "oil pipeline terminal" would be more relevant, and could be extended to cover also electric power lines and [[ropeway]] terminals.
:* B = Border crossing function
:* 0 = function not known, to be specified

====Status====
:Indicates the status of the entry by a 2-character code. The following codes are used at present:
:*AA: Approved by competent national government agency
:*AC: Approved by Customs Authority
:*AF: Approved by national facilitation body
:*AI: Code adopted by international organisation (IATA or ECLAC)
:*AM: Approved by the UN/LOCODE Maintenance Agency
:*AQ: Entry approved, functions not verified 
:*AS: Approved by national standardisation body
:*RL: Recognised location - Existence and representation of location name confirmed by check against nominated gazetteer or other reference work
:*RN: Request from credible national sources for locations in their own country
:*RQ: Request under consideration
:*UR: Entry included on user's request; not officially approved 
:*RR: Request rejected
:*QQ: Original entry not verified since date indicated
:*XX: Entry that will be removed from the next issue of UN/LOCODE

====Date====
:The date the location was added or updated: 0207 is July 2002, 9501 is January 1995, etc.
:Note that the edition published in 2008 uses the value 0701 for additions, while in other cases the exact month is used like 9710, 0212.

====IATA====
:For correlation purposes, the [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA code]] for the location is marked if different from the second part of the UN/LOCODE.

====Coordinates====
:Some entries have coordinates in the database. They are represented as: ddmmN dddmmW, ddmmS dddmmE, etc.

====Remarks====
:The remarks column can among other things contain a hint to what specifically was changed (See data field - "Change").

==Availability==
Availability
UN/LOCODE is available on the [http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/welcome.html UNECE website], where the latest release of UNLOCOD directories and background documents are listed. Complete UN/LOCODE code list may be downloaded in the format of.mdb (MS Access database), .txt (text file) and .csv (Comma-separated values). HTML pages are also displayed on the website by countries.

==Data Maintenance Requests==
UN/LOCODE Data Maintenance Request system is web-based (http://apps.unece.org/unlocode/), which enables registered users to submit online requests for new UN/LOCODE entry modifications.

The system provides online functions for 
:*Registration of users and password retrieval 
:*Submission of requests for new UN/LOCODE entries 
:*Submission of requests for modification changes in existing UN/LOCODE entries 
:*A guide to explain the use of the system

==Errors==
In 2006-07 &lt;tt&gt;IQ IRB&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Irbil]] was added while &lt;tt&gt;IQ ABL&lt;/tt&gt; [[Arbil]] with almost the same coordinates existed. In the 2007 edition &lt;tt&gt;IQ ABL&lt;/tt&gt; gets marked for deletion and &lt;tt&gt;IQ EBL&lt;/tt&gt; [[Erbil International Apt]] is added to the database, but with a different coordinates, reflecting the distance between airport and city. The error is to delete ABL and to insert IRB.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}}

Occasionally locations are listed twice; this is not necessarily an error. In issue 2006-1, &lt;tt&gt;ARSMC &lt;/tt&gt; [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] (functions 2,3) was added while &lt;tt&gt;ARTUC &lt;/tt&gt; Tucumán (function 1) already was in the list. The coordinates are with very little deviation the same. Also in 2006-1, &lt;tt&gt;ARSSJ &lt;/tt&gt; [[San Salvador de Jujuy]] was added (function 4) while &lt;tt&gt;ARJUJ &lt;/tt&gt; Jujuy (functions 1,2,3,5) already existed.

=== 2009-1 ===
The 2009-1 release added several entries for Ukraine where the longitude is off by a few orders of magnitude. Ranging from 23230E to 38829E, they are outside what would constitute an eastern [[longitude]]. [[Ivano Frankovsk]] and [[Chuguyev]] have two entries now, along with Nikolayev. For all three, the [[Romanization|romanized]] spelling varies.

==Problems==
Some entries do not have coordinates, so it is not clear where they actually refer to. If an IATA code changes, then the UN/LOCODE could also be considered to have changed.

'''Urban design''' is the process of designing and shaping the physical features of cities, towns and villages and planning for the provision of municipal services to residents and visitors. In contrast to architecture, which focuses on the design of individual buildings, urban design deals with the larger scale of groups of buildings, streets and public spaces, whole neighborhoods and districts, and entire cities, with the goal of making urban areas functional, attractive, and sustainable.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/49f234rd|author=Boeing|title=LEED-ND and Livability Revisited|journal=Berkeley Planning Journal|date=2014|volume=27|pages=31–55|accessdate=2015-04-15|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban design is an inter-disciplinary field that utilizes elements of many built environment professions, including [[landscape architecture]], [[urban planning]], [[architecture]], [[civil engineering]] and [[municipal engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). [http://plt.sagepub.com/content/12/2/177.short Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems]. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for professionals in all these disciplines to practice urban design. In more recent times different sub-subfields of urban design have emerged such as strategic urban design, [[landscape urbanism]], [[water-sensitive urban design]], and [[sustainable urbanism]].

Urban design demands an understanding of a wide range of subjects from physical geography to social science, and an appreciation for disciplines, such as [[real estate development]], [[urban economics]], [[political economy]] and [[social theory]].

Urban design is about making connections between people and places, movement and urban form, nature and the built fabric. Urban design draws together the many strands of place-making, environmental stewardship, social equity and economic viability into the creation of places with distinct beauty and identity. Urban design draws these and other strands together creating a vision for an area and then deploying the resources and skills needed to bring the vision to life.

Urban design theory deals primarily with the design and management of [[public space]] (i.e. the 'public environment', 'public realm' or 'public domain'), and the way public places are experienced and used.  Public space includes the totality of spaces used freely on a day-to-day basis by the general public, such as streets, plazas, parks and public infrastructure.  Some aspects of privately owned spaces, such as building facades or domestic gardens, also contribute to public space and are therefore also considered by urban design theory. Important writers on urban design theory include [[Christopher Alexander]], [[Peter Calthorpe]], [[Gordon Cullen]], [[Andres Duany]], [[Jane Jacobs]], [[Mitchell Joachim]], [[Jan Gehl]], [[Allan Jacobs|Allan B. Jacobs]], [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]], [[Aldo Rossi]], [[Colin Rowe]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[William H. Whyte]], [[Camillo Sitte]], Bill Hillier ([[Space syntax]]) and [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]].

==History==

Although contemporary professional use of the term 'urban design' dates from the mid-20th century, urban design as such has been practiced throughout history. Ancient examples of carefully planned and designed [[cities]] exist in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas, and are particularly well known within Classical Chinese, Roman and Greek cultures (see [[Hippodamus of Miletus]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

European Medieval cities are often, and often erroneously, regarded as exemplars of undesigned or 'organic' city development.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} There are many examples of considered urban design in the Middle Ages (see, e.g., David Friedman, ''Florentine New Towns: Urban Design in the Late Middle Ages'', MIT 1988).  In England, many of the towns listed in the 9th century [[Burghal Hidage]] were designed on a grid, examples including [[Southampton]], [[Wareham, Dorset]] and [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire]], having been rapidly created to provide a defensive network against Danish invaders.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} 12th century western Europe brought renewed focus on urbanisation as a means of stimulating economic growth and generating revenue.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The [[burgage]] system dating from that time and its associated burgage plots brought a form of self-organising design to medieval towns.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  Rectangular grids were used in the [[Bastides]] of 13th and 14th century Gascony, and the new towns of England created in the same period.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Throughout history, design of [[street]]s and deliberate configuration of [[public spaces]] with [[buildings]] have reflected contemporaneous social norms or philosophical and religious beliefs (see, e.g., [[Erwin Panofsky]], ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism'', Meridian Books, 1957). Yet the link between designed urban space and human mind appears to be [[wikt:bidirectional|bidirectional]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Indeed, the reverse impact of [[urban structure]] upon human behaviour and upon thought is evidenced by both [[environmental psychology|observational]] study and historical record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} There are clear indications of impact through [[Renaissance]] urban design on the thought of [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] (see, e.g., Abraham Akkerman, "Urban planning in the founding of Cartesian thought," ''Philosophy and Geography'' 4(1), 1973). Already [[René Descartes]] in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' had attested to the impact Renaissance planned new towns had upon his own thought, and much evidence exists that the Renaissance streetscape was also the perceptual stimulus that had led to the development of coordinate geometry (see, e.g., Claudia Lacour Brodsky, ''Lines of Thought: Discourse, Architectonics, and the Origins of Modern Philosophy'', Duke 1996).

The beginnings of modern urban design in Europe are associated with the [[Renaissance]] but, especially, with the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Spanish colonial cities were often planned, as were some towns settled by other imperial cultures.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} These sometimes embodied utopian ambitions as well as aims for functionality and good governance, as with [[James Oglethorpe]]'s plan for [[Savannah, Georgia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In the [[Baroque]] period the design approaches developed in French formal gardens such as [[Gardens of Versailles|Versailles]] were extended into urban development and redevelopment. In this period, when modern professional specialisations did not exist, urban design was undertaken by people with skills in areas as diverse as [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[garden design]], [[surveying]], [[astronomy]], and [[military engineering]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries, urban design was perhaps most closely linked with surveyors (engineers) and architects. The increase in urban populations brought with it problems of epidemic disease,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} the response to which was a focus on public health, the rise in the UK of [[municipal engineering]] and the inclusion in British legislation of provisions such as minimum widths of street in relation to heights of buildings in order to ensure adequate light and [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Much of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frederick Law Olmsted|url=http://www.fredericklawolmsted.com|publisher=fredericklawolmsted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; work was concerned with urban design, and the newly formed profession of landscape architecture also began to play a significant role in the late 19th century.

===Modern urban design===

[[Urban planning]] focuses on public health and urban design. Within the discipline, modern urban design developed.

At the turn of the 20th century, planning and architecture underwent a paradigm shift because of societal pressures. During this time, cities were industrializing at a tremendous rate; private business largely dictated the pace and style of this development. The expansion created many hardships for the [[working poor]] and concern for health and safety increased. However, the [[laissez-faire]] style of government, in fashion for most of the [[Victorian era]], was starting to give way to a [[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]]. This gave more power to the public. The public wanted the government to provide citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments. Around 1900, modern urban design emerged from developing theories on how to mitigate the consequences of the [[industrial age]].

The first modern urban planning theorist was Sir [[Ebenezer Howard]]. His ideas, although utopian, were adopted around the world because they were highly practical. He initiated the garden city movement in 1898 [[garden city movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Urban_and_Regional_Planning.html?id=LFLydtcQf54C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Urban and Regional Planning|author=Peter Hall, Mark Tewdwr-Jones|year=2010|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His garden cities were intended to be planned, self-contained communities surrounded by parks. Howard wanted the cities to be proportional with separate areas of residences, industry, and agriculture. Inspired by the [[Utopian]] novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' and [[Henry George]]'s work ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', Howard published his book ''[[Garden Cities of To-morrow]]'' in 1898. His work is an important reference in the history of urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rudi.net/node/6597|title=To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; He envisioned the self-sufficient garden city to house 32,000 people on a site {{convert|6000|acres|0|abbr=on}}. He planned on a [[concentric]] pattern with open spaces, public parks, and six radial [[boulevard]]s, {{convert|120|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, extending from the center. When it reached full population, Howard wanted another garden city to be developed nearby. He envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as [[satellite town|satellites]] of a central city of 50,000 people, linked by road and rail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Goodall | first = B | year = 1987 | title = Dictionary of Human Geography | place = London | publisher = Penguin}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His model for a garden city was first created at [[Letchworth]]{{Sfn | Hardy | 1999 | p = 4}} and [[Welwyn Garden City]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. Howard's movement was extended by [[Frederic Osborn|Sir Frederic Osborn]] to regional planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.tcpa.org.uk/data/files/18991999.pdf | title = History 1899–1999 | publisher = TCPA | format = [[PDF]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727123822/http://www.tcpa.org.uk/data/files/18991999.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-27 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, urban planning became professionalized. With input from [[utopia]]n visionaries, civil engineers, and [[local government|local councilors]], new approaches to city design were developed for consideration by decision makers such as elected officials. In 1899, the [[Town and Country Planning Association]] was founded. In 1909, the first academic course on urban planning was offered by the [[University of Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/619445/urban-planning|title=urban planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planning was first officially embodied in the [[Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1909|Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909]] Howard's ‘garden city’ compelled local authorities to introduce a system where all housing construction conformed to specific building standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/towncountry/towns/overview/townplanning/|title=The birth of town planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom following this Act, [[surveying|surveyor]], [[civil engineer]]s, [[architect]]s, and [[lawyer]]s began working together within [[municipal government|local authorities]].
In 1910, [[Thomas Adams (architect)|Thomas Adams]] became the first Town Planning Inspector at the [[Local Government Board]] and began meeting with practitioners. In 1914, The [[Town Planning Institute]] was established. The first urban planning course in America wasn’t established until 1924 at [[Harvard University]]. Professionals developed schemes for the development of land, transforming town planning into a new area of expertise.

In the 20th century, urban planning was forever changed by the [[automobile]] industry. Car oriented design impacted the rise of ‘urban design’. City layouts now had to revolve around roadways and traffic patterns.
In 1956, 'Urban design' was first used at a series of conferences [[Harvard University]]. The event provided a platform for Harvard's Urban Design program. The program also utilized the writings of famous urban planning thinkers: [[Gordon Cullen]], [[Jane Jacobs]], [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]],  and [[Christopher Alexander]].

In 1961, [[Gordon Cullen]] published ''The Concise Townscape''. He examined the traditional artistic approach to city design of theorists including Camillo Sitte, Barry Parker and [[Raymond Unwin]]. Cullen also created the concept of 'serial vision'. It defined the urban landscape as a series of related spaces.

In 1961, [[Jane Jacobs]] published ' ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''. She critiqued the [[Modernism]] of [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]] (International Congresses of Modern Architecture). Jacobs also [[crime rate]]s in publicly owned spaces were rising because of the Modernist approach of ‘city in the park’. She argued instead for an 'eyes on the street' approach to town planning through the resurrection of main public space precedents (e.g. streets, squares).

In the same year, [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] published ''The Image of the City''. He was seminal to urban design, particularly with regards to the concept of legibility. He reduced urban design theory to five basic elements: paths, districts, edges, nodes, landmarks. He also made the use of mental maps to understanding the city popular, rather than the two-dimensional physical master plans of the previous 50 years.

Other notable works:

''Architecture of the City'' by [[Aldo Rossi|Rossi]] (1966)

''Learning from Las Vegas'' by [[Robert Venturi|Venturi]] (1972)

''Collage City'' by [[Colin Rowe]](1978)

''The Next American Metropolis'' by [[Peter Calthorpe]](1993)

''The Social Logic of Space'' by Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson (1984)

The popularity of these works resulted in terms that become everyday language in the field of urban planning. Aldo Rossi introduced 'historicism' and 'collective memory' to urban design. Rossi also proposed a 'collage metaphor' to understand the collection of new and old forms within the same urban space. Peter Calthorpe developed a manifesto for sustainable urban living via medium density living. He also designed a manual for building new settlements in his concept of [[Transit-oriented development|Transit Oriented Development]] (TOD). Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson introduced [[Space Syntax]] to predict how movement patterns in cities would contribute to urban vitality, anti-social behaviour and economic success. 'Sustainability', 'livability', and 'high quality of urban components' also became commonplace in the field.

Urban design seeks to create [[sustainable city|sustainable urban]] environments with long-lasting structures, buildings and overall livability. [[Walkability|Walkable]] urbanism is another approach to practice that is defined within the ''Charter of [[New Urbanism]]''. It aims to reduce environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create smart cities that support [[sustainable transport]].&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt; Compact urban neighborhoods encourage residents to drive less. These neighborhoods have significantly lower environmental impacts when compared to [[urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, R [http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html "Growing Cooler - the Evidence on Urban Development and Climate Change"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |date=2010-12-24 }}. Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent urban sprawl, [[Circular flow land use management]] was introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns.

As a result of the recent [[New Classical Architecture]] movement, [[sustainable architecture|sustainable construction]] aims to develop [[smart growth]], walkability, [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]], and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contrasts from [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture.

[[Urban planner]]s frequently act as urban designers when preparing design guidelines, regulatory frameworks, legislation, and advertising. Urban planners also work in urban design with [[architects]], [[landscape architects]], [[transportation engineers]] and [[industrial designers]]. They must also deal with ‘[[place management]]’ to guide and assist the use and maintenance of urban areas and public spaces. Public agencies, authorities, and the interests of nearby property owners manage public spaces. Users often compete over the spaces and negotiate across a variety of spheres. Input is frequently needed from a wide range of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s.

While there are some professionals who identify themselves specifically as urban designers, a majority have backgrounds in [[urban planning]], [[architecture]], or [[landscape architecture]]. Many collegiate programs incorporate urban design theory and design subjects into their curricula. There are an increasing number of university programs offering degrees in urban design at the post-graduate level.

Urban design considers:
* [[Pedestrian zones]]
* [[Incorporation of nature within a city]]
* [[Aesthetics]]
* ''[[Urban structure]]'' – arrangement and relation of business and people
* ''[[Typology (urban planning and architecture)|Urban typology]], [[Urban density|density]]'' and sustainability - spatial types and morphologies related to intensity of use, consumption of resources and production and maintenance of viable communities
* ''[[Accessibility]]'' – safe and easy transportation
* ''Legibility and [[wayfinding]]'' – accessible information about travel and destinations
* ''Animation'' – Designing places to stimulate public activity
* ''Function and fit'' – places support their varied intended uses
* ''Complementary [[Mixed-use|mixed uses]]'' – Locating activities to allow constructive interaction between them
* ''[[Neighbourhood character|Character]] and meaning'' – Recognizing differences between places
* ''Order and incident'' – Balancing consistency and variety in the urban environment
* ''Continuity and change'' – Locating people in time and place, respecting [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and contemporary culture
* ''[[Civil society]]'' – people are free to interact as civic equals, important for building [[social capital]]

==Equality issues==

Until the 1970s, the design of towns and cities took little account of the needs of [[Disability|people with disabilities]]. At that time, disabled people began to form movements demanding recognition of their potential contribution if social obstacles were removed. Disabled people challenged the 'medical model' of disability which saw physical and mental problems as an individual 'tragedy' and people with disabilities as 'brave' for enduring them. They proposed instead a 'social model' which said that barriers to disabled people result from the design of the [[built environment]] and attitudes of able-bodied people. 'Access Groups' were established composed of people with disabilities who audited their local areas, checked planning applications and made representations for improvements. The new profession of 'access officer' was established around that time to produce guidelines based on the recommendations of access groups and to oversee adaptations to existing buildings as well as to check on the accessibility of new proposals. Many [[Local government|local authorities]] now employ access officers who are regulated by the Access Association. A new chapter of the Building Regulations (Part M) was introduced in 1992. Although it was beneficial to have legislation on this issue the requirements were fairly minimal but continue to be improved with ongoing amendments. The [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] continues to raise awareness and enforce action on disability issues in the urban environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2580">'''World Meteorological Organization squares''' or '''WMO squares''' is a system of [[geocode]]s that divides a chart of the world with latitude-longitude gridlines (e.g. [[plate carrée projection]], [[Mercator Projection|Mercator]] or other) into grid cells of 10° [[latitude]] by 10° [[longitude]], each with a unique, 4-digit numeric identifier (refer chart at NODC [http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD05/data05geo.html World Ocean Database 2005] page). On the plate carrée projection the grid cells appear square, however if the Mercator projection is used, the grid cells appear 'stretched' vertically nearer the tops and bottoms of the map. On the actual surface of the [[Globe]], the cells are approximately "square" only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four.

Each 10°x10° square is allocated a number between 1000 and 7817. The numbering system is based first on "global quadrant" numbers where 1=NE, 3=SE, 5=SW, 7=NW which gives the initial digit of any square code (1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx, 7xxx). The second digit (x0xx through x8xx) indicates the number of tens of degrees latitude (north in global quadrants 1 and 7, south in global quadrants 3 and 5) of the 'minimum' square boundary (nearest to the [[Equator]]), i.e. a cell extending between 10°N and 20°N (or 10°S and 20°S) has this digit = 1, a cell extending between 20°N and 30°N has this digit = 2, etc. The third and fourth digits (xx00 through xx17) similarly indicate the number of tens of degrees of longitude of the 'minimum' square boundary, nearest to the [[Prime Meridian]]. By way of illustration, the square 1000 thus extends from 0°N to 10°N, 0°E to 10°E, and the square 7817 from 80°N to 90°N, 170°W to 180°W, adjacent to the major portion of the [[International Date Line]]. In this manner, reverse-engineering (decoding) the relevant square boundaries from any particular WMO Square identifier is straightforward, in contrast to some other similar systems e.g. [[Marsden square]]s.

WMO squares are also used as the basis for the [[c-squares]] spatial indexing system, which further divides 10°x10° WMO squares into smaller units of 5°x5°, 1°x1°, 0.5°x0.5°, 0.1°x0.1°, and so on.
