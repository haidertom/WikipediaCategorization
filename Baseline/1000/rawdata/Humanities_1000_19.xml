[[File:An-actress-at-her-toilet-or-miss-brazen-just-breecht-john-colley.jpg|300px|thumb|1779 John Colley Playbill of an actress dressing in breeches]]
{{Crossdressing|history}}
A '''breeches role''' (also '''pants role''' or '''trouser role''', ''[[Travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'' or "Hosenrolle") is a role in which an actress appears in male clothing. [[Breeches]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|tʃ|ᵻ|z}}, also "britches"), tight-fitting knee-length pants, were the standard male garment at the time breeches roles were introduced. 

In opera it also refers to any male character that is sung and acted by a female singer. Most often the character is an adolescent or a very young man, sung by a [[mezzo-soprano]] or [[contralto]].&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Budden J. Breeches part. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The operatic concept assumes that the character is male, and the audience accepts him as such, even knowing that the actor is not. Cross-dressing female characters (e.g., Leonore in ''[[Fidelio]]'' or Gilda in Act III of ''[[Rigoletto]]'') are not considered breeches roles. The most frequently performed breeches roles are Cherubino (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''), Octavian (''[[Der Rosenkavalier]])'', Hansel (''[[Hansel und Gretel (opera)|Hansel und Gretel]]'') and Orpheus (''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Euridice]]''), though the latter was originally written for a male singer, first a [[castrato]] and later, in the revised French version, an [[haute-contre]].

Because non-musical stage plays generally have no requirements for vocal range, they do not usually contain breeches roles in the same sense as opera. Some plays do have male roles that were written for adult female actors, and (for other practical reasons) are usually played by women (e.g., ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''); these could be considered modern-era breeches roles. However, in most cases, the choice of a female actor to play a male character is made at the production level; [[Hamlet#Hamlet as a character|Hamlet]] is not a breeches role, but [[Sarah Bernhardt]] once played Hamlet ''as'' a breeches role. When a play is spoken of as "containing" a breeches role, this ''does'' mean a role where a female character pretends to be a man and uses male clothing as a disguise.

== History ==
When the London theatres re-opened in 1660, the first professional actresses appeared on the public stage, replacing the boys in dresses of the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] era. To see real women speak the risqué dialogue of [[Restoration comedy]] and show off their bodies on stage was a great novelty, and soon the even greater sensation was introduced of women wearing male clothes on stage. Out of some 375 plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700, it has been calculated that 89, nearly a quarter, contained one or more roles for actresses in male clothes (see Howe). Practically every Restoration actress appeared in trousers at some time, and breeches roles would even be inserted gratuitously in revivals of older plays.

Some critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, have argued that these [[cross-dressing]] roles subvert conventional [[gender roles]] by allowing women to imitate the roistering and sexually aggressive behaviour of male Restoration [[Rake (character)|rakes]], but Elizabeth Howe has objected in a detailed study that the male disguise was "little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object". The epilogue to [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''Sir Anthony Love'' (1690) suggests that it does not much matter if the play is dull, as long as the audience can glimpse the legs of the famous "breeches" actress [[Susanna Verbruggen|Susanna Mountfort]] (also known as Susanna Verbruggen):

:You'll hear with Patience a dull Scene, to see,
:In a contented lazy waggery,
:The Female Mountford bare above the knee.

Katharine Eisaman Maus also argues that as well as revealing the female legs and buttocks, the breeches role frequently contained a revelation scene where the character not only unpins her hair but as often reveals a breast as well. This is evidenced in the portraits of many of these actresses of the Restoration.

Breeches roles remained an attraction on the British stage for centuries, but their fascination gradually declined as the difference in real-life male and female clothing became less extreme. They played a part in [[Victorian burlesque]] and are traditional for the [[principal boy]] in [[pantomime]].

== Opera ==
Historically, the list of roles that are considered to be breeches roles is constantly changing, depending on the tastes of the opera-going public. In early Italian opera, many leading operatic roles were assigned to a [[castrato]], a male castrated before puberty with a very strong and high voice. As the practice of castrating boy singers faded, composers created heroic male roles in the mezzo-soprano range, where singers such as [[Marietta Alboni]] and Rosamunda Pisaroni specialised in such roles.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; (See ''[[Serse|Xerxes]]'' below.)

Currently, many castrato roles are being reclaimed by men. As the training and use of [[countertenor]]s becomes more common, there are more men with these very high voices to sing these roles.

Casting directors are left with choices such as whether to cast the young Prince Orlofsky in [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss II's]] ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' for a woman or man; both commonly sing the role. When played by a mezzo, the prince looks like a woman, but sounds like a boy. When played by a counter-tenor, he looks like a man, but sings like a woman. This disparity is made even clearer if, as in this case, there is also spoken dialogue.

The term ''Travesty'' (from the Italian ''travesti'', disguised) applies to any roles sung by the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;Budden J. Travesty. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term is a ''skirt role'', a female character to be played by a male singer, usually for comic or visual effect. These roles are often ugly stepsisters or very old women, and are not as common as trouser roles. As women were not allowed to sing on stage in the [[Papal States]] during the [[Baroque period]], many female operatic roles which premiered in those areas were originally written as skirt roles for [[castrato|castrati]] (e.g. ''Mandane'' and ''Semira'' in [[Leonardo Vinci]]'s [[Artaserse (Vinci)|Artaserse]]). Britten's Madwoman in ''[[Curlew River]]'' and the Cook in Prokofiev's ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'' are examples. The role of the witch in Humperdinck's ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', although written for a mezzo-soprano is now more regularly{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} sung by a tenor, who sings the part an octave lower. In the same opera the "male" roles of Hänsel, the Sandman, and the Dewman are however meant to be sung by women.

==History==
Many Chicano scholars agree that Chicano studies came about as a result of the Chicano student movements, whether they were in the form of protests, activism or just taking part in ''[[Chicano Movement|el movimiento]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chicano Studies: The Genesis of a Discipline|last = Soldatenko|first = Michael|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780816599530|location = Tucson, Arizona|pages = 12–37|chapter = The Genesis of Academic Chicano Studies, 1967-1970|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780816599530/9780816599530-6.pdf|access-date = 12 May 2015|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicano studies was seen as a way to advance Mexican American perspectives on culture, history and literature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The major push for universities and colleges to include Chicano studies came within the context of the African-American civil rights struggle.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED273429|title = The Current Status and Future of Chicano Studies Programs: Are They Academically Sound?|date = April 1986|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Rochin|first = Refugio I.|last2 = de la Torre|first2 = Adela}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED114133|title = Administrative Reorganizational Needs in Chicano Studies at Cerritos College|date = 25 April 1975|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Hinrichsen|first = Keith A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Mexican American educators demanded that colleges and universities address the pedagogical needs of Mexican American students.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This was especially important because Mexican American student populations grew significantly in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, many young people and students were becoming very politically active and began to organize for political causes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A very prominent student organization that grew out of the civil rights movements of the '60s was the [[Mexican American Youth Organization]] (MAYO), which began to work towards educational reform.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Making of Chicano Studies: In the Trenches of Academe|last = Acuna|first = Rodolfo|publisher = Rutgers University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9780813550701|location = New Brunswick|pages = 36–58|chapter = From Student Power to Chicano Studies|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780813550701/9780813550701-10.pdf|access-date = 13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAYO was very active in promoting student walkouts in [[Texas]] and [[California]] to highlight problems that Mexican American students faced.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As students became more organized, they began to develop "experimental colleges" where informal classes on topics important to the Chicano movement were taught.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Manuel H. Guerra, professor at the University of Southern California and chair of the [[Mexican American Political Association|Mexican American Political Association's]] (MAPA) Education Committee, reported in 1963 on "serious discriminatory policies and practices" at his university in relation to hiring Mexican Americans, especially considering that there had been an increase in the number of Mexican American students.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Making of Chicano Studies: In the Trenches of Academe|last = Acuna|first = Rodolfo|publisher = Rutgers University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9780813550015|location = New Brunswick|pages = 14–35|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780813550701/9780813550701-9.pdf|chapter = The Sixties and the Bean Count}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving Mexican American students without providing Mexican American faculty was considered a sort of colonialism and cultural assimilation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, many Mexican American students were put at a disadvantage because speaking [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (even outside of class) was considered "degrading" or "un-American."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Opportunities such as the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) helped increase the number of minorities entering colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Educators and students alike began to visualize "an academic program that could serve and transform the Mexican American community," a program that would become Chicano studies and which was built by and for Chicanos.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chicano Studies: The Genesis of a Discipline|last = Soldatenko|first = Michael|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780816599530|location = Tucson, Arizona|pages = 38–66|chapter = Empirics and Chicano Studies: The Formation of Empirical Chicano Studies, 1970-1975|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780816599530/9780816599530-7.pdf|access-date = 14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, anthropologist Octavio Romano along with graduate students at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] began to publish a Chicano studies journal called ''El Grito: A Journal of Contemporary Mexican-American Thought''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=76504493&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Chicano Studies Examined|last = Gonzalez|first = Phillip B.|date = 2012|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 May 2015|subscription = yes|volume = 31|issue = 4|pages = 69–74|issn = 0278-5927}}&lt;/ref&gt; His co-founder was Nick. C. Vaca.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Many of the ideas surrounding the formation of later Chicano studies programs stemmed from this publication.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One major idea that was put forth in ''El Grito'' by its editors was that Mexican Americans, in contrast to other ethnic groups, "have retained their distinct identity and refused to disappear into The Great American Melting Pot."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The consequence of this, said the editors, was that Mexican Americans were kept in an economically and politically impoverished state.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Also in 1967, Ralph Guzmán, a political scientist was hired by [[CSULA|Los Angeles State College]] to conduct a study which would lay the foundation for the creation of a national center for Mexican American studies at [[CSULA|California State College, Los Angeles (CSCLA)]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Both Mexican American and Black Student Unions pressed CSCLA to have ethnic studies classes at this time.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The [[Plan de Santa Barbara]] is generally considered to be the manifesto of Chicano studies.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Drafted in 1969 at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], the plan emphasizes the need for education, and especially higher education to enact Chicano community empowerment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Plan helped to "establish Chicano studies as an entity incorporated into the structures of academia."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, while the Plan articulated a need for education, it did not specify how to create a program of study.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The Plan did, however, lead to the creation of the Chicano Studies Institute in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oru.research.ucsb.edu/csi/?page_id=6|title = About the Institute|date = |accessdate = 14 May 2015|website = Chicano Studies Institute|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important document in Chicano studies was also produced in 1969. In March of that year, the Chicano Youth Conference held in [[Denver]] produced a plan written by Chicano poet, [[Alurista]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It was called ''[[Plan Espiritual de Aztlán|El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán]]'' (The Spiritual Plan of Aztlán) and it contains a concept of "ethnic nationalism and self-determination."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The idea of the mythic homeland of the Aztec people, [[Aztlán]], is one that unifies the United States and Mexico and correspondingly, united Mexican Americans with a sense of nationalism.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/arizona_quarterly_a_journal_of_american_literature_culture_and_theory/v058/58.1.aranda.pdf|title = Making the Case for New Chicano/a Studies: Recovering Our Alienated Selves|last = Aranda Jr.|first = Jose F.|date = 2002|journal = Arizona Quarterly|doi = 10.1353/arq.2002.0011|pmid = |access-date = 14 May 2015|pages = 127–158|subscription = yes|volume = 58|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, a major Chicano journal began to be published at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v054/54.4pulido.html|title = In the Spirit of Ernesto Galarza: Recent Publications in Chicano Studies|last = Pulido|first = Alberto Lopez|date = 2002|journal = American Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 14 May 2015|subscription = yes|volume = 54|issue = 4|pages = 719–729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was called ''Aztlán: A Journal of Chicano Studies'' and it was created at first by the students.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The journal, ''Aztlán'', had a big influence on the discourse surrounding Chicano studies and helped "establish and legitimize" the subject in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The name of the journal came directly from ''El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán'' and under the direction of the historian Juan Gomez-Quiñones, the journal supported and sustained a culture of activism.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Chicano scholars in 1970 also wrote papers for the Chicano Studies Institute which were later published in the journal, ''Epoca''.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These papers addressed topics such as Chicano curriculum, goals of the educational program and how to achieve academic recognition.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

As Chicano studies programs began to be implemented at universities, it was necessary to provide infrastructure and support. In 1973, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] recognized the need to provide quality library materials to support the Chicano studies programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED164147|title = Providing Library Services for the Chicano Studies Program at the University of California, Berkeley|date = 1973|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Padilla|first = Raymond V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicano scholars also recognized the need to have a "Chicano-controlled academic" space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chicano Studies: The Genesis of a Discipline|last = Soldatenko|first = Michael|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780816599530|location = Tucson, Arizona|pages = 94–129|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780816599530/9780816599530-9.pdf|chapter = Chicano Studies as an Academic Discipline, 1975-1982|access-date = 14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers began to study the impact that these new programs had on students, finding that Mexican-American students responded positively to Chicano studies and also to bilingual classes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED118160|title = Chicano Studies and Self-Concept: Implications for the Community Colleges|date = 1975|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Gonzalez|first = Jess}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars felt that the philosophy of education in the United States at the time was "inconsistent with the values of the Chicano movement" and that Chicano studies needed to create tools for students to use in the real world and also a new type of research to solve problems.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It was also important to find ways to recruit Chicano teachers and administration within the schools to support students and research.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Further support for Chicano studies came in the form of the [[National Association of Chicana and Chicano Studies|National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies]] (NACCS) which was created in 1972 in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.naccs.org/naccs/History.asp|title = History of NACCS|date = |accessdate = 14 May 2015|website = National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NACCS allows scholars in Chicano studies to exchange ideas, share research, communicate and it also has an annual conference.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The conferences were important to help bring together scholars and legitimize Chicano studies, since other disciplines have similar annual conferences.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

By 1975, many Chicano studies programs were in place at major universities.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The ten years between 1977 and 1987 saw "tremendous changes in the foundations of Chicano/a studies."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; During this period, Chicano studies began to include more diverse voices that better represented women, homosexuality and other under-represented groups under the umbrella of "Chicano" while also acknowledging the many differences within the group.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  In 1981, the Mexican American Studies and Research Center (MASRC) at the University of Arizona was established. MASRC focused on contemporary applied public policy research on Mexican Americans.  MASRC became a department in 2009. As the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160402085833/http://mas.arizona.edu/ Mexican American Studies Department], it continued public policy research and teaching to addressing issues of concern to Mexican American communities. It currently offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and in 2011, began offering a Ph.D. degree in Mexican American Studies. The idea of the "borderland" or [[nepantla]] grew stronger than the idea of Aztlán by the 1980s and Chicanaos celebrated the many different (often conflicting) aspects of themselves.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]'' (1987) by [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]] both grew out of and signifies this change.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Chicano studies became less about nationalism, and more about belonging to a group and contributing to "something greater."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This shift helped reshape the mission of Chicano studies and gave it "new life" and "new authority."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The 1980s saw more Chicano Studies programs integrated into institutions of higher learning while it also created a "canonical approach" to its studies and "gatekeeping procedures" to evaluate promotions and [[tenure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, Chicano studies programs helped universities and colleges fulfill [[Affirmative action in the United States|Affirmative Action]] requirements.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During the mid 1990s, however, a study found that most Chicano studies programs were still very non-uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED380034|title = Current Mexican-American and Chicano Studies Undergraduate College Programs in the United States|date = 1995|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Jaramillo|first = James A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason that many Chicano studies programs were not consistent in what was studied is that a core curriculum had not yet been formally published.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The first primer of Chicano studies was published in 1980 by Diego Vigil, called ''From Indians to Chicanos: A Sociocultural History''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, there was a lack of Chicano faculty with only 1.2% of faculty at U.S. colleges and universities having any "Hispanic" ethnicity at all in 1985.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Many of the faculty teaching Chicano studies didn't feel that their own programs were "qualitatively sound."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Schools of thought ==
Chicano studies has two major threads, one is considered pragmatic and the other transformational.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_literary_history/v025/25.3.perez-torres.html|title = Chicano Studies's Two Paths|last = Pérez-Torres|first = Rafael|date = 2013|journal = American Literary History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 May 2015|volume = 25|issue = 3|subscription = yes|pages = 683–692}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pragmatic method involves a more activist and "politicized" approach while the transformational method is more in line with working within the traditions of academia, rather than against it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Current Events==
[[File:Arizona Ethnic Studies.jpg|alt=Protesters against HB 2281|thumb|350x350px|Protesters are seen in June 2011 in support of the [[Tucson Unified School District]]'s Mexican-American studies program. A new state law effectively ended the program saying it was divisive.]]
On May 11, 2010, the Governor of [[Arizona]], [[Jan Brewer]], signed House Bill 2281 (also known as HB 2281) which prohibits a school district or charter school from including in its curriculum courses that
#Promote the overthrow of the United States Government
#Promote resentment toward any race or class
#Advocate ethnic solidarity instead of being individuals
#Are designed for a certain ethnicity
while still allowing:
#Native American classes to comply with federal law
#Grouping of classes based on academic performance
#Classes about the history of an ethnic group open to all students
#Classes discussing controversial history
Another provision of the law stated that any school district or charter school breaching its stated provisions would be liable to lose state funding as a public institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2281s.pdf |title=Arizona House Bill 2281 (2010) |format=PDF |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the [[Mexican American Studies Department Programs, Tucson Unified School District|Mexican-American studies program]] as taught by Tucson Unified School District (TUSD) came under scrutiny and was found to be in violation of the law by [[Tom Horne]]. However, an independent audit (paid for by the state of Arizona) was conducted, and found the program was not in breach of HB 2281.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racial Lens Used to Cull Curriculum in Arizona|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/19/education/racial-lens-used-to-cull-curriculum-in-arizona.html?_r=2|work=nytimes.com|format=article|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With pressure from former Arizona Superintendent [[Tom Horne]], who felt the courses were breaching HB 2281, and after TUSD issued an appeal stating otherwise, Superintendent [[John Huppenthal]] deemed that the course must be disbanded or TUSD would lose funding.&lt;ref name="mex-amer"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mexican-american.org/history/2010/arizona/education/chicano-studies-ban.html | title=Arizona Bans Chicano Studies in Public Schools | first=Tito | last=Rodriguez | publisher=Mexican-American.org | date=May 13, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427090236/http://www.mexican-american.org/history/2010/arizona/education/chicano-studies-ban.html | archivedate=April 27, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in January 2012, the TUSD school board came to a 4-1 decision that the program was to be disbanded in lieu of the district losing state funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-tucson-school-board-daily-show-20120404,0,5593283.story | title= Mexican American studies: 'Daily Show' Segment Strikes a Nerve | author=Castellanos, Dalina | date=April 4, 2012 | publisher= Los Angeles Times | accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further consequence of HB 2281 was opening the door to challenges and limiting classes teaching Chicano studies not just in Arizona, but across the United States.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A '''chronology of Jesus''' aims to establish a [[timeline]] for the events of the life of [[Jesus]]. Scholars have correlated [[Jewish]] and [[Greco-Roman]] documents and astronomical calendars with the [[New Testament]] accounts to estimate dates for the major events in Jesus's life. 

Two main approaches have been used to estimate the year of the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]]: one based on the accounts in the [[Gospels]] of his birth with reference to [[Herod the Great|King Herod's]] reign, and the other by subtracting his stated age of "about 30&amp;nbsp;years" when he began preaching. Most scholars, on this basis, assume a date of birth between 6 and 4&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=MJDG324 &gt;[[John P. Meier]] (1991).

Three details have been used to estimate the year when [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus began preaching]]: a mention of his age of "about 30&amp;nbsp;years" during "the fifteenth year" of the reign of [[Tiberius Caesar]], another relating to the date of the building of the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]], and yet another concerning the [[death of John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 &gt;Eerdman Publishing.

Five methods have been used to estimate the date of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]]. One uses non-Christian sources such as [[Josephus]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book |last=Funk |first=Robert W. |author2=[[Jesus Seminar]]  |authorlink=Robert W.

Both methods result in AD&amp;nbsp;36 as an upper bound to the crucifixion.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 &gt;Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum. (2009).

Humphreys &amp; W. G. Waddington. (1985). The Date of the Crucifixion. ''Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation'',&amp;nbsp;''37''. (March 1985). [http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1985/JASA3-85Humphreys.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[lunar eclipse]] method, the Apostle Peter's statement that the moon turned to blood at the crucifixion ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:14|Acts of the Apostles 2:14-21]]) is taken to refer to the lunar eclipse of 3 April AD 33; although astronomers are discussing whether the eclipse was visible as far west as Jerusalem.  Recent astronomical research uses the contrast between the synoptic date of Jesus' last Passover on the one hand with John's date of the subsequent "Jewish Passover" on the other hand, to propose Jesus' Last Supper to have been on Wednesday, 1 April AD 33 and the crucifixion on Friday 3 April AD 33.

(1999). ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews'', pages=6–7, 105–10, 232–34, 266. [[Alfred A. Knopf]] Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; One indication that the gospels are theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one-third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, also known as [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion of Christ]].&lt;ref name=Turner613 &gt;''Matthew'' by David L. Turner 2008 {{ISBN|0-8010-2684-9}} page 613&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the gospels provide some details regarding events which can be clearly dated, so one can establish date ranges regarding major events in Jesus' life by comparison with independent sources.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 /&gt;&lt;ref name = autogenerated5&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Historical  Figure of Jesus | last = Sanders | first = EP | publisher = Penguin Books | place = London | year = 1995 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of historical non-Christian documents, such as Jewish and [[Greco-Roman]] sources, have been used in historical analyses of the chronology of Jesus.&lt;ref name= Blomberg431 &gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0-8054-4482-3}} pages 431-436&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all modern historians agree that Jesus existed, and regard [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]] as historical events, and assume that approximate ranges for these events can be estimated.&lt;ref name=Ehrman285&gt;In a 2011 review of the state of modern scholarship, [[Bart Ehrman]] wrote: "He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees" B.

Using these methods, most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 and 4&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=

===Biblical references to King Herod's reign===
The two [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity accounts of Jesus]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke]] differ substantially from each other, and are considered to have been written independently. However, some consistent elements are evidently derived from a common early tradition:&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulrich Luz]]: ''Die Geburtsgeschichten Jesu und die Geschichte.'' Göttingen 2013, [https://books.google.de/books?id=6ZJbAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 S. 170]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jesus was born under the Judean king [[Herod the Great]] (Matt 2,1f; Luke 1,5 vs Luke 2,1f)
*in [[Bethlehem]] (Matt 2,5f; Luke 2,4.15)
*prior to his parents moving to [[Nazareth]] (Matt 2,22f), or before their return to Nazareth (Luke 2,39).
*Jesus' parents [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] were [[Engagement#Betrothal|betrothed]] (Matt 1,18–20; Luke 1,27; 2,5).
* His birth was a [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] conceived by the [[Holy Spirit]].
* [[Angel]]s announced Jesus' birth, his name, his role as the [[Messiah]] (being a descendant of King [[David]] and the [[Son of God (Christianity)|son of God]]), and his mission to save his people from sin (Matt 1,21; Luke 1,77; 2,11,30).

Thus both Luke and Matthew independently associate Jesus' birth with the reign of [[Herod the Great]].&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} page 731&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew furthermore implies that Jesus was up to two years old when Herod reportedly ordered the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], that is, the murder of all boys in Bethlehem up to the age of two (Matt 2:16).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Edwin D | last = Freed | title = Stories of Jesus' Birth | publisher = Continuum International | year = 2004 | page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars agree that Herod died in 4 BC, although some have argued for 1 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Timothy David|title=The Date of Herod's Death|journal=[[Journal of Theological Studies]]|issue=19|year=1968|pp=204–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernegger|first=P.

===Subtracting Jesus' age of "about 30 years" when preaching===

However, if the phrase "about 30" is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of birth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

This date is independently confirmed by John's reference in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] to the Temple being in its 46th year of construction during Passover when Jesus began his ministry, which corresponds to around 28–29 AD according to scholarly estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Jack V. Scarola, "A Chronology of the nativity Era" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos 2'' by Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-582-0}} pages 61–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches===
The Gospel of John 8:57 mentions in passing an upper limit of 50 for Jesus' age when preaching: ''Then the Jews said to Him: You are not even fifty years old, and you claim to have seen Abraham?'' Fifty years is a round number which emphasises the discrepancy to Jesus's claim he had existed before Abraham, that is, for more than a thousand years.&lt;ref name=Humphreys72 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have attempted to establish the date of birth by identifying the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with some known astronomical or astrological phenomenon. For example, astronomer Michael Molnar proposed 17 April 6 BC as the likely date of the Nativity, since that date corresponded to the [[heliacal rising]] and lunar [[occultation]] of [[Jupiter]], while it was [[Apparent retrograde motion#Apparent motion|momentarily stationary]] in the [[Aries (constellation)|constellation of Aries]]. According to Molnar, to knowledgeable astrologers of this time, this highly unusual combination of events would have indicated that a regal personage would be (or had been) born in Judea. &lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Molnar, "The Star of Bethlehem: The Legacy of the Magi," Rutgers University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research points to a 1991 report from the Royal Astronomical Society, which mentions that Chinese astronomers noted a "comet" that lasted 70 days in the Capricorn region of the sky, in March of 5 BC.  Authors Dugard and O'Reilly consider this event as the likely Star of Bethlehem. &lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, Bill, and Dugard, Martin, "Killing Jesus: A History," Henry Holt and Company, 2013, {{ISBN|0805098542}}, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many possible phenomena and none seems to match the Gospel account exactly.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''101 Questions and Answers on the Bible'', Paulist Press (2003), page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Years of preaching==

===Reign of Tiberius and the Gospel of Luke===
[[File:Sapsaphas Madaba.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Madaba Map]] showing [[Bethabara]] (Βέθαβαρά), calling it the place where John baptised]]
One method for the estimation of the date of the beginning of the [[ministry of Jesus]] is based on the Gospel of Luke's specific statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1-2]] about the ministry of [[John the Baptist]] which preceded that of Jesus:&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans67 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reign of [[Tiberius Caesar]] began on the death of his predecessor [[Augustus Caesar]] in September AD&amp;nbsp;14, implying that the ministry of John the Baptist began in late AD&amp;nbsp;28 or early AD&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref name=Cradle &gt;Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum, Charles L Quarles, ''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown'' (B&amp;H Publishing, 2009), page 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=art201 &gt;''Luke 1-5: New Testament Commentary'' by John MacArthur 2009 {{ISBN|0-8024-0871-0}} page 201&lt;/ref&gt; Riesner's alternative suggestion is that John the Baptist began his ministry in AD&amp;nbsp;26 or 27, because Tiberius ruled together with Augustus for two years before becoming the sole ruler. If so, the fifteenth year of Tiberius' reign would be counted from AD&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;ref name="Riesner"/&gt; Riesner's suggestion is however considered less likely, as all the major Roman historians who calculate the years of Tiberius' rule - namely Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio - count from AD&amp;nbsp;14 - the year of Augustus' death. In addition, coin evidence shows that Tiberius started to reign in AD&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;ref name=Humphreys64 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament presents [[John the Baptist]] as the precursor to Jesus and the [[Baptism of Jesus]] as marking the beginning of Jesus' ministry.&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blomberg224 &gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L.

===The Temple in Jerusalem and the Gospel of John===
[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 3.JPG|right|thumb|[[Herod's Temple]], referred to in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13]], as imagined in the [[Holyland Model of Jerusalem]]. It is currently situated adjacent to the [[Shrine of the Book]] exhibit at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem.]]

Another method for estimating the start of the ministry of Jesus without reliance on the [[Synoptic gospels]] is to relate the account in the [[Gospel of John]] about the visit of Jesus to [[Herod's Temple]] in Jerusalem with historical data about the construction of the Temple.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13]] says that Jesus went to the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]] around the start of his ministry and in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] Jesus is told: "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?".&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;

Herod's Temple in Jerusalem was an extensive and long term construction on the [[Temple Mount]], which was never fully completed even by the time it was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70.&lt;ref name=Roller67 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lundquist /&gt;&lt;ref name= Maxxix &gt;''The biblical engineer: how the temple in Jerusalem was built'' by Max Schwartz 2002 {{ISBN|0-88125-710-9}} pages xixx-xx&lt;/ref&gt; Having built entire cities such as [[Caesarea Maritima]], Herod saw the construction of the Temple as a key, colossal monument.&lt;ref name=Lundquist &gt;''The Temple of Jerusalem: past, present, and future'' by John M. Lundquist 2007 {{ISBN|0-275-98339-0}} pages101-103 [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9VeCEwbNvsC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22john+2:20%22+temple&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kpydTvvXB-qK4gSg2NHPCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%202%3A20%22%20temple&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication of the initial temple (sometimes called the inner Temple) followed a 17 or 18 month construction period, just after the visit of [[Augustus]] to Syria.&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Roller67 &gt;''The building program of Herod the Great'' by Duane W. Roller 1998 University of California Press {{ISBN|0-520-20934-6}} pages 67-71 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZsB1yQOmyEC&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=herod+temple+construction&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DredTu3cIqT64QSitp2nCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=temple%20construction&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josephus]] ([[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XV|Ant 15.11.1]]) states that the temple's reconstruction was started by Herod in the 18th year of his reign.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kostenberger140"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the historical Jesus'' by Craig A. Evans 2008 {{ISBN|0-415-97569-7}} page 115&lt;/ref&gt; But there is some uncertainty about how Josephus referred to and computed dates, which event marked the start of Herod's reign, and whether the initial date should refer to the inner Temple, or the subsequent construction.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt; Hence various scholars arrive at slightly different dates for the exact date of the start of the Temple construction, varying by a few years in their final estimation of the date of the Temple visit.&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pages 140-141&lt;/ref&gt; Given that it took 46 years of construction, the best scholarly estimate for when Jesus preached is around the year AD&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=PAnderson200 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name="J.

===Josephus' reference to John the Baptist===
Both the gospels and first-century historian [[Flavius Josephus]], in his work [[Antiquities of the Jews]],&lt;ref&gt;''The new complete works of Josephus by Flavius Josephus'', William Whiston, Paul L. Maier {{ISBN|0-8254-2924-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to [[Herod Antipas]] killing [[John the Baptist]], and to the marriage of Herod and [[Herodias]], establishing two key connections between Josephus and the biblical episodes.&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 /&gt; Josephus refers to the imprisonment and execution of John the Baptist by Herod Antipas and that Herodias left her husband to marry Herod Antipas, in defiance of Jewish law.&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fox25 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromiley694 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Ant 18.5.2-4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephus and the gospels differ, however, on the details and motives, e.g. whether the execution was a consequence of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias (as indicated in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:4|Matthew 14:4]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:18|Mark 6:18]]), or a pre-emptive measure by Herod which possibly took place before the marriage to quell a possible uprising based on the remarks of John, as Josephus suggests in [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Ant 18.5.2]].&lt;ref name=Leslie508 &gt;''Jesus in history, thought, and culture: an encyclopedia, Volume 1'' by James Leslie Houlden 2003 {{ISBN|1-57607-856-6}} pages 508-509 [https://books.google.com/books?id=17kzgBusXZIC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=baptist+josephus+antipas+jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5kmbTvPYB9TP4QSuzIDjAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=baptist%20herodias%20josephus%20antipas%20jesus&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Women in scripture'' by [[Carol Meyers]], Toni Craven and Ross Shepard Kraemer 2001 {{ISBN|0-8028-4962-8}} pages 92-93 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MFbHT73BxpAC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=herodias+herod&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FJmcToy0M4abOtTmzIYJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=herodias%20herod&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Herod Antipas in Galilee: The Literary and Archaeological Sources'' by Morten H.

The exact year of the marriage of [[Herod Antipas]] and [[Herodias]] is subject to debate among scholars.&lt;ref name=fox25 /&gt; While some scholars place the year of the marriage in the range AD&amp;nbsp;27-31, others have approximated a date as late as AD&amp;nbsp;35, although such a late date has much less support.&lt;ref name=fox25 /&gt; In his analysis of Herod's life, [[Harold Hoehner]] estimates that John the Baptist's imprisonment probably occurred around AD&amp;nbsp;30-31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oO0upEG0g7kC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=herodias+herod+antipas#v=onepage&amp;q=herodias%20herod%20antipas&amp;f=false |title='&amp;#39;Herod Antipas'&amp;#39; by Harold W.

===Conversion of Paul===
[[File:The Temple of Apollo at Delphi.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Delphi]], Greece, where the [[Delphi Inscription]] was discovered early in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=CCPaul20 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Marrow45 /&gt;]]
Another approach to estimating an [[upper bound]] for the year of death of Jesus is the estimation of the date of [[conversion of Paul the Apostle]] which the New Testament accounts place some time after the death of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riesner /&gt; Paul's conversion is discussed in both the [[Letters of Paul]] and in the [[Acts of the Apostles]].&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey William (1979). ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A–D'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. pp. 689. {{ISBN|0-8028-3781-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|15:3–8]]), Paul refers to his conversion. The [[Acts of the Apostles]] includes three separate references to his conversion experience, in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#9|Acts 9]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#22|Acts 22]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#26|Acts 26]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paul and His Letters'' by John B. Polhill 1999 {{ISBN|0-8054-1097-X}} pages 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'' by William Lane Craig, James Porter Moreland 2009 {{ISBN|1-4051-7657-1}} page 616&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimating the year of Paul's conversion relies on working backwards from his trial before [[Junius Annaeus Gallio|Junius Gallio]] in [[Achaea]] Greece ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:12|Acts 18:12–17]]) around AD&amp;nbsp;51–52, a date derived from the discovery and publication, in 1905, of four stone fragments as part of the [[Delphi Inscription]]s, at [[Delphi]] across the Gulf from [[Corinth]].&lt;ref name=Marrow45 &gt;''Paul: his letters and his theology'' by Stanley B.

Polhill, ''Paul and His Letters'', B&amp;H Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|9780805410976}}, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

On this basis, most historians estimate that Gallio (brother of [[Seneca the Younger]]) became [[proconsul]] between the spring of AD&amp;nbsp;51 and the summer of AD&amp;nbsp;52, and that his position ended no later than AD&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;ref name=CCPaul20 &gt;''The Cambridge Companion to St Paul'' by James D.

Evans 2004 {{ISBN|0-7814-4006-8}} page 248&lt;/ref&gt; The trial of Paul is generally assumed to be in the earlier part of Gallio's tenure, based on the reference ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:2|Acts 18:2]]) to his meeting in Corinth with [[Priscilla and Aquila]], who had been recently expelled from Rome based on Emperor Claudius' [[Claudius' expulsion of Jews from Rome|expulsion of Jews from Rome]], which is dated to AD&amp;nbsp;49–50.&lt;ref name=Novak18 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament edition'' by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 {{ISBN|0-88207-812-7}} page 405&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the New Testament, Paul spent eighteen months in Corinth, approximately seventeen years after his conversion.&lt;ref name=Marrow45 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eerdsman1019 &gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' Amsterdam University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 1019&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#2:1|Galatians 2:1-10]] states that Paul went [[Paul the apostle#Visits to Jerusalem in Acts and the epistles|back to Jerusalem]] fourteen years after his conversion, and various missions (at times with [[Barnabas]]) such as those in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#11:25|Acts 11:25–26]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/2 Corinthians#11:23|2 Corinthians 11:23–33]] appear in the Book of Acts.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt; The generally accepted scholarly estimate for the date of conversion of Paul is AD&amp;nbsp;33–36, placing the death of Jesus before this date range.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riesner /&gt;

===Astronomical analysis===

====Newton's method====
[[File:Bolton-newton.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Newton]]]]
All four Gospels agree to within about a day that the crucifixion was at the time of Passover, and all four Gospels agree that Jesus died a few hours before the commencement of the Jewish Sabbath, i.e. he died before nightfall on a Friday (Matt 27:62, 28:1, Mark 15:42, Luke 23:54, John 19:31,42). In the official festival calendar of Judaea, as used by the priests of the temple, Passover time was specified precisely. The slaughtering of the lambs for Passover occurred between 3pm and 5pm on the 14th day of the Jewish month Nisan (corresponding to March/April in our calendar). The Passover meal commenced at moonrise (necessarily a full moon) that evening, i.e., at the start of 15 Nisan (the Jewish day running from evening to evening) (Leviticus 23 v. 5; Numbers 28 v. 16). There is an apparent discrepancy of one day in the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion which has been the subject of considerable debate. In John's Gospel, it is stated that the day of Jesus' trial and execution was the day before Passover (John 18 v. 28 and 19 v. 14), Hence John places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan. Likewise the Apostle Paul, in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], implies Jesus died on a 14 Nisan ("sacrificed as a Passover lamb", 1 Cor 5:7), and was resurrected on the Jewish [[Shavuot|festival of the first fruits]], i.e. on a 16 Nisan (1 Cor 15:20).&lt;ref name=Humphreys68 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; The correct interpretation of the Synoptics is less clear. Thus some scholars believe that all 4 Gospels place the crucifixion on Friday, 14 Nisan, others believe that according to the Synoptics it occurred on Friday, 15 Nisan. The problem that then has to be solved is that of determining in which of the years of the reign of Pontius Pilate (AD 26–36) the 14th and 15th Nisan fell on a Friday.&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1985/JASA3-85Humphreys.html "The Date of the Crucifixion"], Colin Humphreys and W. Graeme Waddington, March 1985. American Scientific Affiliation website. Retrieved 17 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1733, [[Isaac Newton]] considered only the range AD&amp;nbsp;31–36 and calculated that the Friday requirement is met only on Friday 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, and 23 April AD&amp;nbsp;34. The latter date can only have fallen on a Friday if an exceptional leap month had been introduced that year, but this was favoured by Newton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00205]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pratt1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Humphreys45 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton &gt;[[Isaac Newton|Newton, Isaac]] (1733).

K. Fotheringham]], who in 1910 suggested 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 on the basis of its coincidence with a lunar eclipse.&lt;ref name=Humphreys45 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fotheringham, J.K. 1910"&gt;Fotheringham, J.K., 1910.

Schaefer]] and J. P. Pratt, following a similar method, arrived at the same date.&lt;ref name=Pratt1 &gt;{{cite journal |last=Pratt |first=J. P. |year=1991 |title=Newton's Date for the Crucifixion |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=301–304 |bibcode=1991QJRAS..32..301P }} [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991QJRAS..32..301P]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=B.

A more refined calculation takes into account that the Jewish calendar was based not on astronomical calculation but on observation, following criticism that it is possible to establish the [[lunar phase|phase of the moon]] on a particular day two thousand years ago but not whether it was obscured by clouds or haze.&lt;ref&gt;C. Philipp E. Nothaft, ''Dating the Passion: The Life of Jesus and the Emergence of Scientific Chronology'' (200–1600) page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Sanders, ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'' (Penguin, 1993) 285–286.&lt;/ref&gt; Including the possibility of a cloudy sky obscuring the moon, and assuming that the Jewish authorities would be aware that lunar months can only be either 29 or 30 days long (the time from one new moon to the next is 29.53 days), then the refined calculation states that the Friday requirement might also have been met, during Pontius Pilate's term of office, on 11 April AD&amp;nbsp;27.  Another potential date arises if the Jewish authorities happened to add an irregular lunar leap month to compensate for a meteorologically delayed harvest season: this would yield one additional possibility during Pilate's time, which is Newton's favoured date of 23 April AD&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;ref name=Humphreys53 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 53–58&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Humphreys calculates but rejects these AD&amp;nbsp;27 and AD&amp;nbsp;34 dates on the basis that the former is much too early to be compatible with Luke 3:1–2, and spring AD&amp;nbsp;34 is probably too late to be compatible with Paul's timeline, confirming Friday 7 April AD&amp;nbsp;30, and Friday 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 as the two feasible crucifixion dates.&lt;ref name=Humphreys63 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 63–66&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eclipse method====
[[File:Total_lunar_eclipse_May_4_2004-Jpeter_smith.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Lunar eclipse]], 4 May 2004. Red hue caused by diffraction of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere.]]
A [[lunar eclipse]] is potentially alluded to in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:14|Acts of the Apostles 2:14–21]] ("The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord come"), as pointed out by physicist [[Colin Humphreys]] and astronomer Graeme Waddington. There was in fact a lunar eclipse on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33,&lt;ref name="Fotheringham, J.K. 1910"/&gt;[https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCLEmap/0001-0100/LE0033-04-03P.gif] a date which coincides with one of Newton's astronomically possible crucifixion dates (see above). Humphreys and Waddington have calculated that in ancient Jerusalem this eclipse would have been visible at moonrise at 6.20pm as a 20% partial eclipse (a full moon with a potentially red "bite" missing at the top left of the moon's disc). They propose that a large proportion of the Jewish population would have witnessed this eclipse as they would have been waiting for sunset in the west and immediately afterwards the rise of the anticipated full moon in the east as the prescribed signal to start their household Passover meals.&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"/&gt; Humphreys and Waddington therefore suggest a scenario where Jesus was crucified and died at 3pm on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, followed by a red partial lunar eclipse at moonrise at 6.20pm observed by the Jewish population, and that [[Saint Peter|Peter]] recalls this event when preaching the resurrection to the Jews ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:14|Acts of the Apostles 2:14–21]]).&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"/&gt; Astronomer [[Bradley Schaefer]] agrees with the eclipse date but disputes that the eclipsed moon would have been visible by the time the moon had risen in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, B. E. (1990, March). Lunar visibility and the crucifixion. Royal Astronomical Society Quarterly Journal, 31(1), 53–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, B. E. (1991, July). Glare and celestial visibility.

A potentially related issue involves the reference in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] to a three-hour period of darkness over the whole land on the day of the crucifixion (according to Luke 23:45 τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος – the sun was darkened). Although some scholars view this as a literary device common among ancient writers rather than a description of an actual event,&lt;ref&gt;David E. Garland, ''Reading Matthew: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the First Gospel'' (Smyth &amp; Helwys Publishing,  1999) page 264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) page 108–9.&lt;/ref&gt; other writers have attempted to identify a meteorological event or a datable astronomical phenomenon which this could have referred to. It could not have been a [[solar eclipse]], since this could not take place during the crucifixion at Passover,&lt;ref name=Milone &gt;''Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy'' by David H. Kelley, Eugene F. Milone 2011 {{ISBN|1-4419-7623-X}} pages 250–251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomy: The Solar System and Beyond'' by Michael A. Seeds, Dana Backman, 2009 {{ISBN|0-495-56203-3}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt; and in any case solar eclipses take minutes, not hours.&lt;ref&gt;Meeus, J. (2003, December). ''The maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse''. Journal of the British Astronomical Association, 113(6), 343–348.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, astronomers [[Colin Humphreys|Humphreys]] and Waddington noted that the reference to a solar eclipse is missing in some versions of Luke and argued that the solar eclipse was a later faulty scribal amendment of what was actually the ''lunar'' eclipse of AD&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;ref name="HumWadJASA"/&gt; This is a claim which historian David Henige describes as 'undefended' and 'indefensible'.&lt;ref name="henige"&gt;{{cite book | last=Henige | first=David P. | authorlink=David Henige | title=Historical evidence and argument | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press | isbn=978-0-299-21410-4 | page=150| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humphreys and a number of scholars have alternatively argued for the sun's darkening to have been caused by a ''[[khamsin]]'', i.e. a sand storm, which can occur between mid-March and May in the Middle East and which does typically last for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review&lt;ref name="Telford"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Telford|first1=William R.|title=Review of The Mystery of the Last Supper: Reconstructing the Final Days of Jesus|journal=The Journal of Theological Studies|date=2015|volume=66|issue=1|pages=371–376|doi=10.1093/jts/flv005|url=http://jts.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/27/jts.flv005|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his lunar eclipse argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony, accepting uncritically statements such as the "three different Passovers in John" and Matthew's statement that Jesus died at the ninth hour. He also alleges that Humphreys uses two very dubious sources, namely Pilate's alleged letter to Tiberius and the writings of the fifth-century Bishop Cyril of Alexandria, which Humphreys however classifies as forgery or contemporary interpretation indicative of a tradition at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys 2011 p85 "Much apocryphal writing consists of highly theatrical literature, which cannot be used as historical evidence ... if [Pilate's report to Tertullian] is a Christian forgery, probably made up on the basis of Acts, as seems likely, then this suggests there was a tradition that at the crucifixion the moon appeared like blood."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Double Passover method====
[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|The rising full moon at sunset signals the start of the Passover meal. This is two weeks after the new moon has heralded the start of the month of Nisan (March/April).]]
In the crucifixion narrative, the synoptic gospels stress that Jesus celebrated a Passover meal (Mark 14:12ff, Luke 22:15) ''before'' his crucifixion, which contrasts sharply with the independent gospel of John who is explicit that the official "Jewish" Passover (John 11:55) started at nightfall ''after'' Jesus' death. In his 2011 book, Colin Humphreys proposes a resolution to this apparent discrepancy by positing that Jesus' "synoptic" Passover meal in fact took place two days before John's "Jewish" Passover because the former is calculated by the putative original Jewish lunar calendar (itself based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar putatively introduced to the Israelites by [[Moses]] in the 13th century BC, and still used today by the [[Samaritans]]). The official "Jewish" Passover in contrast was determined by a Jewish calendar reckoning which had been modified during the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]] in the 6th century BC. This modified Jewish calendar is in use among most Jews today. One basic difference lies in the determination of the first day of the new month: while the Samaritans use the calculated (because by definition invisible) new moon, mainstream Jews use the first observation of the thin crescent of the waxing moon which is on average 30 hours later. The other basic difference lies in the fact that the Samaritan calendar uses a sunrise-to-sunrise day, while the official Jewish calendar uses a sunset-to-sunset day. Due to these differences, the Samaritan Passover is normally one day earlier than the Jewish Passover (and in some years two or more days earlier). The crucifixion year of Jesus can then be calculated by asking the question in which of the two astronomically possible years of AD&amp;nbsp;30 and AD&amp;nbsp;33 is there a time gap between the last supper and the crucifixion which is compatible with the gospel timeline of Jesus' last 6 days. The astronomical calculations show that a hypothetical AD&amp;nbsp;30 date would require an incompatible Monday Last Supper, while AD&amp;nbsp;33 offers a compatible Last Supper on Wednesday, 1 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, followed by a compatible crucifixion on Friday, 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these assumptions he argues that the calculated date of Wednesday 1 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 for the Last Supper allows all four gospel accounts to be astronomically correct, with Jesus celebrating Passover two days before his death according to the original Mosaic calendar, and the Jewish authorities celebrating Passover just after the crucifixion, using the modified Babylonian calendar. In contrast, the Christian church tradition of celebrating the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday would be an anachronism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/135477/20110418/colin-humphreys-last-supper-challenge-biblical-calendar-jewish-calendar-final-days-of-jesus-good-fri.htm |author=Staff Reporter |title=Last Supper was on Wednesday, not Thursday, challenges Cambridge professor Colin Humphreys.| publisher=[[International Business Times]] |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculated chronology incidentally supports John's narrative that Jesus died at the same hour (Friday 3pm) on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 that the Passover lambs were slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 192–195&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford counters that the separate day schema of the Gospel's Holy Week "is an artificial as well as an inconsistent construction".  As Telford had pointed out in his own book in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;WR Telford ''The Barren Temple and the Withered Tree: A Redaction-Critical Analysis of the Cursing of the Fig-Tree Pericope in Mark's Gospel and its Relation to the Cleansing of the Temple Tradition'' Bloomsbury, London, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; "the initial three-day structure found in [Mark 11] is occasioned by the purely redactional linkage of the extraneous fig-tree story with the triumphal entry and cleansing of the temple traditions, and is not a chronology upon which one can base any historical reconstructions."

===Scholarly debate on time of death===
[[File:Papyrus 90 (John 19.1-7).jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Papyrus 90]] fragment of [[Gospel of John|John 19]]]]
The estimation of the hour of the death of Jesus based on the New Testament accounts has been the subject of debate among scholars for centuries, since there was perceived to be&lt;ref name=RBrown959 /&gt; a clear difference between the accounts in the Synoptic Gospels and that in the Gospel of John. Also, some scholars have argued that it is unlikely that the many events of the Passion could have taken place in the span from midnight to about 9 o'clock in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Ruckstuhl (1965), ''Chronology of The Last Days of Jesus – A Critical Study'' [Trans. from German] (pp. 35–71 for ‘The Chronology of “More Than One Day”)&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus of modern scholarship agrees with the four Gospels that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday, although a Wednesday crucifixion has also been proposed.&lt;ref name=Kellum142 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pages 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nis167 &gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Niswonger+%22which+meant+Friday%22&amp;btnG= ''New Testament History''] by Richard L.

The debate can be summarised as follows. In the Synoptic account, the [[Last Supper]] takes place on the first night of [[Passover]], defined in the [[Torah]] as occurring after daylight on [[Quartodeciman|14 of Nisan]], and the crucifixion is on 15 Nisan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Lev|23:5–6|he}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[the Gospel of John]] the trial of Jesus takes place before the Passover meal&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barnett, ''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times'', page 21  (InterVarsity Press, 1999). {{ISBN|978-0-8308-2699-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sentencing takes place on the day of Preparation, before Passover. John's account places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan, since the law mandated the lamb had to be sacrificed between 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm and 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm and eaten before midnight on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Philo]] |title=''De Specialibus Legibus'' 2.145 |url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book28.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]].

It is problematic to reconcile the chronology presented by John with the Synoptic tradition that the [[Last Supper]] was a Passover meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:17–19}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:12–16}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Some scholars have presented arguments to reconcile the accounts,&lt;ref name= KEasley323 /&gt; although [[Raymond E.

Köstenberger, L.

Colin Humphreys' widely publicised "double passover" astronomical analysis, published in 2011 and outlined above, places the hour of death of Jesus at 3pm on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 and claims to reconcile the Gospel accounts for the "six days" leading up to the crucifixion. His solution is that the synoptic gospels and John's gospel use two distinct calendars (the official Jewish lunar calendar, and what is today the Samaritan lunar calendar, the latter used in Jesus' day also by the Essenes of Qumran and the Zealots). Humphrey's proposal was preceded in 1957 by the work of Annie Jaubert&lt;ref&gt;La date de la cène, Gabalda, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that Jesus held his Last Supper at Passover time according to the Qumran ''solar'' calendar. Humphreys rejects Jaubert's conclusion by demonstrating that the Qumran solar reckoning would always place Jesus' Last Supper ''after'' the Jewish Passover, in contradiction to all four gospels. Instead, Humphreys points out that the Essene community at Qumran additionally used a lunar calendar, itself evidently based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar. Humphreys suggests that the reason why his two-calendar solution had not been discovered earlier is (a) widespread scholarly ignorance of the existence of the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar (used alongside the well-known Egyptian administrative solar calendar, and presumably the basis for the 13th-century BC Jewish lunar calendar), and (b) the fact that the modern surviving small community of [[Samaritans]] did not reveal the calculations underlying their lunar calendar (preserving the Egyptian reckoning) to outsiders until the 1960s.

In a review of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony. In doing so, Telford says, Humphreys has built an argument upon unsound premises which "does violence to the nature of the biblical texts, whose mixture of fact and fiction, tradition and redaction, history and myth all make the rigid application of the scientific tool of astronomy to their putative data a misconstrued enterprise."&lt;ref name="Telford"/&gt;

==Ancient estimates==
Other estimates of the chronology of Jesus have been proposed over the centuries, e.g. [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], and [[Cassiodorus]] asserted that the death of Jesus occurred in AD&amp;nbsp;31.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The 3rd/4th century Roman historian [[Lactantius]] states that Jesus was crucified on a particular day in AD&amp;nbsp;29, but that did not correspond to a full moon.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''Of the Manner In Which the Persecutors Died'' 2: "In the latter days of the Emperor Tiberius, in the consulship of Ruberius (''sic'') Geminus and Fufius Geminus, and on the tenth of the kalends of April, as I find it written".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copperplate''' is a style of [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] writing most commonly associated with [[Round hand|English Roundhand]]. Although often used as an [[umbrella term]] for various forms of pointed pen calligraphy, Copperplate most accurately refers to script styles represented in [[Copybook (education)|copybooks]] created using the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio printmaking method]].

==History==
The first use of the term "Copperplate" was in [[Ambrose Heal|Sir Ambrose Heal]]'s 1931 work ''The English Writing-Masters and Their Copy-Books 1570-1800'', although the term may have been used earlier. The term derives from the practice of engraving English roundhand onto a copper plate, also known as intaglio printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iampeth.com/lesson/business-handwriting/styles-script|title=Styles of Script|website=[[IAMPETH]]|first=Joseph|last=Vitolo|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cultural system''', is the interaction of different elements in [[culture]]. While a cultural system is very different from a [[social system]], sometimes both systems together are referred to as the [[sociocultural system]].

==Social theory==
A major concern in the social sciences is the problem of order. One way that social order has been theorized is according to the degree of integration of cultural and social factors.

===Action theory===
[[Talcott Parsons]], a major figure in sociology, who was the main originator of [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] in the early 20th century, based his sociological theory of action system is built up around a general theory of society, which is codified within a cybernetic model featuring four functional imperatives: adaptation, goal-attainment, integration, and pattern maintenance. The hierarchy of systems is, from least to most encompassing system, respectively, behavioral organism, personality system, social system, and cultural system as well. Ritzer and Goodman (2004) summarize Parsons view, "Parsons saw these action systems acting at different levels of analysis, starting with the behavioral organism and building to the cultural system. He saw these levels hierarchically, with each of the lower levels providing the impetus for the higher levels, with the higher levels controlling the lower levels." In an article, late in life, Parsons maintained that the term "functionalism" was an inappropriate characterization of his theory.

===System and social integration===
The British Sociologist David Lockwood argued for a contrast between social content and social transmission in his work on social [[structure and agency]]. Noting that social systems were distinct in structure and transmission. Lockwood's conceptual distinction influenced [[Jürgen Habermas]]' discussion in the classic ''Legitimation Crises'', who made the now famous distinction between system integration and social integration of the lifeworld.

===Cultural and socio-cultural integration===
[[Margaret Archer]] (2004) in a revised edition of her classic work ''Culture and Agency'', argues that the grand idea of a unified, integrated culture system, as advocated by early Anthropologists such as [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and later by [[Mary Douglas]], is a myth. Archer reads this same myth through Pitirim Sorokin's influence and then Talcott Parsons' approach to cultural systems (2004:3). The myth of a unified, integrated cultural system was also advanced by Western Marxists such as by [[Antonio Gramsci]] through the theory of [[cultural hegemony]] through a dominant culture. Basic to these mistaken conceptions was the idea of culture as a community of meanings, which function independently in motivating social behavior. This combined two independent factors, community and meanings which can be investigated quasi-independently (2004:4)

Archer, a proponent of [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], suggests that cultural factors can be objectively studied for the degree of compatibility (and that various aspects of cultural systems may be found to contradict each other in meaning and use). And, social or community factors in socialization may be studied in the context of the transmission of cultural factors by studying the social uniformity (or lack thereof) in the transmitted culture.  Cultural systems are used (and inform society) both through idea systems and the structuring of social systems. To quote Archer in this regard:
: "logical consistency is a property of the world of ideas; causal consistency is a property of people. The main proposition here is the two are logically and empirically distinct, hence can vary independently of one another. Thus it is perfectly conceivable that any social unit, from a community to a civilization, could be found the principle ideational elements (knowledge, belief, norms, language, mythology, etc.) of which do display considerable logical consistency&amp;nbsp;– that is, the components are consistent, not contradictory&amp;nbsp;– yet the same social unit may be low on causal consensus. " (2004:4)

Archer notes that the opposite may be the case: low cultural logical consistency and high social consistency. Complex societies can include complex sociocultural systems that mix of cultural and social factors with various levels of contradiction and consistency.

==Research==	
According to Burrowes (1996), in two recent approaches to the study of culture, in the 1980-1990s, the "cultural studies" and "cultural indicators" approaches, investigators explored the traditionally functionalist concern of "cultural systems integration." These two approaches could be synthesized in the investigating cultural systems. Burrowes (1996) writes, "If functionalism offers to this cross-fertilization a focus on the normative orders of society, the cultural indicators approach provides a rigorous methodology, and cultural studies caution a greater sensitivity to social hierarchies." Constrained by Merton's [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] [note: to be discussed here], the specification of cultural elements and social structures makes possible the investigation of specific cultural and social systems and their interaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3083">The '''derbfine''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|d|ɛr|ᵻ|ˈ|v|iː|n|ᵻ}}, {{lang-ga|dearbhfhine}} {{IPA-ga|dʲaɾˠəˈvˠiɲə}}, from ''derb'' 'real' + ''fine'' 'group of persons of the same family or kindred,' thus literally 'true kin'&lt;ref&gt;electronic Dictionary of the Irish Language s.v. [http://www.dil.ie/search?search_in=headword&amp;q=derbfine derbḟine]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a term for [[patrilineality|patrilineal group]]s and power structures defined in the first written tracts in [[Early Irish law]]. Its principal purpose was as an institution of property inheritance, with property redistributed on the death of a member to those remaining members of the derbfine. Comprising all the patrilineal descendants over a four-generation group with a common great-grandfather, it gradually gave way to a smaller three-generation kinship group, called the ''gelfine''.

Within a [[clan]], on the death of its chief or king, the surviving members of its derbfine would elect from their number a new chief and/or elect his successor, or ''[[Tánaiste]]'' (in English, his [[Tanistry|Tanist]]). A larger number of clan members, either allies or cousins who were too distantly related to be members of the derbfine, would not have a direct say in such an election. The frequent recitations of a clan's [[genealogy]] by its [[bard]]s was therefore a reminder of who was currently in or out of the clan's derbfine as much as it was a claim to ancient lineages.

Professor [[Francis John Byrne]] of [[University College Dublin]] also identified an ''indfine'' system used in some clans before the year 1000, with membership going back to a common great-great-great-grandfather, perhaps necessary at a time of frequent warfare.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Comparative systems==
In [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|later Anglo-Saxon England]], princes of the royal dynasty who were eligible for the kingship were known as [[ætheling]]s. In Wales, an [[edling]] was the term for an accepted [[heir apparent]] of a reigning Welsh monarch.

The inheritance of the Norman royal line on the death of [[Stephen, King of England]] and his succession by his cousin, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], is similar. Stephen's son was disinherited by consent and Henry was chosen as the equivalent of [[tanistry|tánaiste]] or next chieftain and succeeded to the English throne in 1154. The system was again attempted during the incapacity of [[Henry VI of England]], when the [[House of York]] obtained the support of some royal cousins to take the throne in 1461. By then the norm in Europe was the system of [[primogeniture]], which led on to the turbulent succession crises and policies of [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1527–36.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13235">The '''destruction of Mosul Museum artifacts''' became publicly known on February 26, 2015 when the group known as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] released a video showing their destruction.

==Mosul Museum==
The [[Mosul Museum]], opened in 1952, is the second largest museum in Iraq, with the first being the [[National Museum of Iraq]]. The museum is split into four areas of focus: The Assyrian hall, the Hatrene hall, the Islamic hall, and the Prehistoric hall.

===Importance of the region===
Iraq's present day borders overlap with the historic extent of [[Mesopotamia]]. Mesopotamia is considered to be one of the first areas in which urbanization evolved, beginning around the 4th millennia B.C. The "city" became the center of the new social system, resulting in the need of centralized power.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically, the land of Iraq holds evidence of the switch from stylized and schematic figures to more realistic representations of the human form. Writing evolved during this time period as well, allowing people to describe divine figures and conceptualize religion.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological efforts uncovered evidence of Mesopotamia as a world contemporary with the Bible, with many stories on cuneiform tablets describing versions of similar biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 22) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's understanding of Iraq and its history comes from the archaeological efforts that have taken place on its land. Because of a lack of visible architectural remains in the area, Mesopotamia, and Iraq in particular, are where the "treasure hunting" of old transformed into the beginnings of  the real archaeological research we know today. Archaeologists have been researching in Iraq for over a century and a half, lending us a great amount of time to truly understand the region's impact on those who live there and ultimately, the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction (2015)==

===Contents of ISIL video===
In a video shared on February 26, 2015, ISIL entered the Mosul Museum with the purpose of destroying artifacts they deemed "idolatrous". Members of the group can be seen pushing over many statues, while using jackhammers and sledgehammers to damage the faces of others. A spokesperson appears in the beginning of the video, explaining the rationale behind the group's actions. The rationale pertains to the assumption that these objects (statues, figurines, etc.) were once worshiped instead of Allah.

A translation from the video is as follows: "These ruins that are behind me, they are idols and statues that people in the past used to worship instead of Allah. The so-called Assyrians and Akkadians and others looked to gods for war, agriculture and rain to whom they offered sacrifices…The Prophet Mohammed took down idols with his bare hands when he went into Mecca. We were ordered by our prophet to take down idols and destroy them, and the companions of the prophet did this after this time, when they conquered countries." &lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damage===
Not all of the museum's collection was damaged by ISIL. However, the most impacted were the Assyrian and Hatrene areas of the museum. The Islamic hall, which still held many priceless antiquities, was not shown in the video. The Prehistoric hall was also never shown, though most of those artifacts had been removed prior to the destruction.

====Assyrian====
*Nergal Gate: The Nergal Gate is located on the north side of [[Nineveh]], an ancient Mesopotamian city located in present-day Mosul. The gate was built sometime between 704 and 690 BC, which was a time of expansion for Nineveh under the ruler [[Sennacherib]]. The gate is related to the ancient Mesopotamian god [[Nergal]], who was associated with the summer solstice, war, destruction, and the netherworld.   
*Lamassu: At the Nergal Gate's entrance, and just within the entrance, stand the [[lamassu]]. These mythological figures first began appearing in art and architecture during the first half of the second millennium B.C., and are described as large winged human-headed bulls. Aside from being decoration, the lamassu are protective figures, more specifically described as "a benevolent spirit attached to an individual, group, a place or an entrance." The lamassu erected at the entrance of the Nergal Gate at Nineveh are surrounded by relief sculpture that depicts the stages of transport of the human-headed bulls from quarries in Balatai.&lt;ref&gt;[Danrey, V. (2004). Winged Human-Headed Bulls of Ninevah: Genesis of an Iconographic Motif. Papers of the 49th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale. Vol. 66, Ninevah.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the release of the ISIL video on February 26, 2015, the lamassu were in various states of preservation. Of the two figures at the entrance of the gate, one still had its upper portion preserved. The video shows an ISIL member jackhammering face of the lamassu at the right side of the gate. The left one was probably untouched, as it has been missing its upper portion since the late 19th century. The ones located inside the gates were less well-preserved than their counterparts at the entrance. However, both were seen being damaged by jackhammers and sledgehammers. The Assyrian section within the Mosul Museum also holds other lamassu of an earlier style. These may also have become damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Balawat Gates====
The Mosul Museum holds in its collection numerous bronze bands of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). The bands are decorated with scenes of Assyrian war, hunt, and tribute.&lt;ref&gt;[J.E. Curtis &amp; N. Tallis. (2009). The Balawat gates of Ashurnasirpal II. In ''Journal of the American Oriental Society''. American Oriental Society. Vol. 129, No. 3. pp. 552-554.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Balawat Gates are of archaeological and historical significance because they are considered a "'major' find from a 'minor'" site.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt; Tell-Balawat, the site from which the Balawat Gates originate, was considered a small site in comparison to the neighboring Assyrian sites of Nineveh and Nimrud. Through further research, Tell-Balawat (also known as the city of Igmur-Enlil), was found to be within a "hollow-way" between Nineveh and Nimrud, suggesting that its purpose included defending these two cities.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The displayed bands are shown on ISIL's video, but it is unknown whether they were destroyed at that time. Because the Mosul Museum was previously looted in 2003, some of the bands were already missing. Since the bands are considered portable, it is assumed that some were sold on the black market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum holds a second pair of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Shalmaneser III. These are well documented, and can be used to aid in the identification of the Ashurnasirpal's bands if they arise.

====Hatrene statues====
Hatra was an ancient city located between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire, to the south of present-day Mosul. Its significance is great, as its historical and archaeological record indicate it was a wealthy trading city, influenced heavily by its neighboring peoples and empires. Hatra's artworks are of interest to scholars because they have been analyzed as hybrids of artistic styles from the West and East of the city. For example, a Hatrene statue of a seated goddess is described as having drapery consistent with Buddhist style, while also having the large, protruding eyes typical of Mesopotamian works.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, S. Said (1972). Hatra, Iraq. In ''Archaeology''. Archaeological Institute of America. Vol. 25, No. 2. pp. 103-111.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Hercules Hatra Iraq Parthian period 1st 2nd century CE.jpg|thumb|Hatrene statue of Hercules]]

The Mosul Museum was home to a variety of Hatra's sculptures. Most of the sculptures were images of Hatrene kings or noblemen. The ISIL video shows many of these sculptures being hit with sledgehammers and toppled to the ground. Of the 27 known Hatrene sculptures of kings, 4 were seen damaged in the ISIL video. This represents a 15% loss of these sculptures that are known to be in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-2-the-sculptures-from-hatra/ Assessing the Damange at the Mosul Museum, Part 2: The Sculptures from Hatra]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Questioned authenticity of damaged artifacts====
According to Iraqi archaeologists, some of the collection belonging to the Mosul Museum was moved to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad six months prior to the release of the ISIL video. This spared many priceless artifacts from becoming damaged. Additionally, sources have suggested that a portion of the artifacts shown being damaged in the video were in fact reproductions or reconstructions. However, Iraqi archaeologists state this may not be the case entirely. Some artworks known to have been genuine were not shown in the video, leading archaeologists to believe that the portable objects were looted, while larger, non-portable objects were the only ones to be damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/full-story-isil-takeover-mosul-museum-150309053022129.html/ The full story behind ISIL's takeover of Mosul Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===

The 2003 looting of the National Museum of Iraq showed the cultural heritage community the extreme importance of documentation within a museum or archaeological setting. The National Museum of Iraq lacked a complete inventory, which includes photographs of all objects. The problem became exacerbated when salvaged archaeological materials came into the museum in the late 1990s until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The influx of artifacts made it very difficult for the staff to keep up with its documentation process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajaonline.org/online-review-museum/364 Learning from the Iraq Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://professorhistoryx.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/what-isis-destroys-why-and-why-we-must-document-it-hyperallergic/ What ISIS Destroys, Why, and Why We Must Document It]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mosul Museum may be in this same situation, though information on its documentation processes has not come to light. If photographs of their artifacts are in existence, they will be useful in identifying and recovering the looted artifacts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10751">[[File:E-learning.jpg|thumb|A digital learning environment]]'''Digital scholarship''' is the use of digital evidence, methods of inquiry, research, publication and preservation to achieve scholarly and research goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rumsey|first=Abby|title=New-Model Scholarly Communication: Road Map for Change|url=http://www.uvasci.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SCI9-report.pdf|work=Scholarly Communication Institute 9|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital scholarship can encompass both [[scholarly communication]] using digital media and research on [[digital media]]. An important aspect of digital scholarship is the effort to establish digital media and [[social media]] as credible, professional and legitimate means of research and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Challenges of Digital Scholarship|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-challenges-of-digital-scholarship/38103|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital scholarship has a close association with [[digital humanities]], though the relationship between these terms is unclear.

Digital scholarship may also include [[born-digital]] means of scholarly communication that are more traditional, like online journals and databases, e-mail correspondence and the digital or digitized collections of research and [[academic libraries]]. Since digital scholarship is concerned with the production and distribution of digital media, discussions about [[copyright]], [[fair use]] and [[digital rights management]] (DRM) frequently accompany academic analysis of the topic. Combined with [[open access]], digital scholarship is offered as a more affordable and open model for scholarly communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hornby|first=Amanda|title=Digital scholarship and scholarly communication|url=http://www.uwb.edu/getattachment/tlc/faculty/teaching-resources/newmedia/scholarlycommunicationhandout.pdf|publisher=University of Washington Libraries|accessdate=30 July 2013|author2=Leslie Bussert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Empty section|date=April 2014}}

==Outlook==
According to [https://depts.washington.edu/gs630/Spring/Boyer.pdf Ernest L. Boyer in Scholarship Reconsidered], discovery, integration, application, and teaching are the four main aspects of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Nick; Scanlon, Eileen; Weller, Martin; Ashleigh, Melanie;. ' ' Digital Scholarship Considered.' ' In Education, p. 35. [http://ineducation.couros.ca/index.php/ineducation/article/view/44/509]&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of digital media means that the main areas of scholarship can each benefit from expansions in their own way thanks to the infinite sharability of digital content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1  = Feeney| first1 = Mary| last2  = Ross| first2 = Seamus| lastauthoramp = yes| title   = Information Technology in Humanities Scholarship, British Achievements, Prospects, and Barriers | journal = Historical Social Research| volume  = 19| issue   = 1 (69)| year    = 1994| pages = 3–59| jstor = 20755828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In education, the main areas of relevance are science, technology, engineering and math.  It is said that students learn best in a classroom when they are actively engaged.  The emergence of digital scholarship and digital media allows for another means for students to become engaged.  Key areas of academia that digital media is used on are to illustrate concepts, model displays and reinforce 21st century skills.&lt;ref&gt;Teachers' domain: digital media (including video!) resources for the STEM classroom and collection. 2010. Knowledgeable Quest, 39 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics cite concerns about the legitimacy, accessibility and verifiability of digital scholarship and the erosion of authors' rights as reasons to be concerned about digital scholarship. As scholarly communication evolves, controversy over the definition and value of the term "digital scholarship" is likely to continue.

Digital scholarship must take all of cultural, economic, personal, and institutional responsibilities to take its position as academic scholarship and to realize the core purpose of higher education with the possibilities of our time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayers|first=Edward L.|title=Does Digital Scholarship Have a Future?|url=https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERM1343.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property==
Concerns with how to regulate digital scholarship have arisen across universities across the world. The explosion in availability and creation of scholarly works has led many universities to adjust their policies on how they will manage scholarship in the future. These universities feel pressured to take action because digital technologies have led to the easy reproduction and commodification of these creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Sheri|title=Intellectual Property Policies in Academe: Issues and Concerns with Digital Scholarship|journal=Proceedings of the Charleston Library Conference|year=2012|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1389&amp;context=charleston|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities are unclear how to address the copyrighting of online classes and media presentations. Current law does not cover these specific areas of media produced in the academic world.&lt;ref name=IP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Sheri V.T.|title=Intellectual Property Policies in Academe: Issues and Concerns with Digital Scholarship|journal=Proceedings of the Charleston Library Conference|year=2012|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1389&amp;context=charleston|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past any printed work done by professors was considered their intellectual property, but now the question stands as to who owns these different forms of multimedia. One of the main concerns of faculty is that universities will soon take ownership of this digital media.

Universities have taken a growing interest in creations that have revenue-generating potential, like online classes or lecture slides, while also showing concern for products that may be used by comparable institutions, potentially reducing their competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; In order to stay on top of others academically, universities have sought to keep the intellectual property created within the university away from others schools. Not only are universities using digital scholarship to make money and stay ahead, but they also have interests in protecting their brand.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt;

While universities attempt to protect digital scholarship, it is in many professors best interests for their creations to be seen by the world as to grow their brand and acclaim as a professor. Laws that may apply to digital scholarship are largely outdated but professors would like to use the argument of faculty ownership of traditional works as historical practice and practice compatible with mission of higher education as a public good.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Professors argue that it took time and serious effort to make the presentations, slides, media.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; To date professors have been rarely questioned whether they have the right to bring their course outlines, lecture outlines, and lecture notes with them if they decide to leave the university where they created them.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Change over the ability of professors to bring digital scholarship with them is expected as universities have begun to take notice and assert copyrights.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Professors will argue that since they are the creators and authors of the product they are the owners according to law.

As of now most copyright laws in America indicate that the author or creator holds the copyright, but the same cannot be said for digital scholarship. The law explicitly states that if the work is within the scope of his or her employment then the work is the property of the employer.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Since the employer here would be the university, professors are technically creating [[work for hire]]. While faculty of universities appear to not be credited for their work, the primary reason for a university to take ownership of a faculty's work is that the member created the work using university funds mostly.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Solutions to the lack of clear laws regarding ownership of digital scholarship are not currently being created but many universities have created written contracts with professors over who owns future work or what they can do with previous work.

For example, in the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Stanford v. Roche]]'', the court decided that Roche, a former Stanford researcher, was a co-owner with Stanford of patents for testing kits to detect  HIV.&lt;ref name=Stand&gt;{{cite web|last=Lapin|first=Lisa|title=Stanford 'disappointed' in Supreme Court ruling in Roche case|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/june/court-roche-ruling-060711.html|publisher=Stanford News|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this case does not deal with digital scholarship directly, it deals with the ownership of intellectual property of university employees when they leave. This case will set a precedent for future decisions with online classes, lecture notes, and outlines.

==NEA Policy==
The [[National Education Association]] (NEA), the largest professional educational association in the United States, updated its policy on digital learning in 2013. The policy stresses that students need to develop "advanced critical thinking and information literacy skills and master new digital tools," as well as "the initiative to become self-directed learners while adapting to the ever-changing digital information landscape." The NEA also believes that digital learning creates an environment in which learning can be more individualized to meet the needs of each student. The NEA mandates that all public schools must do their best to acquire necessary modern technologies and constantly revise teaching plans to incorporate technology where viable to best prepare students for the 21st century. The NEA's digital learning policy also states that technology must be used in an adaptive manner as to not become a distraction and to remain a tool, as well as that technology should not become a replacement for instructors, merely a supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEA Policy Statement on Digital Learning|url=http://www.nea.org/home/55434.htm|publisher=National Education Association|accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flavius Dioscorus''' ({{lang-el|Φλαύϊος Διόσκορος}} ''Flauios Dioskoros'') lived during the 6th century A.D. in the village of [[Per-Wadjet (Upper Egypt)|Aphrodito]], [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], and therefore is called by modern scholars '''Dioscorus of Aphrodito'''.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was an Egyptian, he composed poetry in [[Byzantine literature|Greek]], the cultural language of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Era]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; His poems are the oldest surviving poems written by the hand of a known poet.&lt;ref&gt;Parca 1991, 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts, which contain his corrections and revisions, were discovered on [[papyrus]] in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1911, pp. 454–456.&lt;/ref&gt; and are now held in museums and libraries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan 1984a, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Dioscorus was also occupied in [[Roman law|legal work]], and legal documents and drafts involving him, his family, Aphroditans, and others were discovered along with his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 4; [[Jean-Luc Fournet|Fournet]]-Magdelaine 2008, pp. 310–343.&lt;/ref&gt; As an administrator of the village of Aphrodito, he composed petitions on behalf of its citizens, which are unique for their poetic and religious qualities.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 16–19 and ff.; Kovelman 1991, pp. 138–148; Kuehn 1995, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Dioscorus was a Christian (a [[Copts|Copt]]) and lived in a [[Coptic monasticism|religiously active environment]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 5–7; Kuehn 1995, pp. 56–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of Greek and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] papyri associated with Dioscorus and Aphrodito is one of the most important finds in the history of [[papyrology]] and has shed considerable light on the law and society of Byzantine Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Bell-Crum 1925, p. 177; Kuehn 1995, p. 47; Ruffini 2008, pp. 150–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papyrus ==
The papyri of Dioscorus were discovered by accident in July 1905 in the village of Kom Ashkaw (also called Kom Ishgau, Kom Ishqaw, etc.), which was built above the ancient site of Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre 1907, pp. viii–xi.&lt;/ref&gt; An inhabitant was renovating his home when a wall collapsed and revealed a chasm below. Papyrus rolls and fragments were seen in the crevice, but by the time the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities|Antiquities Service]] was notified and arrived, most of the papyrus was gone. During subsequent excavations, a large jar filled with papyrus was discovered in a Roman-style house. Important fragments of [[Ancient Greek comedy|Athenian Comedy]], both Old and New, were discovered among these papyri, including fragments of the famous comedy writer [[Menander]].&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre 1907, 1911; Gomme-Sandbach 1973; Koenen 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also fragments of Homer's [[Iliad]] and other literary works and reference works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Luc Fournet|Fournet]] 1999, pp. 9–237; Fournet-Magdelaine 2008, pp. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jean Maspero.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Maspero]], editor of the first collection of Dioscorian poems (1911)]]

Most importantly, the excavator Gustave Lefebvre unearthed an archive of sixth-century legal, business, and personal papers, and original poetry. These were turned over to the young scholar Jean Maspero, son of the Director of the Antiquities Service of Egypt, who edited and published the documents and poems in several journal articles &lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1908–1910, 1910, 1911, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; and two volumes of the ''Catalogue général des antiquités égyptiennes du Musée du Caire: Papyrus grecs d’époque byzantine'' (Cairo 1911, 1913). Jean was killed in the battle at Vauquois on the Lorraine during [[World War I]], and his father Gaston completed the third volume of Dioscorian papyri in 1916. Other Dioscorian papyri, obtained by antiquities dealers through sales and clandestine excavations,&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Maspero, intro. to P.Cair.Masp. III, p. viii; Keenan 1984a, pp. 52–53, and 2009, p. 66; Gagos-van Minnen 1994, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; were published in Florence, London, Paris, Strasbourg, Princeton, [[University of Michigan Papyrus Collection|Ann Arbor]], the Vatican, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See note 5 above.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aphrodito ==
The village of Kom Ashkaw is in [[Geography of Egypt|Middle Egypt]], south of Cairo and north of Luxor. It was originally an Egyptian city, but after [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt in 332 B.C., it was given the Greek name "Aphroditopolis" (“The City of [[Aphrodite]]”) and was made the capital city of its ''[[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]'' (an administrative district, like a US county). Before the 6th century, however, [[Aphroditopolis Nome|Aphroditopolis]] lost its status as a city, and the capital of the ''nome'' was moved across the Nile River to [[Antaeopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 6; Kuehn 1995, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The village of Aphrodito and the city of Antaeopolis were part of a larger, merged administrative district called the [[Thebaid]], which was under the jurisdiction of a ''[[dux|doux]]'', appointed by the [[Byzantine Emperor]]. The ''doux'' had his administrative center in [[Antinopolis|Antinoopolis]] on the east bank of the [[Nile|Nile River]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall-Rathbone 2004, pp. 169–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aphrodito was situated in an environment that was highly poetic and religious. [[Nonnus]], the most influential poet of the Early Byzantine Era (A.D. 300–700), had come from Panopolis, 42&amp;nbsp;km. southeast of Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron 2007; pp. 34–39; Cavero 2008, pp. 15–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Other poets from the Thebaid had not only become celebrities—such as [[Musaeus Grammaticus]], Colluthus, and Christodorus—but also were part of a poetic revolution of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron 1965 passim; MacCoull 1988, pp. 59–61; Cavero 2008, pp. 25–105.&lt;/ref&gt; These poets, though Egyptians, wrote their verses in the Greek dialect of [[Homer]], who had composed his Iliad and Odyssey more than a thousand years before them. Perhaps one of the reasons for this movement was to usurp the pagan vocabulary and style of the most honored ancient poet for Christian purposes. Dioscorus continued and developed this revolution by writing [[Encomium|encomiastic poems]] (poems of praise) in an Homeric style.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1985, p. 9; Fournet 1999, pp. 673–675.&lt;/ref&gt; The community was also active religiously. According to the New Testament, Egypt was the first home of [[Flight into Egypt|young Jesus and his family]].&lt;ref&gt;Mt 2:13–21.&lt;/ref&gt; And according to [[Church Fathers|Patristic literature]], Egypt was the birthplace of [[Christian monasticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Athanasius, Life of Antony.&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Egypt, the areas of [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitria]], [[Kellia]], and [[Wadi El Natrun|Wadi Natrun]] contained large monastic centers that attracted devout followers from both the Eastern and Western halves of the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall-Rathbone 2004, pp. 107–115.&lt;/ref&gt; In southern Egypt, one of the first Christian monasteries was established at [[Pachomius|Pbow]], 127&amp;nbsp;km. southeast of Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Gascou 1976, pp. 157–184; Rousseau 1985 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 40&amp;nbsp;km. south of Aphrodito was the [[White Monastery]], founded by the vigorous Coptic monk [[Shenoute]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmel 2004 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; The father of Dioscorus himself, Apollos, established and later entered his own monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Gascou 1981, pp. 219–230.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Aphrodito and its vicinity “boasted over thirty churches and nearly forty monasteries.”&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

===Early years===
There is no surviving record for the early years of Dioscorus. His father Apollos was an entrepreneur and local official.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan 1984b passim; Kuehn 1995, pp. 54–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly accepted date for the birth of Dioscorus is around A.D. 520.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1911, p. 457; MacCoull 1988, p. 9; Kuehn 1995, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no evidence, it is likely that Dioscorus went to school in [[Alexandria]], where one of his teachers might have been the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[John Philoponus]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1987 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Alexandria was not the most prominent place for a legal education – that was the city of [[Beirut]] – young men did travel there for rhetorical training preliminary to the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;Cribiore 2007, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; These included the celebrated poet [[Agathias]], a contemporary of Dioscorus, who at an early age published a successful collection of poems called the Cycle and later became the center of a circle of prominent poets in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan and Averil Cameron 1966, pp. 8–10; Averil Cameron 1970 1–11, 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Aphrodito, Dioscorus married, had children, and pursued a career similar to his father's: acquiring, leasing out, and managing property, and helping in the administration of the village.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan 1988, p. 173; Kuehn 1995, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; His first dated appearance in the papyrus is 543. Dioscorus had the assistant of the ''[[defensor civitatis]]'' of Antaeopolis examine the damage done by a shepherd and his flock to a field of crops, which was owned by the Monastery of Apa Sourous but managed by Dioscorus.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. I 67087; Keenan 1985, pp. 245–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constantinople===
[[Image:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''Empress Theodora.'' Mosaic. San Vitale, Ravenna.&lt;br /&gt;6th century representation of the Empress Theodora.]]

Dioscorus also became engaged in legal work. In 546/7, after his father Apollos died, Dioscorus wrote a formal petition to [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] and a formal explanation to [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Empress Theodora]] about tax conflicts affecting Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. I 67019 v, and P.Cair.Masp. III 67283.&lt;/ref&gt; The village was under the special patronage of the Empress,&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, intro. to P.Cair.Masp. III 67283, pp. 15–17; Bell 1944, p. 31; Keenan 1984a, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and had been granted the status of ''autopragia''.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, p. 53 note 58.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the village could collect its own public taxes and deliver them directly to the imperial treasury. Aphrodito was not under the jurisdiction of the [[pagarch]], stationed in Antaeopolis, who handled the public taxes for the rest of the ''nome''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Gascou|Gascou]] 1972, pp. 60–72; Liebeschuetz 1973, pp. 38–46, and 1974, pp. 163–168.&lt;/ref&gt; Dioscorus's petition and explanation to the imperial palace described the pagarch's violations of their special tax status, including theft of the collected tax money.

The communications to Constantinople seem to have had little effect, and in 551 (three years after the death of Theodora), Dioscorus travelled with a contingency of Aphroditans to Constantinople to present the problem to the Emperor directly. Dioscorus may have spent three years in the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Salomon 1948, pp. 98 – 108; Fournet 1999, pp. 318 – 321.&lt;/ref&gt; In poetry, the city was very active. Not only was [[Agathias]] now writing there, but also [[Paul the Silentiary]] and [[Romanus the Melodist]]. In respect to the Aphroditans' tax problems, Dioscorus was able to obtain an imperial rescript, three copies of which have survived in his archive.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. I 67024 r, v, and 67025.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor instructs the Duke of the Thebaid to investigate and, if justified, to stop the aggressions of the pagarch. There is no evidence of further tax violations by the pagarch until after the death of Justinian in 565.

===Antinoopolis===

[[Image:Petersinai.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''St. Peter.'' Encaustic icon. Sinai.&lt;br /&gt;6th century representation of St. Peter as a Roman consul.]]

In 565/6 Dioscorus left Aphrodito for Antinoopolis, the capital city of the Thebaid and the residence of the ''doux''.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 11–12; Kuehn 1995, p. 66.
&lt;/ref&gt; He remained there for about seven years. His motivation for the move is nowhere made clear. But surmising from the surviving documents, one can conclude that he was attracted by the opportunity to advance his legal career in the proximity of the Duke and likewise was compelled by the increasing violence of the pagarch against Aphrodito and his own family.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal documents from that period show that Dioscorus wrote the final will for the Surgeon General (Phoebammon),&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. II 67151 and 67152.&lt;/ref&gt; arbitrated in family property disputes,&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P.Lond. V 1708.&lt;/ref&gt; composed marriage and divorce contracts,&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1993, pp. 103–106, and 1995, p. 70 note 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued writing petitions about the offenses of the pagarch. One such petition, P.Cair.Masp. I 67002, describes how a group of Aphroditans on their way to the annual cattle market were ambushed. They were eventually put into a prison in Antaeopolis, under the control of the pagarch Menas, where they were tortured and robbed and their animals were seized. Menas and his men then attacked the village of Aphrodito itself: he blocked the [[Bahr Yussef|irrigation]], extorted money, burned down homes, and violated the nuns. All these crimes were committed in the name of collecting the public taxes, although Aphrodito had never failed a payment and Menas had no right to collect them. A formal explanation, P.Lond. V 1677, describes the attacks by Menas on Dioscorus himself and his family. He seized property owned by Dioscorus and transferred it to his assistants, leaving Dioscorus with only the tax liability. Menas proceeded to pillage the home of Dioscorus's brother-in-law and seized his land too, reducing him and his family to poverty. He then arrested Dioscorus's own son.

Before May 574, Dioscorus left Antinoopolis.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 14; Kuehn 1995, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for his departure is not explained. It might have been related to domestic affairs, to his career, or to the changed situation in Constantinople. The violent crimes against Aphrodito and Dioscorus (described above) were committed under the reign of [[Justin II]], who had launched a savage persecution of Christians that did not adhere to [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian]] dogmas, including [[Monophysitism|Egyptian Copts]]. But Justin went completely insane and abdicated, and in 574, [[Tiberius II Constantine|Tiberius]] and Empress [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]], the wife of Justin, took over the management of the Byzantine Empire.

=== Return to Aphrodito ===

Back home in Aphrodito, it seems that Dioscorus withdrew from legal affairs and administrative responsibilities. Much of his poetry was composed during his stay in Antinoopolis or after he had returned to Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 13–14; Kuehn 1995, pp. 73, 75–76; Fournet 1999, pp. 321–324.&lt;/ref&gt; His documents now focus on mundane, rural activities. His last dated document, a land lease written by his hand in an account book, is April 5, 585.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. III 67325 IV r 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry ==

===Publications===
Dioscorus might have recited his poems and circulated them locally, but there is no evidence that they were ever published during his lifetime. Jean Maspero published the first collection of Dioscorian poems in 1911: “Un dernier poète grec d’Égypte: Dioscore, fils d’Apollôs.”&lt;ref&gt;Revue des études grecques 24: 426–81.&lt;/ref&gt; This journal article included the texts of 13 poems, French translations, and an analysis of the style. Then between 1911 and 1916, Jean and Gaston Maspero republished the poems along with Dioscorian documents in three volumes of ''Papyrus grecs d'époque byzantine''.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue général des antiquités égyptiennes du Musée du Caire: Papyrus grecs d’époque byzantine, 3 vols. (Cairo, 1911–1916). [P.Cair.Masp. I–III]&lt;/ref&gt; These poems were all part of the papyrus collection owned by the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]. In 1962, Ernst Heitsch published 29 Dioscorian poems that were among papyrus fragments held in a variety of museums and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Die griechischen Dichterfragmente der römischen Kaiserzeit, Vol. 1, 2nd edn. (Göttingen, 1963); Vol. 2 (Göttingen, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; For over thirty-five years, this was the authoritative edition. The most comprehensive edition at the present time is by [[Jean-Luc Fournet]], who in 1999 published 51 Dioscorian poems and fragments (including 2 that he considered of dubious authenticity).&lt;ref&gt;Hellénisme dans l’Égypte du VIe siècle. La bibliothèque et l’œuvre de Dioscore d’Aphrodité [MIFAO 115], 2 vols. (Cairo 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the texts and commentaries offered by Maspero, Heitsch, [[Jean-Luc Fournet|Fournet]], and the initial editors of other poems, a comprehensive study of his poetry was published by Leslie MacCoull in 1988: ''Dioscorus of Aphrodito: His Work and His World'' (Berkeley). Clement Kuehn published a reinterpretation of his poetry in 1995: ''Channels of Imperishable Fire: The Beginnings of Christian Mystical Poetry and Dioscorus of Aphrodito'' (New York).

===Interpretations===
The reactions by modern readers to his poetry have varied widely. The papyrologists and historians that first examined them were not impressed. Influenced by their backgrounds in [[List of Ancient Greek poets|Classical poetry]], they compared the Dioscorian verses primarily to Classical standards. The most frequent objection was that his verses were obscure: the editors thought that the lines did not make sense – or at least, were not saying what the editors expected them to say.&lt;ref&gt;“Le style de Dioscore fait pauvre figure” (Maspero 1911, p. 472; cf. 427). “At no moment has he any real control of thought, diction, grammar, metre, or meaning” (Milne 1927, p. 68). “So ist doch selbst dort, wo der Text heil zu sein scheint, der Gedankengang nicht immer verständlich” (Heitsch 1963, p. 16 note 1).&lt;/ref&gt; A more positive assessment was offered by Leslie MacCoull, who insisted that a reader must take Dioscorus’s Coptic background into consideration when reading the poetry.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 57–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the poems seemed to be praising unknown dignitaries – including an Emperor and several Dukes – and some papyrologists concluded that Dioscorus wrote the poems to get favors from government administrators (whom the papyrologists vaguely and inconsistently identified).&lt;ref&gt;“C’est que, pour Dioscore, la poésie semble ne se concevoir que dans l’adversité : elle est destinée à obtenir, non à donner” (Fournet 1999, p. 325).&lt;/ref&gt; Clement Kuehn, however, proposed that the poems be viewed not from a Classical, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], or even a strictly [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian]] perspective,&lt;ref&gt;“To be sure, most of these poems are not great works of literature, especially when compared with their illustrious classical models” (Gagos-van Minnen 1994, p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt; but through a lens of [[Byzantine literature|Byzantine culture]] and [[Christian mysticism|spirituality]], in which Dioscorus and the Thebaid were so deeply immersed. Kuehn demonstrated that the poems fit neatly and masterfully into the [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegorical style]] that was pervasive in the pictoral art and literature of the Early Byzantine Era.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann 1978, pp. 40–55; Lamberton 1986 passim; Dawson 1992 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; That is: Dioscorus, influenced by allegorical commentaries on the [[Homeric scholarship|Homeric epics]] and Bible, and by the allegorical icons and church art of the [[Byzantine art|6th century]], was praising Christ, Old Testament patriarchs, and the saints in heaven as if they were the Emperor, kings, and dignitaries in a Byzantine court.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, pp. 2, 156, and passim; Kuehn 2011, pp. 9–12 (“Introduction”).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distancing language''' is [[phrase|phrasing]] used by a person to "distance" themselves from a statement, either to avoid thinking about the subject or to distance themselves from its content. [[Euphemistic]] in nature, distancing language is often a means of [[self-deception]], but distancing language used orally may indicate that a person is [[lie|lying]]. This is especially apparent when someone is attempting to avoid consequences that they believe may arise from their statements or while trying to justify the unpleasant content of their statements by trivializing it.

[[Circumlocution]], [[synecdoches]], [[metaphors]], [[Trivialization (psychology)|trivialization]], [[innuendos]], [[litotes]], [[Meiosis (figure of speech)|meiosis]], [[Elegant variation|elegant variation]], [[equivocation]], etc. are all readily used to this end.

==Examples of distancing language==

* Distancing clinical language partly shields health workers from the impact of workplace experiences, e.g. "bled to death" substituted with "[[exsanguination|exsanguinated]]".
* [[Military personnel]] may use a range of distancing terms for [[combatants]] either killing or getting killed. They may also employ distancing, dehumanizing terms for enemy combatants. "[[Collateral damage]]" for the incidental or accidental killing of [[non-combatants]] during attacks on [[legitimate military target]]s is an example. Also "blue-on-blue" or [[friendly fire|"friendly" fire]].
* Everyday [[euphemism|euphemistic]] references to death, dying, burial, corpses and to the people and places which deal with death are also protective, distancing terms either formal or informal, respectful or disrespectful, e.g. "croaked", "bought the farm", "expired", "passed on".
* An indirect statement implying an answer, rather than a direct answer, may indicate lying. For example, replies such as "would I do such a thing?" or even "I wouldn't do such a thing", rather than "I didn't do it". Referring to someone known well by the speaker as "that woman" instead of using a name or "her" is another example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/09/16/MN241376.DTL&amp;type=science|title = The lie detective / S.F psychologist has made a science of reading facial expressions - SFGate|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date = 2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other examples of distance language exist, perhaps to the point where no list could be exhaustive.

[[File:Comedy and tragedy masks without background.svg|upright=0.9|right|thumb|Comedy and tragedy masks]]
'''Drama''' is the specific [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of [[fiction]] [[Mimesis|represented]] in [[performance]]: a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[mime]], [[ballet]], etc, performed in a [[theatre]], or on [[Radio drama|radio]] or television.&lt;ref name="elam98"&gt;Elam (1980, 98).&lt;/ref&gt; Considered as a genre of [[poetry]] in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and the [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] modes ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of [[dramatic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Fergusson]] writes that "a drama, as distinguished from a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]], is not primarily a composition in the verbal medium; the [[Dialogue (fiction)|words]] result, as one might put it, from the underlying [[Dramatic structure|structure of incident]] and [[Character (arts)|character]]. As [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] remarks, 'the poet, or "maker" should be the maker of [[Plot (narrative)|plots]] rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he [[Mimesis|imiates]], and what he imitates are [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]'" (1949, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term "drama" comes from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "[[Action (philosophy)|action]]" ([[Classical Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δρᾶμα}}, ''drama''), which is derived from "I do" ([[Classical Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δράω}}, ''drao''). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional [[Genre|generic]] division between [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. 

In English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word "[[Play (theatre)|play]]" or "game" (translating the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''pleġan'' or [[Latin]] ''ludus'') was the standard term used to describe drama until [[William Shakespeare]]'s time—just as its creator was a "play-maker" rather than a "dramatist" and the building was a "play-house" rather than a "[[Theater (building)|theatre]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1959, 32—41; 1969, 133; 1981, 68—69). The sense of the creator of plays as a "maker" rather than a "writer" is preserved in the word "[[playwright]]." [[The Theatre]], one of the first purpose-built playhouses in London, was "a self-conscious latinism to describe one particular playhouse" rather than a term for the buildings in general (1967, 133). The word 'dramatist' "was at that time still unknown in the English language" (1981, 68).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of "drama" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific ''type'' of [[play (theatre)|play]] dates from the modern era. "Drama" in this sense refers to a play that is ''neither'' a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, [[Émile Zola|Zola's]] ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' ([[1873 in literature|1873]]) or [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov's]] ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' ([[1887 in literature|1887]]). It is this narrower sense that the [[film]] and [[television]] industries, along with [[film studies]], adopted to describe "[[Drama (film and television)|drama]]" as a [[Film genre|genre]] within their respective media. "[[Radio drama]]" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of [[radio]].&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 894–900).&lt;/ref&gt;

The enactment of drama in [[theatre]], performed by [[actor]]s on a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] before an [[audience]], presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref&gt;Pfister (1977, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body. Drama can be combined with [[music]]: the dramatic text in [[opera]] is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musical theatre|Musicals]] include both spoken [[dialogue]] and [[song]]s; and some forms of drama have [[incidental music]] or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue ([[melodrama]] and Japanese [[Noh|Nō]], for example).&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;See the entries for "opera", "musical theatre, American", "melodrama" and "Nō" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Closet drama]] describes a form that is intended to be read, rather than performed.&lt;ref name="closet"&gt;''[[Manfred]]'' by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], for example, is a good example of a "[[Verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic poem]]." See the entry on "Byron (George George)" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.&lt;ref name="impro"&gt;Some forms of improvisation, notably the [[Commedia dell'arte]], improvise on the basis of 'lazzi' or rough outlines of scenic action (see Gordon (1983) and Duchartre (1929)). All forms of improvisation take their cue from their immediate response to one another, their characters' situations (which are sometimes established in advance), and, often, their interaction with the audience. The classic formulations of improvisation in the theatre originated with [[Joan Littlewood]] and [[Keith Johnstone]] in the UK and [[Viola Spolin]] in the USA; see Johnstone (1981) and Spolin (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Western drama==
===Classical Greek drama===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Greece}}
[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|''Relief of a seated poet ([[Menander]]) with masks of New Comedy'', 1st century BC – early 1st century AD, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]
[[Western culture|Western]] drama originates in [[classical Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), and Ley (2007, 206). Taxidou notes that "most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct" (2004, 104). Brown writes that [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] "was essentially the creation of [[classical Athens]]: all the dramatists who were later regarded as classics were active at Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the time of the [[Athenian democracy]]), and all the surviving plays date from this period" (1998, 441). "The dominant culture of [[Classical Athens|Athens in the fifth century]]", Goldhill writes, "can be said to have invented [[theatre]]" (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatrical culture]] of the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] produced three [[genre]]s of drama: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]]. Their origins remain obscure, though by the 5th century BC they were [[institution]]alised in [[Agon|competitions]] held as part of [[Athenian festivals|festivities]] celebrating the god [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Banham (1998, 441–447).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians know the names of many ancient Greek dramatists, not least [[Thespis]], who is credited with the innovation of an actor ("''hypokrites''") who speaks (rather than sings) and impersonates a [[Character (arts)|character]] (rather than speaking in his own person), while interacting with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and its leader ("''[[coryphaeus]]''"), who were a traditional part of the performance of non-dramatic poetry ([[dithyramb]]ic, [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Epic poetry|epic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 441–444). For more information on these ancient Greek dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a small fraction of the work of five dramatists, however, has survived to this day: we have a small number of complete texts by the tragedians [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], and the comic writers [[Aristophanes]] and, from the late 4th century, [[Menander]].&lt;ref&gt;The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] would bring this number to six dramatists whose work survives.&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus' historical tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' is the oldest surviving drama, although when it won first prize at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] competition in 472 BC, he had been writing plays for more than 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 8) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16).&lt;/ref&gt; The competition ("''[[agon]]''") for tragedies may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records ("''didaskaliai''") begin from 501 BC when the [[satyr play]] was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Banham (1998, 442).&lt;/ref&gt; Tragic dramatists were required to present a [[tetralogy]] of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play (though exceptions were made, as with Euripides' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' in 438 BC). [[Comedy]] was officially recognized with a prize in the competition from 487 to 486 BC.

Five comic dramatists competed at the City [[Dionysia]] (though during the [[Peloponnesian War]] this may have been reduced to three), each offering a single comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 18) and Banham (1998, 444–445).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is traditionally divided between "old comedy" (5th century BC), "middle comedy" (4th century BC) and "new comedy" (late 4th century to 2nd BC).&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 444–445).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Roman drama===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Statuette actor Petit Palais ADUT00192.jpg|thumb|An ivory statuette of a Roman actor of [[tragedy]], 1st century CE.]]
Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]].&lt;ref name="h43"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43).&lt;/ref&gt; From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; [[Theater of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 36, 47).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43). For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 46–47).&lt;/ref&gt; The first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] and [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] that [[Livius Andronicus]] wrote from 240 BC.&lt;ref name="h47"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write drama.&lt;ref name="h47" /&gt; No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both [[genres]], Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama.&lt;ref name="h47" /&gt;

By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a [[guild]] of writers (''collegium poetarum'') had been formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47–48).&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman comedies that have survived are all ''[[fabula palliata]]'' (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: [[Plautus|Titus Maccius Plautus]] (Plautus) and [[Terence|Publius Terentius Afer]] (Terence).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48–49).&lt;/ref&gt; In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in dividing the drama into [[episode]]s and introduced musical accompaniment to its [[dialogue]] (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence).&lt;ref name="h49"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49).&lt;/ref&gt; The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from [[eavesdropping]].&lt;ref name="h49" /&gt;

Plautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his [[farce]]s are best known; he was admired for the [[wit]] of his dialogue and his use of a variety of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meters]].&lt;ref name="h48"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48).&lt;/ref&gt; All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour.&lt;ref name="h48" /&gt; No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]], and [[Lucius Accius]].&lt;ref name="h49" /&gt;

From the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref name="h50"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 50).&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49–50).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.&lt;ref name="h50" /&gt;

===Medieval===
{{Main article|Medieval theatre}}
[[File:Castle of Perseverance staging.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stage drawing from a 15th-century [[vernacular]] [[morality play]] ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (as found in the [[Macro Manuscript]]).]]
Beginning in the [[early Middle Ages]], churches staged dramatised versions of biblical events, known as [[liturgical drama]]s, to enliven annual celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76, 78). Many churches would have only performed one or two [[liturgical drama]]s per year and a larger number never performed any at all.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest example is the [[Easter]] trope ''Whom do you Seek? (Quem-Quaeritis)'' (c. 925).&lt;ref name="Brockett_76"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76).&lt;/ref&gt; Two groups would sing responsively in [[Latin]], though no impersonation of [[Character (arts)|characters]] was involved. By the 11th century, it had spread through Europe to [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[Italy]]; excluding [[Al-Andalus|Islamic-era Spain]].

In the 10th century, [[Hrosvitha]] wrote six plays in Latin modeled on [[Terence]]'s comedies, but which treated religious subjects.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 77).&lt;/ref&gt; Her plays are the first known to be composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western drama of the post-Classical era.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt; Later, [[Hildegard of Bingen]] wrote a [[music]]al drama, ''Ordo Virtutum'' (c. 1155).&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt;

One of the most famous of the early [[Secularity|secular]] plays is the courtly [[pastoral]] ''[[Jeu de Robin et Marion|Robin and Marion]]'', written in the 13th century in French by [[Adam de la Halle]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1981, 191; 1987, 141).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' (c. 1300), one of the earliest known in English, seems to be the closest in tone and form to the contemporaneous French [[farce]]s, such as ''[[The Boy and the Blind Man]].''&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 9, 11, 38, 45), Dillon (2006, 213), and Wickham (1976, 195; 1981, 189–190). In ''Early English Stages'' (1981), Wickham points to the existence of ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' as evidence that the old-fashioned view that [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] began in England in the 1550s with ''[[Gammer Gurton's Needle]]'' and ''[[Ralph Roister Doister]]'' is mistaken, ignoring as it does a rich tradition of [[Medieval theatre|medieval comic drama]]; see Wickham (1981, 178).&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of plays survive from [[France]] and [[Germany]] in the [[late Middle Ages]], when some type of religious drama was performed in nearly every European country. Many of these plays contained [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s, and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt; In England, trade guilds began to perform [[vernacular]] "[[mystery plays]]," which were composed of long cycles of a large number of playlets or "pageants," of which four are [[Extant literature|extant]]: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and the so-called "[[N-Town Plays|N-Town]]" (42). ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play]]'' from the Wakefield cycle is a farcical story of a stolen sheep that its [[protagonist]], Mak, tries to pass off as his new-born child asleep in a crib; it ends when the shepherds from whom he has stolen are summoned to the [[Nativity of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morality plays]] (a modern term) emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished in the early [[Elizabethan era]] in England. Characters were often used to represent different ethical ideals. ''[[Everyman]]'', for example, includes such figures as Good Deeds, Knowledge and Strength, and this characterisation reinforces the conflict between good and evil for the audience.  ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (c. 1400—1425) depicts an archetypal figure's progress from birth through to death. ''[[Horestes]]'' (c. 1567), a late "hybrid morality" and one of the earliest examples of an English [[revenge play]], brings together the classical story of [[Orestes]] with a [[Vice (character)|Vice]] from the medieval [[Allegory|allegorical]] tradition, alternating comic, [[slapstick]] scenes with serious, [[Tragedy|tragic]] ones.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack (1958, 251-303), Bevington (1962, 58-61, 81-82, 87, 183), and Weimann (1978, 155).&lt;/ref&gt; Also important in this period were the folk dramas of the [[Mummers Play]], performed during the [[Christmas]] season. Court [[masque]]s were particularly popular during the reign of [[Henry VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 101-103).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabethan and Jacobean===
{{Main article|English Renaissance theatre}}
One of the great flowerings of drama in [[England]] occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many of these plays were written in verse, particularly [[iambic pentameter]]. In addition to Shakespeare, such authors as [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Thomas Middleton]], and [[Ben Jonson]] were prominent playwrights during this period. As in the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], historical plays celebrated the lives of past kings, enhancing the image of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] monarchy. Authors of this period drew some of their storylines from [[Greek mythology]] and [[Roman mythology]] or from the plays of eminent Roman playwrights such as [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].

===English Restoration comedy===
{{Main article|Restoration comedy}}
[[File:Colley Cibber as Lord Foppington in The Relapse by John Vanbrugh engraving.jpg|thumb|[[Colley Cibber]] as the extravagant and affected Lord Foppington, "brutal, evil, and smart", in [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh's]] ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696).]]

[[Restoration comedy]] refers to English comedies written and performed in England during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. [[Comedy of manners]] is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy.&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur [https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; After [[London theatre closure 1642|public theatre had been banned]] by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 with the Restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hatch|first1=Mary Jo|title=The Three Faces of Leadership: Manager, Artist, Priest|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration comedy is known for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness, urbane, cosmopolitan [[wit]], up-to-the-minute topical writing, and crowded and bustling plots. Its dramatists stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] plays, and even from [[Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Classics|classical]] comedies, combining the various plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized "variety" within as well as between plays. Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of the first professional female playwright, [[Aphra Behn]], in the 1680s is an important exception. In the mid-1690s, a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are significantly different from each other.

The unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]] reflected the atmosphere at Court and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]] (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). The single play that does most to support the charge of [[obscenity]] levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's masterpiece ''[[The Country Wife]]'' (1675), whose title contains a [[Lascivious behavior|lewd]] [[pun]] and whose notorious "china scene" is a series of sustained [[double entendre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|ROI9FhR6URI|The "China scene" from Wycherley's play}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the "softer" comedies of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh]] set out to appeal to more socially diverse audience with a strong middle-class element, as well as to female spectators. The comic focus shifts from young lovers outwitting the older generation to the vicissitudes of marital relations. In Congreve's ''[[Love for Love]]'' (1695) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), the give-and-take set pieces of couples testing their attraction for one another have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the latter's famous "Proviso" scene. Vanbrugh's ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) has a light touch and more humanly recognisable characters, while ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696) has been admired for its throwaway wit and the characterisation of Lord Foppington, an extravagant and affected [[burlesque]] [[fop]] with a dark side.&lt;ref&gt;''The Provoked Wife'' is something of a Restoration [[problem play]] in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of "divorce" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the [[House of Lords]].&lt;/ref&gt; The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out by the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did.&lt;ref&gt;Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were [[demographic]] change, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]]'s and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place.&lt;/ref&gt; At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of ''The Way of the World'', Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by [[sentimental comedy]] and the drama of exemplary morality.

===Modern and postmodern===
The pivotal and innovative contributions of the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th-century]] Norwegian dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]] and the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th-century]] German [[theatre practitioner]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] dominate modern drama; each inspired a tradition of imitators, which include many of the greatest playwrights of the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1993, 25–26) and Moi (2006, 17). Moi writes that "Ibsen is the most important playwright writing after Shakespeare. He is the founder of modern theater. His plays are world classics, staged on every continent, and studied in classrooms everywhere. In any given year, there are hundreds of Ibsen productions in the world." Ibsenites include [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Arthur Miller]]; Brechtians include [[Dario Fo]], [[Joan Littlewood]], [[W. H. Auden]] [[Peter Weiss]], [[Heiner Müller]], [[Peter Hacks]], [[Tony Kushner]], [[Caryl Churchill]], [[John Arden]], [[Howard Brenton]], [[Edward Bond]], and [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]].&lt;/ref&gt; The works of both playwrights are, in their different ways, both [[Modernism|modernist]] and [[Realism (theatre)|realist]], incorporating formal [[Experimental theatre|experimentation]], [[meta-theatre|meta-theatricality]], and [[Social criticism|social critique]].&lt;ref&gt;Moi (2006, 1, 23–26). Taxidou writes: "It is probably historically more accurate, although methodologically less satisfactory, to read the [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalist movement in the theatre]] in conjunction with the more anti-illusionist aesthetics of the theatres of the same period. These interlock and overlap in all sorts of complicated ways, even when they are vehemently denouncing each other (perhaps particularly when) in the favoured mode of the time, the manifesto" (2007, 58).&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the traditional theoretical discourse of genre, Ibsen's work has been described as the culmination of "[[Tragedy#Modern development|liberal tragedy]]", while Brecht's has been aligned with an [[Historicization|historicised]] comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966) and Wright (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important playwrights of the modern era include Antonin Artaud, [[August Strindberg]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Dario Fo]], [[Heiner Müller]], and [[Caryl Churchill]].

== Opera ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
[[Opera|Western opera]] is a dramatic art form that arose during the [[Renaissance]] in an attempt to revive the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|classical Greek drama]] in which dialogue, dance, and song were combined. Being strongly intertwined with [[Classical music|western classical music]], the opera has undergone enormous changes in the past four centuries and it is an important form of theatre until this day. Noteworthy is the major influence of the German 19th-century composer [[Wagner|Richard Wagner]] on the opera tradition. In his view, there was no proper balance between music and theatre in the operas of his time, because the music seemed to be more important than the dramatic aspects in these works. To restore the connection with the classical drama, he entirely renewed the operatic form to emphasize the equal importance of music and drama in works that he called "[[music drama]]s".

[[Chinese opera]] has seen a more conservative development over a somewhat longer period of time.

== Pantomime ==
{{Main|Pantomime}}
[[Pantomime]] (informally '''panto'''),&lt;ref&gt;Lawner, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[musical theatre|musical comedy]] stage production, designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or [[Folklore|folk tale]].&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline. "Pantomime", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', Jack Zipes (ed.), Oxford University Press (2006), {{ISBN|9780195146561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer (1969), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.

These stories follow in the tradition of [[fable]]s and [[Folklore|folk tale]]s. Usually, there is a lesson learned, and with some help from the audience, the hero/heroine saves the day. This kind of play uses [[stock character]]s seen in masque and again [[commedia dell'arte]], these characters include the villain (doctore), the clown/servant (Arlechino/Harlequin/buttons), the lovers etc. These plays usually have an emphasis on [[moral dilemma]]s, and good always triumphs over evil, this kind of play is also very entertaining making it a very effective way of reaching many people.

Pantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre. It developed partly from the 16th century [[commedia dell'arte]] tradition of Italy, as well as other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century [[masque]]s and [[music hall]].&lt;ref name=Reid/&gt; An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the [[harlequinade]].&lt;ref name=HistoryIBY&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/Factsheets/The%20History%20of%20Pantomime.pdf "The History of Pantomime"], It's-Behind-You.com, 2002, accessed 10 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Britain the word "pantomime" is usually used to mean '''[[Mime artist|miming]]''', rather than the theatrical form discussed here.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Webster's New World Dictionary]]'', World Publishing Company, 2nd College Edition, 1980, p. 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mime==
[[Mime artist|Mime]] is a theatrical medium where the action of a story is told through the movement of the body, without the use of speech. Performance of mime occurred in [[Ancient Greece]], and the word is taken from a single masked dancer called ''Pantomimus'', although their performances were not necessarily silent.&lt;ref&gt;Gutzwiller (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Medieval]] Europe, early forms of mime, such as [[Mummers Play|mummer play]]s and later [[dumbshow]]s, evolved. In the early nineteenth century [[Paris]], [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]] solidified the many attributes that we have come to know in modern times, including the silent figure in whiteface.&lt;ref&gt;Rémy (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Copeau]], strongly influenced by [[Commedia dell'arte]] and Japanese [[Noh]] theatre, used masks in the training of his actors. [[Étienne Decroux]], a pupil of his, was highly influenced by this and started exploring and developing the possibilities of mime and refined [[corporeal mime]] into a highly sculptural form, taking it outside of the realms of [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]]. [[Jacques Lecoq]] contributed significantly to the development of mime and [[physical theatre]] with his training methods.&lt;ref name=Callery&gt;Callery (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballet==
While some ballet emphasises "the lines and patterns of movement itself" dramatic dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; Such ballets are theatrical works that have characters and "tell a story",&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; Dance movements in ballet "are often closely related to everyday forms of physical expression, [so that] there is an expressive quality inherent in nearly all dancing", and this is used to convey both action and emotions; mime is also used.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', which tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse, [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ballet ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', based on Shakespeare's famous play, and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', which tells tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets.

== Creative drama ==
Creative drama includes dramatic activities and games used primarily in educational settings with children. Its roots in the United States began in the early 1900s. [[Winifred Ward]] is considered to be the founder of creative drama in education, establishing the first academic use of drama in Evanston, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich (1974, 75–80).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian drama==
===India===
{{Main|Theatre in India}}
[[File:Macbeth_by_Kalidasa_kalakendram.JPG|right|thumb|A scene from the drama ''Macbeth'' by [[Kalidasa Kalakendram]] in [[Kollam]] city, [[India]]]]
[[File:കൂടിയാട്ടത്തിലെസുഗ്രീവൻ.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Performer playing [[Sugriva]] in the [[Koodiyattam]] form of [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].]]
The earliest form of [[India]]n drama was the [[Sanskrit drama]].&lt;ref name="RSZ12"&gt;Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1st century AD and the 10th was a period of relative peace in the [[history of India]] during which hundreds of plays were written.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquests]] that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across the subcontinent, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72), Richmond (1998, 516), and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Indian theatre developed during the [[British Raj|period of colonial rule]] under the [[British Empire]], from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 516) and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sanskrit theatre====
{{Main|Sanskrit drama}}
The earliest-surviving fragments of [[Sanskrit drama]] date from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 516–517).&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516"&gt;Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient ''[[Vedas]]'' ([[hymn]]s from between 1500 and 1000 BC that are among the earliest examples of [[History of literature#India|literature]] in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of [[dialogue]]) and the [[ritual]]s of the [[Vedic period]] do not appear to have developed into theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516"/&gt; The ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' by [[Patañjali]] contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name="Richmond517"&gt;Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise on [[grammar]] from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of [[theatre in India]].&lt;ref name="Richmond517"/&gt;

The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is ''[[Natyashastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' (''Nātyaśāstra''), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to [[Bharata Muni]]. The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], architecture, [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond517"/&gt;

Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii"&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised [[stock character]]s, such as the hero (''nayaka''), heroine (''nayika''), or clown (''vidusaka''). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. It was patronized by the kings as well as village assemblies. Famous early playwrights include [[Bhasa]], [[Kalidasa]] (famous for ''[[Vikramōrvaśīyam|Vikrama and Urvashi]]'', ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram|Malavika and Agnimitra]]'', and ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|The Recognition of Shakuntala]]''), [[Śudraka]] (famous for ''[[Mṛcchakatika|The Little Clay Cart]]''), [[Asvaghosa]], [[Daṇḍin]], and [[Harsha|Emperor Harsha]] (famous for ''[[Nagananda]]'', ''[[Ratnavali]],'' and ''[[Priyadarsika]]''). ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|Śakuntalā]]'' (in English translation) influenced [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808–1832).&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii"/&gt;

====Modern Indian drama====
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
[[Rabindranath Tagore]] was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed.&lt;ref name="Banham1051"&gt;Banham (1998, 1051).&lt;/ref&gt; His plays are written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and include ''Chitra'' (''Chitrangada'', 1892), ''The King of the Dark Chamber'' (''Raja'', 1910), ''[[The Post Office (play)|The Post Office]]'' (''Dakghar'', 1913), and ''Red Oleander'' (''Raktakarabi'', 1924).&lt;ref name="Banham1051"/&gt;
[[Girish Karnad]] is a noted playwright, who has written a number of plays that use history and mythology, to critique and problematize ideas and ideals that are of contemporary relevance. Karnad's numerous plays such as ''Tughlaq'', ''Hayavadana'', ''[[Taledanda]]'', and ''Naga-Mandala'' are significant contributions to Indian drama. [[Vijay Tendulkar]] and [[Mahesh Dattani]] are amongst the major Indian playwrights of the 20th century. Mohan Rakesh in Hindi and [[Danish Iqbal]] in Urdu are considered architects of new age Drama. Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe Adhoore and Danish Iqbal's ''Dara Shikoh'' are considered modern classics.

====Modern Urdu drama of India and Pakistan====
{{Original research|section|date=December 2011}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Urdu Drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of North India shaping Rahas or Raas as practiced by exponents like [[Nawab Wajid Ali Shah]] (1822 – 1887) of [[Awadh]]. His dramatic experiments led to the famous [[Inder Sabha]] of Amanat and later this tradition took the shape of Parsi Theatre. Agha Hashr Kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition.

Urdu theatre tradition has greatly influenced modern [[Indian theatre]]. Theatre has flourished in [[Urdu]] (which was called [[Hindi]] by early writers), along with [[Gujarati language|Gujrati]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Urdu drama has had an important influence on [[Hindi film industry|Bombay Film industry]] and all the early works of Urdu theatre (performed by Parsi Companies) were made into films. Urdu dramatic tradition has existed for more than a 100 years.

Prof Hasan, Ghulam Jeelani, J.N,Kaushal, Shameem Hanfi, Jameel Shaidayi, etc. belong to the old generation, contemporary writers like Danish Iqbal, Sayeed Alam, Shahid Anwar, Iqbal Niyazi, and Anwar are a few [[postmodern]] playwrights actively contributing in the field of Urdu Drama.

Sayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for plays like 'Ghalib in New Delhi', 'Big B' and many other works, which are regularly staged for large audiences. ''Maulana Azad'' is his most important play both for its content and style.

Danish Iqbal's play ''[[Dara Shikoh]]'' directed by [[M. S. Sathyu]] is a modern classic that uses newer theatre techniques and a contemporary perspective. His other plays are ''[[Sahir]]''. on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet. ''Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam'' is another play written by Danish which is basically a Celebration of [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz|Faiz]]'s poetry, featuring events from the early part of his life, particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals. ''Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan'' – another play inspired from Faiz's letters written from various jails during the [[Rawalpindi Conspiracy]] days. He has written 14 other plays including ''Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa'' and ''Main Gaya Waqt Nahin hoon''. Shahid's ''Three B'' is also a significant play. He has been associated with many groups like 'Natwa' and others. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Urdu theatre flying in [[Kolkata]]. Unlike the writers of previous generation Sayeed, Shahid, Danish Iqbal and Zaheer do not write bookish plays but their work is a product of performing tradition. Iqbal Niyazi of [[Mumbai]] has written several plays in Urdu, his play ''AUR KITNE JALYANWALA BAUGH?'' won a National award other awards. Hence this is the only generation after Amanat and Agha Hashr who actually write for stage and not for libraries.

===China===
{{Main article|Theatre of China}}
[[File:1958 CPA 2262.jpg|thumb|A 1958 [[U.S.S.R.]] [[postage stamp]] commemorating [[Guan Hanqing]], one of the great Chinese dramatists, who is renowned for his "[[zaju]]" plays.]]

Chinese theatre has a long and complex history. Today it is often called [[Chinese opera]] although this normally refers specifically to the popular form known as [[Beijing opera]] and [[Kunqu]]; there have been many other forms of theatre in China, such as [[zaju]].

===Japan===
{{Main article|Theatre of Japan}}
Japanese [[Noh|Nō drama]] is a serious dramatic form that combines drama, music, and dance into a complete aesthetic performance experience. It developed in the 14th and 15th centuries and has its own musical instruments and performance techniques, which were often handed down from father to son. The performers were generally male (for both male and female roles), although female amateurs also perform Nō dramas. Nō drama was supported by the government, and particularly the military, with many military commanders having their own troupes and sometimes performing themselves. It is still performed in Japan today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iijnet.or.jp/NOH-KYOGEN/english/english.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050715090014/http://www.iijnet.or.jp/NOH-KYOGEN/english/english.html| archivedate=2005-07-15| accessdate=2013-02-27| deadurl=yes| title=Background to Noh-Kyogen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kyōgen]] is the comic counterpart to Nō drama. It concentrates more on dialogue and less on music, although Nō instrumentalists sometimes appear also in Kyōgen. [[Kabuki]] drama, developed from the 17th century, is another comic form, which includes dance.

'''Estate satire''' is a genre of writing from 14th Century, [[Medieval literature|Medieval literary]] works. The three Medieval estates were the Clergy (those who prayed), the [[Nobility]] (those who fought) and lastly the [[Peasantry]] (those who labored). These estates were the major [[social classes]] of the time and were typically gender specific to men, although the clergy also included nuns. Nevertheless, women were considered as a separate class in themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Jill. ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; the best-known example being [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[The Wife of Bath's Tale|Wife of Bath]]. Estates satire praised the glories and purity of each class in its ideal form, but was also used as a window to show how society had gotten out of hand. The ''Norton Anthology of [[English Literature]]'' describes the duty of estates satire: "They set forth the functions and duties of each estate and castigate the failure of the estates in the present world to live up to their divinely assigned social roles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estates Satire|work=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/middleages/topic_1/satire.htm|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|accessdate = 25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Estate, the Church, consisted of those who ran the Catholic church and part of the country. They were the recipients of the ''[[tithe]]'' or the 10% tax given to the Church.

The Second Estate, the Nobility, were royalty, not including the King. They were never taxed but could collect taxes from the Third Estate, and had other special privileges.

The Third Estate, the Commons, is the largest, consisting of around 96% of the population (UCL). The commons included everyone who did not belong to the first two estates, primarily rural [[peasants]] and the urban [[bourgeois]] or middle class. They had none of the privileges or luxuries that the first two estates enjoyed, although the [[History of capitalism|rise of capitalism]] in the late 14th Century resulted in the bourgeois having relatively more power.

Among 14th-century English authors, [[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and Chaucer were three of the most prominent writers of the time to include estates satire in their works. Although Gower was more aggressive in his approach, Chaucer was more subtle and more successful, making himself to be the fool of the joke and subverting may of the conventions of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Medieval authors used estates satire to express their disgust towards the hypocrisy of the three estates and their supposed virtuous ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8451">[[File:Amanita muscaria After Rain.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' has a long and varied history of psychoactive use.]]
'''Ethnomycology''' is the study of the historical uses and sociological impact of [[fungi]] and can be considered a subfield of [[ethnobotany]] or [[ethnobiology]]. Although in theory the term includes fungi used for such purposes as [[tinder]], medicine ([[medicinal mushrooms]]) and food (including [[yeast]]), it is often used in the context of the study of psychoactive mushrooms such as [[psilocybin mushrooms]], the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom, and the [[ergot]] fungus.

American banker [[Robert Gordon Wasson]] pioneered interest in this field of study in the late 1950s, when he and his wife became the first Westerners on record allowed to participate in a mushroom ''[[Velada (Mazatec ritual)|velada]]'', held by the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] ''[[Curandero|curandera]]'' [[María Sabina]]. The biologist [[Richard Evans Schultes]] is also considered an ethnomycological pioneer.  Later researchers in the field include [[Terence McKenna]], [[Albert Hofmann]], [[Ralph Metzner]], [[Carl Ruck]], [[Blaise Daniel Staples]], [[Giorgio Samorini]], [[Keewaydinoquay Peschel]], [[John Marco Allegro]], [[Clark Heinrich]], [[Jonathan Ott]], and [[Paul Stamets]].

Besides mycological determination in the field, ethnomycology depends to a large extent on [[anthropology]] and [[philology]]. One of the major debates among ethnomycologists is Wasson's theory that the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] mentioned in the [[Rigveda]] of the [[Indo-Aryans]] was the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book

  | title = Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality

  | isbn = 0-15-683800-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his example similar attempts have been made to identify psychoactive mushroom usage in many other (mostly) ancient cultures, with varying degrees of credibility. Another much written about topic is the content of the [[Kykeon]], the [[sacrament]] used during the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] in [[ancient Greece]] between approximately 1500 BCE and 396 CE.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book

  | page = 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not an ethnomycologist as such, [[philologist]] [[John Allegro]] has made an important contribution suggesting, in a book controversial enough to have his academic career destroyed, that ''Amanita muscaria'' was not only consumed as a sacrament but was the main focus of worship in the more [[esoteric]] sects of [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian religion]], [[Judaism]] and [[early Christianity]].&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-340-12875-5
  | page = 320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clark Heinrich]] claims that ''Amanita muscaria'' use in Europe was not completely wiped out by [[Orthodox Christianity]] but continued to be used (either consumed or merely symbolically) by individuals and small groups such as [[medieval]] [[Holy Grail]] [[myth]] makers, [[alchemy|alchemists]] and [[Renaissance]] artists.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite book

  | page = 256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Wasson views historical mushroom use primarily as a facilitator for the [[shamanic]] or spiritual experiences core to these rites and traditions, McKenna takes this further, positing that the ingestion of psilocybin was perhaps primary in the formation of language and culture and identifying [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] mushrooms as the original "[[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]]".&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{cite book

The 1990s saw a surge in the recreational use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]] due to a combination of a psychedelic revival in the [[rave]] culture, improved and simplified cultivation techniques, and the distribution of both the mushrooms themselves and information about them via the [[Internet]]. This "mushrooming of mushroom use" has also caused an increased popularization of ethnomycology itself as there are many websites and Internet forums where mushroom references in [[Christmas]] and [[fairy tale]] symbolism are discussed. It remains open to interpretation what effect this popularization has on ethnomycology in the academic world, where the lack of verifiable evidence has kept its theories with their often far-reaching implications shrouded in controversy.

[[Image:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry décembre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', a famous [[illuminated manuscript]], is on view to both the public and to scholars only in the form of a high-quality facsimile]]
A '''facsimile''' (from [[Latin]] ''fac simile'' (to 'make alike')) is a copy or reproduction of an old [[book]], [[manuscript]], [[map]], [[Old master print|art print]], or other item of historical value that is as true to the original source as possible. It differs from other forms of reproduction by attempting to replicate the source as accurately as possible in scale, color, condition, and other material qualities. For books and manuscripts, this also entails a complete copy of all pages; hence, an incomplete copy is a "partial facsimile". Facsimiles are sometimes used by scholars to research a source that they do not have access to otherwise, and by museums and archives for [[media preservation]] and [[Art conservation and restoration|conservation]]. Many are sold commercially, often accompanied by a volume of commentary. They may be produced in [[limited edition]]s, typically of 500–2,000 copies, and cost the equivalent of a few thousand [[United States dollars]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}{{clarify|date=August 2018}} The term "[[fax]]" is a shortened form of "facsimile" though most faxes are not reproductions of the quality expected in a true facsimile.

==Facsimiles in the age of mechanical reproduction==
Advances in the art of facsimile are closely related to advances in [[printmaking]]. Maps, for instance, were the focus of early explorations in making facsimiles, although these examples often lack the rigidity to the original source that is now expected.&lt;ref name="koeman"&gt;C. Koeman, "An Increase in Facsimile Reprints," ''Imago Mundi'', vol. 18 (1964), pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt; An early example is the [[Abraham Ortelius]] [[map]] (1598).&lt;ref name="koeman"/&gt; Innovations during the 18th century, especially in the realms of  [[lithography]] and [[aquatint]], facilitated an explosion in the number of facsimiles of [[old master]] drawings that could be studied from afar.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Hartley, "Aquatint," ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art'', ed. Hugh Brigstocke. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001; [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford University Press, 2005. [accessed 20 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RueMorgueManuscript.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Facsimile of Edgar Allan Poe's original manuscript for ''The Murders in the Rue Morgue'']] In the past, a technique such as the [[photostat]], [[hectograph]], or [[lithograph]] was usually used to create facsimiles. More recently, facsimiles have been made by the use of some form of [[photographic]] technique. For documents, a facsimile most often refers to document reproduction by a [[photocopy]] machine. In the digital age, an [[image scanner]], a [[personal computer]], and a [[desktop printer]] can be used to make a facsimile.

==Facsimiles and conservation==
Important [[illuminated manuscript]]s like [[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]] are not only on display to the public as facsimiles, but available in high quality to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facsimile-editions.com/en/about/institutions.aspx Public institutions with facsimile collections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDD1E3FF936A15752C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Paul Lewis, "Preservation takes rare manuscripts from the public," ''New York Times''] - 25 January 1987 [accessed 19 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike normal book reproductions, facsimiles remain truer to the original colors—which is especially important for illuminated manuscripts—and preserve defects.&lt;ref name="um"&gt;[http://www.unimelb.edu.au/culturalcollections/exhibitions/facsimile/essay.html Bronwyn Stocks, "The Facsimile and the Manuscript,"] - an exhibition in the Leigh Scott Gallery, [[University of Melbourne]] (on-line catalogue with additional images).&lt;/ref&gt;

Facsimiles are best suited to printed or hand-written documents, and not to items such as three-dimensional objects or oil paintings with unique surface texture.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Godfrey, "Reproduction reproductive prints," ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art'', ed. Hugh Brigstocke. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001; [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford University Press, 2005. [accessed 20 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductions of those latter objects are often referred to as [[replica]]s.

In [[linguistics]], a '''feature'''  is the assignment of [[wiktionary:binary|binary]] or [[unary operation|unary]] conditions which act as constraints.{{what|date=January 2015}}

==In phonology==
{{main|distinctive feature}}
In [[phonology]], [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s are categorized into [[natural class]]es on the basis of their [[distinctive feature]]s. Each feature is a quality or characteristic of the natural class, such as [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] or [[manner of articulation|manner]]. A unique combination of features defines a [[phoneme]].

Examples of [[phonemic]] or distinctive features are: [+/- [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] ], [+/- [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] ] (binary features) and [ [[coronal consonant|CORONAL]] ] (a unary feature; also a [[place of articulation|place]] feature).

Surface representations can be expressed as the result of rules acting on the features of the [[underlying representation]]. These rules are formulated in terms of transformations on features.

==In morphology==
In [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]], words are often organized into '''[[lexical category|lexical categories]]''' or '''word classes''', such as "noun", "verb", "adjective", and so on. These word classes have '''[[grammatical category|grammatical feature]]s''' (also called ''categories'' or ''inflectional categories''), which can have one of a set of potential '''values''' (also called the ''property'', ''meaning'', or ''feature'' of the category).&lt;ref&gt;Kibort, Anna &amp; Corbett, Greville G. [http://www.grammaticalfeatures.net/inventory.html Grammatical Features - Feature Inventory]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider the [[pronoun]] in English. Pronouns are a ''lexical category''. Pronouns have the [[grammatical person|person]] ''feature'', which can have a ''value'' of "first", "second", or "third". English pronouns also have the [[grammatical number|number]] ''feature'', which can have a value of either "singular" or "plural". As a result, we can describe the English pronoun "they" as a pronoun with [person:3] and [number:plural].

==In semantics==
{{main|semantic feature}}
In [[semantics]], words are categorized into [[semantic class]]es. Intersecting semantic classes share the same [[semantic feature]]s.

'''Forensic astronomy''' is the use of [[astronomy]], the scientific study of celestial objects, to determine the appearance of the sky at specific times in the past. This has been used, if relatively rarely, in [[forensic science]] (that is, for solving problems of relevance to the legal system) and for resolving [[history|historical]] problems more generally, notably issues in [[art history]].

==Forensic science==
As a forensic science in the strict sense of the term, astronomical knowledge can help resolve certain legal questions. In one reported instance, an astronomer testified in court as an [[expert witness]] as to whether a newly built house would cast a shadow on another house. More generally, questions about the sun's or moon's placement in the sky at certain times of day or night may be legally relevant, such as for determining the date on which a  photograph was made.&lt;ref name="Marché"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marché|first=Jordan D.|title=Theaters of time and space: American planetaria, 1930-1970|year=2005|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-3576-0|pages=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olT1ipj-EboC&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has for instance been reported that [[Abraham Lincoln]] once successfully defended a legal case by describing the location of the Moon on the night of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pistalu|first=Mary Ellen|title=Astronomy Takes the Stand: Using the Heavens to Solve Crimes|journal=[[Mercury Magazine]]|issue=January/February 2006|publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Frederic Church Meteor of 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Frederic Edwin Church]], ''[[The Meteor of 1860]]'']]

By extension, the adjective "forensic" has come to be used for any detailed analysis of past events, whether related to legal questions or not, and so the determination of past celestial constellations more generally is now increasingly referred to as "forensic astronomy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunn|first=Alan|title=Essential Forensic Biology|year=2009|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|isbn=978-0-470-75803-8|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eesJuyXhKHoC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For research in [[art history]], in particular, methods of astronomy are sometimes useful for determining the place and time of creation of a particular work of art, or of the event that inspired it. Such methods have for instance been used to date [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s painting ''[[Evening Landscape with Rising Moon]]'' (to 9:08 pm, 13 July 1889), and to identify the [[meteor]]s described in [[Walt Whitman]]'s poem ''[[Year of Meteors (1859-60)]]'' – in conjunction with [[Frederic Edwin Church]]'s painting of the same event (at right) – as the [[meteor procession]] of [[1860 Great Meteor|1860]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falk|first=Dan|title=Forensic astronomer solves Walt Whitman mystery|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2010/06/the-forensic-astronomer-donald-olson.php|accessdate=2 June 2010|newspaper=[[New Scientist]] CultureLab|date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">The '''four field approach''' in [[anthropology]] sees the discipline as composed of the four subfields of [[Archaeology]], [[Linguistics]], [[Physical Anthropology]] and [[Cultural anthropology]]. The approach is conventionally understood as having been developed by [[Franz Boas]] who developed the discipline of anthropology in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, E. N. (2003), Four-Field Anthropology. Anthropology News, 44: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Beck Kehoe. 1998. Humans:  An Introduction to Four-Field Anthropology. Psychology Press, 1998 - Social Science&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 re-assessment of the evidence has indicated that the idea of four-field anthropology has a more complex 19th-century history in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Dan|title=Four Field Anthropology: Charter Myths and Time Warps from St. Louis to Oxford|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 2013|volume=54|issue=6|pages=753|jstor=10.1086/673385|doi=10.1086/673385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Boas, the four field approach was motivated by his [[Holism|holistic]] approach to the study of human behavior, which included integrated analytical attention to culture history, material culture, [[anatomy]] and population history, customs and social organization, [[folklore]], grammar and language use. For most of the 20th century, U.S. Anthropology departments housed anthropologists specializing in all of the four branches, but with the increasing professionalization and specialization, elements such as [[linguistics]] and [[archaeology]] came to be regarded largely as separate disciplines. Today, physical anthropologists often collaborate more closely with biology and medicine than with cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Borofsky, R. (2002), The Four Subfields: Anthropologists as Mythmakers. American Anthropologist, 104: 463–480.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|date=November 2018|reason=Much of the information on this article is old (not out of date). There have been many other studies, critiques, etc. of gender bias on Wikipedia and the article must be updated to reflect that.}}
[[File:LE15_Gender_overall_in_2018.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Pie chart for gender of Wikipedia editors: 90% male, 9% female, and 1% transsexual or transgender|Wikipedia editors surveyed by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] in 2018 were predominantly male.]]

'''Gender bias on Wikipedia''' reflects the fact that a dominant majority of volunteer Wikipedia editors, particularly on the [[English Wikipedia|English-language site]], are male. This has led to Wikipedia having fewer and less extensive articles about women or topics important to women.

It figures among the most frequent [[criticism of Wikipedia|criticisms of Wikipedia]], and part of a more general criticism about [[systemic bias in Wikipedia]]. The [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which runs Wikipedia, agrees with these criticisms and has made an ongoing attempt to increase female editorship of Wikipedia. [[Edit-a-thon]]s have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.

''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out that Wikipedia's female participation rate may be in line with other "public thought-leadership forums".&lt;ref name=Cohen110130 /&gt; In 2009, a Wikimedia Foundation survey revealed that 6% of editors who made more than 500 edits were female, with the average male editor having twice as many edits.&lt;ref name=Clubhouse&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~lam/papers/wp-gender-wikisym2011.pdf |title = WP:Clubhouse?

In the English Wikipedia and five other language editions that were studied by researchers, the ratio of articles about women to articles about men was higher than in three other databases. However, analysis with computational linguistics concluded that the way women and men are described in articles demonstrates bias, with articles about women more likely to overuse words relating to gender and family. The researchers believe that this is a sign Wikipedia editors consider male the "null gender" (in other words, that "male" is assumed unless otherwise specified).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.technologyreview.com/s/534616/computational-linguistics-reveals-how-wikipedia-articles-are-biased-against-women/ |title = Computational Linguistics Reveals How Wikipedia Articles Are Biased Against Women |last = arXiv |first = Emerging Technology from the |work = MIT Technology Review |access-date = 21 August 2017 |language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critique of Wikipedia's approach, from a 2014 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial, is that it has difficulty making judgments about "what matters". To illustrate this point they noted that [[List of pornographic actresses by decade|the page listing pornographic actresses]] was better organized than [[List of women writers|the page listing women writers]].&lt;ref name=GuardianAugust2014&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'' 2014 (London) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth The Guardian view on Wikipedia: evolving truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112212758/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth |date=November 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[United Nations University]] and [[UNU-MERIT]] jointly presented an overview of the results of a global Wikipedia survey.&lt;ref name=WPSurvey2010&gt;{{cite web |title = Wikipedia Survey: Overview Results |url = http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |last1 = Glott |first1 = Ruediger |last2 = Schmidt |first2 = Philipp |last3 = Ghosh |first3 = Rishab |date = March 2010 |website =  |publisher =  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100414165445/http://wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |archivedate = 14 April 2010 |accessdate = 11 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 30 January 2011, ''New York Times'' article cited this [[Wikimedia Foundation]] collaboration, which indicated that fewer than 13% of contributors to Wikipedia are women.  [[Sue Gardner]], then executive director of the foundation, said that increasing diversity was about making the encyclopedia "as good as it could be." Factors the article cited as possibly discouraging women from editing included the "obsessive fact-loving realm", associations with the "hard-driving hacker crowd," and the necessity to be "open to very difficult, high-conflict people, even misogynists”.&lt;ref name=Cohen110130&gt;{{cite news |last = Cohen |first = Noam |date = 30 January 2011 |title = Define Gender Gap?

In February 2011, ''The New York Times'' followed up with a series of opinions on the subject under the banner, "Where Are the Women in Wikipedia?"&lt;ref name=WhereAretheWomen&gt;{{cite news |author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = 2 February 2011 |title = Where Are the Women in Wikipedia? |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 9 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140715112226/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia |archivedate = 15 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Herring|Susan C. Herring]], a professor of information science and linguistics, said that she was not surprised by the Wikipedia contributors gender gap. She said that the often contentious nature of Wikipedia article "talk" pages, where article content is discussed, is unappealing to many women, "if not outright intimidating."&lt;ref name=Herring110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Herring |first = Susan C. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Communication Styles Make a Difference |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140724050237/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |archivedate = 24 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Reagle|Joseph M. Reagle]] reacted similarly, saying that the combination of a "culture of hacker elitism," combined with the disproportionate effect of high-conflict members (a minority) on the community atmosphere, can make it unappealing. He said, "the ideology and rhetoric of freedom and openness can then be used (a) to suppress concerns about inappropriate or offensive speech as "censorship" and (b) to rationalize low female participation as simply a matter of their personal preference and choice."&lt;ref name=Reagle110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Reagle |first = Joseph M. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = 'Open' Doesn't Include Everyone |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140715113229/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |archivedate = 15 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justine Cassell]] said that although women are as knowledgeable as men, and as able to defend their point of view, "it is still the case in American society that debate, contention, and vigorous defense of one’s position is often still seen as a male stance, and women’s use of these speech styles can call forth negative evaluations."&lt;ref name=Cassell110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Cassell |first = Justine |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Editing Wars Behind the Scenes |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170227113525/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |archivedate = 27 February 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[International Journal of Communication]]'' published research by Reagle and Lauren Rhue that examined the coverage, gender representation, and article length of thousands of biographical subjects on the English-language Wikipedia and the online ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. They concluded that Wikipedia provided better coverage and longer articles in general, that Wikipedia typically has more articles on women than ''Britannica'' in absolute terms, but Wikipedia articles on women were more likely to be missing than articles on men relative to ''Britannica''. That is, Wikipedia dominated ''Britannica'' in biographical coverage, but more so when it comes to men. Similarly, one might say that ''Britannica'' is more balanced in whom it neglects to cover than Wikipedia. For both reference works, article length did not consistently differ by gender.&lt;ref name="Reagle-Rhue"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Reagle |first1 = Joseph |last2 = Rhue |first2 = Lauren |title = Gender Bias in Wikipedia and ''Britannica'' |url = http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631 |year = 2011 |journal = International Journal of Communication |volume = 5 |publisher = Joseph Reagle &amp; Lauren Rhue |pages = 1138–1158 |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160322081809/http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631 |archivedate = 22 March 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation conducted its first semi-annual Wikipedia survey. It suggested that 9% of Wikipedia editors are women. It also reported, "Contrary to the perception of some, our data shows that very few women editors feel like they have been harassed, and very few feel Wikipedia is a sexualized environment."&lt;ref name=WES2011&gt;{{cite web |url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Editor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf |title = Wikipedia Editors Study: Results From ''The Editor Survey, April 2011'' |date = April 2011 |website = [[Wikipedia]] |accessdate = 18 May 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141226041321/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Editor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf |archivedate = 26 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an October 2011 paper at the [[WikiSym|International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration]] found evidence that suggested that Wikipedia may have "a culture that may be resistant to female participation".&lt;ref name=WPClubhouse&gt;{{cite conference |last1 = Lam |first1 = Shyong K. |last2 = Uduwage |first2 = Anuradha |last3 = Dong |first3 = Zhenhua |last4 = Sen |first4 = Shilad |last5 = Musicant |first5 = David R. |last6 = Terveen |first6 = Loren |last7 = Reidl |first7 = John |date = October 2011 |title = WP:Clubhouse?

A study published in 2014 found that there is also an "Internet skills gap" with regard to Wikipedia editors. The authors found that the most likely Wikipedia contributors are high-skilled men and that there is no gender gap among low-skilled editors, and concluded that the "skills gap" exacerbates the gender gap among editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Hargittai |first1 = Eszter |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Aaron |title = Mind the skills gap: the role of Internet know-how and gender in differentiated contributions to Wikipedia |journal = Information, Communication &amp; Society |date = 4 November 2014 |pages = 1–19 |doi = 10.1080/1369118X.2014.957711 |volume = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010–14, women made up 61% of participants of the college courses arranged by the Wiki Education Foundation program that included editing Wikipedia as part of the curriculum. Their contributions were found to shift the Wikipedia content from pop-culture and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] towards social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |title = Wikipedia grows up on college campuses |author = Bruce Maiman |date = 23 September 2014 |website = [[The Sacramento Bee]] |accessdate = 23 September 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140923224639/http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |archivedate = 23 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Wagner et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Wagner |first1 = Claudia |last2 = Graells-Garrido |first2 = Eduardo |last3 = Garcia, |first3 = David |last4 = Menczer |first4 = Filippo |title = Women through the glass ceiling: gender asymmetries in Wikipedia |journal = EPJ Data Science |date = 1 March 2016 |doi = 10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0066-4 |volume = 5 |number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; found linguistic gender bias manifest in family-, gender-, and relationship-related topics being more present in biographies about women, and in positive terms being more frequent in the biographies of men and negative terms more frequent in the biographies of women. The authors also found structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities.

A 2017 study found that women participating in an experiment by editing a Wikipedia-like site tended to view other editors as male, and to view their responses as more critical than if the other editor was [[gender-neutral]]. The study concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Shane-Simpson |first1=Christina |last2=Gillespie-Lynch |first2=Kristen |title=Examining potential mechanisms underlying the Wikipedia gender gap through a collaborative editing task |journal=[[Computers in Human Behavior]] |date=January 2017 |volume=66 |pages=312–328 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.043|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01612306/document }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote |text = ...visible female editors on Wikipedia and broader encouragement of the use of constructive feedback may begin to alleviate the Wikipedia gender gap. Furthermore, the relatively high proportion of anonymous editors may exacerbate the Wikipedia gender gap, as anonymity may often be perceived as male and more critical.}}

A study by Ford and Wajcman observes that research on the gender bias continues to frame the problem as a deficit in women. In contrast, their central argument states that infrastructure studies in [[feminist technoscience]] allows the gender analysis to be taken to a further level. It looks at three issues within the infrastructure: content policies, software and the legalistic framework of operation. It suggests that progress can be made through altering that culture of [[knowledge production]] through encouraging alternate knowledge, reducing the technical barriers to editing, and addressing the complexity of Wikipedia policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ford |first1 = Heather |last2 = Wajcman |first2 = Judy |title = 'Anyone can edit', not everyone does: Wikipedia and the gender gap |journal = Social Studies of Science |date = 2017 |url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228081909/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |archivedate = 28 December 2016 |df = dmy-all | doi = 10.1177/0306312717692172 |volume=47 |pages=511–527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, mathematician [[Marie A. Vitulli]] wrote in ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The percentage of women editors on Wikipedia remains dismally low."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201803/rnoti-p330.pdf|title=Writing Women in Mathematics into Wikipedia 65 (3). pp. 331–332. doi:10.1090/noti1650|last=Vitulli|first=Marie A.|date=March 2018|publisher=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|access-date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, when [[Donna Strickland]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], numerous write-ups mentioned that she did not previously have a Wikipedia page. A draft had been submitted, but was rejected for not demonstrating "significant coverage (not just passing mentions) about the subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel prize winning scientist who wasn’t famous enough for Wikipedia |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/the-nobel-prize-winning-scientist-who-wasn-t-famous-enough-for-wikipedia-1.3650212 |website=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2018 |date=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2018/oct/02/nobel-prize-in-physics-2018-live&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leyland Cecco|title=Female Nobel prize winner deemed not important enough for Wikipedia entry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/03/donna-strickland-nobel-physics-prize-wikipedia-denied|work=The Guardian|date=2018-10-03|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several causes for this gender disparity have been suggested. A 2010 study revealed a Wikipedia female participation rate of 13 percent, observed to be close to the 15 percent overall female participation rate of other "public thought-leadership forums".&lt;ref name=Cohen110130 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Signpost-2013-07-31"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2013-07-31/Recent_research |title = Recent research&amp;nbsp;— Napoleon, Michael Jackson and Srebrenica across cultures, 90% of Wikipedia better than Britannica, WikiSym preview |last = Yasseri |first = Taha |last2 = Liao |first2 = Han-Teng |last3 = Konieczny |first3 = Piotr |last4 = Morgan |first4 = Jonathan |last5 = Bayer |first5 = Tilman |date = 31 July 2013 |work = [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost|The Signpost]] |publisher = [[Wikipedia]] |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150617074727/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2013-07-31/Recent_research |archivedate = 17 June 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia research fellow Sarah Stierch acknowledged that it is "fairly common" for Wikipedia contributors to remain gender-anonymous.&lt;ref name="DailyDotStierch"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dailydot.com/society/wikipedia-gender-gap-sarah-stierch/ |title = The women of Wikipedia: Closing the site's giant gender gap |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150703203120/http://www.dailydot.com/society/wikipedia-gender-gap-sarah-stierch/ |archivedate = 3 July 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A perceived unwelcoming culture and tolerance of violent and abusive language are also reasons put forth for the gender gap.&lt;ref name="CSM-misogyny"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2013/0801/In-UK-rising-chorus-of-outrage-over-online-misogyny |title = In UK, rising chorus of outrage over online misogyny |website = CSMonitor.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704200524/http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2013/0801/In-UK-rising-chorus-of-outrage-over-online-misogyny |archivedate = 4 July 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 study,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/morgan_cscw2013_final.pdf |title = Tea &amp; Sympathy: Crafting Positive New User Experiences on Wikipedia |author = Jonathan T.

As well, Wikipedia "...editors that publicly identify as women face harassment" from other Wikipedia editors.&lt;ref name="Montellaro" /&gt;

Former Wikimedia Foundation executive director [[Sue Gardner]] cited nine reasons why women don't edit Wikipedia, culled from comments by female [[Wikipedia community|Wikipedia editors]]:&lt;ref name=Gardner110219&gt;{{cite web |last = Gardner |first = Sue |date = 19 February 2011 |title = Nine Reasons Why Women Don't Edit Wikipedia, In Their Own Words |url = http://suegardner.org/2011/02/19/nine-reasons-why-women-dont-edit-wikipedia-in-their-own-words/ |type = blog |website = suegardner.org |publisher =  |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Wikipedia culture is sexual in ways they find off-putting
# Being addressed as male is off-putting to women whose primary language has grammatical gender
# Fewer opportunities than other sites for social relationships and a welcoming tone

Lam ''et al''. suggest that there may be a culture which is non-inclusive of women on Wikipedia, which may be due to a disparity in male-to-female centric topics represented and edited, the tendency for female users to be more active in the [[Community of Wikipedia|social and community aspects of Wikipedia]], an increased likelihood that edits by new female editors are reverted, and/or that articles with high proportions of female editors are more contentious.&lt;ref name=WPClubhouse /&gt;

In July 2014, the [[National Science Foundation]] announced that it would spend $200,000 to study systemic gender bias on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/ |title=Government-Funded Study: Why Is Wikipedia Sexist? |work=[[Washington Free Beacon]] |date=30 July 2014 |author= Elizabeth Harrington |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801062009/http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/ |archivedate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Julia Adams and Hannah Brückner that was supported by the funding was published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Julia |last1=Adams |first2=Hannah |last2=Brückner |title=Wikipedia, sociology, and the promise and pitfalls of Big Data |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951715614332|journal=Big Data &amp; Society |date=27 December 2015 |issn=2053-9517 |volume=2 |issue=2 |doi=10.1177/2053951715614332}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|reason=Please tell us what the report's findings were.

== Reactions ==

The Wikimedia Foundation has officially held, since at least 2011 when Gardner was executive director, that gender bias exists in the project. It has made some attempts to address it but Gardner has expressed frustration with the degree of success achieved. She has also noted that "in the very limited leisure time women had, they tended to be more involved in social activities instead of editing Wikipedia. 'Women see technology more as a tool they use to accomplish tasks, rather than something fun in itself.{{'"}}&lt;ref name=Huang130811&gt;{{cite news |last = Huang |first = Keira |date = 11 August 2013 |title = Wikipedia fails to bridge gender gap |url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1295872/wikipedia-fails-bridge-gender-gap |newspaper = South China Morning Post |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160115195821/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1295872/wikipedia-fails-bridge-gender-gap |archivedate = 15 January 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wikistorm2013&gt;{{cite web |url = http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/wikistorming/ |title = Wikistorming |date = Fall 2013 |website = FemTechNet |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150717034630/http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/wikistorming/ |archivedate = 17 July 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Foundation set a target of having 25 percent of its contributors identifying as female by 2015.&lt;ref name=Cohen110130 /&gt; In August 2013, Gardner said, "I didn't solve it. We didn't solve it. The Wikimedia Foundation didn't solve it. The solution won't come from the Wikimedia Foundation."&lt;ref name=Huang130811 /&gt;

Writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in 2011, [[Heather Mac Donald]] called Wikipedia's gender imbalance a "non-problem in search of a misguided solution." Mac Donald asserted, "The most straightforward explanation for the differing rates of participation in Wikipedia—and the one that conforms to everyday experience—is  that, on average, males and females have different interests and preferred ways of spending their free time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Mac Donald |first = Heather |url = http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/02/wikipedia_is_maledominated_that_doesnt_mean_its_sexist.html |title = Wikipedia Is Male-Dominated.

In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] announced in a BBC interview the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]'s plans for "doubling down" on the gender content gap at Wikipedia. Wales said the Foundation would be open to more outreach and more software changes.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28701772 Wikipedia 'completely failed' to fix gender imbalance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004148/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28701772 |date=29 December 2016 }}, [[BBC]] interview with [[Jimmy Wales]], 8 August 2014; starting at 45 seconds.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to increase female editorship ==

[[File:Giants in the field of Women in the Arts 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Attendees at the 2013 Women in the Arts edit-a-thon in Washington, DC]]

Dedicated [[edit-a-thon]]s have been organized to increase the coverage of women's topics in Wikipedia and to encourage more women to edit Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |title = Closing Wikipedia’s Gender Gap — Reluctantly |work = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date = 11 February 2014 |accessdate = 27 August 2014 |author = Stoeffel |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140902160836/http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |archivedate = 2 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These events are supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, which sometimes provides mentors and technology to help guide newer editors through the process.

The [[Wikipedia:Teahouse/About|Wikipedia Teahouse]] project was launched with the goal to provide a user-friendly environment for newcomers, with a particular goal of boosting women's participation in Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dub.washington.edu/pubs/364 |title = Tea &amp; Sympathy: Crafting Positive New User Experiences on Wikipedia |website = washington.edu |publisher = Proc.

An early-2015 initiative to create a "women-only" space for Wikipedia editors was strongly opposed by Wikipedians.&lt;ref&gt;Paling, Emma, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/how-wikipedia-is-hostile-to-women/411619/ How Wikipedia Is Hostile to Women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021174625/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/how-wikipedia-is-hostile-to-women/411619/ |date=21 October 2015 }}", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 21 October 2015 {{Subscription or advertising}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender studies''' is a [[Field of study|field]] for [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study devoted to [[gender identity]] and gendered [[Representation (politics)|representation]] as central categories of analysis. This field includes [[women's studies]] (concerning [[women]], [[feminism]], gender, and politics), [[men's studies]] and [[queer studies]].&lt;ref name="whitman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies |title=Gender Studies |publisher=Whitman College |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121212181127/http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies |archivedate=12 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, gender studies is offered together with study of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

These disciplines study [[gender]] and sexuality in the fields of [[literature]], language, [[geography]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[Film theory|cinema]], [[media studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gender And Media: Representing, Producing, Consuming |last1=Krijnen |first1=Tonny |last2=van Bauwel |first2=Sofie |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-415-69540-4 |location=New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; human development, law, public health and medicine.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gendersexuality.uchicago.edu/about/ | title=About – Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS) | publisher=[[The University of Chicago]] | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also analyzes how [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[Location (geography)|location]], [[Class (social)|class]], [[nationality]], and [[disability]] intersect with the categories of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Race, Ethnicity, Gender &amp; Class"&gt;Healey, J. F. (2003). ''Race, Ethnicity, Gender and Class: the Sociology of Group Conflict and Change''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiana"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiana.edu/~gender/ | title=Department of Gender Studies | publisher=[[Indiana University]] (IU Bloomington) | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding gender, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] said: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one."&lt;ref name="de Beauvoir"&gt;de Beauvoir, S. (1949, 1989). "The Second Sex".&lt;/ref&gt; This view proposes that in gender studies, the term "gender" should be used to refer to the [[social constructionism|social and cultural constructions]] of masculinities and femininities and not to the state of being male or female in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Stephanie Garrett"&gt;Garrett, S. (1992). "Gender", p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view is not held by all gender theorists. Beauvoir's is a view that many sociologists support (see [[Sociology of gender]]), though there are many other contributors to the field of gender studies with different backgrounds and opposing views, such as psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan#Lacan and his discontents|Jacques Lacan]] and feminists such as [[Judith Butler]].

Gender is pertinent to many disciplines, such as [[literary theory]], drama studies, [[film theory]], [[performativity|performance theory]], contemporary [[art history]], anthropology, sociology, [[sociolinguistics]] and [[psychology]]. However, these disciplines sometimes differ in their approaches to how and why gender is studied. For instance in anthropology, sociology and psychology, gender is often studied as a practice, whereas in cultural studies representations of gender are more often examined. In politics, gender can be viewed as a foundational discourse that political actors employ in order to position themselves on a variety of issues.&lt;ref&gt;Salime, Zakia. ''Between Feminism and Islam: Human Rights and Sharia Law in Morocco''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender studies is also a discipline in itself, incorporating methods and approaches from a wide range of disciplines.&lt;ref name=companion&gt;{{cite book |last1=Essed |first1=Philomena |authorlink1=Philomena Essed |last2=Goldberg |first2=David Theo |authorlink2=David Theo Goldberg |last3=Kobayashi |first3=Audrey |authorlink3=Audrey Kobayashi |title=A Companion to Gender Studies |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZPgYDTa9P84C |accessdate=7 November 2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-8808-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each field came to regard "gender" as a practice, sometimes referred to as something that is [[Performative utterance|performative]].&lt;ref name = "performativity of gender"/&gt; [[Feminist theory]] of psychoanalysis, articulated mainly by [[Julia Kristeva]]&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie Smith, ''Julia Kristeva: Speaking the Unspeakable'' (Pluto Press, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; (the "semiotic" and "abjection") and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]]&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, "Inscriptions in the Feminine" and "Introduction" to "The With-In-Visible Screen", in: ''Inside the Visible'' edited by Catherine de Zegher. MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; (the feminine-prematernal-maternal matrixial Eros of borderlinking and com-passion,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book | first = Bracha L. | last = Ettinger | authorlink = Bracha L.

According to Sam Killermann, Gender can also be broken into three categories, gender identity, gender expression, and biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRcPXtqdKjE|title=Understanding the Complexities of Gender: Sam Killermann at TEDxUofIChicago|date=3 May 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three categories are another way of breaking down gender into the different social, biological, and cultural constructions. These constructions focus on how femininity and masculinity are fluid entities and how their meaning is able to fluctuate depending on the various constraints surrounding them.

==Influences==

===Psychoanalytic theory===

A number of theorists have influenced the field of gender studies significantly, specifically in terms of psychoanalytic theory. Among these are [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], and Mark Blechner.

Gender studied under the lens of each of these theorists looks somewhat different. In a Freudian system, women are "mutilated and must learn to accept their lack of a penis" (in Freud's terms a "deformity").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Horney | first = Karen | contribution = On the Genesis of the Castration Complex in Women (1922) | editor-last = Miller | editor-first = J. B. | title = Psychoanalysis and Women | location = New York | publisher = Bruner/Mazel | year = 1973 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan, however, organizes femininity and masculinity according to different unconscious structures. Both male and female subjects participate in the "phallic" organization, and the feminine side of sexuation is "supplementary" and not opposite or complementary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lacan | first = Jacques | author-link = Jacques Lacan | title = Encore | publisher = Seuil | location = Paris | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of sexuation (sexual situation), which posits the development of gender-roles and role-play in childhood, is useful in countering the idea that gender identity is innate or biologically determined. In other words, the sexuation of an individual has as much, if not more, to do with their development of a gender identity as being genetically sexed male or female.&lt;ref name="Lacan &amp; Post-feminism"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = E. | title = Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Other influences include [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Mark Blechner]]. --&gt;Julia Kristeva has significantly developed the field of [[semiotics]]. She contends that patriarchal cultures, like individuals, have to exclude the maternal and the feminine so that they can come into being.&lt;ref name="Kristeva Abject"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kristeva | first = Julia | author-link = Julia Kristeva | title = Powers of Horror | year = 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Blechner expanded psychoanalytic views of sex and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blechner | first = Mark J. | author-link = Mark Blechner| title = Sex Changes: Transformations in Society and Psychoanalysis | location = New York and London | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued that there is a "gender fetish" in western society, in which the gender of sexual partners is given enormously disproportionate attention over other factors involved in sexual attraction, such as age and social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Blechner | first = Mark J. | author-link = Mark Blechner | contribution = The shaping of psychoanalytic theory and practice by cultural and personal biases about sexuality | editor-last1 = Domenici | editor-first1 = T. | editor-last2 = Lesser | editor-first2 = R. | title = Disorienting Sexuality | pages = 265–288 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1995 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bracha L. Ettinger]] transformed subjectivity in contemporary psychoanalysis since the early 1990s with the Matrixial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha L. | author-link = Bracha L. Ettinger | title = Matrix and metramorphosis | journal = [[Differences (journal)|differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 176–208 | date = 1992 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; feminine-maternal and prematernal Eros&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; of borderlinking (bordureliance), borderspacing (bordurespacement) and co-emergence. The matrixial feminine difference defines a particular gaze&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, ''The Matrixial Borderspace''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2006 (articles 1994–99). {{ISBN|0-8166-3587-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a source for trans-subjectivity and transjectivity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha L. | author-link = Bracha L. Ettinger | title = Matrixial Trans-subjectivity | journal = Theory, Culture &amp; Society, Special Issue: Problematizing Global Knowledge | volume = 23 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 218–222 | doi=10.1177/026327640602300247 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both males and females. Ettinger rethinks the human subject as informed by the archaic connectivity to the maternal and proposes the idea of a Demeter-Persephone Complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|mdkbYsjlMA8|Public lecture at EGS (2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures can have very different norms of maleness and [[masculinity]]. Blechner identifies the terror, in Western males, of penetration. Yet in many societies, being gay is defined only by being a male who lets himself be penetrated. Males who penetrate other males are considered masculine and not gay and are not the targets of prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Blechner | first = Mark J. | author-link = Mark Blechner | title = Maleness and masculinity | journal = [[Contemporary Psychoanalysis]] | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 597–613 | doi = 10.1080/00107530.1998.10747024 | date = 1998 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cultures, however, receptive [[fellatio]] is the norm for early adolescence and seen as a requirement for developing normal manliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Herdt | first = G. | title = Guardians of the Flute | location = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feminist psychoanalytic theory====
Feminist theorists such as [[Juliet Mitchell]], [[Nancy Chodorow]], [[Jessica Benjamin]], [[Jane Gallop]], Bracha L. Ettinger, [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Griselda Pollock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pollock | first = Griselda | author-link = Griselda Pollock | title = Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive | publisher = Routledge | date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luce Irigaray]] and Jane Flax have developed a Feminist psychoanalysis and argued that psychoanalytic theory is vital to the feminist project and must, like other theoretical traditions, be criticized by women as well as transformed to free it from vestiges of sexism (i.e. being [[censored]]). [[Shulamith Firestone]], in "The Dialectic of Sex" calls Freudianism the misguided feminism and discusses how Freudianism is ''almost'' completely accurate, with the exception of one crucial detail: everywhere that Freud writes "penis", the word should be replaced with "power".

Critics such as [[Elizabeth Grosz]] accuse [[Jacques Lacan]] of maintaining a sexist tradition in psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name ="Grosz"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grosz | first = Elizabeth | author-link = Elizabeth Grosz| title = Jacques Lacan: A Feminist Introduction | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Judith Butler]], Bracha L. Ettinger and [[Jane Gallop]] have used Lacanian work, though in a critical way, to develop gender theory.&lt;ref name="Gender Trouble"&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ettinger"&gt;{{citation | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha L. | author-link = Bracha L. Ettinger | contribution = The Matrixial Borderspace | editor-last = Ettinger | editor-first = Bracha L. | editor-link = Bracha L. Ettinger | title = Collected Essays from 1994–1999 | publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]] | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallop"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gallop | first = Jane | author-link = Jane Gallop | title = The Daughter's Seduction: Feminism and Psychoanalysis | publisher = Cornell University Press | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to J. B. Marchand, "The gender studies and queer theory are rather reluctant, hostile to see the psychoanalytic approach."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chaudoye | first1 = Guillemine | last2 = Cupa | first2 = Dominique | last3 = Parat | first3 = Hélène | contribution = Judith Butler | editor-last1 = Chaudoye | editor-first1 = Guillemine | editor-last2 = Cupa | editor-first2 = Dominique | editor-last3 = Parat | editor-first3 = Hélène | title = Le Sexuel, ses différences et ses genres | publisher = EDK Editions | location = Paris | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Jean-Claude Guillebaud]], gender studies (and activists of sexual minorities) "besieged" and consider psychoanalysis and psychoanalysts as "the new priests, the last defenders of the genital normality, morality, moralism or even obscurantism".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Claude Guillebaud]], Armand Abécassis, Alain Houziaux, ''La psychanalyse peut-elle guérir?'' Paris: Éditions de l'Atelier, 2005, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judith Butler]]'s worries about the psychoanalytic outlook under which sexual difference is "undeniable" and pathologizing any effort to suggest that it is not so paramount and unambiguous ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = Judith | last2 = Fassin | first2 = Éric | last3 = Wallach Scott | first3 = Joan | author-link1 = Judith Butler | author-link2 = Éric Fassin | author-link3 = Joan Wallach Scott | title = Pour ne pas en finir avec le 'genre'... table ronde | trans-title = For more on 'gender'... round table | journal = Sociétés &amp; Représentations, Special Issue: Investigating Gender | volume = 2 | issue = 24 | pages = 285–306 | doi = 10.3917/sr.024.0285 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Daniel Beaune and Caterina Rea, the gender-studies "often criticized psychoanalysis to perpetuate a family and social model of patriarchal, based on a rigid and timeless version of the parental order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Beaune | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Rea | first2 = Caterina | title = Psychanalyse sans Œdipe: Antigone, genre et subversion | page = 78 | publisher = L'Harmattan | location = Paris | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary theory===
Psychoanalytically oriented French feminism focused on visual and literary theory all along. [[Virginia Woolf]]'s legacy as well as "[[Adrienne Rich]]'s call for women's revisions of literary texts, and history as well, has galvanized a generation of feminist authors to reply with texts of their own".&lt;ref&gt;Mica Howe &amp; Sarah A. Aguier (eds). ''He said, She Says''. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]] and other feminists have articulated Myth and poetry&lt;ref name="Vanda Zajko 2006"&gt;Vanda Zajko &amp; [[Miriam Leonard]] (eds). ''Laughing with Medusa''. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and literature,&lt;ref name="Vanda Zajko 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humm, Maggie, ''Modernist Women and Visual Cultures''. Rutgers University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8135-3266-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nina Cornietz, ''Dangerous Women, Deadly Words''. Stanford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; from the point of view of gender.

===Post-modern influence===
The emergence of [[post-modernism]] theories affected gender studies,&lt;ref name="Lacan &amp; Post-feminism"/&gt; causing a movement in [[Gender identity|identity theories]] away from the concept of fixed or [[essentialism|essentialist]] gender identity, to [[Postmodernity#Distinctions in philosophy and critical theory|post-modern]]&lt;ref&gt;Grebowicz, M. (2007). ''Gender After Lyotard''. NY: SUNY Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; fluid&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, Ayelet (ed.), ''PostGender''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; or multiple identities.&lt;ref&gt;Benhabib, S. (1995). "Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange", and Butler, J. (1995), "Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange".&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of post-structuralism, and its literary theory aspect post-modernism, on gender studies was most prominent in its challenging of grand narratives. Post-structuralism paved the way for the emergence of [[queer theory]] in gender studies, which necessitated the field expanding its purview to sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderandsexuality.as.nyu.edu/page/home|title=Gender and Sexuality Studies – New York University|work=nyu.edu|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the expansion to include sexuality studies, under the influence of post-modernism gender studies has also turned its lens toward [[hegemonic masculinity|masculinity studies]], due to the work of sociologists and theorists such as [[R. W. Connell]], [[Michael Kimmel]], and E. Anthony Rotundo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Manhood: Transformations In Masculinity From The Revolution To The Modern Era|author= E.

These changes and expansions have led to some contentions within the field, such as the one between second wave feminists and queer theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amygoodloe.com/papers/lesbian-feminism-and-queer-theory-another-battle-of-the-sexes/|title=Lesbian-Feminism and Queer Theory: Another "Battle of the Sexes"?|work=amygoodloe.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line drawn between these two camps lies in the problem as feminists see it of queer theorists arguing that everything is fragmented and there are not only no grand narratives but also no trends or categories. Feminists argue that this erases the categories of gender altogether but does nothing to antagonize the power dynamics reified by gender. In other words, the fact that gender is [[social construction|socially constructed]] does not undo the fact that there are strata of oppression between genders.

==Development of theory==

===History===

The history of gender studies looks at the different perspectives of gender. This discipline examines the ways in which historical, cultural, and social events shape the role of gender in different societies. The field of gender studies, while focusing on the differences between men and women, also looks at sexual differences and less binary definitions of gender categorization.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis," American Historical Review 91, No. 5 (December 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the universal suffrage revolution of the twentieth century, the [[women's liberation movement]] of the 1960 and 1970s promoted a revision from the feminists to "actively interrogate" the usual and accepted versions of history as it was known at the time. It was the goal of many feminist scholars to question original assumptions regarding women's and men's attributes, to actually measure them, and to report observed differences between women and men.&lt;ref name="Chafetz, Janet Saltzman 1999"&gt;Chafetz, Janet Saltzman. Handbook of the Sociology of Gender. New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, these programs were essentially feminist, designed to recognize contributions made by women as well as by men. Soon, men began to look at masculinity the same way that women were looking at femininity, and developed an area of study called "men's studies".&lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"&gt;Douglas, Fedwa. ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender''. Detroit: Macmillan Reference, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1980s and 1990s that scholars recognized a need for study in the field of sexuality. This was due to the increasing interest in lesbian and gay rights, and scholars found that most individuals will associate sexuality and gender together, rather than as separate entities.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liddington|first=Jill|title=HISTORY, FEMINISM AND GENDER STUDIES|url=http://www.jliddington.org.uk/cig1.html|publisher=University of Leeds Centre for Interdisciplinary Gender Studies: Working Paper 1 Feminist Scholarship: within/across/between/beyond the disciplines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of drivers' propensity to use traffic information system showed that income and car ownership play an important role in travel behavior for men, while education and occupation were identified significant in the women's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40890-015-0002-5#page-1 |title=Investigating Women's and Men's Propensity to Use Traffic Information in a Developing Country |author=Fatemeh Baratian-Ghorghi|author2= Huaguo Zhou |year=2015 |work=Transportation in Developing Economies |accessdate=27 June 2015|doi=10.1007/s40890-015-0002-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although doctoral programs for women's studies have existed since 1990, the first doctoral program for a potential PhD in gender studies in the United States was approved in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/11/10/gender |title=Indiana Creates First Gender Studies PhD |date=10 November 2005 |first=Scott |last=Jaschik |quote=The last decade has seen the number of women's studies PhD programs grow to at least 10 – most of them relatively new.

In 2015, [[Kabul University]] became the first university in Afghanistan to offer a master's degree course in gender and women's studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FaithWorld |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2015/10/26/kabul-university-unlikely-host-for-first-afghan-womens-studies-programme/ |title=Kabul University unlikely host for first Afghan women's studies programme |publisher=Blogs.reuters.com |date=26 October 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's studies===
{{Main|Women's studies}}
Women's studies is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[women]], [[feminism]], [[gender identity|gender]], and [[politics]]. It often includes [[feminist theory]], [[women's history]] (e.g. a history of [[women's suffrage]]) and [[social history]], [[women's fiction]], [[women's health]], feminist psychoanalysis and the [[feminist]] and gender studies-influenced practice of most of the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]].

===Men's studies===
{{Main|Men's studies}}
Men's studies is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[men]], [[masculism]], [[gender identity|gender]], and [[politics]]. It often includes feminist theory, men's history and [[social history]], men's fiction, [[men's health]], feminist psychoanalysis and the feminist and gender studies-influenced practice of most of the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Timothy Laurie and Anna Hickey-Moody suggest that there 'have always been dangers present in the institutionalisation of "masculinity studies" as a semi-gated community', and note that 'a certain triumphalism vis-à-vis feminist philosophy haunts much masculinities research'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurie |first1=Timothy |last2=Hickey-Moody |first2=Anna |year=2015 |title=Geophilosophies of Masculinity: Remapping Gender, Aesthetics and Knowledge |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912564 |format=PDF |journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender in Asia===
{{See also|Women in Asia}}

Certain issues associated with gender in [[Eastern Asia]] and the [[Pacific Region]] are more complex and depend on location and context. For example, in [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], a heavy importance of what defines a woman comes from the workforce. In these countries, "gender related challenges tend to be related to economic empowerment, employment, and workplace issues, for example related to informal sector workers, feminization of migration flows, work place conditions, and long term social security".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The World Bank. [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20327365~menuPK:502969~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502940,00.html "Gender in East Asia and Pacific"], Social Development. The World Bank, 2013. Web. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in countries who are less economically stable, such as [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Timor Leste]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and some provinces in more remote locations, "women tend to bear the cost of social and domestic conflicts and natural disasters".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

One issue that remains consistent throughout all provinces in different stages of development is women having a weak voice when it comes to decision-making. One of the reasons for this is the "growing trend to decentralization [which] has moved decision-making down to levels at which women's voice is often weakest and where even the women's civil society movement, which has been a powerful advocate at national level, struggles to organize and be heard".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

East Asia Pacific's approach to help mainstream these issues of gender relies on a three-pillar method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20327365~menuPK:502969~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502940,00.html#EAP_approach | website = The World Bank | title = Gender in East Asia and Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pillar one is partnering with middle-income countries and emerging middle-income countries to sustain and share gains in growth and prosperity. Pillar two supports the developmental underpinnings for peace, renewed growth and poverty reduction in the poorest and most fragile areas. The final pillar provides a stage for knowledge management, exchange and dissemination on gender responsive development within the region to begin. These programs have already been established, and successful in, [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[China]], as well as the [[Philippines]], and efforts are starting to be made in [[Laos]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[Timor Leste]] as well. These pillars speak to the importance of showcasing gender studies.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Judith Butler===
{{Main|Judith Butler}}

The concept of gender performativity is at the core of philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler's work ''[[Gender Trouble]]''. In Butler's terms the performance of gender, sex, and sexuality is about power in society.&lt;ref name="performativity of gender"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 | page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She locates the [[Social constructivism|construction]] of the "gendered, sexed, desiring subject" in "regulative discourses". A part of Butler's argument concerns the role of sex in the construction of "natural" or coherent gender and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UczySqq19AIC|title=Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex|last=Butler|first=Judith|authorlink=Judith Butler|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136807183|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her account, gender and heterosexuality are constructed as natural because the opposition of the male and female sexes is perceived as natural in the social imaginary.&lt;ref name="performativity of gender"&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 | pages = 163–71, 177–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Historian and theorist Bryan Palmer argues that gender studies' current reliance on [[post-structuralism]] – with its reification of discourse and avoidance of the structures of oppression and struggles of resistance – obscures the origins, meanings, and consequences of historical events and processes, and he seeks to counter current trends in gender studies with an argument for the necessity to analyze lived experiences and the structures of subordination and power.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Palmer, "Descent into Discourse: The Reification of Language and the Writing of Social History", Trent University (Peterborough, Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge propose in the book ''Professing Feminism: Education and Indoctrination in Women's Studies'' that the attempt to make women's studies serve a political agenda has led to problematic results such as dubious scholarship and pedagogical practices that resemble indoctrination more than education.

[[Rosi Braidotti]] (1994) has criticized gender studies as "the take-over of the feminist agenda by studies on masculinity, which results in transferring funding from feminist faculty positions to other kinds of positions. There have been cases... of positions advertised as 'gender studies' being given away to the 'bright boys'. Some of the competitive take-over has to do with gay studies. Of special significance in this discussion is the role of the mainstream publisher Routledge who, in our opinion, is responsible for promoting gender as a way of deradicalizing the feminist agenda, re-marketing masculinity and gay male identity instead."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Feminism by any other name (Judith Butler interviews Rosi Braidotti) | journal = [[Differences (journal)|differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 44–45 | date = Summer 1994 | url = https://bagelabyss.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/butler-and-braidotti-interview-feminism-by-any-other-name1.pdf | format = pdf | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin Thomas countered that, "as Joseph Allen Boone points out, 'many of the men in the academy who are feminism's most supportive 'allies' ''are'' gay,'" and that it is "disingenuous" to ignore the ways in which mainstream publishers such as Routledge have promoted feminist theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Calvin, ed., "Introduction: Identification, Appropriation, Proliferation", ''Straight with a Twist: Queer Theory and the Subject of Heterosexuality''. University of Illinois Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender studies, and more particularly queer studies within gender studies, were repeatedly criticized by the Vatican. Pope Francis spoke about "ideological colonization",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=John |last=Newsome |title=Pope warns of 'ideological colonization' in transgender teachings |work=CNN |date=October 4, 2016 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/02/world/pope-transgender-comments/}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which he meant that "gender ideology" threatens traditional family and fertile heterosexuality. France was one of the first countries where this claim became widespread when Catholic movements marched in the streets of Paris against the bill on gay marriage and adoption. [[Bruno Perreau]] has shown that this fear has deep historical roots.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Perreau]], ''[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=27481 Queer Theory: The French Response]'', Stanford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the rejection of gender studies and queer theory expresses anxieties about national identity and minority politics.

Teaching certain aspects of gender theory was banned in public schools [[New South Wales]] after an independent review into how the state teaches sex and health education and the controversial material included in the teaching materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Urban|first1=Rebecca|title=Gender theory banned in NSW classrooms|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/education/gender-theory-banned-in-nsw-classrooms/news-story/eeb40f3264394798ebe67260fa2f5782|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=[[The Australian]]|date=February 9, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.is/5TEdW|archive-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State and governmental attitudes to gender studies ===
In Central and Eastern Europe ‘anti-gender’ movements are on the rise, especially, in Hungary, Poland, and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-conversation-global/how-hungary-and-poland-ha_b_12486148.html|title=How Hungary and Poland have silenced women and stifled human rights|last=Global|first=The Conversation|date=2016-10-14|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Anti-Gender Movements on the Rise?|url=https://pl.boell.org/sites/default/files/anti-gender-movements-on-the-rise.pdf|journal=Publication Series on Democracy|volume=38|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
In Russia gender studies are at the moment tolerated, however state support practices that pushes gender agenda related to perspectives on gender of those in power – e.g. law solving in detail specifics of domestic violence was abolished in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/09/putins-war-on-women/|title=Putin's War on Women|last=Ferris-Rotman|first=Amie|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010 the Russia has also been leading a campaign at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] to recognise so-called ‘traditional values’ as a legitimate consideration in human rights protection and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2018/01/15/traditional-values-for-the-99-the-new-gender-ideology-in-russia/|title=‘Traditional values’ for the 99%?  The new gender ideology in Russia|date=2018-01-15|work=Engenderings|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hungary ====
Gender studies programs were banned in Hungary in October 2018. In a statement released by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's office, a spokesperson stated that "The government's standpoint is that people are born either male or female, and we do not consider it acceptable for us to talk about socially constructed genders rather than biological sexes." The ban has attracted criticism from several European universities which offer the program, among them the Budapest-based Central European University, whose charter was revoked by the government, and is widely seen as part of the Hungarian ruling party's move towards totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-bans-gender-studies-programmes-viktor-orban-central-european-university-budapest-a8599796.html|title=Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban bans gender studies programmes|last=Oppenheim|first=Maya|date=2018-10-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China ====
[[Central People's Government|The Central People's Government]] supports studies of gender and social development of gender in history and practices that lead to gender equality. Citing [[Mao Zedong]]'s philosophy, "Women hold up half the sky", this may be seen as continuation of equality of men and women introduced as part of [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/china-voices-lu-ying|title=China voices: the professor of gender studies|last=Branigan|first=Tania|date=2009-05-20|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two teams stand ready, each side has 24 knights, all with heraldic [[surcoat]]s and [[caparison]]s, and each accompanied by a banner-bearer with a [[heraldic flag]].
There is a central spectators' box for the four judges, where the [[heraldic shield]]s of the competitors are displayed, 
the two teams being led by the dukes of [[duke of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[duke of Bourbon|Bourbon]], respectively, and one spectator box on each side for the ladies; inscribed over the boxes is ''plus est en vous'', the [[heraldic motto]] of the [[Gruuthuse]] family of Bruges, attributed to tournament between  [[Jean III de Gruuthuse]] and Jean de Ghistelles held in 1393.&lt;ref&gt;Octave Delepierre, '' Précis des annales de Bruges'' (1835) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=eIpDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 38f]. René of Anjou's contemporary [[Louis de Gruuthuse]] himself was a famous competitor in tournaments during the 1440s.&lt;/ref&gt; The two dukes can be seen facing each other in the center of the front lines, each with a personal heraldic flag as well with a larger flag of the same design representing their team.
The chief [[herald]] is also on horseback, between the two teams, wearing his own heraldic colours.]]

'''[[Heraldry]]''' is the system of visual identification of rank and [[genealogy|pedigree]] which developed 
in the European [[High Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name="CGH 1–18"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; closely associated with the [[Royal court|courtly]] culture of [[chivalry]], 
[[Latin Church|Latin Christianity]], the [[Crusades]], [[feudalism|feudal]] [[nobility|aristocracy]], and [[Monarchies in Europe|monarchy]] of the time. 
Heraldic tradition fully developed in the 13th century, and it flourished and developed further during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern period]].
Originally limited to nobility, heraldry is adopted by wealthy commoners in the Late Middle Ages ([[Burgher arms]]). 
Specific traditions of [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]] also develop in the late medieval period. 
Coats of arms of noble families, often after their extinction, becomes attached to the territories they used to own, giving rise to [[municipal coats of arms]] by the 16th century.

Western heraldry spread beyond its core territory of Latin Christendom in the 17th century, Western heraldic traditions being adopted in the [[Russian Empire]].

With the decline of European monarchies in favour of [[Republicanism]] in the 19th to 20th centuries, heraldic tradition declined in importance, but modern [[national flag]]s and [[national emblem]]s adopted in the 19th and 20th century still frequently use elements inherited from heraldic tradition.

==Precursors==

[[File:Harold dead bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|Depiction of [[kite shield]]s with cross or spiral ornaments in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (c. 1070).]]
Traditions of [[field sign]]s, personal [[emblem]]s or [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] go back to at least the [[Ancient Near East|Bronze Age]].
The [[Ekphrasis|ekphrastic]] description of [[shield]] designs in particular is found as a topos in classical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Units of the Roman army were sometimes identified by distinctive markings on their shields.&lt;ref&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', Bodleian Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldry developed in the [[high medieval period]], based on earlier, "pre-heraldic" or "ante-heraldic", traditions of visual identification by means of  [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]s,  [[field sign]]s, emblems used on [[numismatics|coins]], etc. Notably, [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] that would subsequently appear in 12th-century coats of arms of European nobility have pre-figurations in the [[animal style]] of ancient art (specifically  the style of [[Scythian art]] as it developed from c. the 7th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;"significant pre-figuration of medieval heraldry"  John Onians, ''Atlas of World Art'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Western heraldry is an innovation of the 12th century. Certain members of the high nobility began to display animals, 
specifically [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] on their shields beginning in c. the 1140s. 
Prior to this, western military shields of the 11th to early 12th century did sometimes show simple decorations, but not apparently tied to the personal identification of the bearer.

The [[Bayeux Tapestry]], illustrating the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of England in 1066, and probably commissioned about 1077, when the cathedral of Bayeux was rebuilt, depicts a number of shields of various shapes and designs, many of which are plain, while others are decorated with dragons, crosses, or other typically heraldic figures.  Yet no individual is depicted twice bearing the same arms, nor are any of the descendants of the various persons depicted known to have borne devices resembling those in the tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;John Woodward and George Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry: British and Foreign'', W. &amp; A. K. Johnson, Edinburgh and London (1892), vol. 1, pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Frankish or German [[round shield]]s of the 11th century ([[Ottonian]], [[Salian dynasty|Salian]]) are sometimes depicted with simple geometric ornamentation, but not with figurative emblems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vikingage.org/wiki/wiki/Round_Shield_Designs Round Shield Designs (vikingage.org)]: "chequered" (11th c., Biblio. Mun. Avranches MS50), "flared cross" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), 
"spirals" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), "spirals with dots" (c.1000-1020 Bamberg MS A. II. 42 Bamberg Apocalypse).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, an account of the French knights at the court of the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius I]] at the beginning of the twelfth century describes their shields of polished metal, utterly devoid of heraldic design.  A Spanish manuscript from 1109 describes both plain and decorated shields, none of which appears to have been heraldic.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] contained a window commemorating the knights who embarked on the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147, and was probably made soon after the event; but [[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon's]] illustration of the window before it was destroyed shows no heraldic design on any of the shields.&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proto-heraldry (12th century)==
{{seealso|List of oldest heraldry|Equestrian seal}}
[[File:Thibaut Blois.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of the [[equestrian seal]] of [[Theobald III, Count of Blois]], dated 1138. Traces of an ornamental cross design are visible on the shield.]]
The 12th-century tradition is mostly preserved in the form of the [[equestrian seal]]s popular at the time which show the nobleman as a fully armed warrior on horseback. Early equestrian seals show plain shields. From the mid 12th century, proto-heraldic designs are sometimes shown, but the shield is shown naturally, as part of the knight's armament, and is often seen in profile or partially obscured. 
The [[:File:Demay p6.jpg|equestrian seal]] of Enguerrand (Ingelram), [[count of Saint-Pol]] (1130s or 1140s) still shows a plain shield, but what would later become [[heraldic charge]]s (in this case, sheaves of corn) are shown arranged around the horse.&lt;ref&gt;"le blason fait son apparition dans les dernières années du XIIe siècle, brusquement, sans transition. Mais il est d’autres types plus anciens où les pièces des armoiries existent, s’annonçant pour ainsi dire avant de passer dans l’écu. Le sceau d’Enguerran, comte de Saint-Pol, antérieur à l’année 1150, est de ce nombre. Il offre déjà plusieurs ''gerbes'' dispersées dans le champ." 
G. Demay, ''Le Blason d’après les sceaux du Moyen-Âge'' (1877), [https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Demay_-_Le_Blason_d’après_les_sceaux_du_Moyen-Âge,_1877.djvu/7 p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;
Seals displaying actual heraldic shields appear by the very end of the 12th century or the early years of the 13th century.

Seals with elements of a distinctly heraldic character begin to appear in the second third of the 12th century.
A number of seals dating from between 1135 and 1155 appear to show the adoption of heraldic devices in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|Thomas Woodcock]] &amp; [[John Martin Robinson]], ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', Oxford University Press, New York (1988), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  
A notable example of an early armorial seal is attached to a charter granted by [[Philip I, Count of Flanders]], in 1164.  Seals from the latter part of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries show no evidence of heraldic symbolism, but by the end of the twelfth century, seals are uniformly heraldic in nature.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ''Heraldry in England'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the oldest equestrial seals with armorials are those of [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[House of Welf]], duke of Saxony (1142&amp;ndash;1180) and Bavaria (1156&amp;ndash;1180). A total of seven seals of Henry's are known. Of these, only the second shows a recognizable [[heraldic lion|lion]] displayed on his shield. This seal is attached to two documents dated to 1146. It is possible that the lion was also on the first seal (c. 1142), but it is no longer recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;Xenja von Ertzdorff, Rudolf Schulz, Winfried Baumann, ''Die Romane von dem Ritter mit dem Löwen'' (1994), p. 175,
citing Schmidt-Phiseldeck, '' Die Siegel des herzoglichen Hauses Braunschweig und Lüneburg'', nr. 1&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt;
An equestrian seal of similar antiquity is [[:File:Ottokar III of Styria 1160.jpg|that]] of [[Ottokar III of Styria]], dated 1160, with an early form of the [[Styria]]n [[Panther (legendary creature)|panther]] on his shield.

[[File:Geoffrey of Anjou Monument.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Enamel from the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], showing his shield in profile, with four out of what were presumably six lions visible (six lions are on the shield of the effigy of  his grandson  [[William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William Longespée]], d. 1226).]]
The oldest extant depiction of a coloured armoury can be seen on the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], who died in 1151.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  An enamel, probably commissioned by Geoffrey's widow between 1155 and 1160, depicts him carrying a blue shield decorated with six golden lions rampant.  He wears a blue helmet adorned with another lion, and his cloak is lined in vair.  A medieval chronicle states that Geoffrey was given a shield of this description when he was knighted by his father-in-law, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], in 1128; but this account probably dates to about 1175.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Stothard, ''Monumental Effigies of Great Britain'' (1817) pl. 2, illus. in Anthony Wagner, Richmond Herald, ''Heraldry in England'', Penguin (1946), pl. I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Discoveries_Heraldry.html?id=hmZ5QgAACAAJ Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition]'', "[[Abrams Discoveries]]" series. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. (1997), {{p.|18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest evidence of the association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future [[John, King of England|King John]] during the lifetime of his father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who died in 1189.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it seems reasonable to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield.  John's elder brother, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], who succeeded his father on the throne, is believed to have been the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early mention of heraldic shields in [[Middle High German literature]] also dates to the 12th century.
Shield designs are described in the  ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'' (c. 1150&amp;ndash;1170), such as the boar carried by the Romans, as well as, in isolated cases, in the ''[[The Song of Roland|Rolandslied]]'' (c. 1115), ''[[King Rother|König Rother]]'' (c. 1150), [[Heinrich von Veldeke|Veldecke's ''Eneas'']] (c. 1170), and [[Erec (poem)|Hartmann's ''Erec'']] (c. 1185).
These appear in the larger context of describing an armed protagonist, and are not yet tied to the bearer's pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;"With the exception of several heraldic shields that appear in the ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'', such as the boar carried by the Romans&amp;mdash;the oldest heraldic insignia in medieval German epic literature, according to Zips [''Wappenwesen'', 1966]&amp;mdash;most of the precourtly and even courtly epics up to 1200 contain very few decorated shields at all. Several isolated coats of arms are mentioned in the German ''[[The Song of Roland|Rolandslied]]'', ''[[King Rother|König Rother]]'', [[Heinrich von Veldeke|Veldecke's ''Eneas'']], and [[Erec (poem)|Hartmann's ''Erec'']]&amp;mdash;mostly related to the protagonists." Wandhoff (2016),  ([https://books.google.ch/books?id=5mYYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 p. 57]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barbarossa.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Depiction of emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] as a [[Crusades|Crusader]] (c. 1188). The [[heraldic cross|cross symbol]] worn on the shield and surcoat at this time is not a heraldic charge identifying the bearer but a [[field sign]] worn by all participants in the Crusade.]]
At least two distinctive features of heraldry are generally accepted as products of the [[Crusades]]: the surcoat, an outer garment worn over the armor to protect the wearer from the heat of the sun, was often decorated with the same devices that appeared on a knight's shield.  It is from this garment that the phrase "coat of arms" is derived.{{dubious|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--the term is from the 14th century, and has no direct relation to the crusades at all--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also the lambrequin, or mantling, that depends from the helmet and frames the shield in modern heraldry, began as a practical covering for the helmet and the back of the neck during the Crusades,{{cn|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--do you mean the period of the crusades (i.e. the 12th century), or the actual campaign? If the latter, what is the evidence?--&gt;
serving much the same function as the surcoat.  Its slashed or scalloped edge, today rendered as billowing flourishes, is thought to have originated from hard wearing in the field, or as a means of deadening a sword blow and perhaps entangling the attacker's weapon.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval heraldry==
{{see|Roll of arms}}

===Terminology===
{{see|Blazon}}
The origin of the term ''[[:wikt:heraldry|heraldry]]'' itself ([[Middle English]] ''heraldy'', [[Old French]] ''hiraudie''), can be placed in the context of the early forms of the [[Tournament (medieval)|knightly tournament]]s in the 12th century. Combattants wore full armour, and identified themselves by wearing their emblems on their [[heater shield|shields]]. A [[herald]] (Old French ''heraut'', from a [[Frankish language|Frankish]] ''*hariwald'' "commander of an army") was an officer who would announce the competitors. 

Originally a type of messenger employed by noblemen, heralds assumed the responsibility of learning and knowing the rank, pedigree, and heraldic devices of various knights and lords, as well as the rules and protocols governing the design and description, or ''blazoning'' of arms, and the precedence of their bearers.&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as the late thirteenth century, certain heralds in the employ of monarchs were given the title "King of Heralds", which eventually became "[[King of Arms]]."&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"/&gt;

The term ''[[coat of arms]]''  in origin refers to the [[surcoat]] with heraldic designs worn by combattants, especially in the knightly tournament, in Old French ''cote a armer''. The sense is transferred to the heraldic design itself in Middle English, in the mid-14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/coat%20of%20arms#etymonline_v_28240 etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heraldic shield===
{{see|Escutcheon (heraldry)}}
By about the 1230s, the shields used by cavalry were almost triangular in shape, referred to as [[heater shield]]s. Such a 
shield is preserved, the shield of [[Konrad von Thüringen]], dated c. 1230, showing the ''lion barry'' of the [[Ludovingians]].
This heater-shaped form was used in warfare during the apogee of the [[Chivalry|Age of Chivalry]], and it becomes the classic heraldic shield, or [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], at about the time of the [[Battle of Crecy]] (1346) and the founding of the [[Order of the Garter]] (1348), when heraldry had become a fully developed system.
All medieval [[roll of arms|rolls of arms]], from the late 13th and throughout the 14th to 15th century, almost exclusively use this shield shape. 

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Sello-real-con-bloca-alfonso-II-aragon-millau-1187.jpg|''Counterseal'' of [[Alfonso II of Aragon]], dated 1187: one of the earliest depiction of a "heraldic shield" (depiction of the shield design in isolation of the full depiction of the armed bearer), in this case showing an early form of the [[Pales of Aragon]]. The shield at this time still has the [[kite shield|"kite" shape]].

Adhemar is wearing a bishop's mitre and displaying a [[crescent (heraldry)|crescent]] on his shield.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Division of the field===
{{see|Division of the field}}
Coats of arms of the 13th century in some cases already include marks of [[cadency]] to distinguish descendants, but they mostly still do without [[division of the field]] to indicate descent from more than one lineage. 
An exception is the [[coat of arms of Castile and León]], showing
the [[Heraldry of Castile|arms of Castile]] (the yellow castle) [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] with the [[Heraldry of León|arms of León]] (the purple lion) in the late 13th century ''[[Camden Roll]]'' and  ''Segar's Roll''.
This practice becomes much more common in the late medieval period. For example, the  arms of [[Eric of Pomerania]] as king of the [[Kalmar Union]] (r. 1396–1439) combine five coats of arms, for Denmark, Sweden, the [[House of Bjelbo]], Pomerania and Norway, quartered by a cross gules and with a central [[inescutcheon]].
In the later 15th century, holders of ecclesiastical office would quarter their family arms with those of the 
order or diocese they represented. Thus [[Pierre d'Aubusson]] as grand master of the [[Knights of Malta]] quartered his family arms with the [[Maltese cross]]; bishop [[Hugo von Hohenlandenberg]] quartered his family arms with those of the [[bishopric of Constance|prince-bishopric of Constance]].

===Heraldic authorities===
{{see|Heraldic authority}}
By the middle of the fourteenth century, the principle that only a single individual was entitled to bear a particular coat of arms was generally accepted, and disputes over the ownership of arms seems to have led to gradual establishment of heraldic authorities to regulate their use.  The earliest known work of [[Law of Arms|heraldic jurisprudence]], ''De Insigniis et Armis'', was written about 1350 by [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato]], a professor of law at the [[University of Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/bartolo.htm ''De Insigniis et Armis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Squibb, "The Law of Arms in England", in ''The Coat of Arms'' vol. II, no. 15 (Spring 1953), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The most celebrated armorial dispute in English heraldry is that of ''[[Scrope v Grosvenor]]'' (1390), in which two different men claimed the right to bear ''azure, a bend or''.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  The continued proliferation of arms, and the number of disputes arising from different men assuming the same arms, led [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] to issue a proclamation in 1419, forbidding all those who had not borne arms at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] from assuming arms, except by inheritance or a grant from the crown.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siebmacher002.jpg|thumb|upright|Royal coats of arms in ''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]'' (1605)]]
In 1484, during the reign of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the various heralds employed by the crown were incorporated into the [[College of Arms]], through which all new grants of arms would eventually be issued.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"&gt;Pastoureau, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The college currently consists of three Kings of Arms, assisted by six Heralds, and four [[Pursuivants]], or junior officers of arms, all under the authority of the [[Earl Marshal]]; but all of the arms granted by the college are graÅnted by the authority of the crown.&lt;ref name="CoA Official Site"&gt;[http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us/heralds-officers College of Arms official website], accessed 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar bodies regulate the granting of arms in other monarchies and several members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but in most other countries there is no heraldic authority, and no law preventing anyone from assuming whatever arms they please, provided that they do not infringe upon the arms of another.&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"/&gt;

Beginning in the reign of [[Henry VIII]], the Kings of Arms were commanded to make ''[[heraldic visitation|visitations]]'', in which they traveled about the country, recording arms borne under proper authority, and requiring those who bore arms without authority either to obtain authority for them, or cease their use.  Arms borne improperly were to be taken down and defaced.  The first such visitation began in 1530, and the last was carried out in 1700, although no new commissions to carry out visitations were made after the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1689.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn, ''Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry'', MacGibbon &amp; Kee, London (1960), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[early modern period]], heraldry became highly complex and standardised, divided into "national"  traditions. 
Western heraldry can be divided into three large cultural groups, "Gallo-British", "German-Nordic" and "Latin".
Part of the Gallo-British group are [[French heraldry|French]], 
[[English heraldry|English]] and [[Scottish heraldry|Scottish]] traditions. The "German-Nordic" group includes the tradition of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its greater sphere of incluence, including 
[[German heraldry]], [[Swedish heraldry]], [[Norwegian heraldry]], [[Danish heraldry]], [[Russian heraldry]],  [[Polish heraldry]], [[Hungarian heraldry]], [[Croatian heraldry]], [[Serbian heraldry]], etc.

The "Latin" group includes [[Italian heraldry]], [[Spanish heraldry]] and [[Portuguese heraldry]].

[[Dutch heraldry]] shows influence of all three groups.

Prominent burghers and corporations, including many cities and towns, assumed or obtained grants of arms, with only nominal military associations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gwynn-Jones, ''The Art of Heraldry: Origins, Symbols, and Designs'', Parkgate Books/Barnes &amp; Noble (1998), pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heraldic devices were depicted in various contexts, such as religious and funerary art, and in using a wide variety of media, including stonework, carved wood, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[stained glass]], and [[embroidery]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottfried Neubecker, ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'', Macdonald and James Publishers (1977), pp. 253–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the abandonment of the [[joust]] as courtly practice at the beginning of the 17th century,  heraldic achievements, especially the [[helmet (heraldry)|heraldry]], ceased to be tied to the technological development or fashion of [[jousting armour]] and shapes of helmets became purely conventional, and in the various regional systems, separate types of helmets came to be tied to separate ranks of nobility.

[[Baroque]] heraldic designs became increasingly elaborate, both in terms of the increasingly complex [[division of the field]] and in terms of the surrounding achievements, culminating in the development of "landscape heraldry", incorporating realistic depictions of landscapes, during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century.

==Modern heraldry==
{{see|Socialist heraldry|National coat of arms|National flag}}
{{see|United States heraldry|Canadian heraldry|Mexican heraldry|New Zealand heraldry|Puerto Rican heraldry|South African heraldry|Coats of arms and emblems of Africa}}
{{see|Consulta Araldica|State Herald of Sweden|Heraldic Council of the President of the Russian Federation|Flemish Heraldic Council|Bureau of Heraldry|Canadian Heraldic Authority|United States Army Institute of Heraldry|State Council of Heraldry|New Zealand Herald Extraordinary}}
In the mid-19th century, there was  a renewed interest in the history of armory,
but now mostly from an [[antiquarian]]'s or [[genealogy|genealogist]]'s perspective. This led to a re-evaluation of older designs over Baroque and Roccoco styles, a new appreciation for the medieval origins of the art.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the late nineteenth century, heraldry has focused on the use of varied lines of partition and little-used ordinaries to produce new and unique designs.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "heraldry" is sometimes used to include the [[national emblem]]s of modern states. Some modern states, especially constitutional monarchies, use national coats of arms (such as the [[coat of arms of Denmark]] or the [[coat of arms of Spain]]).
States with republican tradition tend to avoid coats of arms, using "national seals" or "national emblems" instead, such as the [[national emblem of France]], the [[national emblem of Turkey]] or the [[Great Seal of the United States]].

In [[aesthetics]], the '''human figure''' or '''human form''' in art, sculpture and other art forms involves a study and appreciation of the [[beauty]] of the [[human]] body in its depiction or presentation. The study involves an appreciation of the [[Human body shape|body shape]], including [[Human positions|body postures]] - sitting, standing or even sleeping, and movements - [[Human gait|walking]], running, [[dancing]] etc. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]  refers to the human figure as the ideal of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aesthetics-online.org/ideas/leddy.html Section 17, Immanuel Kant]&lt;/ref&gt; The human figure conforms very well to the law that states that [[form follows function]], which is believed to be a result of [[evolution]] over thousands of generations.

== Study ==
The human figure is one of the most enduring themes in the visual arts. Very few art forms are not related to human figure such as [[music]], though it figures in [[lyrics]]. A study of the human figure includes a detailed study of the following subjects:
* [[Sculpture]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/HumanForm.html Human figure in various art forms]&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to figure drawing.
* [[Figure drawing]] involves the depiction of the body in different postures or in motion or at work.
* [[Literature]] involves the description of the human figure to imply its [[sexual attraction]], physical ability and mentality.
* [[Dance]] is an [[art form]] that involves [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social]] [[Interpersonal relationship|interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting.
* [[Body language]] involves [[human position|body posture]], [[gesture]]s, [[facial expression]]s, and [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]].
* [[Fashion]] and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]].
* [[Ergonomics]] in passenger vehicles and seatings, this deals with [[unisex]] approach to human figure.

== Body proportions ==
{{Main|Body proportions}}
''Body proportions'' are the study of relation of [[human anatomy|human body]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://realcolorwheel.com/human.htm Human Proportions]&lt;/ref&gt; or in general, animal body, parts to each other and the whole, essential for depiction of the overall figure.

== Sculpture and figure drawing ==
[[File:Carracci, Annibale - Studio di nudo.jpg|thumb|Nude study, by [[Annibale Carracci]]]]
{{See also|Sculpture|figure drawing}}
A [[figure drawing]] is a study of the human form in its various shapes and postures. It is a study or stylized depiction of the human form, with the line and form of the human figure as the primary objective, rather than the subject person. It is a composed image of the subject in a still position. A life drawing is a work that has been drawn from an observation of a live [[Model (art)|model]].

'''Ideological criticism''' is a method in [[rhetorical criticism]] concerned with critiquing texts for the dominant ideology they express while silencing opposing or contrary [[ideologies]]. It was started by a group of scholars roughly in the late-1970s through the mid-1980s at universities in the United States. Leading scholars of ideological criticism were Michael Calvin McGee at the University of Iowa and Phillip Wander at San Jose State University. Wander's 1983 article, "The Ideological Turn in Modern Criticism,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=March 1983|title=The ideological turn in modern criticism|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978309368110?journalCode=rcst19|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/10510978309368110|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1984 article, "The Third Persona: An Ideological Turn in Rhetorical Theory,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=December 1984|title=The third persona: An ideological turn in rhetorical theory|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978409368190|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=197–216|doi=10.1080/10510978409368190|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain two of the most important articles in the field. According to Sonja Foss, “the primary goal of the ideological critic is to discover and make visible the dominant ideology or ideologies embedded in an artifact and the ideologies that are being muted in it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice (3rd ed.)|last=Foss|first=|publisher=Waveland Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Long Grove, Illinois|pages=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foss has also mentioned the contribution to ideological criticism of several theoretical schools, including [[Marxism]], [[structuralism]], [[cultural studies]], and [[postmodernism]].

==Ideograph==
A unit of analysis in ideological criticism, or what Foss calls "traces of ideology in an artifact," is the [[ideograph (rhetoric)|ideograph]].  It is a symbol representing an ideological concept and is more than what the symbol itself depicts.  Michael McGee, a renowned ideological critic, postulated that an “ideograph is an ordinary term found in political discourse” that “is a high-order abstraction representing collective commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=462–463}}  Thus, McGee restricted ideographs to [[words]], words that “constitute a vocabulary of public motives, which authorize and warrant public actions”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|p=479}}  McGee encourages the study of ideographs (such as “[[liberty]]” and “[[Political freedom|freedom]]”) to help identify the ideological position of a [[society]].  He argues such terms are used in [[discourse]] as a means of justifying problematic issues within a society.  The meaning of an ideograph is defined by a society and its [[culture]] and can change over time.  Ideographs need not be only positive in nature, but can be negative as well.  For example, [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[slavery]], can “guide behavior and belief negatively by branding unacceptable behavior."  McGee notes that to fully understand ideographs, they must be examined both “[[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]” as well as “[[Synchronic analysis|synchronically]].”  That is, ideographs need to be examined across time to determine how their meanings may have changed and all ideographs that are used in a given situation must be considered.

Who in [[democracy]] would be opposed to actions taken under the auspices of liberty and freedom?  To do so would, ideographically speaking, be undemocratic. Citizens of a democratic state are “conditioned” to believe that liberty and freedom are so fundamentally important that society expects those citizens to simply unquestioningly accept actions claiming to be in defense of liberty and freedom.  For example, even within the United States, the ideograph of freedom has changed.  At the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] (1775–1783), freedom meant breaking away from the tyrannical rule of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].  Today, freedom means many things including the freedom to pursue one's dreams and the freedom to be left alone.  People disagree about the freedoms that are most important: freedom to possess guns, freedom to make decisions that affect one's body, freedom from fear or violence, and freedom of movement.  Depending on one's ideological orientation, the ideograph of freedom represents many things, which is why it can be so powerfully used by politicians.  Ideographs succeed in political discourse because of their inability to be concretely understood.  

Ideographs need not be [[Linguistics|verbal]] only; they can be [[Visual communication|visual]] too.  In 1997, Janis Edwards and Carol Winkler expanded the idea of the ideograph to include visual images as well as written words.{{Sfn|Edwards and Winkler 1997|pp=289–310}}  They argue images can act as “a Visual reference point that forms the basis of arguments about a variety of themes and subjects” that are used by both “[[elite]]s and non-elites” alike.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=487–508}}  Like McGee’s textual ideographs, visual ideographs depict common values and goals in a given culture, recur in different contexts over time, and are used to validate arguments and [[Social practice theory|social practice]]s.  Edwards and Winkler mention images of people can act as ideographs too.  “In their construct, a person (character) is abstracted and elevated to the status of a cultural figure, and becomes a surface for the articulation of the political character, employing cultural ideals”.  Foss identifies the following steps in a piece of ideological criticism: 1) “formulate a [[research question]] and select an [[Social artifact|artifact]]”; 2) “select a [[unit of analysis]]” (which she calls “traces of ideology in an artifact”); 3) “analyze the artifact” (which, according to Foss, involves identifying the ideology in the artifact, analyzing the interests the ideology serves, and uncovering the strategies used in the artifact to promote the ideology); and 4) “write the critical essay”.

The concept appears in numerous fields and is encountered in works of [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[David Bohm]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Gilles Deleuze]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W.

==Usage==
The word ''individuation'' occurs with different meanings and connotations in different fields.

===In philosophy===
Philosophically, "individuation" expresses the general idea of how a thing is identified as an individual thing that "is not something else". This includes how an individual person is held to be distinct from other elements in the world and how a person is distinct from other persons.

===In Jungian psychology===
In [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]], also called [[analytical psychology]], individuation is the process in which the individual self develops out of an undifferentiated [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] – seen as a developmental [[Psyche (psychology)|psychic process]] during which innate elements of personality, the components of the immature [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], and the [[Experience (disambiguation)|experience]]s of the person's life become, if the process is more or less successful, integrated over time into a well-functioning whole.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
{{See also|Analytical psychology#Self-realization and neuroticism}}

===In the media industry===
The media industry has begun using the term ''individuation'' to denote new printing and online technologies that permit [[mass customization]] of the contents of a newspaper, a magazine, a broadcast program, or a website so that its contents match each individual user's unique interests. This differs from the traditional [[mass-media]] practice of producing the same contents for all readers, viewers, listeners, or online users.

Communications theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]] alluded to this trend{{qn|date=June 2015}} when discussing{{when|date=June 2015}} the future of printed books in an electronically interconnected world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UUMoGmujREwC&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;ots=2C5ZRF6d1W&amp;dq=mcluhan%20packaged%20information%20services&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false alluded to this trend], books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===In physics===
Two [[quantum entanglement|quantum entangled]] particles cannot be understood independently. Two or more states in [[quantum superposition]], e.g., as in [[Schrödinger's cat]] being simultaneously dead and alive, is mathematically not the same as assuming the cat is in an individual alive state with 50% probability. The [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] says that [[Complementarity (physics)|complementary variables]], such as [[Position (vector)|position]] and [[momentum]], cannot both be precisely known - in some sense, they are not individual variables. A ''natural criterion of individuality'' has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=Individuation in Quantum Mechanics|journal=Foundations of Physics|date=2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=299–304|doi=10.1007/s10701-009-9382-x|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-009-9382-x|bibcode=2011FoPh...41..299J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arthur Schopenhauer==

For Schopenhauer the principium individuationis constituted of time and space, being the ground of multiplicity. In his view, the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different, with each of the two states having its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other. 

This view influenced [[Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Howard|first=Don A.|title=Albert Einstein as a Philosopher of Science|date=December 2005|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~dhoward1/vol58no12p34_40.pdf|journal=Physics Today|volume=58|issue=12|pages=34–40|publisher=American Institute of Physics|format=PDF|bibcode=2005PhT....58l..34H|doi=10.1063/1.2169442|accessdate=2015-03-08|via=University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, author's personal webpage|quote=From Schopenhauer he had learned to regard the independence of spatially separated systems as, virtually, a necessary a priori assumption ... Einstein regarded his separation principle, descended from Schopenhauer's ''principium individuationis'', as virtually an axiom for any future fundamental physics. ... Schopenhauer stressed the essential structuring role of space and time in individuating physical systems and their evolving states. This view implies that difference of location suffices to make two systems different in the sense that each has its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other. For Schopenhauer, the mutual independence of spatially separated systems was a necessary a priori truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schrödinger]] put the Schopenhaurian label on a folder of papers in his files “Collection of Thoughts on the physical Principium individuationis.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cosmos of Science: Essays of Exploration|last=John Earman, John D. Norton|first=|publisher=Univ of Pittsburgh Pr|year=1997|isbn=0822939304|location=|pages=131|quote=Schrödinger's biographer, Walter Moore, details the lifelong influence of Schopenhauer on Schrödinger ... or the Schopenhauerian label that Schrödinger put on one folder of papers in his files: "Sammlung der Gedanken über das physikalische Principium individuationis".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carl Jung==
{{Main|Carl Jung}}
According to [[Jungian psychology]], individuation ({{lang-de|Individuation}}) is a process of psychological integration. "In general, it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated [from other human beings]; in particular, it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general, collective psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G.  ''Psychological Types''.  Collected Works, vol. 6, par. 757.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and [[collective unconscious]] are brought into consciousness (e.g., by means of dreams, [[active imagination]], or [[Free association (psychology)|free association]]) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche.&lt;ref name="jung1"&gt;Jung, C.G. (1962). ''Symbols of Transformation: An Analysis of the Prelude to a Case of Schizophrenia'' (vol. 2). New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuation has a [[Holistic health|holistic healing]] effect on the person, both mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="jung1"/&gt;

In addition to [[Complex (psychology)|Jung's theory of complexes]], his theory of the individuation process forms conceptions of an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] filled with mythic images, a non-sexual [[libido]], the general types of [[extraversion and introversion]], the compensatory and prospective functions of [[dream]]s, and the synthetic and constructive approaches to fantasy formation and utilization.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. (Shamdasani, S). (2009). ''The Red Book'', p. 208, par. 3. Verona, Italy: Mondadori Printing.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The symbols of the individuation process . . . mark its stages like milestones, prominent among them for Jungians being the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]], the [[wise old man]] . . . and lastly [[Anima and animus|the anima in man and the animus]] in woman."&lt;ref&gt;Jung quoted in J. Jacobi, ''Complex, Archetype, Symbol'' (London 1959) p. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "There is often a movement from dealing with the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] at the start . . . to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] at the second stage, to the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] as the third stage, to the anima or animus, to the [[Self]] as the final stage. Some would interpose the [[Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman|Wise Old Man and the Wise Old Woman]] as spiritual archetypes coming before the final step of the [[Self]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, John, ''Subpersonalities'' (London 1990) p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gilbert Simondon==
{{Main|Gilbert Simondon}}
In ''L'individuation psychique et collective'', Gilbert Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending [[Process philosophy|ontological process]] of individuation.

Simondon also conceived of "pre-individual fields" which make individuation possible. Individuation is an ever-incomplete process, always leaving a "pre-individual" left over, which makes possible future individuations. Furthermore, individuation always creates both an individual subject and a collective subject, which individuate themselves concurrently.

==Bernard Stiegler==
{{Main|Bernard Stiegler}}
The philosophy of Bernard Stiegler draws upon and modifies the work of [[Gilbert Simondon]] on individuation and also upon similar ideas in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. During a talk given at the [[Tate Modern]] art gallery in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/bernard-stiegler-culture-and-technology Bernard Stiegler: Culture and Technology], tate.org.uk, 13 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Stiegler summarized his understanding of individuation. The essential points are the following:

*The ''I'', as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to ''we'', which is a collective individual. The ''I'' is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of ''I''&amp;nbsp;’s acknowledge each other’s existence.
*This inheritance is an adoption, in that I can very well, as the French grandson of a German immigrant, recognize myself in a past which was not the past of my ancestors but which I can make my own. This process of adoption is thus structurally factual.
*The ''I'' is essentially a process, not a state, and this process is an in-dividuation — it is a process of psychic individuation. It is the tendency to ''become one'', that is, to become indivisible.
*This tendency never accomplishes itself because it runs into a counter-tendency with which it forms a [[Metastability|metastable equilibrium]]. (It must be pointed out how closely this conception of the dynamic of individuation is to the Freudian [[Drive theory#Psychoanalysis|theory of drives]] and to the thinking of [[Nietzsche]] and [[Empedocles]].)
*The ''we'' is also such a process (the process of collective individuation). The individuation of the ''I'' is always inscribed in that of the ''we'', whereas the individuation of the ''we'' takes place only through the individuations, polemical in nature, of the ''I''&amp;nbsp;’s which constitute it.
*That which links the individuations of the ''I'' and the ''we'' is a pre-individual system possessing positive conditions of effectiveness that  belong to what Stiegler calls retentional apparatuses. These retentional apparatuses arise from a technical system which is the condition of the encounter of the ''I'' and the ''we'' — the individuation of the ''I'' and the ''we'' is in this respect also the individuation of the technical system.
*The technical system is an apparatus which has a specific role wherein all objects are inserted — a technical object exists only insofar as it is disposed within such an apparatus with other technical objects (this is what [[Gilbert Simondon]] calls the technical group).
*The technical system is also that which founds the possibility of the constitution of retentional apparatuses, springing from the processes of [[Grammar|grammatization]] growing out of the process of individuation of the technical system. And these retentional apparatuses are the basis for the dispositions between the individuation of the ''I'' and the individuation of the ''we'' in a single process of psychic, collective, and technical individuation composed of three branches, each branching out into process groups.
*This process of triple individuation is itself inscribed within a vital individuation which must be apprehended as
**the vital individuation of natural organs,
**the technological individuation of artificial organs,
**and the psycho-social individuation of organizations linking them together.
*In the process of individuation, wherein knowledge as such emerges, there are individuations of mnemo-technological subsystems which overdetermine, ''qua'' specific organizations of what Stiegler calls tertiary retentions, the organization, transmission, and elaboration of knowledge stemming from the experience of the sensible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16359">The '''international trade of fine art''' is most precisely defined as the trade across nations of unique, non-reproducible works by an artist.  The art trade contradicts typical international trade models since it is a culturally significant good.  It is not treated by consumers the same way any other commodity would because of the aesthetic value that is unique to each piece.  Despite existing as a finite physical piece, unique art is still considered intellectual property. This sparks the debate as to whether art exports should be restricted for nationalistic and cultural reasons, or liberalized for the sake of a healthier international market.

==Decorative art as a trade commodity==

The trade commodities included in the definition of "[[visual art]]" include the following: [[painting]], drawing, [[sculpture]] in various materials, [[printmaking]], [[photography]], maps, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], [[mail art]], [[assemblage art]], [[textile arts]], [[fashion design]], [[video art]], [[digital art]], and product design.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; These works are non-functional, emotional, social, political, traditional, and cultural statements, and in comparison to other goods, are not greatly affected by commercial-sector constraints.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Though visual art is a physical, hand-made good, it is often culturally rooted and created for aesthetic appeal.  Therefore, art is considered [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

The 4-digit [[Standard International Trade Classification]] (SITC) classifies "Works of Art, Collectors Pieces and Antiques" under category 8960, which includes paintings, drawings, pastels, original sculptures, original prints, stamps, and antiques over 100 years old. This is the only SITC category that consists of unique, non-reproducible art, which is typically thought of as "fine" art.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The 4-digit [[Harmonized System|harmonized commodity]] description and coding system, otherwise known as the harmonized system (HS) code for "fine" art is 9701, which is classified as "Paintings, Drawings and Pastels, Executed Entirely By Hand".&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

==History of international art trade==

The earliest known regulation of cultural property dates to 1464, when [[Pope Pius II]] prohibited the exportation of works of art from the Papal States.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; It wasn’t until the mid-1500s that any sizable amount of formal artwork was transferred between nations in licit markets.  Previously, local demand had satisfied the supply of artwork, but it couldn’t keep up as the number of artists increased.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;  Consequently, artists exported their works to foreign markets.  Between 1540 and 1670, an average of 144 paintings per year were transported between the [[Netherlands]] and [[New Spain]].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Throughout much of the [[early modern period]], if an artist could not domestically sell his art, he sold it instead to dealers who exported the works abroad.  Starting in the 17th Century, however, most art was traded at the massive auction houses of [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]] of London, which both still survive today.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Like any other traded good, art has been historically subjected to import duties.  For example, in the more enlightened years of the 19th Century, art escaped high tariffs in America because the government viewed art as an important cultural good.   At other times, though, tariff revenue was considered more important than free intellectual property.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], neutral [[Switzerland]] became the primary trafficker of art on the European continent.  Most "degenerate" works of art that the [[Nazi]] government purged from German museums were sold there, where they largely entered [[black markets]].  Since the war ended, there has been a massive, ongoing effort to recover all of these works.  For fifteen years following the war, 45,000 pieces were returned to France, mostly to Jewish owners.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Today, almost every country in the world has restrictions and regulations on the export of cultural property.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;  Currently, most art auctions are facilitated on online sites such as [[eBay]] and [http://Lauritz.com/ Lauritz.com].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

==Economic theory of art trade==

Fine art proves complicated for economists to analyze, mostly because trade in unique art is in large part trade between consumers – the "secondary market" – rather than the "primary market" trade between the producer (artist) and the consumer.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;  For example, when a museum buys a sculpture from a private collector, the exchange is between two consumers and considered a transaction in the secondary market because neither of them produced the sculpture.  It is more complicated for economists, then, to capture these transactions in their data.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

[[Comparative advantage]] is also more difficult to pinpoint in the case of cultural goods.   There is a certain degree of cultural nationalism of art,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; making some nations reluctant to part with their cultural property.  Additionally, relative advantage cannot simply be calculated by the [[marginal cost]] of producing a unit of art, since aesthetic value plays so heavily into its price.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Trade theory demonstrates how much and at what price countries trade goods if they have different endowments or different preferences.  But this model is not very useful because of retentive nationalism:&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; a country that is relatively less endowed with art-producing resources will not stop producing simply because they can import art from abroad at cheaper prices.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

===Determination of prices===

Traditional trade theory treats art as a homogenous, non-differentiated good, which is where it fails to reliably predict trade trends.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Unique art is valued precisely because of its uniqueness.  Since each piece of art is different, and because each piece does not appear on the market very often, the determination of changes in market value prove difficult to determine.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Economists use the [[hedonic regression]] (HR) estimation method to calculate prices in art.  This is used to predict prices based on various attributes of the artwork such as its dimensions, the artist, and the subject matter attended to.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Protectionism vs. Liberalization==
 
[[Protectionism]] is a nationalistic viewpoint that contends that a healthy cultural industry is necessary to assert national sovereignty and identity.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;  Countries with small domestic markets are often overwhelmed by imports from larger markets in which producers can make up their costs of production by dumping content abroad.  America is the largest exporter of artwork in the world, and English speaking countries are especially vulnerable to American imports.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; Protectionists view this as a modern form of American [[imperialism]], which reduces cultural diversity when national industries are unable to compete.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

Protectionism is less concerned with direct economic interest as it is with preserving cultural integrity.  Australian economist [[David Throsby]] argues that investment in "cultural capital" may be necessary for the sustainability of a culture.&lt;ref name="twelve" /&gt; [[Paul M. Bator]], who helped negotiate and draft the [[UNESCO]] convention on the International Trade of Art, argues that larger countries are responsible for the cultural interests of smaller ones.  He explains in ''The International Trade in Art'' that "art-rich countries should create tax and other financial and psychological incentives to persuade those with important antiquities and archaeological objects to keep them at home".&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;


Proponents of [[Economic liberalization|liberalization]] in international art markets stress that open markets contribute to efficient production and distribution of cultural products.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; Reliance on competitive market forces also frees creative individuals from the hindrance of government oversight.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;   Many special characteristics of cultural products – the lack of rivalry in content, [[economies of scale]], and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration economies]] – enhance the case for opening markets.  Protection raises rather than lowers domestic prices, which detracts from consumer welfare.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The "[[commodification]] objection" is the reluctance to classify an important cultural good as a simple trade commodity, and is frequently cited by cultural protectionists.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;  Those who advocate openness believe that free-market nations can provide the most effective political force for development of an active market.  This argument diametrically opposes Bator’s: free-trade advocates contend that large countries are better suited to help smaller nations finance organization of their cultural resources for more effective participation in international trade.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The issue of the illicit art trade also factors into the debate.  In terms of value transferred, the illegal trafficking of art ranks in black market activities second only to narcotics.&lt;ref name="thirteeen" /&gt; More problematic than the actual theft of the work is its subsequent transport, which proves difficult to prosecute since most paintings are easily concealable. By maintaining an open market, liberalists argue that much of the illicit trade of art can be eliminated.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;

==Largest countries by total trade in art==

The following tables list the top world import/export values, according to data from the UN Comtrade database using SITC code 8960.  The sums here are greater than those included in HS 9701 (works done exclusively by hand) because the SITC classification includes works such as antiques, stamps, and sculpture that aren’t captured in the HS definition.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

      <comment>It looks like this tangential sentence is only here to advance a particular belief. It's not relevant to the description of what late-term abortion is, which is the purpose of this section. (Plus in any case, a ''pregnancy'' can't be alive or dead.)</comment>

Retrieved 2011-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; is a termination of [[pregnancy]] that is performed during a later stage of pregnancy. Late termination of pregnancy is [[Abortion in the United States#By trimester of pregnancy|more controversial]] than abortion in general because it results in the death of a [[fetus]] that is more developed and sometimes [[fetal viability|able to survive independently]]. Given the complex, gradual nature of [[human fetal development]], the definition of "late" in this context is not precise, and different medical publications have discussed the varying [[gestational age]] points that can be involved.

==Definition==
A late termination of pregnancy often refers to an induced ending of pregnancy after the [[Gestational age|20th week]] of [[gestation]]. The exact point when a pregnancy becomes late-term, however, is not clearly defined. Some sources define an abortion after 16 weeks as "late".&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;Torres, Aida and Forrest, Jacqueline Darroch. (1988). [http://www.holysmoke.org/fem/fem0543.htm Why Do Women Have Abortions]. ''Family Planning Perspectives, 20 (4)'', 169-176. Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weihe, Pál, Steuerwald, Ulrike,  Taheri, Sepideh, Færø, Odmar, Veyhe, Anna Sofía, &amp; Nicolajsen, Did. (2003).

Danish Ministry of Environment. Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Three articles published in 1998 in the same issue of the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' could not agree on the definition. Two of the ''JAMA'' articles chose the 20th week of gestation to be the point where an abortion procedure would be considered late-term.&lt;ref&gt;Sprang, M.L, and Neerhof, M.G. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/744 Rationale for banning abortions late in pregnancy]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8),'' 744-747.&lt;br /&gt;Grimes, D.A. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/747 The continuing need for late abortions]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8)'', 747-750.&lt;/ref&gt; The third ''JAMA'' article chose the third trimester, or 27th week of gestation.&lt;ref name="Jama2"&gt;Gans Epner, J.E., Jonas, H.S., Seckinger, D.L. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/724 Late-term abortion]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8)'', 724-729.&lt;/ref&gt;

The point at which an abortion becomes late-term is often related to the "[[Fetus#Viability|viability]]" (ability to survive outside the [[uterus]]) of the [[fetus]]. Sometimes late-term abortions are referred to as post-viability abortions.

==Mental health==
While a single first-trimester abortion carried no more mental health risk than carrying a pregnancy to term, abortion could not be proven safe in other cases as far as mental health was concerned. Women who terminate a pregnancy because of abnormalities discovered through fetal screenings have a similar risk of negative mental health outcomes as women who miscarry a wanted pregnancy or experience a stillbirth or the death of a newborn. However, "the differing patterns of psychological experiences observed among women who terminate an unplanned pregnancy versus those who terminate a planned and wanted pregnancy highlight the importance of taking pregnancy intendedness and wantedness into account when seeking to understand psychological reactions to abortion."&lt;ref name="apa-2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/abortion/index.aspx | title = Mental Health and Abortion | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | year = 2008 | accessdate = April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2013 found that most women seeking late-term abortion "fit at least one of five profiles: They were raising children alone, were depressed or using illicit substances, were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence, had trouble deciding and then had access problems, or were young and nulliparous."  The study data did not include any women who were having abortions "on grounds of fetal anomaly or life endangerment." The researchers concluded that "Bans on abortion after 20 weeks will disproportionately affect young women and women with limited financial resources."&lt;ref name=Foster2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Diana|title=Who Seeks Abortions at or After 20 Weeks?|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|date=December 2013|volume=45|issue=4|pages=210–218|doi=10.1363/4521013|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4521013.html|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an earlier study published in 1987, the Alan Guttmacher Institute collected questionnaires from 1,900 women in the United States who came to clinics to have abortions. Of the 1,900 questioned, 420 had been pregnant for 16 or more weeks. These 420 women were asked to choose among a list of reasons they had not obtained the abortions earlier in their pregnancies.  The results were as follows:&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;
* 71% of women were unaware they were pregnant or misjudged gestation
* 48% of women found it hard to make arrangements for abortion
* 33% of women were afraid to tell their partner or parents
* 24% of women took longer to decide whether to have an abortion
* 8% of women had an abortion after a change in their relationship status
* 8% of women were initially pressured not to have abortion
* 6% of women chose to have an abortion because of a change in circumstances after becoming pregnant
* 6% of women were not properly educated on how timing affects abortion
* 5% of women were unaware that abortion was available to them
* 2% A fetal problem was diagnosed late in pregnancy
* 11% Other

=== England and Wales ===
The NHS records the reasons given for abortions at all stages of development. In 2015, 2,877 abortions were performed at 20 weeks or above. Of these, 23 (0.8%)&lt;!-- Ground A (alone, or with B, C, D) or F or G  --&gt; were performed to save the life of the pregnant woman, 1,801&lt;!-- C (alone) --&gt; (63%) were performed for mental or physical health reasons, and 1046&lt;!-- Ground E (alone, or with A, B, C or D)  --&gt; (36%) were performed because of foetal abnormalities. (The data do not sum up to 100% because multiple reasons could be recorded for each abortion.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/529344/Abortion_Statistics_2015_v3.pdf|title=Report on abortion statistics in England and Wales for 2015|last=Department of Health|first=|date=17 May 2016|issue=|doi=|volume=|page=31 (Table 7b)|pmid=|access-date=2016-10-24|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal restrictions==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Intact dilation and extraction]] --&gt;
As of 1998, among the 152 most populous countries, 54 either banned abortion entirely or permitted it only to save the life of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;Anika Rahman, Laura Katzive and Stanley K. Henshaw. [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2405698.pdf A Global Review of Laws on Induced Abortion, 1985-1997], International Family Planning Perspectives (Volume 24, Number 2, June 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, 49 of the 152 most populous countries were without restriction as to reason, but 44 of these imposed limits after a particular [[gestational age]]:&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

* 12 weeks (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia, Greece, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Rep., Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Norway, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Ukraine, Tajikistan,  Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan)
* 13 weeks (Italy)
* 14 weeks (Austria, Cambodia, Germany, Hungary, and Romania)
* 18 weeks (Sweden)
* 24 weeks (Singapore)
* no limit (Canada, China, and North Korea)
* viability (Netherlands and to some extent the United States)

In these countries, abortions after the general gestational age limit are allowed only under restricted circumstances, which include, depending on country, risk to the woman's life, physical or mental health, fetal malformation, cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape, or poor socio-economic conditions. For instance, in Italy, abortion is allowed on request up until 90 days, after which it is allowed only if the pregnancy or childbirth pose a threat to the woman’s life, a risk to physical health of the woman, a risk to mental health of the woman; if there is a risk of fetal malformation; or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or other sexual crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313162004/http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark provides a wider range of reasons, including social and economic ones, which can be invoked by a woman who seeks an abortion after 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Denmark.abo.htm|title=DENMARK|author=|date=|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions at such stages must in general be approved by a doctor or a special committee, unlike early abortions which are performed on demand. The ease with which the doctor or the committee allows a late term abortion varies significantly by country, and is often influenced by the social and religious views prevalent in that region.

Some countries, like Canada, China (Mainland only) and Vietnam have no legal limit on when an abortion can be performed.&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act}}
The [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions on abortion, including ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'',  allow states to impose more restrictions on post-viability abortions than during the earlier stages of pregnancy.

As of December 2014, forty-two states had bans on late-term abortions that were not [[Facial challenge|facially]] unconstitutional under ''Roe v. Wade'' or [[enjoined]] by court order.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;Guttmacher Institute. (April 1, 2007). [http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_PLTA.pdf State Policies on Later-Term Abortions]. ''State Policies in Brief.''  Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' ruled that Congress may ban certain late-term abortion techniques, "both previability and postviability",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Annas|first1=George J.|title=The Supreme Court and Abortion Rights|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=24 May 2007|volume=2007|issue=356|pages=2201–2207|doi=10.1056/NEJMhle072595|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhle072595|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it had done in banning [[intact dilation and extraction]] with the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Warren M.|title=Did I violate the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2003/10/did_i_violate_the_partialbirth_abortion_ban.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=Slate.com|date=22 Oct 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court has held that bans must include exceptions for threats to the woman's life, physical health, and mental health, but four states allow late-term abortions only when the woman's life is at risk; four allow them when the woman's life or physical health is at risk, but use a definition of health that pro-choice organizations believe is impermissibly narrow.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  Note that just because a portion of a state's law is found to be unconstitutional does not mean that the entire law will be deemed unconstitutional: "[I]nvalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief," meaning the court could declare that only those parts of the law that are violative of the Constitution are invalid (declaratory relief), or that the court can prohibit the state from enforcing those portions of the law (injunctive relief).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/04-1144.html 546 U.S. 320] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteen states prohibit abortion after a certain number of weeks' gestation (usually 22 weeks from the last menstrual period).&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court held in ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'' that a statute may create "a presumption of viability" after a certain number of weeks, in which case the physician must be given an opportunity to rebut the presumption by performing tests.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=492&amp;invol=490 492 U.S. 490] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Because this provision is not explicitly written into these state laws, as it was in the Missouri law examined in ''Webster'', pro-choice organizations believe that such a state law is unconstitutional, but only "to the extent that it prohibits pre-viability abortions".&lt;ref name="Delaware"&gt;NARAL Pro-Choice America. (2007). "[http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/choice-action-center/in_your_state/who-decides/state-profiles/delaware.html?templateName=lawdetails&amp;issueID=3&amp;ssumID=2516 Delaware]."  ''Who Decides? The Status of Women's Reproductive Rights in the United States.'' Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten states (although Florida's enforcement of such laws are under [[permanent injunction]]) require a second physician's approval before a late-term abortion can be performed.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a requirement of "confirmation by two other physicians" (rather than one other physician) because "acquiescence by co-practitioners has no rational connection with a patient's needs and unduly infringes on the physician's right to practice".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;invol=179 410 U.S. 179] (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-choice organizations, such as the [[Guttmacher Institute]], posit that some of these state laws are unconstitutional, based on these and other Supreme Court rulings, at least to the extent that these state laws require approval of a second or third physician.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

Thirteen states have laws that require a second physician to be present during late-term abortion procedures in order to treat a fetus if born alive.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt; The Court has held that a doctor's right to practice is not infringed by requiring a second physician to be present at abortions performed after viability in order to assist in the case of a living fetus.&lt;ref&gt;''Planned Parenthood Ass'n v. Ashcroft'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/462/476/case.html 462 U.S. 476], 486-90 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
There are at least four medical procedures associated with late-term abortions:
* [[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E)
* Early [[labor induction]] (sometimes called "induction abortion")
* [[Intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX or D&amp;X), sometimes referred to as "[[Partial birth abortion#Partial-birth abortion|''partial-birth abortion'']]"
* [[Hysterotomy abortion]]

==Viability==
There is no sharp limit of development, age, or weight at which humans automatically become viable.&lt;ref name="developinghuman"&gt;Moore, Keith and Persaud, T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2622">The '''Library of Latin Texts''' (LLT) is a subscription-based database of Latin texts, from Antiquity up to the present day. First started in 1991 as the ''Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts'' (CLCLT), it continues to be developed by the ''Centre ‘Traditio Litterarum Occidentalium’'' and is hosted by [[Brepols Publishers]].

== History ==
In 1991, development of the ''Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts'' (CLCLT) started, with the aim of encompassing the entirety of Christian Latin literature. This digital database, initially released as a [[CD-ROM]], was produced by the Cetedoc, led by prof. [[Paul Tombeur]] at the [[Université catholique de Louvain]]. Since 2001, the activities of Cetedoc have been continued in Turnhout by the ''Centre ‘Traditio Litterarum Occidentalium’'' (CTLO), still led by Paul Tombeur.

When in 2002, the decision was made to expand the database's chronological scope beyond Medieval and Patristic times, its name was changed to ''Library of Latin Texts''. A further development followed in 2009. Then, a B series (LLT-B) was added to the original LLT (hence known as LLT-A). The LLT-B's scope was to accelerate the growth of the database by directly adopting the text of existing editions, without the intensive research work that is applied to the texts of the LLT-A. This work includes verifying facts related to the text and correcting errors in the printed edition.&lt;ref name="Brepolis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brepolis.net/pdf/Brepolis_LLT_EN.pdf|title=Library of Latin Texts|publisher=BREPOL&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;S|accessdate=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference between the LLT and similar databases ==
Unlike similar initiatives, like [[Corpus Corporum]] or [[The Latin Library]], the LLT is not an open-access database. This allows for the adoption of copyrighted editions. In fact, while open-access initiatives have to rely on out-of-copyright, possibly outdated editions, the LLT's policy is to select texts that have "been edited according to best contemporary scholarly practice".&lt;ref name="Brepolis" /&gt;

Born in [[Vienna]] into one of Europe's richest families, he inherited a fortune from his father in 1913. He initially made some donations to artists and writers and then, in a period of severe personal depression after the First World War, he gave away his entire fortune to his brothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/phi/prt/en2341144.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302195044/http://www.goethe.de/ges/phi/prt/en2341144.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 March 2011 |quote=When his father died in 1913 and Ludwig inherited a considerable fortune...

His philosophy is often divided into an early period, exemplified by the ''Tractatus'', and a later period, articulated in the ''Philosophical Investigations''. The early Wittgenstein was concerned with the logical relationship between propositions and the world and believed that by providing an account of the logic underlying this relationship, he had solved all philosophical problems. The later Wittgenstein rejected many of the assumptions of the ''Tractatus'', arguing that the meaning of words is best understood as their use within a given [[language-game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/conant/Ian%20Proops%20The%20New%20Wittgenstein%20A%20Critique.pdf|title=PDF|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey among American university and college teachers ranked the ''Investigations'' as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as "the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations."&lt;ref name="here"&gt;Lackey, Douglas [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0031-806X.00022/abstract?

He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men."&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Malcolm, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===The Wittgensteins===
{{Further|Karl Wittgenstein}}
[[File:Karl Wittgenstein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Karl Wittgenstein]] was one of the richest men in Europe.&lt;ref name=Bramann/&gt;|235x235px]]
According to a family tree prepared in Jerusalem after World War II, Wittgenstein's paternal great-great-grandfather was Moses Meier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wittgensteinchronology.com/4.html|title=Wittgenstein Family History - Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Chronology of his Life and Work|last=Preston|first=John|website=www.wittgensteinchronology.com|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] land agent who lived with his wife, Brendel Simon, in [[Bad Laasphe]] in the [[Siegen-Wittgenstein|Principality of Wittgenstein]], Westphalia.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:de:Schloss Wittgenstein|Schloss Wittgenstein]]. Various sources spell Meier's name Maier and Meyer.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1808, [[Napoleon]] issued a decree that everyone, including Jews, must adopt an inheritable [[Jewish surname|family surname]], and so Meier's son, also Moses, took the name of his employers, the [[Sayn-Wittgenstein]]s, and became Moses Meier Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Hermann Christian Wittgenstein—who took the middle name "Christian" to distance himself from his Jewish background—married Fanny Figdor, also Jewish, who converted to [[Protestantism]] just before they married, and the couple founded a successful business trading in wool in Leipzig.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=4-5}} Ludwig's grandmother Fanny was a first cousin of the famous violinist [[Joseph Joachim]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=5}}

They had 11 children—among them Wittgenstein's father. Karl Otto Clemens Wittgenstein (1847–1913) became an industrial tycoon, and by the late 1880s was one of the richest men in Europe, with an effective monopoly on Austria's steel cartel.&lt;ref name="Bramann"&gt;Bramann, Jorn K. and Moran, John.

Retrieved 2 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated63"&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to Karl, the Wittgensteins became the second wealthiest family in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], only behind the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated63"/&gt;  Karl Wittgenstein was viewed as the Austrian equivalent of [[Andrew Carnegie]], with whom he was friends, and was one of the wealthiest men in the world by the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Bramann"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;   As a result of his decision in 1898 to invest substantially in the Netherlands and in Switzerland as well as overseas, particularly in the US, the family was to an extent shielded from the hyperinflation that hit Austria in 1922.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=7}} However, their wealth diminished due to post-1918 hyperinflation and subsequently during the [[Great Depression]], although even as late as 1938 they owned 13 mansions in Vienna alone.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

* For his time and place of birth, see Edmonds, David and John Eidinow. ''Wittgenstein's Poker''. Faber and Faber, 2001, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Karl and Poldi had nine children in all. There were four girls: Hermine, [[Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein|Margaret]] (Gretl), Helene, and a fourth daughter Dora who died as a baby; and five boys: Johannes (Hans), Kurt, Rudolf (Rudi), [[Paul Wittgenstein|Paul]]—who became a concert pianist despite losing an arm in [[World War I]]—and Ludwig, who was the youngest of the family.&lt;ref name=Bartley16&gt;Bartley, William Warren. ''Wittgenstein''. Open Court, 1994, p. 16, first published 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The children were baptized as Catholics, received formal Catholic instruction, and were raised in an exceptionally intense environment.&lt;ref name=MW&gt;[[Norman Malcolm]], [[Peter Winch]], ''Wittgenstein: A Religious Point of View?'', Cornell University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The family was at the center of Vienna's cultural life; [[Bruno Walter]] described the life at the Wittgensteins' palace as an "all-pervading atmosphere of humanity and culture."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=8}} Karl was a leading patron of the arts, commissioning works by [[Auguste Rodin]] and financing the city's exhibition hall and art gallery, the [[Secession hall (Austria)|Secession Building]]. [[Gustav Klimt]] painted Wittgenstein's sister for her wedding portrait, and [[Johannes Brahms]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] gave regular concerts in the family's numerous music rooms.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=8}}{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=18}}

For Wittgenstein, who highly valued precision and discipline, [[contemporary music]] was never considered acceptable at all. "Music," he said to his friend Drury in 1930, "came to a full stop with [[Brahms]]; and even in Brahms I can begin to hear the noise of machinery."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Redpath, Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Student's Memoir, London: Duckworth, 1990, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig Wittgenstein himself had [[absolute pitch]],&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp=157&lt;/ref&gt; and his devotion to music remained vitally important to him throughout his life: he made frequent use of musical examples and metaphors in his philosophical writings, and was unusually adept at whistling lengthy and detailed musical passages.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=442-443}} He also learnt to play the [[clarinet]] in his thirties.&lt;ref name=Monk15/&gt; A fragment of music (three bars), composed by Wittgenstein, was discovered in one of his 1931 notebooks, by [[Michael Nedo]], Director of the Wittgenstein Institute in Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/1450-9814/2005/1450-98140505393H.pdf "Three Bars by Wittgenstein"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714153847/http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/1450-9814/2005/1450-98140505393H.pdf |date=14 July 2014 }} by Eric Heijerman, ''Muzikologija'', 2005 (5): pp. 393–395.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family temperament and the brothers' suicides===
[[Ray Monk]] writes that Karl's aim was to turn his sons into captains of industry; they were not sent to school lest they acquire bad habits, but were educated at home to prepare them for work in Karl's industrial empire.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=11}} Three of the five brothers would later commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Kenny"&gt;Kenny, Anthony.

Retrieved 7 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Michael Fitzgerald (psychiatrist)|Michael Fitzgerald]] argues that Karl was a harsh perfectionist who lacked empathy, and that Wittgenstein's mother was anxious and insecure, unable to stand up to her husband.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;Fitzgerald, Michael. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/wd1bk8fkp4ru6xvy/ "Did Ludwig Wittgenstein have Asperger's syndrome?"],
''European Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry'', volume 9, number 1, pp. 61–65. {{doi|10.1007/s007870050117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Brahms said of the family, whom he visited regularly: "They seemed to act towards one another as if they were at court."&lt;ref name="autogenerated63"/&gt; The family appeared to have a strong streak of depression running through it. [[Anthony Gottlieb]] tells a story about Paul practicing on one of the pianos in the Wittgensteins' main family mansion, when he suddenly shouted at Ludwig in the next room: "I cannot play when you are in the house, as I feel your scepticism seeping towards me from under the door!"&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;Gottlieb, Anthony.

The family Palace housed seven grand pianos&lt;ref&gt;Waugh p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; and each of the siblings pursued music "with an enthusiasm that, at times, bordered on the pathological."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The eldest brother, Hans, was hailed as a musical prodigy. At the age of four, writes [[Alexander Waugh]], Hans could identify the [[Doppler effect]] in a passing siren as a quarter-tone drop in pitch, and at five started crying "Wrong! Wrong!" when two brass bands in a carnival played the same tune in different [[Key signature|keys]]. But he died in mysterious circumstances in May 1902, when he ran away to America and disappeared from a boat in [[Chesapeake Bay]], most likely having committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, pp. 24–26.
* Also see Monk, p. 11ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, aged 22 and studying chemistry at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]], the third eldest brother, Rudi, committed suicide in a Berlin bar. He had asked the pianist to play [[Thomas Koschat]]'s "Verlassen, verlassen, verlassen bin ich" ("Forsaken, forsaken, forsaken am I"),&lt;ref&gt;For the Koschat song, see {{YouTube|QLMBkWWavJo|"Verlassen bin ich"}}. Retrieved 11 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; before mixing himself a drink of milk and [[potassium cyanide]]. He had left several suicide notes, one to his parents that said he was grieving over the death of a friend, and another that referred to his "perverted disposition". It was reported at the time that he had sought advice from the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]], an organization that was campaigning against [[Paragraph 175]] of the German Criminal Code, which prohibited homosexual sex.

The second eldest brother, Kurt, an officer and company director, shot himself on 27 October 1918 at the end of World War I, when the Austrian troops he was commanding refused to obey his orders and deserted ''en masse''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=11}} According to Gottlieb, Hermine had said Kurt seemed to carry "...the germ of disgust for life within himself."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Wittgenstein wrote: "I ought to have... become a star in the sky.

==1903–1906: Realschule in Linz==

===Realschule in Linz===
[[File:Realschule in Linz.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Realschule]]'' in Linz]]
Wittgenstein was taught by private tutors at home until he was fourteen years old. Subsequently, for three years, he attended a school. After the deaths of Hans and Rudi, Karl relented, and allowed Paul and Ludwig to be sent to school. Waugh writes that it was too late for Wittgenstein to pass his exams for the more academic [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Wiener Neustadt; having had no formal schooling, he failed his entrance exam and only barely managed after extra tutoring to pass the exam for the more technically oriented [[k.u.k.]] [[Realschule]] in [[Linz]], a small state school with 300 pupils.&lt;ref name="Waugh33"&gt;Waugh, p. 33.
* McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: a life : young Ludwig 1889–1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 51ff.
* K.u.k. stood for "[[Kaiserlich und königlich]]".
* The successor institution to the ''Realschule'' in Linz is [[Bundesrealgymnasium Linz Fadingerstraße]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, when he was 14, he began his three years of formal schooling there, lodging nearby in term time with the family of Dr. Josef Strigl, a teacher at the local gymnasium, the family giving him the nickname Luki.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}}&lt;ref name="Sandgruber"&gt;Sandgruber, Roman. [http://www.nachrichten.at/oberoesterreich/serien/wir-oberoesterreicher/Das-Geld-der-Wittgenstein;art11547,561859 "Das Geld der Wittgenstein"],"Oberösterreichische Nachrichten". 26 February 2011. Linz 2011. Retrieved 5 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On starting at the Realschule, Wittgenstein had been moved forward a year.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}} Historian [[Brigitte Hamann]] writes that he stood out from the other boys: he spoke an unusually pure form of [[High German]] with a stutter, dressed elegantly, and was sensitive and unsociable.&lt;ref name=Hamann15&gt;Hamann, Brigitte and Thornton, Thomas. ''Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship''. Oxford University Press, 2000 (first published 1996 in German), pp. 15–16, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Monk writes that the other boys made fun of him, singing after him: "''Wittgenstein wandelt wehmütig widriger Winde wegen Wienwärts''"&lt;ref name=Monk15&gt;Monk, pp.14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Monk can only be used as a source for the original German because this is incorrectly translated by Monk as "Wittgenstein wends his woeful windy way Vienna-wards"--&gt; ("Wittgenstein strolls wistfully Vienna-wards due to adverse winds"). In his leaving certificate, he received a top mark (5) in religious studies; a 2 for conduct and English, 3 for French, geography, history, mathematics and physics, and 4 for German, chemistry, geometry and freehand drawing.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}} He had particular difficulty with spelling and failed his written German exam because of it. He wrote in 1931: "My bad spelling in youth, up to the age of about 18 or 19, is connected with the whole of the rest of my character (my weakness in study)."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}}

===Faith===
Wittgenstein was baptized as an infant by a Catholic priest and received formal instruction in Catholic doctrine as a child, as was common at the time.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; In an interview, his sister Gretl Stonborough-Wittgenstein says that their grandfather's "strong, severe, partly ascetic Christianity" was a strong influence on all the Wittgenstein children.&lt;ref&gt;Stonborough-Wittgenstein, Gretl. Reviewed in Portraits of Wittgenstein, Flowers &amp; Ground&lt;/ref&gt;  It was while he was at the ''Realschule'' that he decided he had lost his faith in God and became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name=Monk18&gt;Monk, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He nevertheless believed in the importance of the idea of [[confession]]. He wrote in his diaries about having made a major confession to his oldest sister, Hermine, while he was at the ''Realschule''; Monk speculates that it may have been about his loss of faith. He also discussed it with Gretl, his other sister, who directed him to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.&lt;ref name=Monk18/&gt; As a teenager, Wittgenstein adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he abandoned epistemological idealism for [[Gottlob Frege]]'s conceptual realism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately "shallow" thinker: "Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind ... where real depth starts, his comes to an end."&lt;ref&gt;''Culture and Value'', 1933-4, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's religious faith and his relationship with Christianity and religion, in general (for which he professed a sincere and devoted reverence{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}) would change over time, much like his philosophical ideas. In 1912, Wittgenstein wrote to Russell saying that Mozart and Beethoven were the actual sons of God.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=34}} However, Wittgenstein resisted formal religion, saying it was hard for him to "bend the knee",&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, 113&lt;/ref&gt; though his grandfather's beliefs continued to influence Wittgenstein—as he famously said, "I cannot help seeing every problem from a religious point of view".&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig, reviewed in Wittgenstein's Religious Point of View, Tim Labron&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein referred to [[Augustine of Hippo]] in his ''Philosophical Investigations.'' Philosophically, Wittgenstein's thought shows fundamental alignment with religious discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. Ashford, "Wittgenstein's Theologians: A Survey of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Impact on Theology"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wittgenstein would become one of the century's fiercest critics of [[Scientism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monk|first1=Ray|title=Wittgenstein's Forgotten Lesson|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/regulars/ray-monk-wittgenstein|accessdate=24 August 2014|work=Prospect Magazine|issue=July 1999|publisher=Prospect Magazine|date=20 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With age, a deepening personal spirituality led to several elucidations and clarifications, as he untangled language problems in religion, attacking, for example, the temptation to think of God's existence as a matter of scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein, "Lectures on Religious Belief"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote, "I have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rush Rhees, "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Personal Recollections"&lt;/ref&gt; In Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'', he writes, "Is what I am doing [my work in philosophy] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." His close friend [[Norman Malcolm]] would write, "Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Malcolm, "Wittgenstein: A Religious Point of View"&lt;/ref&gt; At last, Wittgenstein writes, "Bach wrote on the title page of his ''[[Orgelbüchlein]]'', ‘To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’  That is what I would have liked to say about my work."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Influence of Otto Weininger===
[[File:OttoWeiningerspring1903.jpg|thumb|upright|Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]] (1880–1903)]]
While a student at the ''Realschule'', Wittgenstein was influenced by Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]]'s 1903 book ''Geschlecht und Charakter'' (''[[Sex and Character]]'').
Weininger (1880–1903), who was also Jewish, argued that the concepts male and female exist only as [[Platonic realism|Platonic forms]], and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=19-26}} Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.&lt;ref&gt;p216, Philosophical Tales, Cohen, M., Blackwell 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter dated 23 August 1931, Wittgenstein wrote the following to [[G. E. Moore]];&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Moore,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Thanks for your letter. I can quite imagine that you don’t admire Weininger very much, what with that beastly translation and the fact that W. must feel very foreign to you. It is true that he is fantastic but he is great and fantastic. It isn’t necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great. I.e. roughly speaking if you just add a “∼” to the whole book it says an important truth.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=141}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;In an unusual move, Wittgenstein took out a copy of Weininger's work on 1 June 1931 from the Special Order Books in the university library. He met Moore on 2 June where he probably gave Moore the copy of Weininger's work.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=141}}

===Jewish background and Hitler===
{{Further|History of the Jews in Austria}}
There is much debate about the extent to which Wittgenstein and his siblings, who were of 3/4 Jewish descent, saw themselves as Jews. The issue has arisen in particular regarding Wittgenstein's schooldays, because [[Adolf Hitler]] was, for a while, at the same school at the same time.&lt;ref name=McGuinnessStern&gt;For the view that Wittgenstein saw himself as completely German, not Jewish, see McGuinness, Brian. "Wittgenstein and the Idea of Jewishness", and for an opposing view, see Stern, David. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FWAX4Ff69SwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Wittgenstein:+Biography+and+Philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xwGKTNX8JYWenwfT0LiyDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Was%20Wittgenstein%20a%20Jew%3F&amp;f=false "Was Wittgenstein Jewish?"], both in James Carl Klagge. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, pp. 231ff and p. 237ff respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Goldstein]] argues it is "overwhelmingly probable" the boys met each other: that Hitler would have disliked Wittgenstein, a "stammering, precocious, precious, aristocratic upstart ..."&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Lawrence. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EvHPNoKvmf0C&amp;pg=PA167 ''Clear and Queer Thinking: Wittgenstein's Development and his Relevance to Modern Thought'']. Duckworth, 1999, p. 167ff. Also see [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2659846 "Clear and Queering Thinking"], review in ''Mind'', Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have dismissed as irresponsible and uninformed any suggestion that Wittgenstein's wealth and unusual personality may have fed Hitler's antisemitism, in part because there is no indication that Hitler would have seen Wittgenstein as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Marie. "Hi Ludwig", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 26 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein and Hitler were born just six days apart, though Hitler had to re-sit his mathematics exam before being allowed into a higher class, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so they ended up two grades apart at the ''Realschule''.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler started at the school on 17 September 1900, repeated the first year in 1901, and left in the autumn of 1905; see Kersaw, Ian. ''Hitler, 1889–1936''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2000, p. 16ff.
* McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: a life : young Ludwig 1889–1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 51ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Monk estimates they were both at the school during the 1904–1905 school year, but says there is no evidence they had anything to do with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, p. 15.
* Brigitte Hamann argues in ''Hitler's Vienna'' (1996) that Hitler was bound to have laid eyes on Wittgenstein, because the latter was so conspicuous, though she told ''Focus'' magazine they were in different classes, and she agrees with Monk that they would have had nothing to do with one another. See Hamann, Brigitte and Thornton, Thomas. ''Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship''. Oxford University Press, 2000, pp. 15–16, 79, and Thiede, Roger.

In his own writings&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., MS 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein frequently referred to himself as Jewish, at times as part of an apparent self-flagellation. For example, while berating himself for being a "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" thinker, he attributed this to his own Jewish sense of identity, writing: "The saint is the only Jewish genius. Even the greatest Jewish thinker is no more than talented. (Myself for instance)."&lt;ref&gt;''Culture and Value'', Ludwig Wittgenstein, (Oxford 1998), page 16e (see also, pages 15e–19e).&lt;/ref&gt; While Wittgenstein would later claim that "[m]y thoughts are 100% Hebraic,"&lt;ref&gt;M.O'C. Drury, "Conversations with Wittgenstein", in ''Recollections of Wittgenstein'', ed. R. Rhees, New York: Oxford University Press, revised edition, 1984, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Hans Sluga]] has argued, if so, "His was a self-doubting Judaism, which had always the possibility of collapsing into a destructive self-hatred (as it did in [[Otto Weininger|Weininger's]] case) but which also held an immense promise of innovation and genius."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Sluga]], ''The Cambridge companion to Wittgenstein'', (Cambridge 1996), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1906–1913: University==

===Engineering at Berlin and Manchester===
[[File:10. Ludwig Wittgenstein, aged about eighteen.jpg|right|thumb|Ludwig Wittgenstein, aged about eighteen]]
[[File:1895 technische hochschule charlottenburg.jpg|right|thumb|The old [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin]]
He began his studies in mechanical engineering at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin, on 23 October 1906, lodging with the family of professor Dr. Jolles. He attended for three semesters, and was awarded a [[diploma]] (''Abgangzeugnis'') on 5 May 1908.

During his time at the Institute, Wittgenstein developed an interest in [[aeronautics]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=27}} He arrived at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in the spring of 1908 to study for a doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior of kites in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near [[Glossop]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=29}} Specifically, the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] researched and investigated the ionization of the upper atmosphere, by suspending instruments on balloons or kites. At Glossop Wittgenstein worked under Professor of Physics Sir [[Arthur Schuster]].&lt;ref name="Lemco 39–51"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lemco |first=Ian |date=22 January 2007 |title=Wittgenstein's Aeronautical Investigation |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=39–51 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2006.0163 |jstor=20462605 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked on the design of a propeller with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911, and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=30-35}} At the time, contemporary propeller designs were not advanced enough to actually put Wittgenstein’s ideas into practice, and it would be years before a blade design that could support Wittgenstein’s innovative design was created. Wittgenstein’s design required air and gas to be forced along the propeller arms to combustion chambers on the end of each blade, where it was then compressed by the centrifugal force exerted by the revolving arms and ignited. Propellers of the time were typically wood, whereas modern blades are made from pressed steel laminates as separate halves, which are then welded together. This gives the blade a hollow interior, and therefore creates an ideal pathway for the air and gas.&lt;ref name="Lemco 39–51" /&gt;

[[File:11. With Eccles at the Kite-Flying Station in Glossop.jpg|right|thumb|Ludwig with Eccles at the Kite-Flying Station in [[Glossop]]]]
Work on the jet-powered propeller proved frustrating for Wittgenstein, who had very little experience working with machinery.&lt;ref name="Mays, p.137"&gt;Mays, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Bamber, a British engineer who was his friend and classmate at the time, reported that “when things went wrong, which often occurred, he would throw his arms around, stomp about, and swear volubly in German.”&lt;ref&gt;Mays, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Eccles, another friend from that period, Wittgenstein then turned to more theoretical work, focusing on the design of the propeller — a problem that required relatively sophisticated mathematics.&lt;ref name="Mays, p.137" /&gt;

It was at this time that he became interested in the [[foundations of mathematics]], particularly after reading [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903), and [[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903).&lt;ref&gt;Beaney, Michael (ed.). ''The Frege Reader''. Blackwell, 1997, pp. 194–223, 258–289.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=30}} He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=30}} In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the [[University of Jena]] to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} He wrote: "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics."&lt;ref name="Kanterian36"&gt;Kanterian, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival at Cambridge===
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein 1910.jpg|right|thumb|Wittgenstein, 1910s]]
Wittgenstein wanted to study with Frege, but Frege suggested he attend the University of Cambridge to study under Russell, so on 18 October 1911 Wittgenstein arrived unannounced at Russell's rooms in [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]].&lt;ref name="ConnorRobertson"&gt;O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F. [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wittgenstein.html "Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein"], St Andrews University. Retrieved 2 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was having tea with [[C. K. Ogden]], when, according to Russell, "an unknown German appeared, speaking very little English but refusing to speak German. He turned out to be a man who had learned engineering at Charlottenburg, but during this course had acquired, by himself, a passion for the philosophy of mathematics &amp; has now come to Cambridge on purpose to hear me."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} He was soon not only attending Russell's lectures, but dominating them. The lectures were poorly attended and Russell often found himself lecturing only to [[C. D. Broad]], [[Eric Harold Neville|E. H. Neville]], and H. T. J. Norton.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, until it was time for the evening meal in [[Formal (university)#Terminology|Hall]]. Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]: "My German friend threatens to be an infliction."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|pp=88-89}}
Russell soon came to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, especially after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=88}} Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: "I love him &amp; feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is ''the'' young man one hopes for."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} The role-reversal between Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein was soon such that Russell wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: "His [Wittenstein]'s criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''Autobiography''. Routledge, 1998, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambridge Moral Sciences Club and Apostles===
[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|234x234px|[[Bertrand Russell]], 1907]]

In 1912 Wittgenstein joined the [[Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club|Cambridge Moral Sciences Club]], an influential discussion group for philosophy dons and students, delivering his first paper there on 29 November that year, a four-minute talk defining philosophy as "all those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof by the various sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, Jack. [http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1617&amp;context=russelljournal "Russell and the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club"], ''Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell'' Studies: Vol. 1, issue 2, article 3, winter 1982.
* Also see Klagge, James Carl and Nordmann, Alfred (eds.) ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: Public and Private Occasions''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, p. 332, citing Michael Nedo and Michele Ranchetti (eds.). ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: sein Leben in Bildern und Texten''. Suhrkamp, 1983, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He dominated the society and for a time would stop attending in the early 1930s after complaints that he gave no one else a chance to speak.&lt;ref name=Edmonds22&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 22–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club became infamous within popular philosophy because of a meeting on 25 October 1946 at [[R. B. Braithwaite|Richard Braithwaite]]'s rooms in [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], where [[Karl Popper]], another Viennese philosopher, had been invited as the guest speaker. Popper's paper was ''Are there philosophical problems?'', in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein's, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein apparently started waving a hot poker, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one—"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers"—at which point Russell told Wittgenstein he had misunderstood and Wittgenstein left. Popper maintained that Wittgenstein 'stormed out', but it had become accepted practice for him to leave early (because of his aforementioned ability to dominate discussion). It was the only time the philosophers, three of the most eminent in the world, were ever in the same room together.&lt;ref&gt;Eidinow, John and Edmonds, David.

[[John Maynard Keynes]] also invited him to join the [[Cambridge Apostles]], an elite secret society formed in 1820, which both Russell and [[G. E. Moore]] had joined as students, but Wittgenstein did not enjoy it and attended infrequently. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group's unseriousness, style of humour, or the fact that the members were in love with one another.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=118}} He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the level of discussion; they took him back though in the 1920s when he returned to Cambridge. (He also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Moral Sciences Club.) {{fact|date=June 2018}}

=== Frustrations at Cambridge/Pre-war ===
Wittgenstein was quite vocal about his depression in his years at Cambridge, and before he went to war; on many an occasion, he told Russell of his woes. His mental anguish seemed to stem from two sources: his work, and his personal life. Wittgenstein made numerous remarks to Russell about logic driving him mad.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=76}} Wittgenstein also stated to Russell that he "felt the curse of those who have half a talent".{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=39}} He later expresses this same worry, and tells of being in mediocre spirits due to his lack of progress in his logical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wittgenstein in Cambridge|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monk writes that Wittgenstein lived and breathed logic, and a temporary lack of inspiration plunged him into despair.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=75}} Unless he was lying, Wittgenstein tells of his work in logic affecting his mental status in a very extreme way. However, he also tells Russell another story. Around Christmas, in 1913, he writes: "how can I be a logician before I'm a human being? For the most important thing is coming to terms with myself!"{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=63}} He also tells Russell on an occasion in Russell’s rooms that he was worried about logic and his sins; also, once upon arrival to Russell's rooms one night Wittgenstein announced to Russell that he would kill himself once he left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Portraits of Wittgenstein vol.1|last=1:Flowers, 2:Ground|first=1:F.A, 2: Ian|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of things Wittgenstein personally told Russell, Ludwig’s temperament was also recorded in the diary of David Pinsent. Pinsent writes "I have to be frightfully careful and tolerant when he gets these sulky fits", and "I am afraid he is in an even more sensitive neurotic state just now than usual", when talking about Wittgenstein's emotional fluctuations.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=85}}

===Sexual orientation and relationship with David Pinsent===

Wittgenstein had romantic relations with both men and women. He is generally believed to have fallen in love with at least three men, and had a relationship with the latter two: [[David Pinsent|David Hume Pinsent]] in 1912, [[Francis Skinner]] in 1930, and Ben Richards in the late 1940s.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=583-586}} He later revealed that, as a teenager in Vienna, he had had an affair with a woman.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=369}} Additionally, in the 1920s Wittgenstein fell in love with a young Swiss woman, Marguerite Respinger, modelling a sculpture of her and proposing marriage, albeit on condition that they would not have children.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=238-240, 318}}

Wittgenstein's relationship with David Pinsent (1891–1918) occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent in the summer of 1912. A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of [[David Hume]], Pinsent soon became Wittgenstein's closest friend.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Laurence. ''Clear and queer thinking: Wittgenstein's development and his relevance to modern thought''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the [[British Psychological Society|British Psychological Association]] in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912—the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including [[first class travel]], the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent. In addition to Iceland, Wittgenstein and Pinsent traveled to Norway in 1913. Upon determining their destination, Wittgenstein and Pinsent visited a tourist office in search for a location that would fulfill the following criteria – small village located on a Fjord, a location away from tourists, and a peaceful destination to allow them to study logic and law.&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912–1914, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Suggesting [[Øystese]], Wittgenstein and Pinsent arrived in the small village on 4 September 1913. With their vacation lasting almost three weeks, Wittgenstein was able to work vigorously on his studies. The immense progress on logic during their stay led Wittgenstein to express to Pinsent his idea to leave Cambridge and return to Norway to continue his work on logic.&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912–1914, p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinsent's diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein's personality – sensitive, nervous and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, p. 58ff. *See Von Wright, G. H. ''A Portrait of Wittgenstein as a Young Man: From the Diary of David Hume Pinsent 1912–1914''. Basil Blackwell, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pinsent also writes of Wittgenstein being "absolutely sulky and snappish" at times, as well.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=85}} In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics: "I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [sic] ejaculating "No—Beastly!" to 90 percent of what he shewed [archaic spelling] us!"&lt;ref name="Kanterian40"&gt;Kanterian, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote in May 1912 that Wittgenstein had just begun to study the history of philosophy: "He expresses the most naive surprise that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!"&lt;ref name=Kanterian40/&gt; The last time they saw each other was on 8 October 1913 at Lordswood House in Birmingham, then residence of the Pinsent family: "I got up at 6.15 to see Ludwig off. He had to go very early – back to Cambridge – as he has lots to do there. I saw him off from the house in a taxi at 7.0 – to catch a 7.30 am train from New St Station. It was sad parting from him."&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;[[Georg Henrik von Wright|Von Wright, G. H.]] ''A Portrait of Wittgenstein as a Young Man: From the Diary of David Hume Pinsent 1912–1914''. Basil Blackwell, 1990. p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein left to live in Norway.

==1913–1920: World War I and the ''Tractatus''==

===Work on ''Logik''===
[[File:Wittgenstein notes 1914.jpg|thumb|Entries from October 1914 in Wittgenstein's diary, on display at the [[Wren Library]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]
Karl Wittgenstein died on 20 January 1913, and after receiving his inheritance Wittgenstein became one of the wealthiest men in Europe.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=71}} He donated some of his money, at first anonymously, to Austrian artists and writers, including [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Georg Trakl]]. Trakl requested to meet his benefactor but in 1914 when Wittgenstein went to visit, Trakl had already killed himself.  Wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics, and so in 1913 he retreated to the village of [[Skjolden]] in Norway, where he rented the second floor of a house for the winter. He later saw this as one of the most productive periods of his life, writing ''Logik'' (''Notes on Logic''), the predecessor of much of the ''Tractatus''.&lt;ref name=ConnorRobertson/&gt; While in Norway, Wittgenstein learned [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] to converse with the local villagers, and [[Danish language|Danish]] to read the works of the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Stewart (philosopher)|Stewart, Jon.]] (ed.) ''Kierkegaard's Influence on Philosophy: German and Scandinavian Philosophy''. Ashgate Publishing, 2009, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time that Wittgenstein began addressing what he considered to be a central issue in ''Notes on Logic'', a general decision procedure for determining the truth value of logical propositions which would stem from a single primitive proposition. He became convinced during this time that “[a]ll the propositions of logic are generalizations of tautologies and all generalizations of tautologies are generalizations of logic. There are no other logical propositions.”{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=58}} Based on this, Wittgenstein argued that propositions of logic express their truth or falsehood in the sign itself, and one need not know anything about the constituent parts of the proposition to determine it true or false. Rather, one simply need identify the statement as a tautology (true), a contradiction (false), or neither.

The problem lay in forming a primitive proposition which encompassed this and would act as the basis for all of logic. As he stated in correspondence with Russell in late 1913, “The big question now is, how must a system of signs be constituted in order to make every tautology recognizable as such IN ONE AND THE SAME WAY? This is the fundamental problem of logic!” {{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=59}} The importance Wittgenstein placed upon this fundamental problem was so great that he believed if he did not solve it, he had no reason or right to live.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=96}} Despite this apparent life-or-death importance, Wittgenstein had given up on this primitive proposition by the time of the writing of the ''Tractatus''. The ''Tractatus'' does not offer any general process for identifying propositions as tautologies; in a simpler manner, “Every tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.”&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: Side-By-Side-By-Side Edition''. Kegan Paul, 1922, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This shift to understanding tautologies through mere identification or recognition occurred in 1914 when Moore was called on by Wittgenstein to assist him in dictating his notes.

At Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, who was now a Cambridge don, visited him in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein exhausted him. [[David Edmonds (philosopher)|David Edmonds]] and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally known philosopher, as an example of how far someone could get in life with "absolutely no intelligence whatever."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=262}} In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong.&lt;ref name=Edmonds45/&gt; When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting ''Logik'' as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May 1914: "If I am not worth your making an exception for me ''even in some STUPID details'' then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I ''am'' worth it and you don't do it then—by God—''you'' might go there."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=103}} Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=200}} The two did not speak again until 1929.&lt;ref name=Edmonds45&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===

On the outbreak of World War I, Wittgenstein immediately volunteered for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], despite being eligible for a medical exemption.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein had a double hernia, according to philosopher [[Iain King]], who recounts Wittgenstein's war record in an April 2014 article [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein's medical exemption is confirmed in [[Philosophy Now]] magazine [http://philosophynow.org/issues/103/WittgensteinTolstoy_and_the_Folly_of_Logical_Positivism here (link to Philosophy Now)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  He served first on a ship and then in an artillery workshop 'several miles from the action'.&lt;ref&gt;According to philosopher [[Iain King]], who described Wittgenstein's war record and its impact on his thinking [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was wounded in an accidental explosion, and hospitalised to [[Kraków]].&lt;ref&gt;From [[Iain King]], writing in April 2014 about Wittgenstein's war record and its impact on his thinking [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1916, he was posted to a fighting unit on the front line of the Russian front, as part of the [[7th Army (Austria-Hungary)|Austrian 7th Army]], where his unit was involved in some of the heaviest fighting, defending against the [[Brusilov Offensive]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=137-142}} Wittgenstein directed the fire of his own artillery from an observation post in no-man's land against Allied troops – one of the most dangerous jobs there was, since he was targeted by enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;From a July 2014 article in [[Philosophy Now]] magazine [http://philosophynow.org/issues/103/WittgensteinTolstoy_and_the_Folly_of_Logical_Positivism here (link to Philosophy Now)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In action against British troops, he was decorated with the [[Military Merit Medal (Austria–Hungary)|Military Merit]] with Swords on the Ribbon, and was commended by the army for "His exceptionally courageous behaviour, calmness, sang-froid, and heroism," that "won the total admiration of the troops."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1917, he was sent as a member of a [[howitzer]] regiment to the Russian front, where he won several more medals for bravery including the [[Medal for Bravery (Austria-Hungary)|Silver Medal for Valour]], First Class.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=137}} In 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant and sent to the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]] as part of an artillery regiment. For his part in the final Austrian offensive of June 1918, he was recommended for the Gold Medal for Valour, one of the highest honours in the Austrian army, but was instead awarded the Band of the Military Service Medal with Swords&amp;nbsp;— it being decided that this particular action, although extraordinarily brave, had been insufficiently consequential to merit the highest honour.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=154}}
[[File:27. Wittgenstein’s military identity card during the First World War.jpg|thumb|228x228px|Wittgenstein’s military identity card during the First World War]]
Throughout the war, he kept notebooks in which he frequently wrote philosophical reflections alongside personal remarks, including his contempt for the character of the other soldiers.&lt;ref name="Klagge2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klagge|first=James Carl|title=Wittgenstein in exile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMzajTUpEp0C&amp;pg=PA68|date=22 December 2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-01534-9|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s 1896 ''[[The Gospel in Brief]]'' at a bookshop in [[Tarnów]], and carried it everywhere, recommending it to anyone in distress, to the point where he became known to his fellow soldiers as "the man with the gospels."{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=44, 116, 382–384}}&lt;ref&gt;* Also see Bill Schardt &amp; David Large, [http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/witty.htm "Wittgenstein, Tolstoy, and the Gospel in Brief"], ''The Philosopher'', Volume LXXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which ''The Gospel in Brief'' influenced Wittgenstein can be seen in the ''Tractatus'', in the unique way both books number their sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gospel in Brief|last=Tolstoy|first=Leo|publisher=T.

===Completion of the ''Tractatus''===
[[File:Wittgenstein family Vienna 1917.jpg|thumb|The Wittgenstein family in [[Vienna]], Summer 1917, with Kurt (furthest left) and Wittgenstein (furthest right) in officers' uniforms.]]
In the summer of 1918 Wittgenstein took military leave and went to stay in one of his family's Vienna summer houses, Neuwaldegg. It was there in August 1918 that he completed the ''Tractatus'', which he submitted with the title ''Der Satz'' (German: proposition, sentence, phrase, set, but also "leap") to the publishers Jahoda and Siegel.&lt;ref name=Bartley33&gt;Bartley, pp. 33–39, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of events around this time left him deeply upset. On 13 August, his uncle Paul died. On 25 October, he learned that Jahoda and Siegel had decided not to publish the ''Tractatus'', and on 27 October, his brother Kurt killed himself, the third of his brothers to commit suicide. It was around this time he received a letter from David Pinsent's mother to say that Pinsent had been killed in a plane crash on 8 May.&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, pp. 33–34. For an original report, see "Death of D.H. Pinsent", ''Birmingham Daily Mail'', 15 May 1918: "Recovery of the Body. The body of Mr. David Hugh Pinsent, a civilian observer, son of Mr and Mrs Hume Pinsent, of Foxcombe Hill, near Oxford and Birmingham, the second victim of last Wednesday's aeroplane accident in West Surrey, was last night found in the Basingstoke Canal, at Frimley." Courtesy of [http://mikeinmono.blogspot.com/2009/08/that-sprawling-ink-blot.html "Wittgenstein in Birmingham"], mikeinmono, 3 August 2009. Retrieved 7 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein was distraught to the point of being suicidal. He was sent back to the Italian front after his leave and, as a result of the defeat of the Austrian army, he was captured by [[Allies of World War I|Allied forces]] on 3 November in [[Trentino]]. He subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp.

He returned to his family in Vienna on 25 August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and brother Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and to get rid of his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]]. He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete, insisting that it not be held in trust for him. His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.&lt;ref name=Bartley33/&gt;

==1920–1928: Teaching, the ''Tractatus'', Haus Wittgenstein==

===Teacher training in Vienna===
In September 1919 he enrolled in the ''Lehrerbildungsanstalt'' (teacher training college) in the ''Kundmanngasse'' in Vienna. His sister Hermine said that Wittgenstein working as an elementary teacher was like using a precision instrument to open crates, but the family decided not to interfere.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=169}} [[Thomas Bernhard]], more critically, wrote of this period in Wittgenstein's life: "the multi-millionaire as a village schoolmaster is surely a piece of perversity."&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching posts in Austria===
In the summer of 1920, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener for a monastery. At first he applied, under a false name, for a teaching post at Reichenau, was awarded the job, but he declined it when his identity was discovered. As a teacher, he wished to no longer be recognized as a member of the famous Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as a member of our family... That one can neither simulate nor dissimulate anything including a refined education I need hardly tell you."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1920, Wittgenstein was given his first job as a primary school teacher in [[Trattenbach]], under his real name, in a remote village of a few hundred people. His first letters describe it as beautiful, but in October 1921, he wrote to Russell: "I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness. I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;Klagge, James Carl. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best. He did not get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings too noisy, he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students "literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Malcolm|Malcolm, Norman]]. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v03/n21/norman-malcolm/wittgensteins-confessions "Wittgenstein’s Confessions"], ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 3 No. 21, 19 November 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the less able, it seems that he became something of a tyrant. The first two hours of each day were devoted to mathematics, hours that Monk writes some of the pupils recalled years later with horror.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=195}} They reported that he caned the boys and boxed their ears, and also that he pulled the girls' hair;&lt;ref name=Bartley107&gt;Bartley, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; This was not unusual at the time for boys, but for the villagers he went too far in doing it to the girls too; girls were not expected to understand algebra, much less have their ears boxed over it. The violence apart, Monk writes that he quickly became a village legend, shouting "''Krautsalat!''" ("coleslaw" – i.e. shredded cabbage) when the headmaster played the piano, and "Nonsense!" when a priest was answering children's questions.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=196, 198}}

===Publication of the ''Tractatus''===
[[File:Wittgenstein2.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Ludwig Wittgenstein, schoolteacher, c. 1922]]While Wittgenstein was living in isolation in rural Austria, the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'' was published to considerable interest, first in German in 1921 as ''Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung'', part of [[Wilhelm Ostwald]]'s journal ''Annalen der Naturphilosophie'', though Wittgenstein was not happy with the result and called it a pirate edition. Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;For the introduction, see Russell, Bertrand. [http://www.kfs.org/~jonathan/witt/aintro.html Introduction], ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'', May 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote "The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by prop[osition]s—i.e. by language—(and, which comes to the same thing, what can be ''thought'') and what can not be expressed by pro[position]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nieli. ''Wittgenstein: From Mysticism to Ordinary Language''. SUNY Press, 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; But Wittgenstein was not happy with Russell's help. He had lost faith in Russell, finding him glib and his philosophy mechanistic, and felt he had fundamentally misunderstood the ''Tractatus''.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 35ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{rquote|right|''The whole modern conception of the world is founded on the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.''
''Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages. And in fact both were right and both wrong; though the view of the ancients is clearer insofar as they have an acknowledged terminus, while the modern system tries to make it look as if everything were explained.''|Wittgenstein, [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]], 6.371-2}}
An English translation was prepared in Cambridge by [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], a mathematics undergraduate at King's commissioned by [[C. K. Ogden]]. It was Moore who suggested ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' for the title, an allusion to [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.'' Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation.&lt;ref name="archiveTractatus"/&gt; This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by [[David Pears]] and Brian McGuinness.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Ramsey translated "''Sachverhalt''" and "''Sachlage''" as "atomic fact" and "state of affairs" respectively. But Wittgenstein discusses non-existent "''Sachverhalten''", and there cannot be a non-existent fact. Pears and McGuinness made a number of changes, including translating "''Sachverhalt''" as "state of affairs" and "''Sachlage''" as ''situation''. The new translation is often preferred, but some philosophers use the original, in part because Wittgenstein approved it, and because it avoids the idiomatic English of Pears-McGuinness. See:

An aim of the ''Tractatus'' is to reveal the relationship between language and the world: what can be said about it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that the logical structure of language provides the limits of meaning. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: "What we can say at all can be said clearly," he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be.&lt;ref name=Grayling16&gt;Grayling, A. C. ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 16ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in the preface: "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought)."&lt;ref&gt;''Tractatus'' (Ogden translation), preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is 75 pages long—"As to the shortness of the book, I am ''awfully sorry for it'' ... If you were to squeeze me like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me," he told Ogden—and presents seven numbered propositions (1–7), with various sub-levels (1, 1.1, 1.11):&lt;ref&gt;For the comment to Ogden, see Monk, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist''.
#: The world is everything that is the case.&lt;ref&gt;The English is from the original Ogden/Ramsey translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Was der Fall ist, die Tatsache, ist das Bestehen von Sachverhalten''.
#: What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.
# ''Das logische Bild der Tatsachen ist der Gedanke''.
#: The logical picture of the facts is the thought.
# ''Der Gedanke ist der sinnvolle Satz''.
#: The thought is the significant proposition.
# ''Der Satz ist eine Wahrheitsfunktion der Elementarsätze''.
#: Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.

===Visit from Frank Ramsey, Puchberg===
[[File:Puchberg am Schneeberg-view.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Frank P. Ramsey]] visited Wittgenstein in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg]] in September 1923.]]
In September 1922 he moved to a secondary school in a nearby village, [[Hassbach (Lower Austria)|Hassbach]], but considered the people there just as bad—"These people are not human ''at all'' but loathsome worms," he wrote to a friend—and he left after a month. In November he began work at another primary school, this time in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg|Puchberg]] in the [[Schneeberg (Alps)|Schneeberg]] mountains. There, he told Russell, the villagers were "one-quarter animal and three-quarters human."

[[Frank P. Ramsey]] visited him on 17 September 1923 to discuss the ''Tractatus''; he had agreed to write a review of it for ''Mind''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=212, 214–216, 220–221.}} He reported in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, D.H. [http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/3484/5/RamseyText.html "Cambridge Philosophers I: F. P. Ramsey"], Philosophy 70, 1995, pp. 243–262.&lt;/ref&gt; After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends to persuade him to return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}} Ramsey wrote to [[John Maynard Keynes]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Wittgenstein's family] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned ... It is an awful pity."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Haidbauer incident, Otterthal===
{{main|Haidbauer incident}}
[[File:31. Wittgenstein, 1925.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein, 1925]]
He moved schools again in September 1924, this time to [[Otterthal]], near Trattenbach; the socialist headmaster, Josef Putre, was someone Wittgenstein had become friends with while at Trattenbach. While he was there, he wrote a 42-page pronunciation and spelling dictionary for the children, ''Wörterbuch für Volksschulen'', published in Vienna in 1926 by Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, the only book of his apart from the ''Tractatus'' that was published in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="archiveTractatus"&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/biogre6.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Tractatus and Teaching"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213064904/http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/biogre6.html |date=13 February 2010 }}, Cambridge Wittgenstein archive. Retrieved 4 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A first edition sold in 2005 for £75,000.&lt;ref name="Ezard"&gt;Ezard, John. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/19/books.booksnews2 "Philosopher's rare 'other book' goes on sale"], ''The Guardian'', 19 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident occurred in April 1926 and became known as ''Der Vorfall Haidbauer'' (the Haidbauer incident). Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=224, 232–233}} Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: "I called him all the names under the sun. I told him he wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}}

Piribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}} Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig Hänsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of [[leukaemia]].&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 162. Monk, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later, in 1936, as part of a series of "confessions" he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a "Ja, ja," though other former students were more hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not "to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle it—to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought." Of the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, "This brought me into more settled waters... and to greater seriousness."{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=370-371}}

===The Vienna Circle===
{{See also|Vienna Circle}}
The ''Tractatus'' was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame. In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, known as the [[Vienna Circle]], had built up largely as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the ''Tractatus''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}} While it is commonly assumed that Wittgenstein was a part of the Vienna Circle, in reality, this was not actually the case. German philosopher [[Oswald Hanfling]] writes bluntly: "Wittgenstein was never a member of the Circle, though he was in Vienna during much of the time. Yet his influence on the Circle's thought was at least as important as that of any of its members."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Essential Readings in Logical Positivism|last = Hanfling|first = Oswald |author-link=Oswald Hanfling |publisher = Basil Blackwell|year = 1981|isbn = 978-0-631-12566-2|location = Oxford|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926, with the members of the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein would take part in many discussions. However, during these discussions, it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy than the members of the Circle whom his work had inspired. For example, during meetings of the Vienna Circle, he would express his disagreement with the group's misreading of his work by turning his back to them and reading poetry aloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/09/07/the-limits-of-science-and-scientists/|title=The Limits of Science—and Scientists - The Crux|date=7 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his autobiography, [[Rudolf Carnap]] describes Wittgenstein as the thinker who gave him the greatest inspiration. However, he also wrote that "there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself. Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems." As for Wittgenstein:
{{quote|His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer... When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answers came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art or a divine revelation ... the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as through divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that any sober rational comment or analysis of it would be a profanation.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Carnap, ''Autobiography'', in P.A. Schlipp (ed) ''The Philosophy of Rudolf Carnap'', The Library of Living Philosophers, Volume 11, La Salle Open Court, 1963, pages 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Haus Wittgenstein===
{{Main|Haus Wittgenstein}}
[[File:Haus Wittgenstein, Stonborough House, Vienna.jpg|thumb|upright|left|150px|Wittgenstein worked on [[Haus Wittgenstein]] between 1926 and 1929.]]

{{rquote|right|"I am not interested in erecting a building, but in [...] presenting to myself the foundations of all possible buildings."|Wittgenstein&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Hyde, Lewis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/books/review/Hyde-t.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt "Making It"]. ''The New York Times'', 6 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926 Wittgenstein was again working as a gardener for a number of months, this time at the monastery of Hütteldorf, where he had also inquired about becoming a monk. His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's ''Kundmanngasse''. Wittgenstein, his friend [[Paul Engelmann]], and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that "This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty."&lt;ref name="Jeffries"&gt;Jeffries, Stuart. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,627752,00.html "A dwelling for the gods"], ''The Guardian'', 5 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

It took him a year to design the door handles and another to design the radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed 150&amp;nbsp;kg, moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of ''The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein'', said there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: "It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor."&lt;ref name=Jeffries/&gt;

The house was finished by December 1928 and the family gathered there at Christmas to celebrate its completion. Wittgenstein's sister Hermine wrote: "Even though I admired the house very much....It seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling for the gods."&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Wittgenstein said "the house I built for Gretl is the product of a decidedly sensitive ear and ''good'' manners, and expression of great ''understanding''... But ''primordial'' life, wild life striving to erupt into the open – that is lacking."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}} Monk comments that the same might be said of the technically excellent, but austere, terracotta sculpture Wittgenstein had modelled of Marguerite Respinger in 1926, and that, as Russell first noticed, this "wild life striving to be in the open" was precisely the substance of Wittgenstein's philosophical work.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}}

==1929–1941: Fellowship at Cambridge==

===PhD and fellowship===
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein.jpg|thumb|Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1930]]

According to Feigl (as reported by Monk), upon attending a conference in Vienna by mathematician Brouwer, Wittgenstein remained quite impressed, taking into consideration the possibility of a "return to Philosophy". At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes wrote in a letter to his wife: "Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=255}} Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate. Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient to fulfill eligibility requirements for a PhD, and urged him to offer the ''Tractatus'' as his thesis.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} It was examined in 1929 by Russell and Moore; at the end of the thesis defence, Wittgenstein clapped the two examiners on the shoulder and said, "Don't worry, I know you'll never understand it."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=271}} Moore wrote in the examiner's report: "I myself consider that this is a work of genius; but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D. degree."&lt;ref&gt;R.

===Anschluss===

[[File:43. Ludwig Wittgenstein on holiday.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein on holiday in [[France]] with Gilbert Pattisson, July 1936]]
From 1936 to 1937, Wittgenstein lived again in Norway,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre8.html Ludwig Wittgenstein: Return to Cambridge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103154319/http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre8.html |date=3 November 2007 }} from the Cambridge Wittgenstein Archive&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked on the ''Philosophical Investigations''. In the winter of 1936/7, he delivered a series of "confessions" to close friends, most of them about minor infractions like white lies, in an effort to cleanse himself. In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]], a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it. The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish [[Taoiseach]], [[Éamon de Valera]], himself a former mathematics teacher. De Valera hoped Wittgenstein's presence would contribute to the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] which he was soon to set up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history//Biographies/De_Valera.html MacTutor: Biography of Éamon de Valera] "The most important contribution de Valera made to mathematics both in Ireland and internationally was the foundation of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS) in 1940."&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:21. Photographs showing Wittgenstein’s house in Norway.jpg|left|thumb|213x213px|Photograph showing Wittgenstein’s house in [[Norway]], sent by Wittgenstein to [[G. E. Moore]], October 1936]]While he was in Ireland in March 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the ''Anschluss''; the Viennese Wittgenstein was now a citizen of the enlarged Germany and a Jew under the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial laws]], because three of his grandparents had been born as Jews. The Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (''Volljuden'') if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (''[[Mischling]]'') if they had one or two. It meant ''inter alia'' that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where they could work.&lt;ref name=Waugh137&gt;Waugh, pp. 137ff, 204–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Anschluss, his brother Paul left almost immediately for England, and later the US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement). He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, pp. 224–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein began to investigate acquiring British or Irish citizenship with the help of Keynes, and apparently had to confess to his friends in England that he had earlier misrepresented himself to them as having just one Jewish grandparent, when in fact he had three.&lt;ref&gt;For the view that Wittgenstein saw himself as a Jew, see Stern, David. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FWAX4Ff69SwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Wittgenstein:+Biography+and+Philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xwGKTNX8JYWenwfT0LiyDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Was%20Wittgenstein%20a%20Jew%3F&amp;f=false "Was Wittgenstein Jewish?"], in James Carl Klagge. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 237ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days before the invasion of Poland, Hitler personally granted ''Mischling'' status to the Wittgenstein siblings. In 1939 there were 2,100 applications for this, and Hitler granted only 12.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 98, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Gottlieb writes that the pretext was that their paternal grandfather had been the bastard son of a German prince, which allowed the Reichsbank to claim foreign currency, stocks and 1700&amp;nbsp;kg of gold held in Switzerland by a Wittgenstein family trust. Gretl, an American citizen by marriage, started the negotiations over the racial status of their grandfather, and the family's large foreign currency reserves were used as a bargaining tool. Paul had escaped to Switzerland and then the US in July 1938, and disagreed with the negotiations, leading to a permanent split between the siblings. After the war, when Paul was performing in Vienna, he did not visit Hermine who was dying there, and he had no further contact with Ludwig or Gretl.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb/&gt;

===Professor of philosophy===
[[File:46. Ludwig Wittgenstein in the Fellows' Garden.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein in the Fellows’ Garden at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]], 1939]]
After G. E. Moore resigned the chair in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected, and acquired [[British subject|British citizenship]] soon afterwards. In July 1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet an official of the Reichsbank. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a week or so before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets, 1,700&amp;nbsp;kg of gold.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a report Wittgenstein visited Moscow a second time in 1939, travelling from Berlin, and again met the philosopher [[Sofya Yanovskaya|Sophia Janowskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Moran, John. "Wittgenstein and Russia" ''New Left Review'' 73, May–June 1972, pp. 83–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Malcolm, at the time a post-graduate research fellow at Cambridge, describes his first impressions of Wittgenstein in 1938: {{quote|"At a meeting of the Moral Science Club, after the paper for the evening was read and the discussion started, someone began to stammer a remark. He had extreme difficulty in expressing himself and his words were unintelligible to me. I whispered to my neighbour, 'Who's that?': he replied, 'Wittgenstein'. I was astonished because I had expected the famous author of the ''Tractatus'' to be an elderly man, whereas this man looked ''young'' – perhaps about 35. (His actual age was 49.) His face was lean and brown, his profile was aquiline and strikingly beautiful, his head was covered with a curly mass of brown hair. I observed the respectful attention that everyone in the room paid to him. After this unsuccessful beginning he did not speak for a time but was obviously struggling with his thoughts. His look was concentrated, he made striking gestures with his hands as if he was discoursing... Whether lecturing or conversing privately, Wittgenstein always spoke emphatically and with a distinctive intonation. He spoke excellent English, with the accent of an educated Englishman, although occasional Germanisms would appear in his constructions. His voice was resonant... His words came out, not fluently, but with great force. Anyone who heard him say anything knew that this was a singular person. His face was remarkably mobile and expressive when he talked. His eyes were deep and often fierce in their expression. His whole personality was commanding, even imperial."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, pp. 23–4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Describing Wittgenstein's lecture program, Malcolm continues: {{quote|"It is hardly correct to speak of these meetings as 'lectures', although this is what Wittgenstein called them. For one thing, he was carrying on original research in these meetings... Often the meetings consisted mainly of dialogue. Sometimes, however, when he was trying to draw a thought out of himself, he would prohibit, with a peremptory motion of the hand, any questions or remarks. There were frequent and prolonged periods of silence, with only an occasional mutter from Wittgenstein, and the stillest attention from the others. During these silences, Wittgenstein was extremely tense and active. His gaze was concentrated; his face was alive; his hands made arresting movements; his expression was stern. One knew that one was in the presence of extreme seriousness, absorption, and force of intellect... Wittgenstein was a frightening person at these classes."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After work, the philosopher would often relax by watching [[Western Movie|Westerns]], where he preferred to sit at the very front of the cinema, or reading detective stories especially the ones written by [[Norbert Davis]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=528}}&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Josef. [http://www.mysteryfile.com/NDavis/Wit.html "Hard-boiled Wit: Ludwig Wittgenstein and Norbert Davis"], ''CADS'', no. 44, October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Malcolm wrote that Wittgenstein would rush to the cinema when class ended.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Wittgenstein's view on the [[foundations of mathematics]] had changed considerably. In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young [[Alan Turing]] who described Wittgenstein as "a ''very'' peculiar man". The two had many discussions about the relationship between computational logic and everyday notions of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Alan Turing: The Enigma |last = Hodges | first = Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Hodges | publisher = [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] |year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-784-70008-9|location = London|page = 194|title-link = Alan Turing: The Enigma }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Cora (ed.).

[[File:50. Wittgenstein in Swansea (taken by Ben Richards).jpg|thumb|285x285px|Wittgenstein in [[Swansea]], Summer 1947]]
Monk writes that Wittgenstein found it intolerable that a war was going on and he was teaching philosophy. He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;For his desire that his students not pursue philosophy, see Malcolm, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1941, he asked [[John Ryle (professor)|John Ryle]], the brother of the philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], if he could get a manual job at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London. John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for [[the Blitz]]. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, delivering drugs from the pharmacy to the wards where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=431}}

In the new year of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein to his home in Sussex to meet his wife who had been adamant to meet him. Ryle's son recorded the weekend in his diary;&lt;blockquote&gt;Wink is awful strange – not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘its “tolerable”’ meaning intolerable.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=434}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;The hospital staff were not told he was one of the world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" Wittgenstein begged one of them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=432}} Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=431}} It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy's to remove a gall-stone that had troubled him for some years.

He had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of [[Francis Skinner]], the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from [[polio]]. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a [[City and Guilds]] exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: "For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A ''tragic'' thought!"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=443}} Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=442-423}}

While Wittgenstein was at Guy's he met Basil Reeve, a young doctor with an interest in philosophy, who, with R. T. Grant, was studying the effect of shock on air-raid casualties. When the blitz ended there were fewer casualties to study. In November 1942, Grant and Reeve moved to the [[Royal Victoria Infirmary]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to study road traffic and industrial casualties. Grant offered Wittgenstein a position as a laboratory assistant at a wage of £4 per week, and he lived in Newcastle (at 28 Brandling Park, [[Jesmond]]&lt;ref name="Schardt"&gt;[http://www.newphilsoc.org.uk/OldWeb1/Wittgenstein/wittgenstein_upon_tyne.htm Wittgenstein Upon Tyne] Bill Schardt, Newcastle Philosophical Society. Retrieved December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) from 29 April 1943 until February 1944.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=447}}

In the summer of 1946, Wittgenstein thought often of leaving Cambridge and resigning his position as Chair. Wittgenstein grew further dismayed at the state of philosophy, particularly about articles published in the journal [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']]. It was around this time that Wittgenstein fell in love with Ben Richards writing in his diary, "The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work into the background." On the 30th of September, Wittgenstein wrote about Cambridge after his return from Swansea, "Everything about the place repels me. The stiffness, the artificiality, the self-satisfaction of the people. The university atmosphere nauseates me."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}

Wittgenstein had only maintained contact with Fouracre from Guy's hospital who had joined the army in 1943 after his marriage, only returning in 1947. Wittgenstein maintained frequent correspondence with Fouracre during his time away displaying a desire for Fouracre to return home urgently from the war.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}

In May 1947, Wittgenstein addressed a group of Oxford philosophers for the first time at the Jowett Society. The discussion was on the validity of [[René Descartes|Descartes']] [[Cogito ergo sum]] where Wittgenstein ignored the question and applied his own philosophical method. [[Harold Arthur Prichard]] who attended the event was not pleased with Wittgenstein's methods;&lt;blockquote&gt;Wittgenstein: If a man says to me, looking at the sky, ‘I think it will rain, therefore I exist,’ I do not understand him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Prichard: That’s all very fine; what we want to know is: is the cogito valid or not?{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=496}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wittgenstein resigned the professorship at Cambridge in 1947 to concentrate on his writing, and in 1947 and 1948 travelled to [[Ireland]], staying at Ross's Hotel in [[Dublin]] and at a farmhouse in [[Redcross]], [[County Wicklow]], where he began the manuscript volume MS 137, Band R. Seeking solitude he moved to ''Rosro'', a holiday cottage in [[Connemara]] owned by Maurice O'Connor-Drury.&lt;ref name=archivefinalyears/&gt;

He also accepted an invitation from [[Norman Malcolm]], then professor at Cornell University, to stay with him and his wife for several months at [[Ithaca, New York]]. He made the trip in April 1949, although he told Malcolm he was too unwell to do philosophical work: "I haven't done any work since the beginning of March &amp; I haven't had the strength of even trying to do any." A doctor in Dublin had diagnosed anaemia and prescribed iron and liver pills. The details of Wittgenstein's stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm's ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir''. During his summer in America, Wittgenstein began his epistemological discussions, in particular his engagement with [[philosophical skepticism]], that would eventually become the final fragments ''[[On Certainty]]''.
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein Blue Plaque, 76 Storey's Way, Cambridge, UK.jpg|thumb|The plaque at "Storey's End", 76 [[Storey's Way]], Cambridge, where Wittgenstein died.]]
He returned to London, where he was diagnosed with an inoperable [[prostate cancer]], which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. "Great loss for me and all of us," he wrote. "Greater than I would have thought." He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with [[Georg Henrik von Wright|G. H. von Wright]]; to London to stay with [[Rush Rhees]]; then to Oxford to see [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then returned to Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into ''Storey's End'' at 76 [[Storey's Way]], the home of his doctor, [[Edward Vaughan Bevan|Edward Bevan]], and his wife Joan; he had told them he did not want to die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan at first was afraid of Wittgenstein, but they soon became good friends.&lt;ref name="archivefinalyears"&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre11.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Final Years"], Cambridge Wittgenstein archive.

By the beginning of 1951, it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29 January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, "My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 79ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In February he returned to the Bevans' home to work on MS 175 and MS 176. These and other manuscripts were later published as ''[[Remarks on Colour]]'' and ''[[On Certainty]]''.&lt;ref name="archivefinalyears" /&gt; He wrote to Malcolm on 16 April 13 days before his death: "An extraordinary thing happened to me. About a month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been ''absolutely'' certain that I'd never again be able to do it. It's the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain in my brain has gone up.—Of course, so far I've only worked for about 5 weeks &amp; it may be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now."&lt;ref name="Malcolm80"&gt;Malcolm, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Death bed.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein on his deathbed, 1951]]
Wittgenstein began work on his final manuscript, MS 177, on 25 April 1951. It was his 62nd birthday on 26 April. He went for a walk the next afternoon, and wrote his last entry that day, 27 April. That evening, he became very ill; when his doctor told him he might live only a few days, he reportedly replied, "Good!" Joan stayed with him throughout that night, and just before losing consciousness for the last time on 28 April, he told her: "Tell them I've had a wonderful life." Norman Malcolm describes this as a "...strangely moving utterance."&lt;ref name=Malcolm80/&gt;{{rquote|left|''I won't say 'See you tomorrow' because that would be like predicting the future, and I'm pretty sure I can't do that.''|Wittgenstein, 1949&lt;ref&gt;Drury, ''Recollections'', p. 160; cf. ''The Danger of Words'' (1973) p. ix, xiv&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Four of Wittgenstein's former students arrived at his bedside—Ben Richards, [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Yorick Smythies]], and [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]]. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father [[Conrad Pepler]], also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.[[File:Wittgenstein Gravestone.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein's grave at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Ascension Parish Burial Ground]] in [[Cambridge]]]]

On his religious views, Wittgenstein was said to be greatly interested in [[Catholicism]] and was sympathetic to it. In his university years, he expressed belief in the [[resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="res"&gt;{{Citation |quote=What inclines even me to believe in Christ's resurrection? I play as it were with the thought.–If he did not rise from the dead, then he decomposed in the grave like every human being. He is dead &amp; decomposed. In that case he is a teacher, like any other &amp; can no longer help; &amp; we are once more orphaned &amp; alone. And have to make do with wisdom &amp; speculation. It is as though we are in a hell, where we can only dream &amp; are shut out from heaven, roofed in as it were. But if I am to be REALLY redeemed,– I need certainty–not wisdom, dreams, speculation–and this certainty is faith. And faith is faith in what my heart, my soul, needs, not my speculative intellect. For my soul, with its passions, as it were with its flesh and blood, must be redeemed, not my abstract mind. Perhaps one may say: Only love can believe the Resurrection. Or: it is love that believes the Resurrection |p=33 |title=Ludwig Wittgenstein, Culture and Value |first=Peter |last=Finch |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not consider himself to be a Catholic. According to [[Norman Malcolm]], Wittgenstein saw Catholicism as more of a way of life than as a set of beliefs he personally held, considering that he did not accept any religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir|authors=Norman Malcolm; G. H. Von Wright|year=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780199247592|pages=59–60|quote=I believe that Wittgenstein was prepared by his own character and experience to comprehend the idea of a judging and redeeming God. But any cosmological conception of a Deity, derived from the notions of cause or of infinity, would be repugnant to him. He was impatient with 'proofs' of the existence of God, and with attempts to give religion a rational foundation. ...I do not wish to give the impression that Wittgenstein accepted any religious faith—he certainly did not—or that he was a religious person. But I think that there was in him, in some sense, the possibility of religion. I believe that he looked on religion as a 'form of life' (to use an expression from the Investigations) in which he did not participate, but with which he was sympathetic and which greatly interested him. Those who did participate he respected — although here as elsewhere he had contempt for insincerity. I suspect that he regarded religious belief as based on qualities of character and will that he himself did not possess. Of Smythies and Anscombe, both of whom had become Roman Catholics, he once said to me: 'I could not possibly bring myself to believe all the things that they believe.' I think that in this remark he was not disparaging their belief. It was rather an observation about his own capacity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein's Religious Point of View|year=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780826490278|author=Tim Labron|page=47|quote=Wittgenstein has no goal to either support or reject religion; his only interest is to keep discussions, whether religious or not, clear.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein was said by some commentators to be [[agnostic]], in a qualified sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136731372|author=William Child|page=218|quote="Was Wittgenstein religious?

The idea of a God in the sense of the Bible, the image of God as the creator of the world, hardly ever engaged Wittgenstein's attention..., but the notion of a [[last judgement]] was of profound concern to him." – (Engelmann)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein|year=2007|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|isbn=9781861893208|pages=145–146|author=Edward Kanterian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1953: Publication of the ''Philosophical Investigations''==
{{Main|Philosophical Investigations|Language-game|Private language argument}}
[[File:Kaninchen und Ente.png|thumb|Illustration of a "[[Rabbit–duck illusion|duckrabbit]]", discussed in the ''Philosophical Investigations'', section XI, part II]]
The ''[[Blue and Brown Books|Blue Book]]'', a set of notes dictated to his class at Cambridge in 1933–1934, contains the seeds of Wittgenstein's later thoughts on language and is widely read as a turning-point in his philosophy of language.

''Philosophical Investigations'' was published in two parts in 1953. Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues the bewitchments of philosophical problems arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called "language gone on holiday."&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §38.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §107.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the "rough ground" of ordinary language in use. Much of the ''Investigations'' consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: "the clarity we are aiming at is indeed ''complete'' clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should ''completely'' disappear."&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Wittgenstein left a voluminous archive of unpublished papers, including 83 manuscripts, 46 typescripts and 11 dictations, amounting to an estimated 20,000 pages. Choosing among repeated drafts, revisions, corrections and loose notes editorial work has found nearly one third of the total suitable for print.&lt;ref&gt;Stern D., "The Bergen Electronic Edition of Wittgenstein's Nachlass", ''[[European Journal of Philosophy]]'', Vol 18, Issue 3, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; An Internet facility hosted by the [[University of Bergen]] allows access to images of almost all the material and to search the available transcriptions.&lt;ref&gt;The Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen [http://wab.uib.no/wab_nachlass.page/ (WAB)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 two new boxes of Wittgenstein papers were found.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press release: [http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/unpublished-wittgenstein-archive-explored Unpublished Wittgenstein Archive explored]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' was the only nearly finished project and the book was published in 1953.

In 1999 a survey among American university and college teachers ranked the ''Investigations'' as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as "the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations."&lt;ref name="here"/&gt; The ''Investigations'' also ranked 54th on a list of most influential twentieth-century works in cognitive science prepared by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences.&lt;ref name="milproj"/&gt;

[[Peter Hacker]] argues that Wittgenstein's influence on 20th-century analytical philosophy can be attributed to his early influence on the Vienna Circle and later influence on the Oxford "ordinary language" school and Cambridge philosophers.&lt;ref name=hacker&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Hacker|url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/58/Peter_Hacker|website=Philosophy Now|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's influence has been felt in nearly every field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Interpreters===
Since Wittgenstein's death, scholarly interpretations of his philosophy have differed. Scholars have differed on the continuity between "early" and "late" Wittgenstein (that is, the difference between his views expressed in the ''Tractatus'' and those in ''Philosophical Investigations''), with some seeing the two as starkly disparate and others stressing the gradual transition between the two works through analysis of Wittgenstein's unpublished papers (the ''[[Nachlass]]'').&lt;ref name="Glock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glock|first1=Hans-Johann|editor1-last=Kahane|editor1-first=Guy|editor2-last=Kanterian|editor2-first=Edward|editor3-last=Kuusela|editor3-first=Oskari|title=Wittgenstein and his interpreters: essays in memory of Gordon Baker|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=9781405129220|pages=37–65|chapter=Perspectives on Wittgenstein: An Intermittently Opinionated Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant debate in Wittgenstein scholarship concerns the work of interpreters who are referred to under the banner of [[The New Wittgenstein]] school such as [[Cora Diamond]], [[Alice Crary]], and [[James F. Conant]].  While the ''Tractatus'', particularly in its conclusion, seems paradoxical and self-undermining, New Wittgenstein scholars advance a "therapeutic" understanding of Wittgenstein's work—"an understanding of Wittgenstein as aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work ourselves out of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing."{{sfn|Crary|2000|p=1}} To support this goal, the New Wittgenstein scholars propose a reading of the ''Tractatus'' as "plain nonsense"—arguing it does not attempt to convey a substantive philosophical project but instead simply tries to push the reader to abandon philosophical speculation. The therapeutic approach traces its roots to the philosophical work of [[John Wisdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=John|last=Wisdom|title=Philosophy and Psycho-Analysis|publisher=Blackwell|date=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the review of ''The Blue Book'' written by [[Oets Kolk Bouwsma]].&lt;ref name="Glock" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouwsma|first1=O. K.|title=The Blue Book|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=16 March 1961|volume=58|issue=6|pages=141–162|doi=10.2307/2023409|jstor=2023409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The therapeutic approach is not without critics: [[Hans-Johann Glock]] argues that the "plain nonsense" reading of the ''Tractatus'' "...is at odds with the external evidence, writings and conversations in which Wittgenstein states that the ''Tractatus'' is committed to the idea of ineffable insight."&lt;ref name="Glock" /&gt;

====Bertrand Russell====
In October 1944, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge around the same time as Russell who had been living in [[United States|America]] for several years. Russell returned to Cambridge after a backlash in America to his writings on morals and religion. Wittgenstein said of Russell's works to Drury;&lt;blockquote&gt;Russell’s books should be bound in two colours…those dealing with mathematical logic in red – and all students of philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue – and no one should be allowed to read them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=471}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Russell made similar disparaging comments about Wittgenstein's later work;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Philosophical Development|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1959|isbn=978-0041920154|location=New York|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Saul Kripke ====
[[Saul Kripke]]'s 1982 book ''[[Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language]]'' contends that the central argument of [[Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' centers on a devastating [[rule-following paradox]] that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language.  Kripke writes that this paradox is "the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date."&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language''. Basil Blackwell Publishing, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kripke's book generated a large secondary literature, divided between those who find his skeptical problem interesting and perceptive, and others, such as [[Gordon Baker]] and [[Peter Hacker]], who argue that his meaning skepticism is a pseudo-problem that stems from a confused, selective reading of Wittgenstein. Kripke's position has, however recently been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher [[Martin Kusch]] (2006), and Wittgenstein scholar [[David G. Stern]] considers the book to be "the most influential and widely discussed" work on Wittgenstein since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David G. 2006.

mainzed is based on different long-term cooperations between various institutions in Mainz. The research and development institution for digital humanities of the Academy of Sciences and Literature Mainz, ''Digitale Akademie'', was founded in 2009 and is connected to the Institute of Historical Regional Studies at the University of Mainz, the Leibniz Institute of European History and the universities of Mainz. Since 1997, the Romano-Germanic Central Museum Mainz and the i3mainz – Institute for Spatial Information and Surveying Technology have operated the ''Competence Centre for Spatial Information Technology in the Humanities'' at the Mainz University of Applied Sciences. In autumn 2013, the informal ''Network DHMainz''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forum DHMainz: Kompetenz-Marktplatz für digitale Geisteswissenschaften {{!}} i3mainz|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://i3mainz.hs-mainz.de/de/pressemitteilungen/ForumDHMainz2014|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-01-11|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created with the help of the Mainz Research Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homepage of Mainz Research Alliance |periodical= |publisher= |url=https://www.wissenschaftsallianz-mainz.de/en/ |deadurl= |format= |accessdate=2018-05-22 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |last= |date= |year= |month= |day= |language= |pages= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network was responsible for the preparation of the Digital Humanities Day 2014 in Mainz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital Humanities Tag 2014 – Programm {{!}}|periodical=|publisher=Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz|url=https://www.digitale-bibliotheksdienste.uni-mainz.de/kurse-und-veranstaltungen/digital-humanities-tag-2014-methoden-technologien-horizonte-impulse-aus-der-praxis/programm/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-01-11|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where first drafts were made for the continuation of the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-mainz.de/studium-und-lehre/Dateien/JGU_LuST_05.pdf Magazin zu Lehre und Studium Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz], S. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=mainzed jahresbericht 2015/2016 |periodical= |publisher= |url=http://mainzed.org/jahresbericht/2015/ |deadurl= |format= |accessdate=2018-01-11 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |last= |date= |year= |month= |day= |language=German |pages= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faculty of Music, University of Toronto - from Philosopher's Walk - DSC09874.JPG|alt=EJB@UofT|thumb|203x203px|The [[University of Toronto, Faculty of Music|Faculty of Music]] at the [[University of Toronto]] offers a Master of Music in Composition, Music Technology and Digital Media, Instrumental (solo piano, woodwinds, brass, percussion, strings), Collaborative Piano, Conducting, Jazz Performance, Opera, Piano Pedagogy, Voice, and Vocal Pedagogy. The first program for the degree was introduced in 1954.]]
The '''Master of Music''' ('''M.M.''' or '''M.Mus.''') is, as an academic title, the first graduate [[academic degree|degree]] in [[Music]] awarded by universities and [[Conservatory of music|conservatories]]. The M.M. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually performance in singing or instrument playing, composition, or conducting) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as [[music history]], [[music theory]], or music [[pedagogy]]. The degree, which takes one or two years of full-time study to complete, prepares students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers, according to their area of specialization. The M.M. is often required as the minimum teaching credential for university, college, and conservatory instrumental or vocal teaching positions. 

==Types==
The M.M. is widely available in performance (sometimes with a specialization in music teaching/pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and, less commonly, [[music education]]. In 2005, Boston University launched an online Master of Music program in [[music education]], the only fully online program at this level as of November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;As of November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The music education degree may also be awarded as a more specifically titled Master of Music Education (M.M.Ed.). The master's in music theory, musicology (commonly called "music history"), and ethnomusicology is typically the [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.). Nevertheless, some universities in the UK (e.g. [[Sheffield University]]) utilize the M.M. as a special research degree, in which the student undertakes original research and prepares a written thesis or similar document. Programs focusing on preparing musicians for careers in sacred music for churches and houses of worship may alternatively be called Master of Sacred Music (M.S.M.).

==Components of degree==

===Applied studies and courses===
One of the major differences between a typical M.A. degree and the M.M. is that whereas M.A. degree students often undertake original research and prepare and submit a [[thesis]] or similar research document, M.M. students focus on practical, applied areas, as set out in their M.M. area of specialization, which are typically instrumental or vocal performance, composition of new music, or [[conducting]] (the latter may focus on orchestral conducting, choral conducting, or a combination of both. 

In M.M. programs, the student spends intensive lesson time with a professor. For singers and instrumentalists, this is with a voice and instrument professor, respectively. For composition students, they take coaching sessions with composer-professors. For conducting students, they get conducting coaching from a conductor-professor at the university. M.M. students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons with a professor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many M.M. programs, all of the different M.M. streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses, as these core courses are a necessary background for all three careers. The different streams may also have different required courses for each stream. For example, vocal performance students may be required to take an opera or art song class; orchestral instrumentalists may be required to take an orchestral excerpts or orchestral audition preparation class; composition students may be required to take composition courses; and conducting students may be required to take conducting, score-reading, or piano classes.

Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing an M.M. in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history (e.g., on [[historically authentic performance]]). Some institutions permit M.M. students to do a sub-specialization in a field outside music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a M.M. in piano [[pedagogy]] may be able to do a sub-specialization in the psychology of learning in the university's department of [[psychology]] or take a sub-specialization in educational methods in the university's department of education. Doing sub-specializations outside the faculty of music typically requires the approval of both the faculty of music and the other faculty (e.g., psychology, education, etc.).

===Recitals and comprehensive exams===
The last stage of the M.M. is usually the performance of one or two recitals and completion of comprehensive exams. Most programs require that the recitals include advanced-grade pieces that are drawn from the different eras of music history, such as Baroque-era solo suites (late 17th to mid 18th century), a Classical-era (mid to late 18th century) sonata or concerto; a Romantic-era (19th century) concerto or solo; and a Contemporary era (20th and 21st century) piece. The specific components of the recital vary between schools. Some programs allow students to include chamber pieces, in which the student plays a major role as part of a chamber group, for some of the pieces.

In some schools, students are required to give a lecture for one or both of the recitals, in which they explain the historical context or music theory or compositional issues involved in the pieces. This approach, called a lecture-recital, is designed to give students experience explaining and contextualizing the pieces or songs they perform. This skill is important for performers because many also teach or coach students, and some will go on to become professors, where they may be required to give lectures on music history, theory, or composition. 

Some M.M. programs require students to pass [[comprehensive exams]] on their area of specialization and subjects such as music history and music theory. The goal of this exam is to ensure that the student has obtained a well-rounded knowledge and understanding that extends beyond their specialization. Since the M.M. is the standard minimum credential to teach applied subjects (performance or composition) at universities and conservatories, it is important that M.M. graduates have this broader understanding of music history and theory.

==Admission requirements==
To be admitted to a M.M. program, most institutions require an undergraduate degree or diploma in music, such as a B.M. or B.A. with a major in music, usually with a grade average of B+ or higher. M.M. programs in performance usually require a live [[audition]] that includes advanced pieces (or for singers, songs) from a wide range of styles, typically ranging from the Baroque era (1600-1750), the Classical music period (1750-1800), the [[Romantic music era]] (1800-1910) to the 20th and/or 21st century. Singers typically perform arias from operas and [[art song]]s, which are typically accompanied by a pianist. Instrumental musicians typically perform solo [[J.S. Bach]] or other unaccompanied repertoire, a movement from a sonata, and a movement from a virtuoso concerto. Instrumentalists who play [[orchestra|orchestral]] instruments (violin family, woodwinds, brass, etc.) may be asked to perform excerpts from the standard orchestral repertoire. Auditionees are typically told which pieces and movements to prepare; some schools even give the bar numbers or rehearsal letters (e.g., Beethoven Symphony no. 5, movement 1, bar 100 to 120).

Some institutions use videotaped recitals or performances as a pre-screening method. This approach helps to eliminate candidates who do not meet the school's minimum performance standards, and as such, it saves those candidates the time and cost of traveling to the institution for an in-person audition, and it also saves the school the cost of having a panel of professors hear the candidate on location. Some universities have multiple audition locations to reduce the traveling expenses faced by candidates. For example, a school located on the west coast of the United States might offer the option of auditioning at a central and eastern US location. The school's professors who form the audition panel travel to these other locations to hear auditionees. Some schools which normally require in-person auditions waive this requirement for students who play the larger instruments (e.g., double bass and tuba), and allow a videotape to be sent instead.

Applicants are typically asked for official transcripts from all post-secondary programs and letters of recommendation from music professors and teachers. For most graduate programs, transcripts of every program or degree are required, whether or not the degree was completed. For students who have started out, but then withdrawn from a number of programs, they may have to request transcripts from many institutions. To protect against applicants changing marks on the transcripts using forgery, most schools require that the transcripts be sent directly from the previous institution's registrar to the music school, or that the transcripts be in sealed envelopes with the other school's registrar's seal (stamp) over the closure. Some programs may also request a statement of intent/statement of purpose or another type of essay, in which the candidate explains why she wishes to be admitted, and sets out her professional, performance or career goals. Some programs may request copies of recital programs from previous performances or a list of performance experience, which may include, for orchestral instrumentalists, orchestra experience. 

In some universities, candidates must also be admitted to the university's [[graduate school]]; as such, applicants may have to achieve a certain mark on [[standardized test]]s, such as the [[GRE]]. Similarly, students from countries where the official language is not that of the university may be required to achieve a certain mark on standardized language tests. For example, students applying to a US M.M. program who come from a country where English is not an official language, may be required to pass the [[Test of English as a Foreign Language]] (TOEFL). Admission to M.M. programs in conducting often requires a video recording of a live rehearsal and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings (audio or video) of live performances.

==Careers==
The M.Mus degree is usually undertaken to prepare students to be professional performers (typically either singers or instrumental musicians), conductors, and composers. As such many recipients of the M.Mus. degree do not seek further formal education after they complete the M.Mus. The M.Mus. is typically the minimum credential that allows them to teach instrumental or vocal performance at universities, colleges, and conservatories (some institutions will also hire teachers who do not have the M.Mus. who hold an Artist's Diploma or similar diploma, and/or who have had a significant performing career as either a solo recitalist, chamber musician or orchestral musician). Some graduates do additional graduate or professional study in other areas, such as a law degree or medical degree. The combination of an M.Mus. and a professional degree could enable the degree holder to work in fields where music and law (or medicine) overlap. Recipients of the M.Mus. may also make use of the general education provided in the degree (e.g., in writing and researching) to get a job in government, university administration, or in the non-profit or [[arts administration]] sector.

Other recipients of the M.Mus. may go on to further graduate studies in music by continuing their M.Mus. specialization in performance or conducting at the doctoral level, by completing a [[Doctor of Musical Arts|DMA]] (Doctor of Musical Arts) degree in those areas. Some students branch out to another area of music at the PhD level, such as musicology or music theory. While PhD programs in musicology and music theory normally require an MA in music, in some cases, students with a M.Mus. in performance or composition who show strong promise may be conditionally admitted to PhD programs in musicology or music theory.

As well, some recipients of the M.Mus. degree may go on to do graduate work in another area in which music is a supporting field, such as an Ed.D. in music education (e.g., specializing in music instruction) or a master's degree in Library Science, in order to become a music reference librarian. M.Mus. graduates who wish to pursue graduate studies in an area that is not directly connected with music may be conditionally admitted to PhD programs in areas such as [[women's studies]] or [[sociology]], subject to the condition that they complete a list of qualifying courses.

[[File:Christopher Walken - 1984.jpg|thumb|Actor [[Christopher Walken]] performing a monologue in the 1984 stage play ''[[Hurlyburly]]'']]
In [[theatre]], a '''monologue''' (from {{lang-el|μονόλογος}}, from μόνος ''mónos'', "alone, solitary" and λόγος ''lógos'', "speech") is a speech presented by a single [[character (arts)|character]], most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the [[audience]]. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media ([[Play (theatre)|play]]s, [[film]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|title=The Greatest Movie Speeches/Monologues of all time!|author=|date=|website=IMDb|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401000758/http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|archivedate=1 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |title=Dramatic Monologue: An Introduction |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807215608/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |archivedate=7 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophes]], and [[asides|asides]]. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.

==Similar literary devices==
Monologues are similar to [[Poetry|poems]], epiphanies, and others, in that, they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |title=Soliloquy – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706041614/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |archivedate=6 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |title=The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare |publisher=Pleasanton.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902062728/http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |archivedate=2 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a [[dialogue]] interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==History==
In ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuritz|first=Paul|title=The Making of Theatre History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cS6JV4Z27DoC|accessdate=27 May 2014|year=1988|isbn=978-0-13-547861-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.

Ancient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=1 |date=January 1939 |pages=1–23|jstor=264065}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue.&lt;ref name="jstor1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=April 1939 |pages=116–126|jstor=264823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other monologue types included "entrance monologues"&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt; and exit monologues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exit Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology|volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 1942 |pages=1–21 |jstor=264367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt;

From Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geis|first=Deborah R.|title=Postmodern theatric(k)s: monologue in contemporary American drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiJaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=December 1993|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0-472-10467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Interior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |title=monologue (drama and literature) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812133304/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |title=Monologue Information |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028033907/http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditions==
Actors in theatre, and sometimes in film and television, may be asked to deliver monologues in auditions. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audition Monologues|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|website=Ace Your Audition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714084548/http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|archivedate=14 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces are usually limited to two minutes or less and are often paired with a contrasting monologue: comic and dramatic; classical and contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyactor.com/contemporary-monologues/|title=Monologues from Movies &amp; Plays|last=|first=|date=October 4, 2018|website=Daily Actor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often depends on the play or role. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5180">{{Distinguish | De Oratore}}
'''''Orator''''' was written by [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] in the latter part of the year 46 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Tempest, Kathryn. "Prologue." In Cicero: politics and persuasion in ancient Rome. London: Continuum, 2011. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is his last work on [[rhetoric]], three years before his death.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson"&gt;Cicero, Marcus Tullius, and George L. Hendrickson. Brutus Orator / Cicero. With an English transl. by H.M. Hubbell.. Rev. and repr. ed. London: Heinemann [u.a.], 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing rhetoric, Cicero addresses previous comments on the five canons of rhetoric: [[Inventio]], [[Dispositio]], [[Elocutio]], [[Memoria]], and [[Pronuntiatio]]. In this text, Cicero attempts to describe the perfect orator, in response to [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]]’ request. ''Orator'' is the continuation of a debate between [[Brutus]] and [[Cicero]], which originated in his text ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'', written earlier in the same year. 

The oldest partial text of ''Orator'' was recovered in the monastery of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] and now is located in the library at [[Avranches]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, G. L. . "Cicero's Correspondence with Brutus and Calvus on Oratorical 	Style ." ''The American Journal of Philology'' 47, no. 3 (1926): 237-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-seven existing manuscripts have been discovered from this text. Another complete text was discovered in 1421, near [[Milan]] in the town of [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]]. These two texts vary considerably between the two manuscripts and modern translators rely on both. 

In 46. B.C, when Cicero wrote ''Orator'', many young Roman men revolted against the stylistic paradigms put forward by Cicero, and from most Roman traditions in general.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt; Cicero writes in a defensive posture to this hostile audience.

==Context and summary==
In ''Orator'', Cicero depicts several models for speakers. Cicero states to the Romans the importance of searching and discovering their own sense of [[rhetoric]]. “I am sure, the magnificence of [[Plato]] did not deter [[Aristotle]] from writing, nor did [[Aristotle]] with all his marvelous breadth of knowledge put an end to the studies of others” &lt;ref name= "Cicero"&gt;Cicero, Marcus Tullius, and B White. Cicero's Brutus, or history of famous orators: 	also, his Orator, or accomplished speaker. Now first translated into English, by E. Jones. London: Printed for B. White, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero encouraged the [[plebeians]] through his writing, “Moreover, not only were outstanding men not deterred from undertaking [[Liberal arts education|liberal]] pursuits, but even craftsmen did not give up their arts because they were unable to equal the beauty of the picture of Ialysus . . . .”&lt;ref name= "Cicero" /&gt; Cicero proposes that rhetoric cannot be confined to one specific group but rather outlines a guide that will lead to the creation of successful orators across Roman society.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt;

In ''Orator'', Cicero also addressed the accusation lodged by his fellow senators, including [[Brutus]], that he was an “[[Atticism|Atticist]].” Cicero addresses this claim by saying that he is too independent and bold to be associated with [[Atticism]], producing his own unique style. Cicero claims the perfect orator creates his own “[[elocutio]],” or diction and style, rather than following this movement.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt;
	Cicero states that all five canons are equally important. Throughout the text, Cicero advises his Roman audience on how to form proper oratory by formal guidelines but also how to specialize in individually in their own sense of oratory. ''Orator'' is written with ideas ranging from the construction of arguments to rhetorical performance. In relation to other Ciceronian works on rhetoric, Orator receives less treatment with scarce research compared to other rhetorical works.

==Goals of the Orator==
The three aims of the orator, according to Cicero, are "''docere, delectare, et movere''."  That is: to prove your thesis to the audience, to delight the audience, and to emotionally move the audience.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Donald|title=Rhetoric and Poetry in the Renaissance|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10140/10140-h/10140-h.htm|publisher=Distributed Proofreaders|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional vividness of poetic language becomes part of the rhetorical tools in service of persuading the audience to your point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cicero|first=Marcus Tullius|title=Orator|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/orator.shtml#69|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Law''' (''[[law|article link]]'') is the set of rules and principles (laws) by which a society is governed, through enforcement by governmental authorities.  Law is also the field which concerns the creation and administration of laws, and includes any and all [[Legal systems of the world|legal systems]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Nature of law ==
Law can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; body of knowledge given to - or received by - a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] &amp;ndash; academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.
* [[System]] &amp;ndash; set of elements (often called 'components' instead) and relationships which are different from relationships of the set or its elements to other elements or sets.
** part of the [[legal system]] &amp;ndash; legal scholarship and practice shapes how law is interpreted and applied in societies

==Legal systems==
* [[List of national legal systems]]
* [[Common law]]
* [[Civil law (legal system)]]
* [[Religious law]]
** [[Bahá'í laws]]
** [[Biblical law]], in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]
** [[Canon law]], in Christianity
*** [[Canons of the Apostles]]
*** [[Canon law of the Anglican Communion]]
*** [[Canon law of the Catholic Church]]
****[[Canon (canon law)]] - a certain rule or norm of conduct or belief prescribed by the Catholic Church. The word "canon" comes from the Greek kanon, which in its original usage denoted a straight rod that was later the instrument used by architects and artificers as a measuring stick for making straight lines. 
****[[Custom (canon law)]] - the repeated and constant performance of certain acts for a defined period of time, which, with the approval of the competent legislator, thereby acquire the force of law. A custom is an unwritten law introduced by the continuous acts of the faithful with the consent of the legitimate legislator. 
****[[Decree (canon law)]] - an order or law made by a superior authority for the direction of others. 
****[[Dispensation (canon law)]] - the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases. Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases. 
****[[Interpretation (canon law)]] - canonists provide and obey rules for the interpretation and acceptation of words, in order that legislation is correctly understood and the extent of its obligation is determined. 
****[[Obrogation]] -  the enacting of a contrary law that is a revocation of a previous law. It may also be the partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one. 
****[[Promulgation (canon law)]] - the publication of a law by which it is made known publicly, and is required by canon law for the law to obtain legal effect.
** [[Halakha]], in Judaism
** [[Hindu law]]
** [[Jain law]]
** [[Patimokkha]], in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]

[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Exterior of a [[sex shop]] in [[New York City]] that also provides a peep show]]

A '''peep show''' or '''peepshow''' is an exhibition of pictures, objects or people viewed through a small hole or [[magnifying glass]]. Though historically a peep show was a form of entertainment provided by wandering showmen, nowadays it more commonly refers to a presentation of a [[sex show]] or [[pornographic film]] which is viewed through a viewing slot. Historically the peep hole was intended to control the point of view to allow an illusion of [[depth perception]], while showmen would later use it to charge for access to the view. For sex shows it also became a means to view material that would be objected to if freely displayed.

&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''peep box''' or '''raree show''' ("rarity show") can be traced back to the [[early modern period]] (15th century in Europe) and are known in various cultures. 
Around 1437 Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] is thought to have created the earliest impressive peep show boxes with painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole. He had two kinds: night scenes with the moon and stars, and day scenes. It is thought these pictures may have been transparent and lit from behind, possibly changing from day to night by changing the lighting. It has also been suggested that it may have been a predecessor of the [[magic lantern]] that could project images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/c/camera_obscura.html|title=Camera Obscura - Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/peep-show-childrens-toy|title=Peep show - children’s toy|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 17th and 18th century peep shows were exhibited on streets and fairs across Europe by itinerant showmen, competing with other entertainment like dancing bears, jugglers, conjurers, et cetera.&lt;ref name=balzer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickbalzer.com/Peepshows.202.0.html|title=Dick Balzer's Website: Peepshows|first=Richard|last=Balzer|date=|website=www.dickbalzer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wooden cabinets could have several viewing holes and contain sets of pictures to be set into a viewing position by pulling a corresponding string. The show was accompanied by spoken [[recitation]] that explained or dramatized what was happening inside. The boxes were often decorated inside to resemble theatrical scenes.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 

Peep shows were most popular in the 17th century in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100313907|title=Peep-show box - Oxford Reference|author=|date=|website=oxfordreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists from the 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], like [[Pieter Janssens Elinga]] and [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] created a type of peep shows with an illusion of depth perception by manipulating the perspective of the view seen inside, usually the interior of a room.
From around 1700 many of these "perspective boxes" or "optica" had a bi-convex lens with a large diameter and small dioptre for an exaggerated perspective, giving a stronger illusion of depth. Most pictures showed architectural and topographical subjects with linear perspectives.&lt;ref name=visualmedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Peepshow|url=http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html|website=visual-media.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dutch Perspectives|last1=Wagenaar|last2=Duller|last3=Wagenaar-Fischer}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1745 similar perspective view prints became very popular for the [[zograscope]], which used the same principle with the lens on a stand rather than in a box.   
Peep shows were further developed with translucent painting techniques, perforations and cut-out shapes that provided special effects when lit from behind by candles. Changing the light from the front to the back of the picture could change the scene from day to night, much like the [[dissolving views]] that would later become a popular type of magic lantern show.&lt;ref name=visualmedia/&gt;

In the early 18th century the perspective boxes were very appreciated in Japan, where they were referred to as ''Holland machines''.&lt;ref name=balzer/&gt; They may have been imported from China earlier than from The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TowardAStudentBasedApproachToTranslationTeaching/toward+a+student-based+approach+to+translation+teaching_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Toward A Student Based Approach To Translation Teaching"|author=|date=|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century Chinese peep shows were known by many names including ''la yang p'ien'' ({{zh|c=拉洋片|p=lā yáng piān|l=pulling foreign picture cards}}). Sometimes the showman would perform for a crowd with [[puppet]]s or [[cantastoria|pictures]] outside the box and then charge people extra to look through the holes.
In [[Ottoman Syria]] a form of peep show called ''sanduk al-ajayib'' ("wonder box") existed, which the storyteller carried on his back. The box had six holes through which people could see scenes backlit by a central candle. ''Sanduk al-ajayib'' stories were about contemporary figures and events, or showed scenes of heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;* Mair, Victor H. ''Painting and Performance: Chinese Picture Recitation and its Indian Genesis.'' Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other common subjects in peep shows throughout the world have been exotic views and animals, scenes of classical drama or [[masque]]s, [[Noble court|court]] ceremonies, surprise transformations (e.g., of an angel into a devil) and of course, lewd pictures.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Raree shows were precursors of [[toy theatre]]s, with movable scenes and paper figurines, popular in the 19th century. They can also be seen as predecessors to [[optical toys]] like [[Chinese fireworks]], the [[diorama]], the [[stereoscope]] and the [[magic lantern]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Some peep shows offer the only accurate representation of the stage design and scenery of the [[masque]]s and pageants of their time.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

==Pornographic shows==
Peep shows have been used for erotic and pornographic pictures, such as ''[[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the Butler Saw]]'', since before the turn of the twentieth century. 

In contemporary use, a peep show is a piecewise presentation of [[pornographic film]]s or a live [[sex show]] which is viewed through a viewing slot, which shuts after the time paid for has expired. The viewing slots can be operated by a money box device, or paid for at a counter. 
[[File:Peep show Iran.JPG|thumbnail|Peep show in [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tehran]]]]
For live peep shows, booths can surround a stage upon which usually a female performer performs a [[striptease]] and sexually explicit poses. In [[Barcelona]] female performers at times also perform sexual intercourse with male performers on stage. In some cases, booths include [[paper towel dispenser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Griffin Donlon, "Peep Shows," ''St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture''. According to Dr. Elliot Chiu, "At first, small booths with a seat, a lock, and a roll of paper towels were made available for individual viewing of 8 or 16 mm stag loops or for access to a usually circular 'stage' with living performers."&lt;/ref&gt; for customers who engage in masturbation. A customer and performer can mutually agree on a fee for a "private dance", which can take place in a peep show booth with a clear window and seating space for only one spectator.

Research on peep show establishments in California&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Linz, Bryant Paul, and Mike Z. Yao, "Peep show establishments, police activity, public place, and time: A study of secondary effects in San Diego, California", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the hypothesis that neighborhoods surrounding [[sex business]]es such as peep show establishments and [[X-rated]] movie stores have higher rates of crime. The researchers compared 911 calls in peep show and control neighborhoods in San Diego.  Although peep show neighborhoods had approximately 16 percent more calls, the researchers concluded that the difference was not statistically significant.  Other researchers reanalyzed the data and concluded that the difference was significant.&lt;ref&gt;Richard McCleary and James W. Meeker, "Do peep shows 'cause' crime?", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regal Show World====
Regal Show World was an [[adult entertainment]] business on lower [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company's [[slogan]] was "Where you are king".&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; The business had a peep show and an [[adult video arcade]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson 2012 p. 159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alta-glamour.com"/&gt; The peep show had performers working in an enclosed round room with viewing booths surrounding it and sometimes had a "double in the bubble" show in which two performers worked simultaneously.&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; During the winter of 1997 to 1998, the business had thirty-five performers.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At this time, over 80% of performers there attempted to [[unionize]] and "signed union authorization cards for representation by the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), Local 790".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;

The business was owned by Bijou Group, Inc., a [[privately held company]] in San Francisco that was founded in 1990.&lt;ref name="Manta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Find"/&gt; Bijou Group owned similar businesses in San Francisco such as New Century Theater, [[Market Street Cinema]], and the Campus Theater.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; Bijou Group, Inc. filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] reorganization circa 1994.&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; In November 1998, management of Regal Show World announced that the peep show would be closed on November 30th of that month due to "economic reasons".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At the time, some performers in the industry stated that closure of the peep show was done as a retaliative measure against attempts for performers to unionize.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company declared bankruptcy after performers made a second attempt at unionization, whereby the performers "signed cards calling for a union election", and the theater was closed.&lt;ref name="TPOS"/&gt;

===Washington===
The former [[Lusty Lady]] peep show in San Francisco, California, entered the news in 1997, when it became the first U.S. sex business to be [[unionized]]. In 2003 it was bought by the employees and became a [[worker cooperative]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The '''''praetexta''''' or '''''fabula praetexta''''' was a genre of Latin [[tragedy]] introduced at Rome by [[Gnaeus Naevius]] in the third century B.C. It dealt with historical Roman figures, in place of the conventional [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]]. Subsequent writers of ''praetextae'' included [[Ennius]], [[Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]]. The name refers to the ''toga praetexta'', the official dress of Roman magistrates.

All [[Roman Republic]]an tragedies are now lost. From the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]] only one play has survived, the [[Octavia (play)|''Octavia'']].

'''Preservation metadata''' is an essential component of most [[digital preservation]] strategies. As an increasing proportion of the world’s information output shifts from analog to digital form, it is necessary to develop new strategies to preserve this information for the long-term. Preservation metadata is information that supports and documents the digital preservation process. Preservation metadata is sometimes considered a subset of technical or administrative metadata.

==Preservation metadata==
Preservation metadata stores technical details on the format, structure and use of the digital content, the history of all actions performed on the resource including changes and decisions, the authenticity information such as technical features or custody history, and the responsibilities and rights information applicable to preservation actions.&lt;ref name="PADI"&gt;''[http://www.nla.gov.au/padi/topics/32.html Preserving Access to Digital Information]'', [[National Library of Australia]]. Retrieved April 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation metadata is access-centered and should accomplish four themes: include details about files and instructions for use; document all updates or actions that have occurred to an object; show provenance and demonstrate current and future custody; list details on the individual(s) who are responsible for the preservation of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Woodyard, D., Metadata and preservation. ''[[Information Services and Use]]'', 22:121–125, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation metadata often includes the following information:

* ''Provenance:'' Who has had custody/ownership of the digital object?
* ''Authenticity:'' Is the digital object what it purports to be?
* ''Preservation activity:'' What has been done to preserve the digital object?
* ''Technical environment:'' What is needed to render, interact with and use the digital object?
* ''Rights management:'' What intellectual property rights must be observed?&lt;ref name = "LOC"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis Library of Congress.  PREMIS: Preservation Metadata Maintenance Activity]. Retrieved April 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital materials require constant maintenance and migration to new formats as technology changes. In order to survive into the future, digital objects need preservation metadata that can exist independently from the systems which were used to create them. Without preservation metadata, digital material will be lost. “''While a print book with a broken spine can be easily re-bound, a digital object that has become corrupted or obsolete is often impossible (or prohibitively expensive) to repair''”.&lt;ref&gt;Lavoie, B. &amp; Dempsey, L., [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july04/lavoie/07lavoie.html Thirteen ways of looking at...digital preservation], ''[[D-Lib Magazine]]'', 10 (7/8), 2004. Retrieved April 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Preservation metadata provides the vital information which will make “digital objects self-documenting across time.”&lt;ref name = "LOC"/&gt;

Preservation metadata is a new and developing field. The Reference Model for an [[Open Archival Information System]] (OAIS) is a broad conceptual model which many organizations have followed in developing new preservation metadata element sets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nost.gsfc.nasa.gov/isoas/ref_model.html Reference model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412100933/http://nost.gsfc.nasa.gov/isoas/ref_model.html |date=2008-04-12 }}, [[NASA]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early projects in preservation metadata in the library community include CEDARS, NEDLIB, The National Library of Australia and the OCLC/RLG Working Group on Preservation Metadata.&lt;ref name="PADI" /&gt; Following on from this work, the [[Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)]] Working Group created the "Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata: Final Report of the PREMIS Working Group" which was released in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/pmwg/ OCLC/RLG PREMIS (PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies)], [http://www.oclc.org/ OCLC].&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing work of maintaining, supporting, and coordinating future revisions to the PREMIS Data Dictionary is undertaken by the PREMIS Editorial Committee, hosted by the Library of Congress.&lt;ref name="LOC" /&gt;

'''Punk ideologies''' are a group of varied social and political beliefs associated with the [[punk subculture]] and [[punk rock]]. In its original incarnation, the punk subculture originated out of working class angst and the frustrations many youth were feeling about economic inequality and the bourgeois hypocrisy and neglect of working people and their struggles.  It was primarily concerned with concepts such as [[poverty]], [[egalitarianism]], [[humanitarianism]], [[anti-authoritarianism]], [[anti-corporatism]], [[anti-consumerism]], [[anti-war]], [[media culture|anti-media culture]], [[mainstream media|anti-mainstream or mainstream media]], [[anti-intellectualism]], against [[selling out]], [[anti-conservative]],  [[anti-nationalism]], anti-[[corporate greed]], anti-infatuation, against vagrancy laws, [[anti-racism]], anti-[[sexism]], [[gender equality]], [[racial equality]], [[civil rights]], [[animal rights]], [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]], [[social rights]], [[free-thought]] and [[non-conformity]]. One of its main tenets was a rejection of mainstream, corporate [[mass culture]] and its values.  It continued to evolve its ideology as the movement spread throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embrace a range anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk ideologies range from [[left wing]] views (e.g., [[NOFX]]) to [[right wing]] beliefs (e.g., [[No Remorse (band)|No Remorse]]) or [[apolitical]] (e.g., [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]).

Punk ideologies are usually expressed through [[punk rock]] music and lyrics, [[punk literature]] such as amateur [[fanzines]], [[spoken word]] performances or recordings, [[punk fashion]], or [[punk visual art]]. Some punks have participated in [[direct action]], such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, [[ecotage]], street barricades, [[squatting]], [[pirate radio]], [[off-grid energy]], [[vandalism]] and public and business [[property destruction]]. Indirect action through counter-propaganda, [[protest]]s or [[boycott]]s. They support and squat in urban and rural collective house's with held group funds in common. [[Punk fashion]] was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the [[status quo]]. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear clothing or have [[tattoos]] that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives such as D.O.A's Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear second-hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.

An attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to [[selling out]], which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward [[Pop music|pop]] and embracing anything in mainstream capitalist culture or more radio-friendly [[Rock music|rock]] in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology. The issue of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term ''[[poseur]]'' is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values or philosophy.

Because [[anti-establishment]] attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of [[independent record label]]s, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of [[major label]]s. The [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression [[DIY]] was coined by commentators after the fact.

On religious issues, punk is mostly [[atheism|atheist]] or [[agnosticism|agnostic]], but some punk bands have promoted religions such as [[Christian punk|Christianity]], [[Buddhism]],  [[Taqwacore|Islam]], the [[Rastafari movement]] or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna]].

==Specific ideologies and philosophies==
The following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).

===Anarchism===
{{Main|Anarcho-punk}}
[[File:Punk Occupy Pittsburgh protestors (6262172208).jpg|thumb|right|170px|A punk protester carries a sign including an anarchy symbol.]]
There is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed "peace punks" or "[[anarcho-punk]]s." While some well-known punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Exploited]] had songs about [[anarchy]], notably the Pistols' ''[[Anarchy in the UK]]'', they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;Glasper, Ian (2006), ''The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984'', Cherry Red publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-901447-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-punks typically believe in [[direct action]]. Many anarcho-punks are [[pacifism|pacifists]] (e.g. Crass and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, [[squatting]], [[graffiti]], [[culture jamming]], [[ecotage]], [[freeganism]], [[boycott]]ing, [[civil disobedience]], [[hacktivism]] and [[subvertising]]. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]). This manifests itself as [[riot]]ing, [[vandalism]], wire cutting, [[Hunt saboteur|hunt sabotage]], participation in [[Animal Liberation Front]]- or [[Earth Liberation Front]]-style activities, and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Dave Insurgent]], [[Crass]], [[Subhumans (British band)]], [[Colin Jerwood]], and [[Dave Dictor]].

===Animal rights and veganism===
In the 1980s, both [[straight edge]] hardcore punk in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helton|first=Jesse J.|last2=Staudenmeier|first2=William J.|year=2002|title=Re-imagining being 'straight' in straight edge|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|volume=29|issue=2|page=465|issn=0091-4509|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert T.|title=Nailed to the X: A Lyrical History of Straightedge|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|year=1999|volume=2|issue=2|pages=133–151|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/13676261.1999.10593032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="descartes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/len-tilburger-and-chris-p-kale-nailing-descartes-to-the-wall-animal-rights-veganism-and-punk-cu|last1=Tilbürger|first1=Len|last2=Kale|first2=Chris P|title="Nailing Descartes to the Wall": Animal Rights, Veganism and Punk Culture|publisher=Active Distribution|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; became associated with [[animal rights]]. Consequently, [[vegetarianism]] and [[veganism]] became a feature of the punk subculture.&lt;ref name="descartes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haenfler|first=Ross|title=Straight Edge: Hardcore Punk, Clean Living Youth, and Social Change|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-3851-3|ref=harv|page=53 and 427–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as [[Fluff Fest]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="sober"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=YWb7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sober Living for the Revolution: Hardcore Punk, Straight Edge, and Radical Politics|page=137|last=Kuhn|first=Gabriel|publisher=PM Press|date=2010|isbn=1604860510|author-link=Gabriel_Kuhn|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bandcamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/09/20/czech-diy-list/|title=The Sincere and Vibrant World of the Czech DIY Scene|publisher=Bandcamp|first=Jacopo|last=Sanna|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apoliticism===
Some punks claim to be non-political, such as the band [[Charged GBH]] and the singer [[G.G. Allin]], although some socio-political ideas have appeared in their lyrics. Some Charged GBH songs have discussed social issues, and a few have expressed anti-war views. G.G. Allin expressed a vague desire to kill the United States president and destroy the political system in his song "Violence Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Lyrics - Violence Now - Assassinate The President |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027094628/http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include: [[glam punk]], [[psychobilly]], [[horror punk]], [[punk pathetique]], [[deathrock]] and [[pop punk]]. Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including [[The Dictators]], [[Ramones]] (which featured staunch [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Johnny Ramone]] alongside [[liberalism|liberal]] activist [[Joey Ramone]]), [[New York Dolls]], [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Johnny Thunders &amp; The Heartbreakers]], and [[Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian punk}}
[[Christian punk]] is a subgenre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Some Christian punk bands are associated with the [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian music industry]],&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/christian-punk-ma0000002639/artists|title=Christian Punk Music Artists - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others reject that association. Ideologies within Christian punk vary, though a number of bands lean towards traditional left-wing politics, most prominently [[Crashdog]], [[Ballydowse]] and [[The Psalters]], the latter two of whom identified as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bramboniusinenglish.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/the-lost-psalters-interview-from-august-11-kortrijk/ |title=The Lost Psalters Interview |date=March 14, 2012 |publisher=Brambonius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://londoncelticpunks.wordpress.com/tag/ballydowse/ |title=Tribute to Ballydowse |publisher=London Celtic Punks Web-Zine |date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of notable Christian punk bands include [[Altar Boys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/altar-boys-mn0000793617/biography |title=Altar Boys |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Crucified]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-crucified-mn0000135837|title=The Crucified - Biography, Albums, Streaming Links - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Five Iron Frenzy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/five-iron-frenzy-mn0000178494 |title=Five Iron Frenzy |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flatfoot 56]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/flatfoot-56-mn0000921885 |title=Flatfoot 56 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pop-punk band [[MxPx]], who earned a [[Music recording certification|gold record]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mxpx-mn0000521851 |title=MxPx |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservatism ===
{{see also|Conservative Punk}}
A small number are [[Conservatism|conservative]], rejecting leftist-[[anarchism]], [[liberalism]], [[communism]] and [[socialism]] in favor of conservatism. Notable conservative punks include [[Johnny Ramone]], [[Forgotten Rebels]], [[Billy Zoom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markprindle.com/zoom-i.htm |title=Billy Zoom interview |publisher=Markprindle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Escalante]], [[Bobby Steele]], [[Duane Peters]] and [[Dave Smalley]]. Some [[Christian punk]] and hardcore bands have [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political stances, in particular some of the [[New York hardcore|NYHC]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McPheeters |first=Sam |url=https://www.vice.com/read/survival-of-the-streets-137-v16n9 |title=Survival Of The Streets &amp;#124; VICE United States |publisher=Vice.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hare Krishna===
{{Further|Krishnacore}}
The Filipino punk band the [[Krishnacore|Wuds]] which was formed in the early 1980s is the first known punk band who composed songs dedicated to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wuds-mn0001790200&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some notable members of the [[New York hardcore]] scene, including [[Ray Cappo]] ([[Youth of Today]], [[Shelter (band)|Shelter]] and other bands), [[John Joseph (rock singer)|John Joseph]] ([[Cro-Mags]]) and [[Harley Flanagan]] (Cro-Mags) converted to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823161134/http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661|date=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to trend within the western hardcore scene that became known as Krishnacore.

===Islam===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[Taqwacore]] is a punk subgenre centred on [[Islam]], its culture and its interpretation. The Taqwacore scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the United States and other western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam. There is no definitive Taqwacore sound, and some bands incorporate styles including hip-hop, techno, and/or musical traditions from the Muslim world. Examples of Muslim punk bands include [[Alien Kulture]], [[The Kominas]] and [[Secret Trial Five]].

===Liberalism===
[[Liberalism|Liberal]] punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning, and are mostly on the [[social liberalism|liberal left]]. Notable liberal punks (second wave, mid-1990s to 2000s) include: [[Joey Ramone]], [[Fat Mike]] of [[NOFX]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] of [[Green Day]], [[Crashdog]],  [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], [[Jared Gomes]] of [[Hed PE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035243/http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Latest-hed-p-e-album-has-plenty-of-messages-116661.php|title=Latest (hed) p.e. album has plenty of messages|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interviews/1025867/hedp-e|title=(Hed)p.e - Interviews - Killyourstereo.com|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218034734/http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Armstrong]] of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[Tim McIlrath]] of [[Rise Against]]. Some punks participated in the [[Rock Against Bush]] movement in the mid-2000s, in support of the Democratic Party candidate [[John Kerry]].

===Libertarianism===
Libertarian punks advocate [[free market]] [[capitalism]], a [[Night-watchman state|minimal government]] and private ownership of property. Joe Young of the band [[Antiseen]],&lt;ref name=slug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slugmag.com/articles/106/ANTiSEEN.html |title=SLUG Magazine &amp;#124; ANTiSEEN |publisher=Slugmag.com |date=2004-09-29 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exene Cervenka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/24-7/2012/10/13/punk-icon-exene-cervenka-endorses-gary-j |title=Punk Icon Exene Cervenka Endorses Gary Johnson - Reason 24/7 |publisher=Reason.com |date=2012-10-13 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mojo Nixon]] have expressed support for libertarianism. Though originally a conservative,  [[Michale Graves]] has shifted towards libertarianism in recent years.

===Neo-Nazism===
{{Main|Nazi punk|White power rock|Rock Against Communism}}
[[Nazi punk]]s have a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] ideology that is closely related to that of [[white power skinhead]]s. [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] and his band [[Skrewdriver]] are credited with popularizing [[white power rock]] and [[hatecore]] (for its hateful lyrical themes), or [[Rock Against Communism]]. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]], who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika]]s for shock or comedy value.

===Nihilism===
Centering on a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, [[nihilism]] was a fixture in some early punk rock and [[protopunk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/interview-with-simon-critchley/|title=Nihilism, Punk and the International Necronautical Society: an interview with Simon Critchley -|date=30 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sex Pistols]] were central to the association of punk and nihilsm, with the ''Trouser Press Record Guide'' writing that their "confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Ira, "Sex Pistols", in ''The Trouser Press Record Guide'', 4th ed., ed. Ira Robbins, p.585, Collier, 1991. {{ISBN|0-02-036361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, researcher Neil Eriksen argues that though "much of the critical realism [of punk rock] expresses cynicism and nihilism, it does serve to question existing relations in such a way that listeners are forced to think about what is being said",&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/periodicals/theoretical-review/19801802.htm|title=Popular Culture and Revolutionary Theory: Understanding Punk Rock|first=|last=EROL|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that overt rejection of meaning is primarily concerned with challenging existing values.

=== Situationism ===
[[File:DUST Flyer.jpg|thumb|Flyer for DUST happening circa. 1992]]
The [[Situationist International]] (SI) was an early influence on punk subculture in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989"&gt;Marcus, Greil, Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, Harvard University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-571-23228-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Started in continental Europe in the 1950s, the SI was an avant-garde political movement that sought to recapture the ideals of surrealist art and use them to construct new and radical social situations. [[Malcolm McLaren]] introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989" /&gt; [[Vivienne Westwood]], McLaren's partner and the band's designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. 15% Pus and DUST, subversive 1990s Manchester bands, staged psycho-geographic walks around [[Hulme]] and created human collages from road signs as part of what became known as 'psycho-spectre.' [[Jamie Reid]]'s distinctive album cover artwork was openly situationist.

===Socialism===
[[The Clash]] were a blatantly political punk rock band, introducing [[socialism]] to the punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yfMIaUCBTWMC&amp;pg=PA47 Ensminger, David, ''Left of the Dial: Conversations with Punk Icons'' (Oakland, CA: PM Press) p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qfACzulTwIC&amp;pg=PT327 |title=Seventies Unplugged - Gerard DeGroot - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]] said of his socialist views "I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those asshole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That's where I'm from and there's where I've made my decisions from. That's why I believe in socialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salewicz|first1=Chris|title=Redemption Song: The Ballad of Joe Strummer|date=May 13, 2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0865479821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original [[Oi!]] bands expressed a rough form of socialist [[working class]] [[populism]] — often mixed with [[patriotism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with [[Red Wedge]]. Notable socialist punks include: [[Attila the Stockbroker]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Bruce La Bruce]], [[Garry Bushell]] (until the late 1980s), [[The Redskins|Chris Dean]], [[The Dicks|Gary Floyd]], [[Jack Grisham]], [[Stewart Home]], [[Dennis Lyxzén]], [[Angelic Upstarts|Thomas Mensforth]], [[Fermin Muguruza]], [[Boikot|Alberto Pla]], [[Tom Robinson (musician)|Tom Robinson]], [[Seething Wells]], [[The Men They Couldn't Hang|Paul Simmonds]], [[Rob Tyner]], Joe Strummer, [[Ian Svenonius]], [[Mark Steel]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] (guitarist for British powerhouse, new wave band, The Jam). Neil Eriksen wrote in 1980: "... we feel that elements of punk rock fulfill a revolutionary cultural function".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;

[[Bernie Sanders]], a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] running for [[president of the United States]] in 2016, was endorsed by various bands and musicians including [[Jello Biafra]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]], [[Mike Watt]], [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], [[Keith Morris]], [[Cheetah Chrome]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Belinda Carlisle]] and [[Pussy Riot]] among others. In April 2016, a [[Richmond, VA]] artist named Mickael Broth, created a large mural of a Sanders which was inspired by a classic [[Circle Jerks]]   logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.styleweekly.com/Studi/archives/2016/04/05/punk-rock-bernie-sanders-mural-goes-up-on-broad-street|title=Punk Rock Bernie Sanders Mural Goes Up on Broad Street|first=Brent|last=Baldwin|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders has also been credited as having a major impact on the east coast punk scene in the United States. In the early 1980s as mayor of [[Burlington, VT]], Sanders fought a government ban on live music and had a major goal of building a youth center. That center became [[242 Main Street]], which is currently one of the United States longest running all-ages youth-run DIY punk venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/how-bernie-sanders-242-main-street-shaped-the-northeast-punk-scene-515|title=How Bernie Sanders Shaped the Northeast Punk Scene|website=Vice|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Straight edge===
{{Main|Straight edge|Hardline (subculture)}}
[[Straight edge]], which originated in the [[Washington DC]] hardcore punk scene with [[Minor Threat]] song "Straight Edge" written by frontman [[Ian MacKaye]] and guitarist Brian Baker. Straight edge involves abstaining from [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and [[recreational drug use]]. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from [[caffeine]], casual sex and meat. (Although the Washington DC straight-edge scene exhibited a fierce allegiance for Coca-Cola, with supporters rarely, if ever, seen drinking anything else in public.) Those more strict individuals may be considered part of the [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline subculture]]. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label but it became a movement one in which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: [[Tim McIlrath]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Davey Havok]].

==Criticism of punk ideologies==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Punk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. [[The Clash]] occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs "[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]" and "[[London Calling|Death or Glory]]". [[Crass]]'s song "White Punks on Hope" criticized the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accused [[Joe Strummer]] of selling out and betraying his earlier socialist principles. Their song "Punk is Dead" attacked corporate [[Recuperation (sociology)|co-option]] of the [[punk subculture]]. [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman [[Jello Biafra]] wrote many songs, such as '' [[Nazi Punks Fuck Off]]'', criticizing aspects of the punk subculture:  ''"Punk ain't no religious cult
Punk means thinking for yourself
You ain't hardcore cos you spike your hair...''

[[Misfits (band)|Misfit]] frontman [[Michale Graves]], who cofounded the [[Conservative Punk]] website, argued that punks have become "[[hippie]]s with [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]]". However, he has since distanced himself from conservatism.

Author [[Jim Goad]] has been very critical of punk ideologies in many of his writings. In his essay "The Underground is A Lie!", Goad argued that many punks are hypocrites, and he claimed that many punks act poor while hiding the fact they come from [[middle class|middle]] to [[upper class]] backgrounds. In ''Farts from Underground'', Goad claimed that the [[DIY ethic]] never produces anything original, and it allows poor quality work to be championed.

In their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', [[Joseph Heath]] and [[Andrew Potter]] argued that [[counterculture]] politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed. They also argued that alternative and mainstream lifestyles ultimately have the same values.

'''''Queer Crips: Disabled Gay Men and Their Stories''''' is a 2004 anthology edited by Bob Guter and John R. Killacky. The book is a  collection of personal stories from gay men with disabilities. The stories are told through a variety of literary genres, including poetry, prose, and interviews. The book won the [[2004 Lambda Literary Awards|2004 Lambda Literary Award]] for the Anthologies/Non-fiction category. Contributors to the book include gay men such as [[Greg Walloch]], [[Kenny Fries]], [[J. Quinn Brisben]], and [[Eli Clare]]. After being turned down for publication by 30 publishers, the anthology was finally published by Harrington Park Press, an imprint of [[Haworth Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Gay-disabled-and-with-a-lot-to-talk-about-2788997.php |title=Gay, disabled and with a lot to talk about |publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-01 |first=Heidi |last=Benson |date=2004-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The ''Disability Studies Quarterly'', the publication of the [[Society for Disability Studies]], wrote a review of ''Queer Crips'', stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While Queer Crips can definitely boast of well-crafted, gorgeous poetry, there are a few exceptions. Perhaps it is only a matter of taste, but some of the poetry is of the cathartic type without the "craft" elements of formal published poetry or the spectacle of a performance piece. However, what is great about including such poetry is that it elevates all expressions of feeling and, in a sense, truly captures the sharing of the soul that poetry is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/518/695 |title=BOOK &amp; FILM REVIEWS |publisher=''[[Society for Disability Studies|Disability Studies Quarterly]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the book ''Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability'', [[Robert McRuer]] notes that the stories in ''Queer Crips'' are "nonheteronormative in their broadest sense" and that it is "striking how much the convergence of disability and homosexuality in "Queer Crips" appears to authorize erotic inventiveness and play". McRuer further writes that the anthology implicitly draws a parallel between [[compulsory heterosexuality]] and "compulsory able-bodiedness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last= McRuer|first= Robert|authorlink= |year= 2006|publisher= [[New York University Press]]|location= [[New York City]]|isbn= 0-814-75712-X|page= |pages= 243–4|accessdate=October 1, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdNb_XJrPwwC&amp;pg=PA243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gustave Courbet 010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|''[[Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet]]'', 1854. A [[Realism (art movement)|Realist]] painting by [[Gustave Courbet]]]]

'''Realism''', sometimes called '''naturalism''', in [[the arts]] is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without [[artificiality]] and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements.  Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.

In the visual arts, illusionistic realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. But realist or naturalist works of art may, as well or instead of illusionist realism, be "realist" in their subject-matter, and emphasize the mundane, ugly or sordid.  This is typical of the 19th-century  [[Realism (art movement)|Realist movement]] that began in France in the 1850s, after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[social realism]], [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], or [[kitchen sink realism]]. The Realist painters rejected [[Romanticism]], which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late [[18th century]].

There have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the [[opera]] style of [[Verismo (music)|verismo]], [[literary realism]], [[Realism (theatre)|theatrical realism]], and [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist cinema]]. 

==Visual arts==
[[File:The Arnolfini Portrait, détail (2).jpg|thumb|left|Realist or illusionistic detail of the [[convex mirror]] in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], 1434]]
Realism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects i.e., it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called [[Naturalism (visual art)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization|naturalism]], [[mimesis]] or [[Illusionism (art)|illusionism]]. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].  It becomes especially marked in European painting in the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and other artists in the 15th century.  However such "realism" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century [[Realism art movement]] painters such as [[Gustave Courbet]] are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of [[academic painting]], which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes.  It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances.  Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and "veristic" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between "realistic" (usually related to visual appearance) and "realist" is often useful, as is the term "illusionistic" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aSBAUzb8SokC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Realism+painting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sfslUYLPDKK30QXLmIHIAQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Realism%20painting&amp;f=false Stremmel, Kerstin,  ''Realism''], pp. 6–9, 2004, Taschen, {{ISBN|3822829420|978-3822829424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finocchio, Ross.

===Illusionistic realism===
[[File:Frederic Leighton - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lord Leighton]]'s ''[[Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna]]'' of 1853–55 is at the end of a long tradition of illusionism in painting, but is not Realist in the sense of Courbet's work of the same period.]]

The development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art.  It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.

The art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] and [[Early Renaissance]] periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, [[Idealism (art)|idealism]] remained the norm.

The accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked "realism", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquets]] in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].

===Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects===
[[File:Simon Bening (Flemish - Gathering Twigs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcutting, miniature from a set of [[Labours of the Months]] by [[Simon Bening]], c. 1550]]

The depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. [[Drolleries]] in the margins of medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times.

Early Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of [[Flanders]], and in some of these, notably the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the [[Merode Altarpiece]], by [[Robert Campin]] and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects.  However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]] in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from [[books of hours]], concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing [[landscape art]] and the depiction of everyday working-class people.
[[File:Annibale Carracci - Butcher's Shop - WGA04409.jpg|thumb|[[Annibale Carracci]], ''The Butcher's Shop'', early 1580s]]

In the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included [[Pieter Aertsen]] and his nephew [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young [[Annibale Carracci]] in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with [[Bartolomeo Passerotti]] somewhere between the two. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life.  Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in [[genre painting]] in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] sprouting several [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|different subgenres]] of such scenes, the [[Bamboccianti]] (though mostly from the [[Low Countries]]) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of [[bodegones]], and the introduction of unidealized peasants into [[history paintings]] by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and [[Velázquez]].  The [[Le Nain brothers]] in France and many Flemish artists including [[Adriaen Brouwer]] and [[David Teniers the Elder]] and [[David Teniers the Younger|Younger]] painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women.

Much art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of [[Old master print|prints]], was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message.  From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as [[Gustave Doré]] to show the horrors of city slums.  Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris.

Medieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of [[marine painting]] largely disappeared in [[fine art]] until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] and [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few [[railway]] scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment.

[[American realism]], a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.

===Realist movement===
{{main|Realism (art movement)}}
The Realist movement began in the mid-19th century as a reaction to [[Romanticism]] and [[History painting]]. In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. Its chief exponents were [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |title=NGA Realism movement |publisher=Nga.gov |date=1941-01-06 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144138/http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/realist-movement |title=National Gallery glossary, Realism movement |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://impressionist1877.tripod.com/realism.htm |title=Philosophy of Realism |publisher=Impressionist1877.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ross Finocchio, formerly of the Department of European Paintings at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of [[Émile Zola]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], and [[Gustave Flaubert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Nineteenth-Century French Realism &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Realist movement had equivalents in all other Western countries, developing somewhat later. In particular the [[Peredvizhniki]] or ''Wanderers'' group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ivan Shishkin]], and had a great influence on Russian art. In Britain artists such as [[Hubert von Herkomer]] and [[Luke Fildes]] had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues.

===Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization===
[[File:La familia de Carlos IV.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Goya]], ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', 1800–01]]

Realism or naturalism as a style meaning the honest, unidealizing depiction of the subject, can be used in depicting any type of subject, without any commitment to treating the typical or everyday.  Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and [[Baroque]]. [[Demetrius of Alopece]] was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the [[Ancient Roman Republic]] even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. [[Goya]]'s portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons.

[[File:Eilif Peterssen-Laksefiskeren (1889).jpg|thumb|left|[[Eilif Peterssen]], ''The Salmon Fisher'', 1889.]]
A recurring trend in [[Christian art]] was "realism" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all [[Christ]] and his physical sufferings in his [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]].  Following trends in [[devotional literature]], this developed in the [[Late Middle Ages]], where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf.  These were especially found in Germany and [[Central Europe]].  After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the [[Baroque]], especially in Spanish sculpture.

Renaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 30–32, and the whole short chapter on Leonardo&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was an early idealizer, stressing the typical,&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 14–20&lt;/ref&gt; with others such as [[Michelangelo]] supporting selection of the most beautiful – he refused to make portraits for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 59–64&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative "classical-idealism" of [[the Carracci]] and the "naturalist" style of the [[Caravaggisti]], or followers of [[Caravaggio]], who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used "naturalist" as a self-description. [[Bellori]], writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to "Those who glory in the name of naturalists" (''naturalisti'').&lt;ref&gt;"Quelle che si gloriamo del nome de naturalisti", quoted in Raben, 134, note 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century "Naturalism" or the "'''Naturalist school'''" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of "naturalist" as a student of [[Natural history]], as the [[biological sciences]] were then generally known.  The originator of the term was the French art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]], who in 1863 announced that: "The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science".&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;Needham&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]] adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of [[Impressionism]], but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

The term "continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of [[Modernism]] and also was not [[Academic art]].  The later periods of the French [[Barbizon School]] and the [[Düsseldorf school of painting]], with its students from many countries, and in 20th-century American [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] are movements which are often also described as "Naturalist", although the term is rarely used of British painting.  Some recent art historians have deepened the confusion by claiming either Courbet or the Impressionists for the label.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

==Literature==
{{Main|Literary realism}}
Broadly defined as "the faithful representation of reality",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Donna M. Campbell |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/realism.htm |title=Realism in American Literature |publisher=Wsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realism as a literary movement was based on "[[objective reality]]." It focused on showing everyday activities and life, primarily among the middle or lower class society, without romantic idealization or dramatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Realism |title=Realism definition of Realism in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be regarded as the general attempt to depict subjects as they are considered to exist in third person [[objective reality]], without embellishment or interpretation and "in accordance with secular, [[empirical]] rules."&lt;ref&gt;in so far as such subjects are "explicable in terms of natural causation without resort to supernatural or divine intervention" [[#refMorris2003|Morris, 2003]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MFAW6dh24ZwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=realism&amp;ei=ROOkS_LBA5TszASD95nXCA&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the approach inherently implies a belief that such [[reality]] is [[ontological]]ly independent of human kind's conceptual schemes, linguistic practices and beliefs, and thus can be known (or knowable) to the artist, who can in turn represent this 'reality' faithfully. As [[Ian Watt]] states, modern realism "begins from the position that truth can be discovered by the individual through the senses" and as such "it has its origins in [[Descartes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], and received its first full formulation by [[Thomas Reid]] in the middle of the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWatt1957|Watt, 1957]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

While the preceding [[Romantic era]] was also a reaction against the values of the [[Industrial Revolution]], realism was in its turn a reaction to romanticism, and for this reason it is also commonly derogatorily referred as "traditional" "bourgeois realism".&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"/&gt; Some writers of [[Victorian literature]] produced works of realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian Literature|url=http://www.online-literature.com/periods/victorian.php|publisher=The Literature Network|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rigidities, conventions, and other limitations of "bourgeois realism," prompted in their turn the revolt later labeled as [[Modernist literature|modernism]]; starting around 1900, the driving motive of modernist literature was the criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and world view, which was countered with an antirationalist, antirealist and antibourgeois program.&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"&gt;[[John Barth]] (1979) ''[[The Literature of Replenishment]]'', later republished in ''[[The Friday Book]]' '(1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff75"&gt;[[Gerald Graff]] (1975) ''Babbitt at the Abyss: The Social Context of Postmodern. American Fiction'', [[TriQuarterly]], No. 33 (Spring 1975), pp. 307–37; reprinted in Putz and Freese, eds., Postmodernism and American Literature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff73"&gt;[[Gerald Graff]] (1973) ''The Myth of the Postmodernist Breakthrough'', [[TriQuarterly]], 26 (Winter, 1973) 383–417; rept in ''The Novel Today: Contemporary Writers on Modern Fiction Malcolm Bradbury'', ed., (London: Fontana, 1977); reprinted in Proza Nowa Amerykanska, ed., Szice Krytyczne (Warsaw, 1984); reprinted in ''Postmodernism in American Literature: A Critical Anthology'', Manfred Putz and Peter Freese, eds., (Darmstadt: Thesen Verlag, 1984), 58–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
{{Main|Theatrical realism}}
Theatrical realism is said to have first emerged in European drama in the 19th century as an offshoot of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the age of science.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Our Dramatic Heritage, Volume 6|last=Hill|first=Philip|publisher=Associated University Presses|year=1992|isbn=978-0838634219|location=Cranbury, NJ|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of Theatre History|last=Kuritz|first=Paul|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1988|isbn=978-0135478615|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also specifically cited the invention of photography as the basis of the realist theater&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Theatre: A Concise Introduction, 3rd edition|last=Downs|first=William|last2=Wright|first2=Lou Anne|last3=Ramsey|first3=Erik|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2013|isbn=978-1111348311|location=Boston, MA|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre Histories: An Introduction, 2nd edition|last=Zarrilli|first=Phillip|last2=McConachie|first2=Bruce|last3=Williams|first3=Gary Jay|last4=Sorgenfrei|first4=Carol|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0415462235|location=Oxon|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others view that the association between realism and drama is far older as demonstrated by the principles of dramatic forms such as the presentation of the physical world that closely matches reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary British Drama|last=Lane|first=David|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0748638215|location=Edinburgh|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of realism in the [[theatre]] was to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life. In its dramas, people emerge as victims of forces larger than themselves, as individuals confronted with a rapidly accelerating world.&lt;ref&gt;Simard, Rodney. ''Postmodern Drama: Contemporary Playwrights in America and Britain.''  New York: UP of America, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; These pioneering playwrights were unafraid to present their characters as ordinary, impotent, and unable to arrive at answers to their predicaments. This type of art represents what we see with our human eyes. [[Anton Chekhov|Anton Chekov]], for instance, used camera works to reproduce an uninflected [[slice of life]], exposing the rhetorical and suasive character of realistic theatricality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Drama and the Rhetoric of Theater|last=Worthen|first=W.B.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0520286870|location=Berkeley, CA|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Thomas Postlewait noted that throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there were numerous joinings of [[melodrama]]tic and realistic forms and functions, which could be demonstrated in the way melodramatic elements existed in realistic forms and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Theatre|last=Saxon|first=Theresa|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0748645206|location=Edinburgh|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, realism in drama preceded fictional realism by about two decades as theater historians identified the first impetus toward realism during the late 1870s and early 1880s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Realism and American Drama, 1880–1940|last=Murphy|first=Brenda|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0521327114|location=Cambridge|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its development is also attributed to [[William Dean Howells]] and [[Henry James]] who served as the spokesmen for realism as well as articulator of its aesthetic principles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The realistic approach to theater collapsed into [[nihilism]] and the [[Absurdism|absurd]] after World War II.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

==Cinema==
{{See also|Neorealism (art)|Poetic realism|Socialist realism}}

[[Italian Neorealism]] was a cinematic movement incorporating elements of realism that developed in post-WWII Italy. Notable Neorealists included [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Luchino Visconti]], and [[Roberto Rossellini]]. Realist films generally focus on social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of realism in film: seamless realism and aesthetic realism. Seamless realism tries to use narrative structures and film techniques to create a "reality effect" to maintain its [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic realism, which was first called for by French filmmakers in the 1930s and promoted by [[Andre Bazin]] in the 1950s, acknowledges that a "film cannot be fixed to mean what it shows", as there are multiple realisms; as such, these filmmakers use location shooting, natural light and non-professional actors to ensure the viewer can make up her/his own choice based on the film, rather than being manipulated into a "preferred reading".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siegfried Kracauer]] is also notable for arguing that realism is the most important function of cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dudley Andrew]], ''The Major Film Theories: An Introduction'', Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 1976, Part II.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic realist filmmakers use [[long shot]]s, [[deep focus]] and eye-level 90 degree shots to reduce manipulation of what the viewer sees.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; Italian neorealism filmmakers from after WWII took the existing realist film approaches from France and Italy that emerged in the 1960s and used the to create a politically-oriented cinema. French filmmakers made some politically-oriented realist films in the 1960s, such as the [[cinéma vérité]] and documentary films of [[Jean Rouch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, British, French and German new waves of filmmaking produced "slice-of-life" films (e.g., [[kitchen sink drama]]s in the UK).&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera==
{{main|Verismo}}
Verismo was a post-Romantic operatic tradition associated with Italian composers such as [[Pietro Mascagni]], [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]], [[Umberto Giordano]], [[Francesco Cilea]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]]. They sought to bring the naturalism of influential late 19th-century writers such as [[Émile Zola]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Henrik Ibsen]] into opera. This new style presented true-to-life drama that featured gritty and flawed lower-class protagonists&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Chronology Of Western Classical Music 1600-2000|last=Paxman|first=Jon|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1783231218|location=London|pages=425–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some described it as a heightened portrayal of a realistic event.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Tanner's Worth of Tune: Rediscovering the Post-war British Musical|last=Wright|first=Adrian|publisher=The Boydell Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1843835424|location=Suffolk, UK|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an account considered [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Luisa Miller]]'' and ''[[La traviata|La Traviata]]'' as the first stirrings of the verismo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tosca|last=Carner|first=Mosco|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0521228244|location=Cambridge|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; some claimed that it began in 1890 with the first performance of [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', peaked in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;"Verismo" in Stanley Sadie (ed.) ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians'', London: Macmillan/New York: Grove, 1980, vol. 19 p. 670, {{ISBN|1561591742}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, which dealt with the themes of infidelity, revenge, and violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Verismo also reached Britain where pioneers included the [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] theatrical partnership of the [[dramatist]] [[W. S. Gilbert]] and the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] (1842–1900).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Specifically, their play ''[[Iolanthe]]'' is considered a realistic representation of the nobility although it included fantastical elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4186">The '''School of Letters''' was a summer institute and degree-granting (M.A. and Ph.D. minor) program at [[Indiana University| Indiana University, Bloomington]]. The School moved from [[Kenyon College]] in 1951 following the withdrawal of funding of the '''School of English''' by the Rockefeller Foundation. I.U. President Herman B. Wells obtained funding from the University and located the School under the administration of Dean John W. Ashton of the College of Arts and Sciences. The School opened under the direction of Prof. Richard B. Hudson and then transitioned to Prof. Newton P. 'Stalky' Stallknecht until his retirement and the School's dissolution in 1972.

==Founding of the School of Letters==
When Indiana University moved the School from Kenyon to Bloomington they maintained [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Lionel Trilling]], Philip Rahv, Austin Warren, and [[Allen Tate]] as senior fellows, all well-known literary scholars. The Kenyon School of English was founded by three senior fellows, John Crowe Ransom, [[F. O. Matthiessen]] and Lionel Trilling and was held during a summer session at Kenyon College from 1948 until 1950. The first session of the School of Letters in Bloomington ran from June 21 to August 1, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Arden Fitz, “School of Letters Opens at I. U.” Indiana Daily Student, 6/22/1951&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:School-of-Letters-Logo.jpg|thumb|right|School of Letters logo from the 1972 (final year of the School) brochure.]]

==School of Letters Mission Statement==
{{quote|The educational policy of the School turns on the belief that the usual college and university courses in English have not discharged their responsibility for the art which is in their keeping…They expend very nearly their entire energy upon disciplines which are philological, historical, biographical, and ideological…able students are not being trained, and perhaps not even being encouraged, to form literary judgments.

In 1954, this statement needs from correction, in part perhaps because of the School’s success; in part, too, because the School was symptom as well as cause. Departments of English have increasingly recognized, and officially provided for, the critical study of literature. More students are drawn to it, and they meet with increasing tolerance and even encouragement.

Insistence upon high standards is not to be understood as commitment to some particular doctrine of criticism. As defined by its aims and exemplified in its history, the School represents various modes of contemporary theory and practice. It hopes for that free and responsible diversity, on the part of students and teachers, from which may develop a rich and inclusive synthesis.
&lt;ref&gt;''School of Letters Brochure''(1954) Indiana University School of Letters Director's records, Collection C36, Office of University Archives and Records Management, Indiana University, Bloomington.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The School's Impact on the Field==

Students at the '''School of Letters''' included James M. Cox '51 (later would become a faculty member at Indiana University and the School), Martha Banta '62, [[Bruce Jackson (scholar)|Bruce Jackson]] '62, Paul Lauter '55, and [[Geoffrey Hartman|Geoffrey H. Hartman]] '51. The School existed during a period of major change within the field of literary studies from the dominance of [[New Criticism]] until the rise of [[post-structuralism]]. During each session of the School high profile academics, poets, and critics were brought to Bloomington to teach seminars and deliver weekly forum lectures. These instructors included [[Northrop Frye]], [[William Empson]], [[John Berryman]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Leslie Fiedler]], and [[R. P. Blackmur]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, James E.

'''Semiotics of culture''' is a research field within [[semiotics]] that attempts to define [[culture]] from semiotic perspective and as a type of human symbolic activity, creation of [[sign]]s and a way of giving meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a [[system]] of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as '''semiotics of culture and language'''. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.

The research field was of particular interest for the [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]] ([[USSR]]). Linguists and semioticians by the Tartu School viewed culture as a hierarchical semiotic system consisting of set of functions correlated to it, and linguistic codes that are used by social groups to maintain coherence. These codes are viewed as superstructures based on natural language, and here the ability of humans to symbolize is central.

The study received a research ground also in [[Japan]] where the idea that culture and nature should not be contrasted and contradicted but rather harmonized was developed.

[[File:Ronald Reagan televised address from the Oval Office, outlining plan for Tax Reduction Legislation July 1981.jpg|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]]'s economic policies, which were dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]", included large tax cuts and were characterized as trickle-down economics—in this picture, he is outlining his plan for Tax Reduction Legislation from the [[Oval Office]] in a televised address, July 1981]]
'''Trickle-down economics''', also called '''trickle-down theory''', refers to the economic proposition that taxes on businesses and the wealthy in society should be reduced as a means to stimulate business investment in the short term and benefit society at large in the long term. In recent history, the term has been used by critics of [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, such as "[[Reaganomics]]." Whereas general supply-side theory favors lowering taxes overall, trickle-down theory more specifically targets taxes on the upper end of the [[Social class|economic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Why Trickle Down Economic Works in Theory But Not in Fact|author=Amadeo, Kimberly|date=April 29, 2017|magazine=The Balance|url=https://www.thebalance.com/trickle-down-economics-theory-effect-does-it-work-3305572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cross and Reaganomics: Conservative Christians Defending Ronald Reagan|author=Crouse, Eric R.|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-vkVdJPN4wC|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "trickle-down" originated as a joke by humorist [[Will Rogers]] and today is often used to criticize economic policies which favor the wealthy or privileged while being framed as good for the average citizen. [[David Stockman]], who as [[Ronald Reagan]]'s budget director championed [[Reagan tax cuts|Reagan's tax cuts]] at first, later became critical of them and told journalist [[William Greider]] that "supply-side economics" is the trickle-down idea:&lt;ref name=atlantic-stockman&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1981/12/the-education-of-david-stockman/305760/?single_page=true "The Education of David Stockman"] by William Greider&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Greider. ''The Education of David Stockman.'' {{ISBN|0-525-48010-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|It's kind of hard to sell 'trickle down,' so the supply-side formula was the only way to get a tax policy that was really 'trickle down.' Supply-side is 'trickle-down' theory.|David Stockman|''[[The Atlantic]]''}}

Political opponents of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] soon seized on this language in an effort to brand the administration as caring only about the wealthy.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Multiple studies have found a correlation between trickle-down economics and reduced growth.&lt;ref name=imf/&gt;&lt;ref name=pav/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/business/12scene.html|title=In the Real World of Work and Wages, Trickle-Down Theories Don’t Hold Up|date=April 12, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tjn/&gt; Trickle-down economics has been widely criticised particularly by [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ([[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Social liberalism|social liberal]]) and [[moderate]] politicians and economists, but also some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] ([[conservative]]) politicians.

== History and usage ==
[[File:WilliamJBryan1902.png|thumb|150px|[[William Jennings Bryan]], who criticized trickle-down theory in his [[Cross of Gold speech]] in 1896]]
In 1896, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[List of United States presidential candidates|presidential candidate]] [[William Jennings Bryan]] described the concept using the metaphor of a "leak" in his {{nowrap|[[Cross of Gold speech]]:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas Frederick. 1992. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VIAbb1cKqp4C&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq= The Power "to Coin" Money: The Exercise of Monetary Powers by the Congress]''. Armonk, N.Y.: M.E.

:There are two ideas of government. There are those who believe that if you just legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, that their prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that rests upon it.&lt;ref name="historymatters.gmu.edu"&gt;[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/ Bryan's "Cross of Gold" Speech: Mesmerizing the Masses], historymatters.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Humorist Will Rogers jokingly advised in a column in 1932:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiredpen.com/2015/01/30/will-rogers-trickle-economics/|title=Will Rogers on "trickle up" economics|date=2015-01-30|website=WiredPen|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;This election was lost four and six years ago, not this year. They [Republicans] didn’t start thinking of the old common fellow till just as they started out on the election tour. The money was all appropriated for the top in the hopes that it would trickle down to the needy. Mr. Hoover was an engineer. He knew that water trickles down. Put it uphill and let it go and it will reach the driest little spot. But he didn’t know that money trickled up. Give it to the people at the bottom and the people at the top will have it before night, anyhow. But it will at least have passed through the poor fellows hands. They saved the big banks, but the little ones went up the flue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William J. Bennett]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Humorist Will Rogers referred to the theory that cutting taxes for higher earners and businesses was a "trickle down" policy, a term that has stuck over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, William J. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=PLP5U-M8dhoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=rosenman+the+belief+that+prosperity+would+trickle+down+to+the+bottom+of+the+heap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigkbm_2eTQAhUCq1QKHS_GAvwQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=trickle&amp;f=false ''America: The Last Best Hope'']. Harper Collins. p. 78. {{ISBN|1595551115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Presidential speech writer [[Samuel Rosenman]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The philosophy that had prevailed in Washington since 1921, that the object of government was to provide prosperity for those who lived and worked at the top of the economic pyramid, in the belief that prosperity would trickle down to the bottom of the heap and benefit all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' notes that the first known use of "trickle-down" as an adjective meaning "relating to or working on the principle of trickle-down theory" was in 1944&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trickle-down ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' (online edition) entry for "trickle-down."] Accessed September 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; while the first known use of "trickle-down theory" was in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trickle-down%20theory ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' (online edition) entry for "trickle-down theory."] Accessed September 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the [[President of the United States|presidency]], Democrat [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] alleged "[[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] [...] simply don't know how to manage the economy. They're so busy operating the trickle-down theory, giving the richest corporations the biggest break, that the whole thing goes to hell in a handbasket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/73jul/janos.htm|title=The Last Days of the President|first=Leo|last=Janos|work=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on the [[United States Senate|Senate]] floor in 1992, Senator [[Hank Brown]] (R-Colorado) said: "Mr. President, the trickle-down theory attributed to the Republican Party has never been articulated by President Reagan and has never been articulated by [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]] and has never been advocated by either one of them. One might argue whether trickle down makes any sense or not. To attribute to people who have advocated the opposite in policies is not only inaccurate but poisons the debate on public issues".&lt;ref&gt;Hank Brown. ''[[Congressional Record]],'' March 24, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Thomas Sowell]] has written extensively on trickle-down economics and loathes its characterization, citing that supply-side economics has never claimed to work in a "trickle-down" fashion. Rather, the economic theory of reducing marginal tax rates works in precisely the opposite direction: "Workers are always paid first and then profits flow upward later – if at all".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsowell.com/images/Hoover%20Proof.pdf "Tricle Down" Theory and "Tax Cuts for the Rich"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
The economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] noted that "trickle-down economics" had been tried before in the United States in the 1890s under the name "horse and sparrow theory", writing: {{quote|Mr. [[David Stockman]] has said that [[supply-side economics]] was merely a cover for the trickle-down approach to economic policy—what an older and less elegant generation called the horse-and-sparrow theory: 'If you feed the horse enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows.'|sign=|source=}} Galbraith claimed that the horse and sparrow theory was partly to blame for the [[Panic of 1896]].&lt;ref name=galbraith&gt;Galbraith, John Kenneth (February 4, 1982) "[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1982/feb/04/recession-economics/ Recession Economics]." ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' Volume 29, Number 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]], [[Independent politician|independent]] candidate [[Ross Perot]] called trickle-down economics "political voodoo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1992/trickle-down|title=The Living Room Candidate - Commercials - 1992 - Trickle Down|website=www.livingroomcandidate.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same election during a presidential town hall debate, [[Bill Clinton]] said: {{quote|What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of [declining economic conditions in America]. It is because America has not invested in its people. It is because we have not grown. It is because we've had 12 years of trickle-down economics. We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages. We've had four years where we’ve produced no private-sector jobs. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/bill-clinton-debate_n_1971685.html|title=Bill Clinton Won 1992 Town Hall Debate By Engaging With One Voter|website=Huffington Post|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In New Zealand, [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament (New Zealand)|Member of Parliament]] [[Damien O'Connor]] has called trickle-down economics "the rich pissing on the poor" in the Labour Party campaign launch video for the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5870477/Labour-campaign-video-harks-back-to-history|title=Labour campaign video harks back to history|last=Chapman|first=Kate|date=October 28, 2011|work=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by the [[Tax Justice Network]] indicates that wealth of the super-rich does not trickle down to improve the economy, but it instead tends to be amassed and sheltered in [[tax haven]]s with a negative effect on the tax bases of the home economy.&lt;ref name=tjn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/21/offshore-wealth-global-economy-tax-havens| author=Heather Stewart |title=Wealth doesn't trickle down – it just floods offshore, research reveals| work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 21, 2012 |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Pope Francis]] referred to "trickle-down theories" in his [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Evangelii Gaudium]]'' with the following statement (No. 54): {{quote|Some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html#No_to_an_economy_of_exclusion|title=Evangelii Gaudium : Apostolic Exhortation on the Proclamation of the Gospel in Today's World |work=vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

A 2015 paper by researchers for the [[International Monetary Fund]] argues that there is no trickle-down effect as the rich get richer: &lt;blockquote&gt;[I]f the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth.&lt;ref name=imf&gt;Era Dabla-Norris; Kalpana Kochhar; Nujin Suphaphiphat; Frantisek Ricka; Evridiki Tsounta (June 15, 2015).

Retrieved June 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2015 report on policy by economist [[Pavlina R. Tcherneva]] described the failings of increasing economic gains of the rich without commensurate participation by the working and middle classes, referring to the problematic policies as "Reagan-style trickle-down economics," and "a trickle-down, financial-sector-driven policy regime".&lt;ref name=pav&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tcherneva|first1=Pavlina|title=When a Rising Tide Sinks Most Boats: Trends in US Income Inequality|url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/pn_15_4.pdf|website=Levy Economics Institute|publisher=Bard College|accessdate=November 25, 2016|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential candidates]] debate, [[Hillary Clinton]] accused [[Donald Trump]] of supporting the "most extreme" version of trickle-down economics with his tax plan, calling it "trumped-up trickle-down" as a pun on his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/26/clinton-trump-would-cut-taxes-for-the-rich-in-trump-dump-economics.html| author=Jacob Pramuk |title=Clinton: Trump would cut taxes for the rich in 'trumped up' trickle down economics| work=[[CNBC]] |date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's studies''' is an academic field that draws on [[Feminism|feminist]] and interdisciplinary methods in order to place women’s lives and experiences at the center of study, while examining [[Social constructionism|social and cultural constructs]] of [[gender]]; systems of privilege and oppression; and the relationships between power and gender as they intersect with other identities and social locations such as [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Social class|socio-economic class]], and [[Disability studies|disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's voices, feminist visions: classic and contemporary readings|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan M. |last2=Lee|first2=Janet|isbn=978-0078027000|edition=Sixth|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|oclc=862041473|date=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular theories within the field of women's studies include [[feminist theory]], [[standpoint theory]], [[intersectionality]], [[multiculturalism]], [[transnational feminism]], [[social justice]], [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] studies, [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[biopolitics]], [[materialism]]s, and embodiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0190872823|oclc=1002116432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research practices and methodologies associated with women's studies include [[ethnography]], [[autoethnography]], [[focus group]]s, surveys, community-based research, discourse analysis, and reading practices associated with [[critical theory]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist research practice: a primer|last=Hesse-Biber|first=Sharlene Nagy|isbn=9781412994972|edition=Second|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|oclc=838201827|date=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field researches and critiques societal norms of [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Social class|class]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and other [[social inequalities]].

== History ==
In 1956 [[Australian]] feminist Madge Dawson took up a lectureship in the Department of Adult Education at [[Sydney University]] and began researching and teaching on the status of women. Dawson's course, "Women in a Changing World," focused on the socio-economic and political status of women in western Europe, becoming one of the first women's studies courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/30/1059480406739.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first accredited women's studies course in the U.S was held in 1969 at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eDF5Ic-DL1wC&amp;pg=PA388|title=The Encyclopedia of Stress and Stress-related Diseases|last=Kahn|first=Ada P.|publisher=Facts on File|year=2006|isbn=978-0816059379|edition=2nd|page=388|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of intense organizing of women's [[consciousness raising group]]s, rallies, petition circulating, and operating unofficial or experimental classes and presentations before seven committees and assemblies, the first women's studies program in the United States was established in 1970 at [[San Diego State University|San Diego State College]] (now [[San Diego State University]]).&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite journal|last=Salper|first=Roberta|date=November 2011|title=San Diego State 1970: The Initial Year of the Nation's First Women's Studies Program|url=http://www.feministstudies.org/issues/vol-30-39/37-3.html|journal=[[Feminist Studies]]|volume=37|issue=3|pages=658–682|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/wsweb/|title=SDSU Women's Studies Department|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918042623/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/wsweb/|archivedate=18 September 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with [[Women's liberation movement|National Women's Liberation Movement]], students and community members created the AD HOC Committee for women's studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womensstudies.sdsu.edu/history.htm|title=History :: Department of Women's Studies at San Diego State University|website=womensstudies.sdsu.edu|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;The second women's studies program in the United States was established in 1971 at Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas. It was mostly formed though efforts by women in the English department, administration and community.&lt;ref&gt;Chinyere Okafor citing from The Center for Women's Studies' papers at WSU&lt;/ref&gt; By 1974 SDSU faculty members began a nationwide campaign for the integration of the department. At the time, these actions and the field were extremely political.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boxer|first=Marilyn J.|date=Fall 2002|title=Women's studies as women's history|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly, Special Issue: Women's Studies then and Now|volume=30|issue=3–4|pages=42–51|jstor=40003241|postscript=.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these early days of women's studies, before formalized departments and programs, many courses were advertised unofficially around campuses and taught by women faculty members—for free—in addition to their established teaching and administrative responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Triumphs, Controversies, and Change: 1970s to the Twenty-First Century|title=The Evolution of American Women's Studies: Reflections on Triumphs, Controversies, and Change|last=Ginsberg|first=Alice E.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-60579-4|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, as in many cases today, faculty who teach in women's studies often hold faculty appointments in other departments on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming Scholarship: Why Women's and Gender Studies Students Are Changing Themselves and the World|last=Berger|first=Michele Tracy|last2=Radeloff|first2=Cheryl|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-0-415-83653-1|location=New York|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first scholarly journal in interdisciplinary women's studies, ''Feminist Studies'', began publishing in 1972.&lt;ref name="FSAboutUs2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministstudies.org/aboutfs/history.html|title=History|publisher=Feminist Studies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Women's Studies Association]] (of the United States) was established in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwsa.org/content.asp?pl=19&amp;contentid=19|title=NWSA|website=nwsa.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s saw the growth and development of women's studies courses and programs across universities in the U.S., while the field continued to grapple with backlash from both conservative groups and concerns from those within the women's movement about the white, [[Gender essentialism|essentialist]], and [[heterosexual privilege]] of those in the academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of American women's studies: reflections on triumphs, controversies, and change|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230605794|edition=1st|location=New York|page=16|oclc=224444238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political aims of the feminist movement that compelled the formation of women's studies found itself at odds with the institutionalized academic feminism of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Studies on the Edge|last=Wiegman|first=Robyn|chapter=Feminism, Institutionalism, and the Idiom of Failure|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8223-4274-8|editor-last=Scott|editor-first=Joan Wallach|location=Durham|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; As "woman" as a concept continued to be expanded, the exploration of social constructions of gender led to the field's expansion into both gender studies and sexuality studies.

The field of women's studies continued to grow during the 1990s and into the 2000s with the expansion of universities offering majors, minors, and certificates in women's studies, gender studies, and feminist studies. The first Ph.D. program in Women's Studies was established at [[Emory University]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gs.emory.edu/academics/program_pages/gender.html|title=Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, there were 16 institutions offering a Ph.D. in Women's Studies in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwsa.org/AF_institution_Directory.asp|title=NWSA|website=nwsa.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artemisguide.com/|title=Artemis Guide to Women's Studies in the U.S|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, UC Santa Cruz (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/|title=UC Santa Cruz – Feminist Studies|website=feministstudies.ucsc.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Kentucky-Lexington (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gws.as.uky.edu/phd-program-gws|title=PHD Program {{!}} Gender &amp; Women's Studies|website=gws.as.uky.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stony Brook University (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/wgss/|title=Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|website=www.stonybrook.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oregon State University (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/school-language-culture-and-society/wgss/phd-women-gender-and-sexuality-studies|title=PhD in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies! {{!}} College of Liberal Arts {{!}} Oregon State University|website=liberalarts.oregonstate.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also introduced a Ph.D. in the field.

==  Theoretical traditions and research methods  ==
[[File:Students of Women and Gender Studies University of Haifa on training in writing in Wikipedia (1).jpg|thumb|300px|Students of Women and Gender Studies [[University of Haifa]]]]
Early women's studies courses and curricula were often driven by the question "where are the women?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Women's Studies – The Early Years: When Sisterhood Was Powerful|last=Rothenberg|first=Paula|title=The Evolution of American Women's Studies|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-60579-4|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|location=New York|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, as more women were present in higher education as both students and faculty, questions arose about the male-centric nature of most courses and curricula. Women faculty in traditional departments such as history, English, and philosophy began to offer courses with a focus on women. Drawing from the women's movement's notion that "the personal is political," courses also began to develop around sexual politics, women's roles in society, and the ways in which women's personal lives reflect larger power structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of American women's studies: reflections on triumphs, controversies, and change|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230605794|edition=1st|location=New York|page=69|oclc=224444238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, scholars of women's studies have taken [[post-modern]] approaches to understanding gender as it intersects with race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, age, and (dis)ability to produce and maintain power structures within society. With this turn, there has been a focus on language, subjectivity, and social hegemony, and how the lives of subjects, however they identify, are constituted. At the core of these theories is the notion that however one identifies, gender, sex, and sexuality are not intrinsic, but are socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwsa.org/Files/Resources/WS_Integrative_Learning_Levine.pdf|title=Questions for A New Century: Women's Studies and Integrative Learning|last=Levin|first=Amy K.|date=2007|website=www.nwsa.org|access-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major theories employed in women's studies courses include [[feminist theory]], [[intersectionality]], [[standpoint theory]], [[transnational feminism]], and [[social justice]]. Research practices associated with women's studies place women and the experiences of women at the center of inquiry through the use of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. Feminist researchers acknowledge their role in the production of knowledge and make explicit the relationship between the researcher and the research subject.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

=== Feminist theory ===

[[Feminist theory]] refers to the body of writing that works to address gender discrimination and disparities, while acknowledging, describing, and analyzing the experiences and conditions of women's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist theory: a reader|last1=Kolmar|first1=Wendy K.|last2=Bartkowski|first2=Frances|year=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|isbn=9780073512358|edition=4th|location=New York|page=2|oclc=800352585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists and writers such as [[bell hooks]], [[Simone de Beauvoir|Simone de Beauvoir,]] [[Patricia Hill Collins]], and [[Alice Walker]] added to the field of feminist theory with respect to the ways in which race and gender mutually inform the experiences of women of color with works such as ''[[Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center]]'' (hooks), ''[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens]]'' (Walker), and ''[[Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment|Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment]]'' (Collins). Alice Walker coined the term [[womanism]] to situate black women's experiences as they struggle for social change and liberation, while simultaneously celebrating the strength of black women, their culture, and their beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Womanist reader|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|last=Phillips|first=Layli|isbn=9780415954112|location=New York|oclc=64585764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Hill Collin's contributed the concept of the "[[matrix of domination]]" to feminist theory, which reconceptualizes race, class, and gender as interlocking systems of oppression that shape experiences of privilege and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment|first=Patricia Hill|last=Collins|isbn=9780415964722|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=245597448|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersectionality ===

Associated with the third wave of feminism, [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw]]'s theory of [[intersectionality]] is an approach to understanding how institutional structures mutually shape an individual's gendered, racial, and social status. Intersectional theory posits that these relationships must be considered in conversation with each other in order to understand hierarchies of power and privilege and they ways in which they manifest in an individual's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carastathis|first=Anna|date=2014-05-01|title=The Concept of Intersectionality in Feminist Theory|journal=Philosophy Compass|language=en|volume=9|issue=5|pages=304–314|doi=10.1111/phc3.12129|issn=1747-9991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standpoint theory ===

[[Standpoint theory]] developed in the 1980s as way of critically examining the production of knowledge and its resulting effects on practices of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The feminist standpoint theory reader: intellectual and political controversies|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|last=Harding|first=Sandra G.|isbn=978-0415945004|location=New York|page=2|oclc=51668081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standpoint theory operates from the idea that knowledge is socially situated and, as a result, underrepresented groups and minorities have historically been ignored or marginalized when it comes to the production of knowledge. Emerging from Marxist thought, standpoint theory argues for analysis that challenges the authority of political and social "truths".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hekman|first=Susan|date=1997|title=Truth and Method: Feminist Standpoint Theory Revisited|jstor=3175275|journal=Signs|volume=22|issue=2|pages=341–365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transnational feminist theory ===

[[Transnational feminism]] is concerned with the flow of social, political, and economic equality of women and men across borders, particularly in response to globalization, neoliberalism, and imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women worldwide: transnational feminist perspectives on women|last=Moghadam|first=Valentine M.|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|editor1-last=Lee|editor1-first=Janet|editor2-last=Shaw|editor2-first=Susan M.|year=|isbn=9780073512297|location=New York, NY|pages=15|chapter=Transnational Feminisms|oclc=436028205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's studies began incorporating transnational feminist theory into its curricula as a way to disrupt and challenge the ways knowledge is prioritized, transmitted, and circulates in the field and academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking women's and gender studies|last=Parisi|first=Laura|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|editor1-last=Orr|editor1-first=Catherine Margaret|editor2-last=Braithwaite|editor2-first=Ann|editor3-last=Lichtenstein|editor3-first=Diane Marilyn|isbn=9780415808316|location=New York|pages=326|chapter=Transnational|oclc=738351967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social justice ===

Since its inception and connection with the women's movement, activism has been a foundation of women's studies. Increasingly [[social justice]] has become a key component of women's studies courses, programs, and departments. Social justice theory is concerned with the fight for just communities, not on the individual level, but for the whole of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Justice: Theories, Issues, and Movements|last1=Capeheart|last2=Milovanovic|first2=Dragan|first1=Loretta|year=2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813541686|location=Piscataway|page=2|oclc=437192947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's studies students engage in social justice projects, although some scholars and critics are concerned about requiring students to engage in mandated activism or social justice work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Jennifer L. |first2=Susanne |last2=Luhmann |title=Social Justice for (University) Credit? The Women's and Gender Studies Practicum in the Neoliberal University. (Report) |journal=Resources for Feminist Research |volume=34 |issue=3–4 |year=2016 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Pedagogies  ==
In most institutions, women's studies courses employ [[feminist pedagogy]] in a triad model of equal parts research, theory, and praxis. The decentralization of the professor as the source of knowledge is often fundamental to women's studies classroom culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shrewsbury|first=Carolyn M.|date=Fall 1987|title=What is feminist pedagogy?|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly, Special Issue: Feminist Pedagogy|volume=15|issue=3–4|pages=6–14|jstor=40003432|ref=harv}}

Women's studies courses focus on a variety of topics such as media literacy, sexuality, race and ethnicity, history involving women, queer theory, multiculturalism and other courses closely related. Faculty incorporate these components into classes across a variety of topics, including popular culture, women in the economy, reproductive and environmental justice, and women's health across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transforming Scholarship|last1=Berger|first1=Michele Tracy|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|edition=Second|location=Abingdon, Oxon|pages=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's studies programs are involved in social justice work and often design curricula that are embedded with theory and activism outside of the classroom setting. Some women's studies programs offer internships that are community-based allowing students the opportunity to experience how institutional structures of privilege and oppression directly affects women's lives. Women's studies curricula often encourage students to participate in [[service-learning]] activities in addition to discussion and reflection upon course materials. However, [[Daphne Patai]], from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], has criticized this aspect of women's studies programs, arguing that they place politics over education, stating that "the strategies of faculty members in these programs have included policing insensitive language, championing research methods deemed congenial to women (such as qualitative over quantitative methods), and conducting classes as if they were therapy sessions."&lt;ref name="Patai"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~korenman/wmst/fem_overhaul.html|title=Why Not A Feminist Overhaul of Higher Education?|last=Patai|first=Daphne|date=January 23, 1998|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since women's studies students analyze identity markers such as gender, race, class, and sexuality, this often results in dissecting institutionalized structures of power. As a result of these pedagogies, women's studies students leave university with a toolset to make social change and do something about power inequalities in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bubriski |first1=Anne |last2=Semaan |first2=Ingrid |year=2009 |title=Activist Learning vs. Service Learning in a Women's Studies Classroom |journal=Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=91–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable women's studies scholars include [[Charlotte Bunch]], [[Patricia Hill Collins]], [[bell hooks]], [[Angela Davis]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Adrienne Rich]], and [[Barbara Ransby]].

'''Women in media''' are individuals who participate in media. Media are the collective communication outlets or tools used to [[Document|store]] and deliver information or data.&lt;ref&gt;What is media? definition and meaning http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/media.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What is Communication Media? – Definition from Techopedia http://www.techopedia.com/definition/14462/communication-media&lt;/ref&gt; The role of women in media evolves around the four axes of media: media [[Freedom of the press|freedom]], [[media pluralism]], [[media independence]], and media [[Safety of Journalists|safety]]. Women in media face the same difficulties and threats as men, but also experience [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]], safety issues, or under-representation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety of women journalists ==
{{Main|Safety of Journalists}}'''Safety of journalists''' is the ability for [[journalist]]s and media professionals to receive, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats. Women journalists also face increasing dangers such as sexual assault, "whether in the form of a targeted sexual violation, often in reprisal for their work; mob-related [[sexual violence]] aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas."&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Issues of Impunity, 2012, https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/un-plan-on-safety-journalists_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends Report in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats on women journalists ===
[[Women in journalism|Women journalists]], whether they are working in an insecure context, or in a [[newsroom]], face risks of physical assault, [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual assault]], rape and even murder. Women journalists are vulnerable to attacks not only from those attempting to silence their coverage, but also from sources, colleagues and others.&lt;ref&gt;Lanza, Edison. 2017. Silenced Zones: Highly Dangerous Areas for the Exercise of Freedomof Expression. Office for the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Available at http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/expression/docs/publications/ZONAS_SILENCIADAS_ENG.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 global survey of nearly 1,000 journalists, initiated by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) in partnership with the [[International Women's Media Foundation]] (IWMF) and with the support of UNESCO, found that nearly two-thirds of women who took part in the survey had experienced intimidation, threats or abuse in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;International Media Women's Foundation and International News Safety Institute 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 2012 through 2016, UNESCO's Director-General denounced the killing of 38 women journalists, representing 7 per cent of all journalists killed.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists&lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage of journalists killed who are women is significantly lower than their overall representation in the media workforce. This large gender gap is likely partly the result of the persistent under-representation of women reporting from war-zones or insurgencies or on topics such as politics and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Janet, Nick Mosdell, and James Griffiths. 2016. Gender, Risk and Journalism. Journalism Practice 10 (7): 902–916&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 2017 report of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] outlines a way forward for a gender-sensitive approach to strengthening the safety of women journalists.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly. 2017.

Available at https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N17/245/44/PDF/N1724544.pdf?OpenElement.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[Council of Europe]]’s Committee of Ministers adopted recommendation CM/Rec(2016)4 on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors, in particular noting the gender-specific threats that many journalists face and calling for urgent, resolute and systematic responses.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 2016.

=== Online harassment of women journalists data ===
Research undertaken by [[Pew Research Center]] indicated that 73 per cent of adult internet users in the United States had seen someone be harassed in some way online and 40 per cent had personally experienced it, with young women being particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, Maeve, Lee Rainie, Aaron Smith, Cary Funk, Amanda Lenhart, and Mary Madden. 2014. Online Harassment. Pew Research Center. Available at http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/onlineharassment/.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Online harassment of women journalists.png|thumb|Online harassment of women journalists, World Trends Report 2018]]An analysis of more than two million tweets performed by the [[think tank]] [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] found that women journalists experienced approximately three times as many abusive comments as their male counterparts on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;Demos. 2014. Demos: male celebrities receive more abuse on Twitter than women. Demos. Available at https://www.demos.co.uk/press-release/demos-malecelebrities-receive-more-abuse-on-twitterthan-women-2/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]] surveyed the 70 million comments recorded on its website between 1999 and 2016 (only 22,000 of which were recorded before 2006). Of these comments, approximately 1.4&amp;nbsp;million (approximately two per cent) were blocked for abusive or disruptive behavior. Of the 10 staff journalists who received the highest levels of abuse and ‘dismissive [[Internet troll|trolling]]’, eight were women.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Becky, Mahana Mansfield, Ian Anderson, Josh Holder, Daan Louter, and Monica Ulmanu. 2016.

The INSI and IWMF survey found that more than 25 per cent of ‘verbal, written and/or physical intimidation including threats to family and friends’ took place online.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Alana, and Hannah Storm. 2014.

The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) organized an expert meeting titled ‘New Challenges to Freedom of Expression: Countering Online Abuse of Female Journalists’ which produced a publication of the same title that includes the voices of journalists and academics on the realities of online abuse of women journalists and how it can be combated.&lt;ref&gt;Mijatović, Dunja. 2016.

== Media freedom ==
'''Media freedom''' is the freedom to participate in media, the rights of expression, and access to and production of media content. These are all issues that can be fully understood only by considering their [[gender equality]] dimensions as they often overlap, and they have been compounded by the growing complexity of the digital sphere. Across all these issues, women do not enjoy full equality with men, nor do they have their work valued to the same extent as men. In many [[newsroom]]s around the world, there continues to be a culture that makes it difficult for women to progress. In such workplaces, [[harassment]] is common, and a lack of monitoring means that even with gender equality [[Policy|policies]] in place, they are often ineffective in challenging [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Under-representation of women ===
A related challenge has been the absence of women's voices as an issue in media freedom, including in [[internet governance]] policy-making more generally. This ongoing issue appears to have stagnated in recent years. The [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) Dynamic Coalition on Gender and Internet Governance, which pushes for recognition of the gendered issues relating to internet governance, reports that although women's participation at the 2015 IGF reached close to parity, women were still underrepresented in discussion and debates: only 37 per cent of panelists were women, a decline from 40 per cent the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Gender Dynamic Coalition and APC. 2016. Internet Governance Forum 2015: Learnings from the Gender Report Cards. GenderIT. Available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.genderit.org/resources/internetgovernance-forum-2015-learnings-genderreport-cards&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In organizations, such as the Internet Association for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]), senior [[leadership]] positions remain largely dominated by men. In 2017, ICANN's board of directors consisted of four women and 16 men. Minimizing the divide between the number of women and men in senior decision-making roles in relation to internet governance is an important step to ensuring that gender-based issues relating to [[Access to information|access]], [[privacy]] and security are prioritized.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, Anja, Avri Doria, Bruno Zilli, Margarita Salas, and Women's Legal and Human Rights Bureau. 2012. Critically Absent: Women’s Rights in Internet Governance. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.genderit.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; resources/critically-absent-womeninternet-governance-policy-advocacytoolkit&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of prevailing inequality, [[civil society]] continues to be a force for progress. Other organizations are working to push for greater representation and key standard-setting bodies, such as the Gender and Internet Governance eXchange, initiated by the [[Association for Progressive Communications]], which aims to redress the gap in participation by women's and [[Sexual rights|sexual rights’ activists]] in internet governance policy processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Freedom of information ===
Women's [[freedom of information]] and access to information is far from being equal to men's. It's the access to information gender divide. Social barriers such as [[Literacy|illiteracy]] and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities in navigating the tools used for access to information, often exacerbating lack of awareness of issues that directly relate to women and gender, such as [[Reproductive health|sexual health]]. There have also been examples of more extreme measures, such as local community authorities banning or restricting mobile phone use for girls and unmarried women in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, Anja. 2017. ‘Chupke, Chupke’: Going Behind the Mobile Phone Bans in North India. Internet Democracy Project. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://genderingsurveillance&lt;/nowiki&gt;. internetdemocracy.in/phone_ban/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of States, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the [[LGBT]]QI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;York, Jillian C. 2016. The State of Free Expression Online in Southeast Asia. Electronic Frontier Foundation. Available at &lt;https:// www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/statefree-expression-online-southeast-asia&gt;. Accessed 4 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube’s 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQ themes as ‘restricted’, a classification designed to filter out ‘potentially inappropriate content’.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Elle. 2017.

=== Online activity ===
Gendered aspects of [[media freedom]] intersect heavily with [[Safety of Journalists|journalists’ safety]]. [[Women in journalism|Women journalists]] face unique concerns, such as personal safety when dealing with confidential [[Journalism source protection|sources]], which can restrict their freedom of expression and add challenges that can hamper their ability to carry. Another dimension is the manifestation of physical violence as virtual violence through the increased incidence of [[Online hate speech|hate speech]] and abuse directed towards women and the LGBTQI community. Such abuse has had a chilling effect and disrupted the [[online participation]] of these communities. Countering the proliferation of such abuse has proved a serious challenge for policy-makers wanting to minimize the harm directed towards vulnerable groups. To mark [[International Women's Day]] in 2017, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression noted the challenges for [[government]]s, corporate bodies and [[Non-governmental organization|civil society organizations]] to address such abuses while remaining attentive to [[international human rights law]]. He counseled against censorship and undue restrictions on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] as a means of curbing [[Cyberbullying|online abuse]], warning that such restrictions could ‘end up undermining the rights of the very women for whom governments and corporate actors may seek to provide redress’.&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR. 2017. UN experts urge States and companies to address online genderbased abuse but warn against censorship&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media pluralism ==
Media pluralism is evaluated in terms of [[Access to information|access]], plurality of economic models and diversity of content. [[Gender equality]] in decision-making roles, the media workforce and representation in the media has not yet been reached in any of these areas according to [[UNESCO]]'s World Trends Report.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

=== Background ===
In the mid-1970s, pioneering academics made the first systematic analysis of women's relationship to and visibility in the mass media and in their ground-breaking study, they used the term ‘[[symbolic annihilation]]’ (originally credited to [[George Gerbner]]) to describe what they found.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, Gaye, A.K. Daniels, and J Benoit. 1978. Hearth and Home: Images of Women the Mass Media. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Available at &lt;Tuchman, G., Daniels, A.K., and Benoit, J. (1978) Hearth and Home: Images of Women in the Mass Media: Oxford: Oxford University Press.&gt;. Accessed 25 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost 40 years later, most gender and media scholars would suggest that progress has stalled, and there is significant work left to be done, including in relation to [[mainstream media]]. Women still feature less frequently than men in news discourse; women journalists and media professionals are often locked out of the more prestigious beats, and their occupation of senior positions within media organizations is still minimal. According to the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring]] Report in 2015 women made up only one in four media decision-makers, one in three reporters and one in five experts interviewed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women's visibility in newspaper, television and radio increased by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Macharia, Sarah. 2015. Who Makes the News? Global Media Monitoring Project 2015. London, Toronto: World Association for Christian Communication (WACC).

Accessed 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opportunities afforded to ‘ordinary’ citizens by the creation of [[Alternative media|alternative online news]] platforms has meant, however, that women's voices and perspectives are finding expression via these informal media channels.

=== International recognition ===
The existence of problems regarding gender and media pluralism has also been recognized by regional and [[international organization]]s and agencies over several decades. In 2010, UNESCO developed a comprehensive set of Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media, aimed at encouraging media organizations to benchmark themselves against equality criteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media-framework-of-indicators-to-gauge-gender-sensitivity-in-media-operations-and-content/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Council of the European Parliament adopted the recommendation made by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]], that the media industry should adopt and implement gender equality indicators relating to women in decision-making, gender equality policies and women on boards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2013-0074+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 60th session of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]] in 2016, United Nations (UN) Women launched a new partnership with major media organizations to draw attention to and act on the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 agenda for sustainable development]], which aims to eradicate all forms of inequality.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[UN Women]] launched ‘Step it Up for Gender Equality’, which had the tagline of ‘Planet 50:50 by 2030’. At the launch of that initiative, 70 nations committed to the gender equality agenda, and two years later, that number had increased to 93. In 2016, a review by UN Women of actions taken by these pledging nations reported a large number of initiatives, although none of them explicitly mentioned the media. Yet despite these initiatives, women remain excluded or marginalized in the media on the one hand, or else stereotyped and [[Minimisation (psychology)|trivialized]] on the other. Longitudinal studies of women and news predict that this is unlikely to change soon. At the current pace of change, parity of visibility between women and men is unlikely to occur for another 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;Macharia, Sarah. 2015. Who Makes the News?

The Step it Up for Gender Equality Media Compact comprises a coalition of media outlets from around the globe and from diverse sectors who have committed themselves to focusing on gender equality in three main ways: in their reporting routines, by disrupting [[stereotype]]s and biases; by increasing the number of women in their organizations, including in leadership and decision-making roles; and in developing gender-sensitive corporate practices. At its launch, 39 media houses had already signed up as founding members of the Compact and although each will devise their own internal agenda, being a member of the Compact requires a minimum set of actions to be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/get-involved/step-it-up/media-compact&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender equality in the media workforce ===
In many countries, as many women as men are graduating from media, journalism and communication degree programmes and entering the industry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011. Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Washington D. C.: International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF). Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;. iwmf.org/our-research/global-report/&gt;. Accessed 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, when the first substantial analysis of women media professionals across 43 nations was produced, women constituted around 40 per cent of the media [[workforce]].&lt;ref&gt;National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch). 1995. Global Media Monitoring Project: Women’s Participation in the News. National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch).&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are encouraged not to go into ‘hard’ news beats and instead are channeled into areas of news that are allegedly of more ‘interest’ to women and are also commonly held as being less prestigious. A [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Monitoring Project]] (Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP)) 2015 report found that 31 per cent of stories on politics and 39 per cent of stories about the economy have female by-lines.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;The Global Media Monitoring Project is the longest-running longitudinal and global study of gender and news media and provides a snapshot of how women and men feature in, make and report the news on one day every five years. The first GMMP report was in 1995 and the most recent one (in 2015) published its findings in November 2015. The Project provides comparative data across time and region. Teams in 114 countries who monitored 22,136 stories published, broadcast or tweeted by 2,030 distinct media outlets carried out the 2015 report. In sum, data were collected on the work of 26,010 journalists and the representation of 45,402 individuals who featured in or were quoted in the stories.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories about politics and crime see the least number of women reporters across all regions with the exception of Asia and Latin America. Unlike men, even when women do work on ‘hard’ news stories, they often struggle to achieve visibility for their copy: just over a third (37 per cent) of stories in newspapers, television and radio [[News broadcasting|newscasts]] had a female by-line or were visibly or audibly reported by women, the same as in GMMP's 2005 study. More focused individual country analyses show exactly the same trends; for example, research from the United States shows that while women journalists are writing on a wider range of topics, they are still a minority of [[columnist]]s at the major dailies.&lt;ref&gt;Harp, Dustin, Ingrid Bachmann, and Jaime Loke. 2014. Where are the women? The presence of female columnists in US opinion pages. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 91 (2): 289–307.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of presenting on broadcast news, the 2015 [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] found that the global proportion of women was 49 per cent, the same as in 2000 and two percentage points below the 1995 finding. Since 2005, the number of women working as reporters in broadcast news has dropped by four percentage points in television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp/gmmp-reports/gmmp-2015-reports&lt;/ref&gt;

Closer analysis from the [[World Trends report]] shows that women were more numerous on television (57 per cent) and less numerous on radio (41 per cent), where ‘looks’ are obviously far less important. The majority of younger presenters were women, but that trend reversed for older presenters, nearly all of whom were men. There were almost no women reporters recorded as older than 65.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Women's Media Center]] (WMC) 2017 report on women and the media in the United States shows a picture that has little changed from the GMMP's latest findings or indeed, from findings of its own previous studies. At 20 of the nation's top news outlets, women produced 37.7 per cent of news reports, an increase of 0.4 percentage points compared to 2016.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Women's Media Center. 2017. The Status of Women in U.S. Media 2017. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.womensmediacenter.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt; pages/the-status-of-women-in-u.s.media-2017&gt;. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In broadcast news, women’s presence as anchors, reporters and field journalists actually declined by nearly seven percentage points between 2015 and 2016. The WMC study found that these gender-based disparities existed across all news media as much in newspapers, online news, wire services as broadcast, but were especially stark in television news.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The digital world is as likely to perpetuate the same gender divisions that exist in the off-line world as the opposite. There is little evidence to suggest that [[digital media]] are employing or promoting more women than other parts of the [[media ecology]]. The [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|GMMP]]’s latest findings suggest that women's visibility as both citizens and media professionals in [[Online newspaper|online news sites]] and Twitter feeds was 26 per cent, only two percentage points higher than for television, radio and print. The situation behind the scenes at large internet companies, which hold influence over which news content is presented most visibly and are responsible for moderation of discussion and comments, has been equally dire.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Women and decision-making ===
The challenge for many women is much more than just breaking into the industry, but also being able to advance to the highest levels in their careers. The Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media found that women in media occupied just over a quarter of the jobs in top management (27 per cent) and [[governance]] (26 per cent) positions.&lt;ref&gt;Byerly 2011. The largest recent study of women media professionals, this report, which was researched for the International Women's Media Foundation and supported by UNESCO, looked at 59 countries and 522 news outlets.&lt;/ref&gt; The regions that fared best for women representation were [[Central Europe|Central]] (33 per cent) and Eastern Europe (43 per cent) and the [[Nordic countries]] (36 per cent). Elsewhere, women comprised only about a fifth of governance positions and held less than 10 per cent of top management jobs in Asia and the Pacific region. A major European project funded by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) found very similar findings. Men held most of the senior management positions and board membership in 99 media houses across the [[European Union]]. Public sector organizations were more likely to recruit and promote women into senior positions than private sector media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). 2017.

In the Asia and Pacific region, a joint report by the UNESCO Office in [[Bangkok]], UN Women and the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) Asia Pacific&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Bangkok Office, UN Women and International Federation of Journalists 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; found women were significantly under-represented in decision-making roles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Southern Africa, a Gender Links study found that women constitute 40 per cent of media employees and 34 per cent of media managers.&lt;ref&gt;Ndlovu, Sikhonzile, and Tarisai Nyamweda. 2016.

Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://genderlinks.org.za/shop/whosenews-whose-views/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also revealed that sexual harassment remains a key issue for women: just under 20 per cent of women media professionals said that they had personal experience of sexual harassment and the majority of those women said that the perpetrator was a senior colleague.

For Mary Kosut, women remain vastly underrepresented as media owners, a trend that has continued unabated as media concentration has increased through media consolidation and convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Kosut, Mary, ed. 2012. Encyclopedia of Gender in Media. SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender and representation ===
Many feminist media scholars have argued that what we see in front of the camera is determined to some extent by who is behind the camera and there is some reason to believe that more women in the newsroom would produce news that is more diverse. Several studies, including the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] (GMMP), show that women journalists are more likely to source women in their stories than men, leading to more balanced reporting which is better able to reflect the views of more and diverse communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The 2015 GMMP was able to make comparisons across the 20 years in which it has been operating. Despite women's considerable advancement over the past two decades in the public and [[private sector]]s, female appearances in television, radio and print rose by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent). Where women most often appear in media, it is when they speak from personal experience (representing 38 per cent), while only 20 per cent of [[spokesperson]]s and 19 per cent of experts featured in stories are women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The underepresentation of women in media content extends across regions. Women featured in stories as 32 per cent of experts interviewed in North America, followed by the Caribbean (29 per cent) and Latin America (27 per cent). In the southern African region, Gender Links’ latest Gender and Media Progress Study covered 14 countries and found that women's views and voices accounted for a mere 20 per cent of news sources across Southern Africa media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Sarah Macharia, even if more women appear in media, there may be limited impact on the entrenched biases and stereotypes present in media content. This can promote narrow gender roles that limit the choices and options available to everyone. This is why many actors continue to encourage all media workers to become more gender-sensitive through training and internal [[Policy|policies]] that monitor coverage and promote greater awareness of gender issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The picture for women in media ===
Women's accomplishments in the media sector have long remained under-recognized by traditional professional and news organizations, a trend that remains unchanged. Women have won only a quarter of [[Pulitzer Prize]]s for foreign reporting and only 17 per cent of awards of the [[Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Asquith, Christina. 2016.

Accessed 25 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organizations, mostly gender focused, have launched dedicated prizes to recognize achievements of women in media. The [[International Women's Media Foundation]] continues to recognize the courageous work of women journalists. In 2007, the [[Alliance of Women Film Journalists]]’ began giving out the EDA Awards annually to recognize women filmmakers and [[Photojournalism|photojournalists]]. More recently, in 2015 the [[African Development Bank]] began sponsoring a category for [[Women's rights]] in Africa, designed to promote gender equality through the media, as one of the prizes awarded annually by [[One World Media]].&lt;ref&gt;African Development Bank. 2015.

Accessed 25 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In considering the way in which women’s contribution to the news environment is made visible, the [[UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize]] is an annual award that honors a person, organization or institution that has made a notable contribution to the defense and/or promotion of press freedom anywhere in the world. Nine out of 20 winners have been women.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/prizes/guillermo-cano&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poynter Institute]] since 2014 has been running a Leadership Academy for Women in Digital Media, expressly focused on the skills and knowledge needed to achieve success in the digital media environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.poynter.org/training-events/leadership-academy-women-digital-media&lt;/ref&gt; Similar initiatives have begun to appear in other regions. UNESCO has also led workshops media professionals and community media in Gabon and Burundi, as part of its global efforts to enhance gender equality in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Kenmoe, Elvis Michel. 2016.

== Media independence ==
'''Media independence''' is the capacity of a news outlet to provide accurate and [[Bias|unbiased]] information to the public. In a 2016 study of board members’ views in North America and Western Europe on the introduction of quotas, for example, individuals whose organizations (and countries) were committed to actions to increase women's representation were enthusiastic about the effects; but in contrast, individuals working in contexts without such commitments were rarely keen to embrace such strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersema and Mors, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addressing issues around gender and media independence, a number of advocacy and media monitoring initiatives have developed over the past few years that provide data on persistent gender inequalities. Media unions at local, national, regional and global levels have been prominent in working to protect the interests of women media workers, initiating women's [[caucus]]es, appointing women's officers, establishing women's conferences and developing handbooks of good practice. [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ), for example, has a Gender Council (GC) which co-ordinates its gender-focused work. Since its inception, the GC has been IFJ's main vehicle to guide projects; formulate policy concerning gender and good practice; and advocate for and mainstream gender-based issues throughout IFJ, its projects and its member unions.  During its 2016 Congress, the work of the GC was officially enshrined and protected through inclusion in the IFJ Constitution. Women media professionals themselves have also been active in forming their own networks to support and encourage each other, organizing events, developing mentoring schemes and initiating awards that recognize women's accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Journalists. 2017.

=== Gender equality in the media workplace ===
Research over the past two decades on the working conditions of women media professionals has mostly shown that women sometimes face hostility in the [[newsroom]], which can be partly explained by the lack of organizational policies relating to gender equality and reporting mechanisms for [[harassment]]. The [[International Women's Media Foundation]]’s 2011 global study of women in the news media, cited in the previous chapter, found that more than half of the news media organizations surveyed had a company-wide policy on gender equality, but with significant variations between regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  More than two-thirds of organizations based in Western Europe and Africa had such policies, compared with a quarter in the Middle East and North Africa and less than 20 per cent in Central and Eastern European countries. The [[European Institute for Gender Equality]]’s 2013 report, which looked at 99 major media houses across Europe, found that a quarter of organizations had policies that included a provision for gender equality, often as part of broader equality directives in the society. It was notable that of the 99 organizations, public service bodies were much more likely than commercial ones to have equality policies in place. Media houses with such policies in place typically lacked mechanisms to monitor their effectiveness, thereby limiting their potential to effect change. The limitations of work practices to address gender inequalities do not reflect a lack of advocacy as there is evidence of a growing commitment towards gender equality on the part of media organizations.

=== Media monitoring and advocacy ===
In addition to the Global Media Monitoring Project, there are several regional initiatives which regularly monitor gendered aspects of the media, some of which also work with journalists to promote change within newsrooms.

The South Africa-based Gender Links, formed in 2001 to promote ‘gender equality in and through the media’ in Southern Africa, leads the media cluster of the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance. Gender Links promotes media advocacy through global initiatives such as the Global Alliance on Media and Gender (GAMAG), hosting gender and media summits, developing policy in collaboration with regulators and working with media organizations through training and policy development. Gender Links is currently developing Centres of Excellence for Gender in the Media in 108 Newsroom across Southern Africa.

In 2016, the [[World Association for Christian Communication]] (WACC), the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) Network and other partners launched a campaign to end news media sexism by 2020. The ‘End News Media Sexism’ campaign encourages and supports advocacy initiatives that promote changes in media policies and journalism practice. The campaign is taking a multi-disciplinary approach and uses a variety of different tools to promote awareness, including a gender scorecard against which media organizations are measured.

The [[FEMNET|African Women's Development and Communication Network]] (FEMNET), founded in 1988 as part of a broader project to promote women's empowerment in Africa, prioritizes women's development in the field of communication, where they have created and managed platforms to share information, ideas, strategies and experiences to foster cross-learning and more effective implementation of shared goals. FEMNET provides strategic policy recommendations through the production of reports and policy briefs. It has led extensive local [[capacity building]] initiatives, such as facilitating women's access to [[Information and communications technology|ICTs]] in Africa. In Asia, the South Asia Women's Network (SWAN) has rolled out a research project titled ‘Women for Change: Building a Gendered Media in South Asia’. Covering nine South Asian countries, it is partly supported by UNESCO’s [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]].

In addition, a number of national organizations work locally to redress the disparity in women's representation and participation in the media. Women, Media and Development (known by its [[Arabic]] acronym TAM) is a Palestine-based organization founded in 2004. TAM works with local women to promote their increased representation in the media and to foster an environment where they are able to effectively communicate and advocate for their rights. TAM provides training for women on how to access and use various media platforms, in addition to promoting community awareness and advocacy initiatives. TAM has facilitated capacity building and worked to counter stereotypes of women in the media by producing gender sensitive guides and training manuals, in addition to implementing projects that aim to increase women's access to decision-making positions and [[Civic engagement|civic participation]].

=== Formal and informal professional associations ===
A number of formal and informal networks of women media professionals also support women in the media. One of the oldest is the [[Alliance for Women in Media]] (AWM), originally established in 1951 as American Women in Radio and television, which supports women across all media to expand their networks, participate in training and professional development and celebrate their talents.&lt;ref&gt;https://allwomeninmedia.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, it began its annual programme of awards to recognize the work of programme-makers and content-providers in promoting women and women’s issues. A more regionally focused example is the [[Marie Colvin]] Journalists’ Network, a bilingual Arabic-English online community of women journalists working in the [[Arab world]] that aims to assist vulnerable local [[Women in journalism|women journalists]] who lack support in relation to safety training, legal contracts, insurance or [[Psychology|psychological]] care.&lt;ref&gt;n.d. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://mariecolvinnetwork.org/en/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media unions at local, regional and global levels have established caucuses for women and have campaigned to encourage more women to stand for elected office within formal union structures. In 2001, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] found that women represented 29 per cent of union membership in 38 countries but just 17 per cent of members on union governing bodies: in its 2010 report, it found that women’s representation on boards had increased only slightly, to 15 per cent. In Europe, between 2006 and 2013, women’s union membership went down from 45 per cent to 42 per cent and board membership also declined, from 39 per cent to 36 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifj.org/press-room/publications-reports/browse/weiter/category/reports/&lt;/ref&gt;
