      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2548">'''Across the Universe''' is an interstellar radio message (IRM) consisting of the song "[[Across the Universe]]" by [[The Beatles]] that was transmitted on 4 February 2008, at 00:00 [[UTC]] by [[NASA]]  in the direction of the star [[Polaris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/across_universe.html NASA Beams Beatles' 'Across the Universe' into Space]&lt;/ref&gt; This transmission was made using a 70-meter dish in the [[Deep Space Network]]'s (DSN) [[Madrid Deep Space Communication Complex]], located in Robledo, near [[Madrid, Spain]].

This action was done in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the song's recording, the 45th anniversary of the DSN, and the 50th anniversary of NASA. The idea was hatched by Beatles historian [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]], who encouraged all Beatles fans to play the track as it was beamed to the distant star. The event marked the second time a song had ever been intentionally transmitted into [[Outer space|deep space]] (the first being Russia's [[Teen Age Message]] in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaitsev|first=A. L.|title=The first musical interstellar radio message|journal=Journal of Communications Technology and Electronics|date=3 April 2008|volume=53|issue=9|pages=1107–1113|doi=10.1134/S106422690809012X|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m62151781m500p16/|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and was approved by [[Paul McCartney]], [[Yoko Ono]], and [[Apple Records]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22951001 "NASA beaming Beatles tune to the stars"]&lt;/ref&gt;

This IRM project has some significant defects in that the message was aimed at [[Polaris]], which is 431 light years distant from us and whose planetary system, even if it exists, may not be suited for life, because it is a [[supergiant]] star, [[spectral type]] F7Ib. In addition, the [[bit rate|transmission rate]] was very high, about 128 kbit/s, for such moderate [[transmitter power output|transmitter power]] (about 18&amp;nbsp;kW).

'''Agnes Nestor''' (24 June 1880 – 28 December 1948) was an [[United States|American]] labor leader, politician, and social reformer.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grivois-Shah|first=Timothy Michael|title=Agnes Nestor: Labor Leader, Politician, and Social Reformer--A Portrait of a Leader|url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1351&amp;context=luc_diss|publisher=Dissertations.Paper 352.|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is best remembered for her membership and leadership roles in the [[International Glove Workers Union]] (IGWU) and the [[Women's Trade Union League]] (WTUL), where she organized for [[women's suffrage]] and workers' rights .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5728/ |title=Working Her Fingers to the Bone: Agnes Nestor's Story |accessdate=2010-09-17 |quote= |publisher= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100817092630/http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5728/| archivedate= 17 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nestor's prominent activities included organizing women workers in Chicago in the early 1900s, running for public office, serving on national commissions to promote education, and securing work-hour limitations for women.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt;

==Early life==
Agnes Nestor was born on June 24, 1880, in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] to Thomas and Anna (McEwen) Nestor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44573291|title=Women building Chicago 1790-1990 : a biographical dictionary|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Schultz, Rima Lunin, 1943-, Hast, Adele., Paul Avrich Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0253338522|location=Bloomington|oclc=44573291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father owned a grocery store there, but due to the depression of the 1890s he returned to his old trade as a [[machinist]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring of 1897 Agnes and the rest of her family followed after their father and headed to Chicago;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44573291|title=Women building Chicago 1790-1990 : a biographical dictionary|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Schultz, Rima Lunin, 1943-, Hast, Adele., Paul Avrich Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0253338522|location=Bloomington|oclc=44573291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnes, still in her teens, found work in Chicago's Eisendrath Glove Company (a non-union shop).&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; In her autobiography ''Woman's Labor Leader'',  Nestor discusses the company's unjust practices such as: the company charged workers fifty cents a week for machine rental, workers had to provide their own needles (and if somebody was to break a needle they were charged for a new one to replace it), and also workers had to purchase their own machine oil, however, these unjust practices would not go unchallenged. In 1902 Nestor stepped forward as leader in a strike of women workers at the Eisendrath Glove Company (encouraged and supported by the [[Trade union|unionised]] men), which lasted ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2814907|title=The roads they made : women in Illinois history|last=Mitchell.|first=Wheeler, Adade|date=1977|publisher=C.H. Kerr Pub. Co|others=Wortman, Marlene Stein,|isbn=0882860208|location=Chicago|oclc=2814907}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike was successful, all the women's demands were met; workers received a raise in pay, no longer had to pay rent for their machines, and the Eisendrath company took greater responsibility for their machinery, its greatest outcome being the implementation of a union shop.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt;

==Activism==
[[File:Agnes Nestor, 1912.jpg|thumb|Agnes Nestor, 1912]]

===International Glove Workers Union and the Women's Trade Union League===
Following the success of the strike, Nestor took on more leadership roles. In 1902, the same small organization of women who took part in the Eisendrath Glove Company strike formed Glove Makers Local 2,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44573291|title=Women building Chicago 1790-1990 : a biographical dictionary|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Schultz, Rima Lunin, 1943-, Hast, Adele., Paul Avrich Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0253338522|location=Bloomington|oclc=44573291}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Agnes Nestor as a founder and leader. Nestor was the national vice president of the International Glove Workers Union from 1903 to 1906, secretary-treasurer from 1906 to 1913, general president from 1913 to 1915, vice-president, again, from 1915 to 1938, and director of research and education from 1938 until her death in 1948.&lt;ref name="Mcmillan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mcmillan |first=Peter |title=Agnes Nestor |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAWnestor.htm |publisher=Spartacus Educational Publishers Ltd |accessdate=3 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603122309/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAWnestor.htm |archivedate=3 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a leader in the International Glove Workers Union, Nestor gained prominence among labor leaders and earned access to network with notable women in Chicago society, many of whom she met through her involvement with [[Women's club (United States)|women's clubs]].&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt; Though there were differences between "club women" and "working women," particularly in terms of class, domestic roles, and educational attainment, the relationship and outreach efforts Nestor built with club women were to further the agenda of the International Glove Workers Union.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt;

Nestor was also an active member of the [[Women's Trade Union League]] (WTUL) of Chicago beginning in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44573291|title=Women building Chicago 1790-1990 : a biographical dictionary|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Schultz, Rima Lunin, 1943-, Hast, Adele., Paul Avrich Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0253338522|location=Bloomington|oclc=44573291}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as its president from 1913 to 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5728/ |title=Working Her Fingers to the Bone: Agnes Nestor's Story |accessdate=2010-09-17 |quote= |publisher= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100817092630/http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5728/| archivedate= 17 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other women's clubs, the Women's Trade Union League admitted women regardless of class,&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt; the club's aim was to secure the organization of all women workers of the U.S. into [[trade unions]] in the hopes of gaining better working conditions, a reduced work day, a living wage, and full citizenship of women.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; At the Women's Trade Union League, Nestor worked alongside prominent women labor leaders [[Mary Kenney O'Sullivan]], [[Jane Addams]], [[Mary McDowell]], [[Margaret Haley]], [[Helen Marot]], [[Florence Kelley]], and [[Sophonisba Breckinridge]], together they were able to lobby, organize, fundraise, and create the WTUL into an influential and transformative organization.&lt;ref name="Mcmillan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt;

The Women's Trade Union League seal exhibits the phrases "The Eight Hour Day," "A Living Wage," and "To Guard the Home," thereby conveying the message that the WTUL believed that in advocating for reduced work hours, and raising wages, women workers would be able to better attend domestic responsibilities at home.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt; They would come to work diligently to achieve the status they longed for displayed on their seal. For many years attempts were made by various labor groups to enact legislation to protect women workers from overlong working hours, from the dangers of unprotected machinery, and sweatshop conditions.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; The WTUL took action in composing a bill that would make the previous goals attainable, the bill called for an [[eight-hour day]]. They worked for three years gathering reports on conditions under which women were working, including unorganized women who did factory work in their own homes (these women had no standard wages, and payments ranged, the poorer the woman the worse the tragedies).&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; The reports were presented in the Women's Trade Union League's first exhibit, which was called "Exhibit of Dyanamic Sweatshops," they presented the eight-hour day bill as a health measure, because it was on those grounds that the Oregon ten-hour day was passed.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; The bill did not pass, Senator Jones suggested they exclude hotel and restaurant workers from the protection of the proposed law, and accept a ten-hour day, the WTUL refused to exclude any working women but did accept the ten-hour day, thus, in 1909 passed the Illinois ten-hour day (their proposed eight-hour day would be reached in 1937).&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; 
The topic of education for working women was just as crucial to the WTUL, they created an education program for working girls, in hopes of providing them with opportunities to explore cultural avenues which they had been denied from.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; In 1917, they worked out a plan with the Chicago Board of Education for the use of the classrooms of public schools (when they were not in use) to hold classes for the working women, Nestor particularly helped work out a course in the history of the trade-union movement.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; In 1918, Nestor joined a group organized by [[Samuel Gompers]] to travel on a Labor mission to [[Europe]], the purpose of the mission was to cultivate international relationships between labor groups in the United States and in Europe and to demonstrate the readiness to help war-stricken Europe and cooperate once [[World War I]] ended.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt;

When Nestor returned to Chicago, she formed the Cooperative Glove Association of Chicago in 1921 to compete against non-union shops, but it failed in 1925 because it could not compete effectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She became involved in politics, running unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for state legislature in 1928,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; serving on the Chicago Recreation Commission (1934), the Board of Trustees of Chicago's [[Century of Progress]] Exposition (1933-1934), and the Advisory Committee of the Chicago Planning Commission (1939).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She opposed the [[National Woman's Party]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], arguing that they would not protect working women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] would have effected both the WTUL and the IGWU financially, the latter suffered greater than the former.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt; Even with such setback, Nestor continued her work as a labor leader and spent a lot of time fundraising for the unions.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt; In the last decade of her life Nestor never retired, rather she spent her remaining years recruiting unorganized glove workers, and preventing the relaxation of labor laws during [[World War II]] &lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5944">'''American political development''' (often abbreviated as '''APD''') is a subfield of [[political science]] that studies the historical development of [[politics in the United States]]. In American political science departments, it is considered a subfield within [[American political science|American politics]] and is closely linked to [[historical institutionalism]].

Scholarship in American political development focuses on "the causes, nature, and consequences of key transformative periods and central patterns in American political history."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersh|first=Rogan|date=2005-01-01|title=The Growth of American Political Development: The View from the Classroom|jstor=3688034|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=3|issue=2|pages=335–345|doi=10.1017/s1537592705050243}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Orren]] and [[Stephen Skowronek]], co-founders of the subfield's [[Studies in American Political Development|flagship journal]], define American political development as the study of "durable shifts in governing authority" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Search-American-Political-Development/dp/0521547644|title=The Search for American Political Development|date=2004-05-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521547642|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subfield emerged within [[American political science]] in the 1980s, alongside a general renewal of work in [[historical institutionalism]], as an "insurgent movement" that sought to refocus attention on the study of historical American politics and to use such historical study to recast the study of contemporary political phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-21|chapter=Distinctiveness and Necessity of American Political Development |title=Oxford Handbook of American Political Development| editors=Richard M.

APD shares overlaps with the research agendas of [[comparative politics]] (particularly [[Comparative historical research|comparative historical analysis]]), [[historical sociology]], and [[political history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/research/department-strengths/american-political-development.html|title=American Political Development: Department of Political Science - Northwestern University|website=www.polisci.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholarship in APD differs from political history in that the former's "primary concerns are analytical, conceptual, and theoretical rather than historical."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-36|title=Qualitative Methods and American Political Development|last=Galvin|first=Daniel J.|date=2015-07-09|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.013.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodologically, the subfield tends to use within-case analysis and conduct causes-of-effects research (as opposed to effects-of-causes research).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Major journals in the subfield include the flagship journal ''[[Studies in American Political Development]]'', founded in 1986, and ''The Journal of Political History'', founded in 1989. As of 2005, the Politics and History section (founded in 1989) of the [[American Political Science Association]] was the eighth-largest in membership out of 35 total sections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/section24|title= MEMBERSHIP &gt; Organized Sections by Title &gt; Politics and History (Section 24)|website=American Political Science Association|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3898">An '''Aonach''' or '''Óenach''' was an ancient [[Ireland|Irish]] public national assembly called upon the death of a [[king]], [[Queen regnant|queen]], notable [[Wise old man|sage]] or [[warrior]] as part of [[ancestor worship]] practices.&lt;ref name="Nally2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=T. H. Nally|title=The Aonac Tailteann and the Tailteann Games Their History and Ancient Associations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SObPJ02EiwMC|accessdate=31 July 2012|date=30 June 2008|publisher=Jesson Press|isbn=978-1-4097-8189-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the entertainment, the óenach was an occasion on which kings and notables met under [[truce]] and where [[law]]s were pronounced and confirmed.

The Aonach had three functions; honoring the dead, proclaiming [[law]]s, and funeral games and festivities to entertain. The first function took between one and three days depending on the importance of the deceased, guests would sing mourning chants called the ''[[Guba (chant)|Guba]]'' after which [[druid]]s would improvise songs in memory of the dead called a ''[[Cepóg]]''. The dead would then be burnt on a [[funeral pyre]]. The second function would then be carried out by the [[Ollamh Érenn]], giving out laws to the people via bards and druids and culminating in the igniting of another massive fire. The custom of rejoicing after a funeral was then enshrined in the ''[[Cuiteach Fuait]]'', games of mental and physical ability accompanied by a large market for traders. 

The most notable fair, that held under the auspices of the [[High King of Ireland]] and the [[Uí Néill]], was the ''Óenach Tailten'' or "[[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]]", which is given [[prehistoric]] origins by medieval writers. This was held at [[Teltown]], in modern [[County Meath]], as late as 1770. The compilers of the [[Irish annals]] considered violence and disorders at this óenach, or the failure of the incumbent High King to hold the fair, to be of note. The [[Irish Free State]] held [[Tailteann Games (Irish Free State)|revivals of the Tailteann Games]] from 1924 to 1932. 

Other important assemblies included that of [[Tlachtga]], held on the [[Hill of Ward]] at [[Samhain]], that of [[Carman]], held in [[County Wexford]], that of [[Uisnech]], held at [[Beltane]] and that of Raigne in [[Kingdom of Ossory|Osraige]]. Not all had pagan calendrical associations. The ''Óenach Colmáin'', probably held at [[Lynally]], was named for Saint [[Elo Colman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2331">The concept of '''armed violence reduction (AVR)''' has gained significant in importance after the [[Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development|2006 Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development]]. According to [[OECD]], more than 740,000 people die each year as a result of the violence associated with [[armed conflict]]s and large- and small-scale [[criminality]]. Furthermore, armed violence impedes humanitarian and socio-economic development and, hence, it is an obstruction to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDG)]].

== Key numbers on armed violence from the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development ==

* More than 740,000 people have died directly or indirectly from armed violence - both conflict and [[violent crime|criminal violence]] - every year in recent years.
* More than 540,000 of these deaths are violent, with the vast majority occurring in non-conflict settings.
* At least 200,000 people - and perhaps many thousands more - have died each year in conflict zones from non-violent causes (such as [[malnutrition]], [[dysentery]], or other easily preventable diseases) that resulted from the effects of war on populations.
* Between 2004 and 2007, at least 208,300 violent deaths were recorded in armed conflicts - an average of 52,000 people killed per year. This is a conservative estimate including only recorded deaths: the real total may be much higher.
* The annual economic cost of armed violence in non-conflict settings, in terms of lost [[productivity]] due to violent deaths, is [[USD]] 95 billion and could reach as high as USD 163 billion - 0.14 percent of the annual [[global GDP|global]] [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Declaration key numbers: http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Geneva-Declaration-Millennium-Development-Goals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed violence reduction is therefore essential for the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;ɡ&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life''' is a [[research centre]] on the [[University of Alberta]]'s [[Augustana University College|Augustana Campus]] in [[Camrose, Alberta]]. It is the first such centre in a public university in Canada to focus on the intersection of religion and public life.

==Background==
The Ronning Centre is named in for [[Chester Alvin Ronning]], Canadian diplomat and principal of Camrose Lutheran College from 1927 to 1942. The Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life grew from the merger of [[Augustana University College]] with the [[University of Alberta]] in 2004. The Centre's activities involve a diversity of communities. It seeks to enhance debate on contested issues through lively discussion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.augustana.ualberta.ca/research/centres/ronningcentre/aboutus/ University of Alberta, Augustana Campus,

'''Conflict transformation''' is a concept designed to reframe the way in which [[peacebuilding]] initiatives are discussed and pursued, particularly in contexts of [[ethnic conflict]]. Traditionally the emphasis has been on [[conflict resolution]] and [[conflict management]] methods, which focus on reducing or defusing outbreaks of hostility.  '''Conflict transformation''', in contrast, places a greater weight on addressing the underlying conditions which give rise to that conflict, preferably well in advance of any hostility, but also to ensure a [[sustainable]] peace. In other terms, it attempts to make explicit and then reshape the social structures and dynamics behind the conflict, often employing analytical tools borrowed from [[systems thinking]]. "The very structure of parties and relationships may be embedded in a pattern of conflictual relationships that extend beyond the particular site of conflict. Conflict transformation is therefore a process of engaging with and transforming the relationships, interests, discourses and, if necessary, the very constitution of society that supports the continuation of violent conflict".&lt;ref name="Miall"&gt;Hugh Miall (2004) [http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Handbook/Articles/miall_handbook.pdf Conflict Transformation: A Multi-Dimensional Task], Berghof Handbook for Conflict Transformation, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches, definitions==
Conflict transformation approaches differ from those of [[conflict management]] or [[conflict resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Books/Book_Glossary_Chapters_en/berghof_glossary_2012_02_conflict_prevention_management_resolution.pdf Berghof Glossary, Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution] on [http://www.berghof-foundation.org Berghof Foundation's] web&lt;/ref&gt;
Whereas conflict transformation involves transforming the relationships that support violence, conflict management approaches seek to merely manage and contain conflict, and conflict resolution approaches seek to move conflict parties away from [[zero-sum]] positions towards positive outcomes, often with the help of external actors.&lt;ref name="Miall"/&gt;

Conflict transformation theory and practice are often associated with the academics and practitioners [[Johan Galtung]] and [[John Paul Lederach]].
&lt;!--sources by name, further (organizations, institutions) following after Galtung (and Lederach, to be added yet)--&gt;
According to [[Johan Galtung]]'s ''[[Transcend Method]]'' conflict transformation theory and practice, and process/es, comprise:&lt;ref name=galtung-un-2000-p10&gt;[[Johan Galtung]]: ''The Transcend Method at a glance: a one-page version'' (page 5) in: [https://www.transcend.org/pctrcluj2004/TRANSCEND_manual.pdf ''Conflict Transformation by Peaceful Means (the Transcend Method) – Participants'/Trainers' Manual''], United Nations 2000 (at [https://www.transcend.org/ transcend.org])&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflict [i.e. conflict transformation] worker has the third role as Preserver, transforming the conflict by avoiding violence, promoting development.''
# ''following [[Buddhist]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Codependent origination, everything grows together in mutual causation. Conflicts have no beginning and no end, we all share the responsibility; no single actor (like statesmen) carries all the responsibility (monopoly) and no single actor carries all the guilt.''
# ''following [[Christian]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Ultimately, the responsibility for conflict transformation lies with individuals and their individual responsibility and decisions to act so as to promote peace rather than violence, and the principle of hope.''
# ''following [[Daoist]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Everything is yin and yang, good and bad, there is the high likelihood that the action chosen also has negative consequences and that action not chosen may have positive consequences; hence the need for reversibility, only doing what can be undone.''
# ''following [[Islamic]] thought...&lt;br&gt;The strength deriving from submitting together to a common goal, including the concrete responsibility for the well-being of all.''
# ''following [[Judaic]] thought...&lt;br&gt;The truth lies less in a verbal formula than in the dialogue to arrive at the formula, and that dialogue has no beginning and no end.''
}}

According to [[Berghof Foundation]], conflict transformation means:
:: ''A generic, comprehensive term referring to actions and processes seeking to alter the various characteristics and manifestations of violent conflict by addressing the root causes of a particular conflict over the long term. It aims to transform negative destructive conflict into positive constructive conflict and deals with structural, behavioural and attitudinal aspects of conflict. The term refers to both the process and the completion of the process. As such, it incorporates the activities of processes such as conflict prevention and conflict resolution and goes farther than conflict settlement or conflict management.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Handbook/Articles/handbook_glossary.pdf The Berghof Handbook Glossary] &gt; [http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Books/Book_Glossary_Chapters_en/berghof_glossary_2012_03_conflict_transformation.pdf expanded into the Berghof Glossary, Conflict Transformation] on [http://www.berghof-foundation.org Berghof Foundation's] web&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Institute for Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding]] (ICP), conflict transformation means:
:: ''Conflict transformation, in contrast to conflict resolution, does not only seek to resolve the contradiction in a conflict setting. It also aims at addressing structural and social root causes by challenging injustices and restoring human relations and it deals with ethnical and value-based dimensions. Conflict transformation is not only an approach or a tool but primarily a mindset. Conflict transformation, according to our 3 Cs approach, needs to be comprehensive, compassionate and creative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 ''ICP: About Conflict Transformation &amp; Peacebuilding''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150209195513/http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 |date=2015-02-09 }} at ICP web [http://www.iicp.ch/ iicp.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;''

According to [[Search for Common Ground]] conflict transformation initiatives are often characterized by longtime horizons and interventions at multiple levels, aimed at changing perceptions and improving communications skills addressing the roots of conflict, including inequality and social injustice.&lt;ref name="SFCG"&gt;SFCG (no date) [http://www.sfcg.org/resources/resources_terms.html Commonly Used Terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829005441/http://www.sfcg.org/resources/resources_terms.html |date=2009-08-29 }}, Search for Common Ground&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Principles of Conflict Transformation'', by [[TransConflict]], specify further in order to help with defining conflict transformation:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
:* ''Conflict should not be regarded as an isolated event that can be resolved or managed, but as an integral part of society’s on-going evolution and development;''
:* ''Conflict should not be understood solely as an inherently negative and destructive occurrence, but rather as a potentially positive and productive force for change if harnessed constructively;''
:* ''Conflict transformation goes beyond merely seeking to contain and manage conflict, instead seeking to transform the root causes of a particular conflict;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is a long-term, gradual and complex process, requiring sustained engagement and interaction;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is not just an approach and set of techniques, but a way of thinking about and understanding conflict itself;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is particularly intended for intractable conflicts, where deep-rooted issues fuel protracted violence;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ref name="TransConflict"&gt;[http://www.transconflict.com/advocate/global-coalition-for-conflict-transformation/principles-of-conflict-transformation/ Principles of Conflict Transformation], TransConflict&lt;/ref&gt;''...continued by some ten more...''

'''Devendrar Jayanthi''' is a festival celebrated annually on 11 September. It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of [[Immanuvel Devendrar]], a freedom fighter and [[Indian National Congress]] leader who took part in the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]] during the [[British Raj]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-immanuel-sekaran-brave-dalit-leader-who-lost-his-life-savarna-brutality-49168|title=Thiyagi Immanuel Sekaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the [[Indian Army]] in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of [[Pallar]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Immanuel Sekaran an Icon of depressed class}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of chief minister [[K. Kamaraj]].

==Political background==
[[File:Devendrar_Jayanthi_in_Paramakudi.jpg|thumb|200px|Gathering at Immanuel sekaran memorial on Devendrar jayanthi]]

Immanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]], and opposed by the [[Forward Block]], which was itself favoured by the [[Maravar]] community. The two sides clashed during elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/immanuel-sekaran-in-the-vanguard-of-dalit-struggle/article2443838.ece|title=Caste riots of South Tamilnadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence erupted notably in the districts of [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramanathapuram]] and [[Madurai district|Madurai]] which claimed over 40 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1522/15220360.htm|title=Series of violence that shooked the south}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Devendrar jayanthi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Two-month-ban-issued-in-Ramanathapuram-district/articleshow/42094253.cms|title=Law and Order problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2820/stories/20111007282012800.htm|title=Paramakudi police firing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/dalit-leader-immanuel-death-anniversary-passes-off-peacefully/other/news/620462.html|title=Immanuel devendrar remebrance day passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics claim that political parties used them as a form of [[vote bank]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/politics/tamil-nadu-caste-realities-unlikely-to-change-any-time-soon|title=Caste reality of Tamilnadu politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikatan.com/news/tamilnadu/10365.art|title=Immanueal Sekaran jayanthi celebrations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/freedom+fighter+dalit+icon+remembering+tamil+nadu+s+immanuel+sekaran-newsid-57791528|title=Sekaran jayanthi passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''digital citizen''' refers to a person utilizing [[information technology]] (IT) in order to engage in society, politics and government. K. Mossberger, et al.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Mossberger, Karen. "Digital Citizenship - The Internet, Society &amp; Participation" By Karen Mossberger, Caroline J. Tolbert, and Ramona S. McNeal." 23 Nov. 2011. {{ISBN|978-0819456069}}&lt;/ref&gt; define digital citizens as "those who use the Internet regularly and effectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The 19th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering|isbn=978-3-642-37270-4|page=742|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7fNHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA742&amp;lpg=PA742&amp;dq=those+who+use+the+Internet+regularly+and+effectively|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ohler|first1=Jason B.|title=Digital Community, Digital Citizen|isbn=978-1412971447|page=25|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=1E2rbEXBg3gC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=those+who+use+the+Internet+regularly+and+effectively|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital citizens understand digital citizenship, which is the appropriate use of technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

People characterizing themselves as digital citizens often use IT extensively, creating [[blogs]], using [[social networks]], and participating in [[Digital journalism|online journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/4678631.stm|title=Have Your Say - Are you a digital citizen?|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although digital citizenship potentially begins when any child, teen, and/or adult signs up for an email address, posts pictures online, uses [[e-commerce]] to buy merchandise online, and/or participates in ''any'' electronic function that is [[B2C]] or [[Business-to-business|B2B]], the process of becoming a digital citizen goes beyond simple Internet activity. In the framework of T.H. Marshall's perspective on citizenship's three traditions (liberalism, republicanism, and ascriptive hierarchy), digital citizenry can occur alongside the promotion of equal economic opportunity, as well as increased political participation and civic duty.&lt;ref&gt;8.	Marshall, T. H. 1992. The Problem Stated with the Assistance of Alfred Marshall [originally delivered in 1949]. In Citizenship and Social Class, T. H. Marshall and T. Bottomore, 3–51. London: Pluto Perspectives.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital technology can lower the [[barriers to entry]] for participation as a citizen within society.

Highly developed states possess the capacity to link their respective governments with digital sites. Such sites function in ways such as illuminating recent legislation, educating current and future policy objectives, lending agency toward political candidates, and/or allowing citizens to voice themselves in a political way. Likewise, the generation of these sites has been linked to increased voting advocacy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Lack of access toward becoming a digital citizen can be a serious drawback, since many elementary procedures such as tax report filing, birth registration, and use of Web sites to support candidates in political campaigns ([[E-democracy]]) etc. have been transferred to only be available via the [[Internet]]. Furthermore, many cultural and commercial entities only publicize information on [[web pages]]. Non-digital citizens will not be able to retrieve this information and this may lead to social isolation or economic stagnation. The gap between digital citizens and non-digital citizens is often referred to as the [[digital divide]]. Currently, the digital divide is a subject of academic debate as access to the Internet has increased, but the place in which the Internet is accessed (work, home, public library, etc.) has a significant effect on how such access will be utilized, if even in a manner related to citizenry. Recent scholarship has correlated the desire to be technologically proficient with greater belief in computer access equity, and thus, digital citizenship (Shelley, et al.).

In [[developing countries]] digital citizens are more sparse. They consist of the people in such countries who utilize technology to overcome their localized obstacles including development issues, corruption, and even military conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/gear/2005-08-28-cell-banks-africa_x.htm|title=Africa's cell phone boom creates a base for low-cost banking|work=usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such citizens include users of [[Ushahidi]] during the [[2007–08 Kenyan crisis|2007 disputed Kenyan election]], and protesters in the [[Arab Spring]] movements who used media to document repression of protests.

==Participation==
The development of digital citizen participation can be divided into two main stages: information dissemination and citizen [[deliberation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080710184539/http://www.businessofgovernment.org/pdfs/HolzerReport.pdf Restoring Trust in Government: The Potential of Digital Citizen Participation]&lt;/ref&gt; Digital citizenship, or the ability to participate in society online, promotes social inclusion. Digital Citizenship examines three aspects of participation in society online: economic opportunity, democratic participation and inclusion in prevailing forms of communication.

==Engagement of youth==

A recent survey revealed that teenagers and young adults spend more time on the Internet than watching TV.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.forbes.com/technology/newswire/2003/07/24/rtr1037488.html Youth Spend More Time on Web than TV:Study]", ''Reuters'', 24 July 2003, Retrieved 4 Dec. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This has raised a number of concerns about how Internet use could impact cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mills |first1=Kathryn |title=Possible Effects of Internet Use on Cognitive Development in Adolescence |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=3 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i3.516 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/516}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by Wartella et al., the first of its kind, teens are concerned about how digital technologies may have an impact on their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wartella |first1=Ellen |last2=Rideout |first2=Vicky |last3=Montague |first3=Heather |last4=Beaudoin-Ryan |first4=Leanne |last5=Lauricella |first5=Alexis |title=Teens, Health and Technology: A National Survey |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=3 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i3.515 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/515}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Digital youth can be generally viewed as the test market for the next generation's digital content and services. Sites such as [[Myspace]] and [[Facebook]] have come to the fore in sites where youth participate and engage with others on the Internet. However, due to the lack of popularity with MySpace in particular, more young people are turning to websites such as SnapChat, Instagram, and YouTube. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/03/health/teens-tweens-media-screen-use-report/|title=Teens spend 9 hours a day using media, report says  - CNN|last=CNN|first=Kelly Wallace,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in 2015, it was reported that teenagers spend up to 9 hours a day on the internet, with the vast majority of that time being spent on social media websites from mobile devices, contributing to the ease of access and availability to young people. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialmediatoday.com/marketing/how-much-time-do-people-spend-social-media-infographic|title=How Much Time Do People Spend on Social Media? [Infographic]|work=Social Media Today|access-date=2018-02-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;Vast amounts of money are spent annually to research the demographic by hiring psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists in order to discover habits, values and fields of interest&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.wrlc.org/bitstream/1961/4649/1/youthreport.pdf Youth as E-Citizens: Engaging the Digital Generation]&lt;/ref&gt;
Particularly in the United States, "Social media use has become so pervasive in the lives of American teens that having a presence on a social network is almost synonymous with being online; 95% of all teens ages 12-17 are now online and 80% of those online teens are users of social media sites".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pewinternet.org/2011/11/09/teens-kindness-and-cruelty-on-social-network-sites/ How American Teens Navigate the New World of 'digital Citizenship']". Pew Research Center's Internet &amp; American Life Project. Web. 23 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, movements such as these appear to benefit strictly those wishing to advocate for their business towards youth. The critical time when young people are developing their civic identities is between the ages 15–22. During this time they develop three attributes: civic literacy, civic skills and civic attachment that comprise [[civic engagement]] later reflected in political actions of their adult lives.&lt;ref&gt;Delli Carpini, The Youth Engagement Initiative Strategy Paper, 10
Educational leaders today are preparing the educational system "American education from pre-K to 12 and beyond to better prepare students to thrive in the global economy." Today's youth needs to be exposed and  prepared for the world they will be living in.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1568480,00.html|title=How to Bring Our Schools Out of the 20th Century|date=10 December 2006|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An open Internet as delegated by a state's government is necessary to instill a sense of trust, legitimacy, and participation in the state's citizenry. [[WikiLeaks]] represents an occurrence where particular political actors have criticized and taken citizen action toward revealing the government's unnecessary clandestine activity online. "The benefit of transparency isn't just catching red-handed bastards. It's also about collaborating and coming together with a more engaged citizenry."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ottawacitizen.com/health/Internet+pushing+governments+more+open+digital+expert+says/5736026/story.html &lt;!-- |accessdate=November 24, 2011  --&gt;]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Internet is a reading-intensive medium that may challenge full access and participation to youth. For youth to fully participate and realize their presence on the Internet, a quality level of reading comprehension is required. "The average government Web site, for examples, requires an eleventh-grade level of reading comprehension, even though about half of the U.S. population reads at an eighth-grade level or lower".&lt;ref&gt;7. Mossberger, Karen. "Digital Citizenship - The Internet, Society and Participation" By Karen Mossberger, Caroline J. Tolbert, and Ramona S. McNeal." 23 Nov. 2011. {{ISBN|978-0819456069}}&lt;/ref&gt; So despite the Internet being a place irrespective of certain factors such as race, religion, and class, education plays a large part in a person's capacity to present themselves online in a formal manner conducive towards their citizenry. Concurrently, education also affects people's motivation to participate online.

Students in school should be encouraged to utilize technology with responsibility and Ethical Digital Citizenship strongly promoted. Education on harmful viruses, Trojans, and worms must be emphasized to protect resources. A student can be a successful Digital Citizen with the help of educators, parents, and school counselors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_tech/responsible-student-technology-use.shtml|title=Help Kids Become Responsible Digital Citizens|publisher=educationworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits on the use of data==
International [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Guidelines state that "personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used, and to the extent necessary for those purposes should be accurate, complete, and kept up to date". Also Article 8 prevents subjects to certain exceptions. Meaning that certain things cannot be published online revealing race, ethnicity, religion, political stance, health, and sex life. This is enforced generally by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC)- but very generally. For example, the FTC did bring an action against Microsoft for preventing to properly protect their customers' personal information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Digital-Person/text/Digital-Person-CH1.pdf The Digital Person - Technology and Privacy in the Information Age - Chapter 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTC does play a significant role in protecting the digital citizen. However, individuals' public records are increasingly useful to the government and highly sought after. This is because this material can help the government detect a variety of crime such as fraud, drug distribution rings, terrorist cells, and so forth. This allows for an easier ability to properly profile a suspected criminal and keep an eye on them . Although there are a variety of ways to gather information on an individual through credit card history, employment history, and so on- the internet is becoming the most desirable information gatherer. The two aspects that have caused the internet to be a greater collector of information is the façade of security and amount of information that can be stored on the internet. [[Internet anonymity|Anonymity]] is proven to be very rare online as [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s can keep track of an individual, account information, web surfing durations, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Digital-Person/text/Digital-Person-CH9.pdf The Digital Person - Technology and Privacy in the Information Age - Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The nine elements of digital citizenship==
According to digitalcitizenship.net, the nine elements (or themes) of digital citizenship are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html Nine Themes of Digital Citizenship], digitalcitizenship.net&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Digital access''': This is perhaps one of the most fundamental blocks to being a digital citizen. However, due to socioeconomic status, location, and other disabilities- some individuals may not have digital access. Recently, schools have been becoming more connected with the internet, often offering computers, and other forms of access. This can be offered through kiosks, community centers, and open labs. This most often is associated with the digital divide and factors associated with such.  Digital access is available in many remote countries via cyber cafés and small coffee shops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iste.org/docs/excerpts/DIGCI2-excerpt.pdf Digital Citizenship in Schools - Excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Digital commerce''': This is the ability for users to recognize that much of the economy is regulated online. It also deals with the understanding of the dangers and benefits of online buying, using credit cards online, and so forth. As with the advantages and legal activities- there is also dangerous activities such as illegal downloads, gambling, drug deals, pornography, plagiarism, and so forth. 
#'''Digital communication''': This element deals with understanding the variety of online communication mediums such as email, instant messaging, Facebook messenger, the variety of apps, and so forth. There is a standard of etiquette associated with each medium.
#'''[[Digital literacy]]''': This deals with the understanding of how to use various digital devices. For example, how to properly search for something on a search engine versus a database. How to use various online logs. Oftentimes many educational institutions will help form an individual's digital literacy.
#'''Digital etiquette''': As discussed in the third element, digital communication, this is the expectation that various mediums require a variety of etiquette. Certain mediums demand more appropriate behavior and language than others.
#'''Digital law''': This is where enforcement occurs for illegal downloads, plagiarizing, hacking, creating viruses, sending spams, identity theft, cyberbullying, and so forth. 
#'''Digital rights and responsibilities''': This is the set of rights digital citizens have such as privacy, speech, and so forth. 
#'''Digital health''': Digital citizens must be aware of the physical stress placed on their bodies by internet usage. They must be aware to not become overly dependent on the internet causing eye strain, headaches, stress problems, and so on.
#'''Digital security''': This simply means that citizens must take measures to be safe by practicing using difficult passwords, virus protection, backing up data, and so forth.

==The Three Principles of Digital Citizenship==
Digital Citizenship is a term used to define the appropriate and responsible use of [[technology]] among users.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.virtuallibrary.info/digital-citizenship.html|title=Digital Citizenship|website=Virtual Library|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three principles were developed by Mark Ribble to teach digital users how to responsibly use technology to become a digital citizen. The three principles include: respect, educate, and protect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iste.org/explore/articleDetail?articleid=535|title=Digital citizenship is more important than ever|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each principle contains three of the nine elements of digital citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html|title=Nine Elements|website=Digital Citizenship|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Respect:''' the elements of etiquette, access, and law are used to respect other digital users.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# '''Educate:''' the elements of literacy, communication, and commerce are used to learn about the appropriate use of the digital world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# '''Protect:''' the elements of rights and responsibilities, security, and health and wellness are used to remain safe in the digital and non-digital world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

==The Overlapping Goals of Digital Citizenship Education==
According to DigCit.us, the overlapping goals of digital citizenship education include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://digcit.us/ About Digital Citizenship Conversations], digcit.us&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Digital Footprint'''
#'''Digital Literacy'''
#'''Information Literacy'''
#'''Copyright, Intellectual Property Respect, Attribution'''
#'''Health and Wellness'''
#'''Empowering Student Voice, Agency, Advocacy'''
#'''Safety, Security and Privacy'''
#'''Character Education and Ethics'''
#'''Parenting'''

'''Discourse of renewal''' is a theory in [[crisis communication]] that seeks to establish and emphasize "learning from the crisis, ethical communication, communication that is prospective in nature, and effective organizational rhetoric.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/855491795|title=Effective crisis communication : moving from crisis to opportunity|last=1969-|first=Ulmer, Robert R.,|others=Sellnow, Timothy L. (Timothy Lester), 1960-, Seeger, Matthew W. (Matthew Wayne), 1957-|isbn=9781452257518|edition=Third|location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=855491795}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a prospective approach, Lippett established the organizational renewal theory that would lead organizations “to higher stages progressively and to preclude a decline toward a lower stage”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7734089|title=Organization renewal : a holistic approach to organization development|last=L.|first=Lippitt, Gordon|date=1982|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=9780136418450|edition=2nd|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|oclc=7734089}}&lt;/ref&gt; of organizational recovery. With the application of discourse of renewal practices, organizations and communities “can consider developing a crisis plan and, more important, build their crisis communication skills over time”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Components of Renewal Discourse ==
Multiple stages exist within the discourse of renewal framework. Each of these different stages contain core components that provide an expectation for what an organization should achieve within each stage and provides suggestions for how the organization should progress through each stage. The four significant stages for the discourse of renewal framework are: organizational learning, ethical communication, a prospective rather than retrospective vision, and sound organizational rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/191697380|title=Handbook of risk and crisis communication|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|others=Heath, Robert L. (Robert Lawrence), 1941-, O'Hair, Dan.|isbn=9780805857788|location=New York|oclc=191697380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning ===
Organizational learning requires the organization as a whole to take account of a crisis situation and consider what caused the crisis to occur and consider how it should have been handled. Crises often make the weak parts of an organization or an organization’s response plans visible. This visibility allows these vulnerabilities to be examined and remedied in order to prevent similar failures from occurring in future crisis situations

=== Ethical communication ===
When responding to a crisis, organizations need to be honest, moral, and ethical in addressing the public and stakeholders regarding the status of the crisis and the information they know regarding its causes and consequences. If an organization engaged in unethical behavior prior to a crisis, “those lapses are eventually revealed during and after the crisis”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828737001|title=Theorizing crisis communication|last=1960-|first=Sellnow, Timothy L. (Timothy Lester),|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Seeger, Matthew W. (Matthew Wayne), 1957-|isbn=9780470659304|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=828737001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an unethical organization attempts to re-emerge after a crisis, full recovery of the organization becomes difficult because of the unethical acts committed previously.

=== Prospective versus retrospective vision ===
In order for an organization to recover, actions taken by the organization throughout the recovery process must be forward-looking and address the faults the organization faced. With consideration to the type of crisis, “issues of responsibility, harm, victimage, and blame may be subordinate to a more optimistic discourse that emphasizes moving beyond the crisis, focusing on strong value positions, responsibility to stakeholders, and growth as a result of the crisis”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ulmer|first=Robert R.|last2=Sellnow|first2=Timothy L.|title=Crisis management and the discourse of renewal: understanding the potential for positive outcomes of crisis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0363811102001650|journal=Public Relations Review|volume=28|issue=4|pages=361–365|doi=10.1016/s0363-8111(02)00165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movement to post-crisis and recovery stages suggests “organizations committed to renewal direct their messages toward the ultimate goal of rebuilding the organization so that it is more resilient to crisis, cleanly focuses on values of social responsibility, and more attentive to stakeholder needs”.

=== Effective organizational rhetoric ===
Organizations in crisis must communicate with the public and with stakeholders who are affected by that crisis. By interacting with these groups positively and expressing messages with a prospective outlook, organizational leaders can express confidence regarding the organization’s ability to overcome the crisis. In order for this confidence to be received by these audiences, organizational leaders must “frame the crisis in a way that inspires, empowers, and motivates”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the public and stakeholders regarding the future of the organization. The language and information presented by organizational leaders possesses the ability to comfort impacted stakeholders when messages are delivered positively; however, negative deliveries can instill concern in the public and stakeholders. A lack of confidence from the public and stakeholders due to the information they received can drastically impact the outcome of an organization’s renewal efforts as well as the relationship the organization has with future stakeholders in the post-crisis stage.

== Purpose ==
The discourse of renewal framework directs organizations to consider how to plan for a crisis and negotiate a crisis when they experience one. A major challenge organizations face when planning for a crisis or when they are attempting to manage a crisis situation is the image they convey throughout the recovery and the overall implications of a crisis. It is important that an organization seizes the opportunity to  situate the minds of the public and of stakeholders regarding what the crisis means for that organization. A prospective outlook and a plan for direct, honest, and informative communication and recovery allows organizations to establish a positive reputation when responding to a crisis. By engaging in positive discourse and acknowledging the problems they are facing, to the public and the stakeholders, an organization can plan for how to proceed in the post-crisis stage.

'''Edward Vivian Dearman Birchall'''  (10 August 1884 – 10 August 1916&lt;ref name=Laybourn /&gt;), was an English [[philanthropist]] who died of wounds at the [[Battle of the Somme]]. He left a legacy of £1000 for the promotion of voluntary services. The money was used to help create, in 1919, the National Council of Social Services. It later became the [[National Council for Voluntary Organisations]], an umbrella body for charities in England.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://thirdforcenews.org.uk/tfn-news/soldiers-legacy-lives-on-through-a-century-of-voluntary-action | title=Soldier’s legacy lives on through a century of voluntary action | work=Third Force News | date=5 August 2014 | accessdate=1 July 2015 | author=Smith, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ella Alexander Boole''' (July 26, 1858 &amp;ndash; March 13, 1952) was an [[United States|American]] [[temperance movement|temperance]] leader and social reformer. She served as head of the world's [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) from 1931 to 1947,&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; after serving as head of the United States' national WCTU.

==Biography==
She was born as '''Ella Alexander''' on July 26, 1858 in [[Van Wert, Ohio]]. Boole's father was a prominent lawyer, who edited a [[free soil]] newspaper and supported reforms during [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] following the Civil War. She attended public schools in Van Wert, then the [[College of Wooster]] where she studied classics. She had an aptitude for natural science and developed skills in public speaking. She received an A.B. degree (1878), followed by an A.M. degree (1881).&lt;ref name="Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green 1980 91"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sicherman, Barbara |author2=Carol Hurd Green|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period|year=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674627338|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married Reverend [[William H. Boole]] of the [[Willet Street Methodist Church]] on July 3, 1883. Her husband died in 1896 and she became a deaconess in his church.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=William H.

Boole, D.D., a prominent clergyman of the Methodist Episcopal Church and widely known as a temperance lecturer and evangelist, died at 1 o'clock yesterday morning at his Home, Prohibition Park, Staten Island.

==Political activities==

===Women's Christian Temperance Union===
Boole's husband was active in [[prohibition]] and [[temperance movement|temperance]] activities, in which she joined him. Boole joined the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) in 1883. She showed great skill as an organizer of new unions, and became vice-president of the New York state union in 1891. After the death of Boole's husband, she was able to support her family through an inheritance from her father and income from her speaking engagements and temperance activities. In 1898, she became president of the New York WCTU. She held this position until 1925, with the exception of a six-year period when she was corresponding secretary of the [[Woman's Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church]] (1903-1909). One of her key activities was in shifting WCTU work away from its emphasis on collecting petitions, and towards direct lobbying of legislators.&lt;ref name="Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green 1980 91"/&gt;

===Political activities===
[[File:Ella A. Boole portrait.jpg|thumb|Boole between 1915 and 1920]]
Following the enfranchisement of women in the United States, Boole decided to run for office herself. In [[New York state election, 1920|1920]], she unsuccessfully challenged [[James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr.]] for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination for the [[United States Senate]]. After losing the nomination, she ran as a candidate for the [[Prohibition Party]] against Wadsworth and the Democratic and Socialist Party candidates in the general election. Wadsworth won easily with 52% of the vote, while Boole came in third place with 7% of the vote, not far ahead of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Her other causes included supporting legislative changes to bring about social reform, including laws to protect the rights of women and children in industry, the establishment of separate courts and deputies for juvenile offenders, and [[woman suffrage]]. As President of the International WCTU, she promoted disarmament, the end of the international illicit drug trade, and supported international women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sicherman, Barbara |author2=Carol Hurd Green|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period|year=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674627338|pages=91–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8246">{{nihongo|'''Ero guro nansensu''', frequently shortened to '''ero guro''' or just '''guro''', |エログロ|ero-guro}} is a literary and artistic movement originating c. 1930 in Japan.&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;Silverberg, Miriam Rom. “By Way of a Preface: Defining ''Erotic Grotesque Nonsense''”. Galley copy of the preface for ''Erotic Grotesque Nonsense: The Mass Culture of Japanese Modern Times''. December 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Ero guro puts its focus on eroticism, sexual corruption, and decadence.&lt;ref name="ucla" /&gt; While ero guro is a specific movement, many of its components can be found throughout Japanese history and culture.

The term itself is an example of ''[[wasei-eigo]]'', a Japanese combination of English words or abbreviated words: ''ero'' from "ero(tic)", ''guro'' from "gro(tesque)", and ''nansensu'' from "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=William J.|title=Introduction: making sense of ''nansensu''|journal=Japan Forum|date=27 Apr 2009|volume=21|issue=1 (Special Issue: URBAN NONSENSE)|pages=1–10|doi=10.1080/09555800902856932|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09555800902856932|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In actuality the "grotesqueness" implied in the term refers to things that are malformed, unnatural, or horrific.&lt;ref name="ucla" /&gt; Items that are pornographic and bloody are not necessarily ''ero guro'', and vice versa. The term is often used incorrectly by western audiences to mean "[[Graphic violence|gore]]"—depictions of horror, blood, and guts.

==History==
Ero guro nansensu, characterized as a "prewar, bourgeois cultural phenomenon that devoted itself to explorations of the deviant, the bizarre, and the ridiculous,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reichert | first = Jim | title = Deviance and Social Darwinism in Edogawa Ranpo's Erotic-Grotesque Thriller Koto no Ōni | journal = Journal of Japanese Studies | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages =113–114 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.2307/3591938 | author2 = Reichert, Jim | publisher = Journal of Japanese Studies, Vol. 27, No. 1 | jstor = 3591938}}&lt;/ref&gt; manifested in the popular culture of [[Taishō period|Taishō]] Tokyo during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Buruma"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ian Buruma|last=Buruma|first=Ian|title=Inventing Japan, 1853–1964|pages=67–68|year=2003|publisher=The Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=0-679-64085-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Ian Buruma]] describes the social atmosphere of the time as "a skittish, sometimes nihilistic hedonism that brings [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] Berlin to mind."&lt;ref name="Buruma"/&gt; Its roots go back to artists such as Tsukioka [[Yoshitoshi]], who, besides erotic [[Shunga (art)|shunga]], also produced woodblock prints showing decapitations and acts of violence from Japanese history. [[Ukiyo-e]] artists such as [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] presented similar themes with bondage, rape and erotic [[crucifixion]].

Ero guro's first distinct appearance began in 1920s and 1930s [[Japanese literature]]. The [[Sada Abe|Sada Abe Incident]] of 1936, where a woman [[Erotic asphyxiation|strangled]] her lover to death and [[castration|castrated]] his corpse, struck a chord with the ero guro movement and came to represent that genre for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston|first=William|title=Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-13052-X|pages=11, 114, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other like activities and movements were generally suppressed in Japan during [[World War II]], but re-emerged in the postwar period, especially in [[manga]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;McLelland, Mark. [http://wwwsshe.murdoch.edu.au/intersections/issue12/mclelland.html "A Short History of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Hentai''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the ero guro movement's influence expanded into parts of Japanese [[Theatre of Japan|theatre]], [[Japanese art|art]], [[manga]], and eventually into film and music.

==Later influences==
Ero guro is also an element of many [[Japanese horror]] films and ''[[Pink film|pinku eiga]]'', particularly of the 1960s and 1970s. Examples include [[Teruo Ishii]]'s ''[[Shogun's Joys of Torture]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]) and ''[[Horrors of Malformed Men]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]) and [[Yasuzo Masumura]]'s ''[[Blind Beast]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]), the latter two based on the works of [[Edogawa Rampo]]. A more recent example of ero guro in cinema is [[Sion Sono]]'s ''[[Strange Circus]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]).

There are modern guro artists, some of whom cite Erotic Grotesque Nonsense as an influence on their work. These artists explore the macabre intermingled with sexual overtones. Often the erotic element, even when not explicit, is merged with grotesque themes and features similar to the works of [[H. R. Giger]]. Others produce ero guro as a genre of [[Japanese pornography]] and [[hentai]] involving [[blood]], [[Disembowelment|gore]], [[disfiguration]], [[violence]], [[Body integrity identity disorder|mutilation]], [[Urolagnia|urine]], [[Klismaphilia|enemas]], or [[Coprophilia|feces]].

Well-known guro [[Mangaka|manga artists]] include [[Suehiro Maruo]], [[Hajime Yamano]], [[Jun Hayami]], [[Go Nagai]], [[Shintaro Kago]], [[Toshio Maeda]], [[Henmaru Machino]], [[Yamamoto Takato]], [[Horihone Saizō]], and [[Waita Uziga]].

The modern genre of [[Tentacle erotica|tentacle rape]] began within the category of ero guro (although it has much older roots in Japanese art; see ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife|Octopi and shell diver]]'') but became so popular that it is now usually considered separately.

==In music==
Some [[visual kei]] bands have a concept or theme relating to ero guro, most notably [[Cali Gari]].&lt;ref name="bounce.com"&gt;[http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/2/ Bounce ''Di(s)ctionary Number 13—Visual Kei''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173324/http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/2/ |date=June 16, 2008 }}. Retrieved November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western visual kei fans assumed their theme was a subgenre of visual kei and linked it with other similar bands.

The 2014 [[Flying Lotus]] album ''[[You're Dead!]]'' prominently featured ero guro artwork from Japanese manga artist [[Shintaro Kago]] on the cover and inner sleeve, with further art being utilised in the accompanying live show. Much of the drawings featured men and women being disfigured and mutilated in unrealistic, hi-tech ways with a significant amount of gore and nudity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21002">'''Ethnoscience''' has been defined as an attempt "to reconstitute what serves as science for others, their practices of looking after themselves and their bodies, their botanical knowledge, but also their forms of classification, of making connections, etc." (Augé, 1999: 118).

==Origins==
Ethnoscience has not always focused on ideas distinct from those of "[[cognitive anthropology]]", "component analysis", or "the New Ethnography"; it is a specialization of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] knowledge-systems, such as ethno-botany, ethno-zoology, ethno-medicine, etc. (Atran, 1991: 595). According to [[Scott Atran]], ethnoscience looks at culture with a scientific perspective (1991: 650), although most{{quantify|date=November 2017}} anthropologists abhor this definition. Ethnoscience helps to understand how people develop with different forms of knowledge and beliefs, and focuses on the ecological and historical contributions people have been given (Atran, 1991: 650){{by whom|date=November 2017}}. [[Tim Ingold]] describes ethnoscience as a cross-discipline (2000: 160). He writes that ethnoscience is based on increased collaboration between [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]] (e.g., [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[philosophy]]) with [[natural sciences]] such as [[biology]], [[ecology]], or [[medicine]] (Ingold, 2000: 406-7). At the same time, ethnoscience is increasingly transdisciplinary in its nature (Ingold, 2000: 407).

Of course, naturally over time, the ways in which data has been collected and studied has changed and the field has evolved, becoming more detailed and specific (Urry, 1972: 45).{{qn|date=November 2017}} The ideas, mechanics, and methods of ethnoscience evolved from something else - a combination of several things. This pretext amalgamation{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} of theories, processes, and –isms led to the evolution of today's ethnoscience.

==Early approaches==
Early on, [[Franz Boas]] established [[cultural relativism]] as an approach to understanding indigenous scientific practices (Uddin, 2005: 980). Cultural relativism identifies people's differences and shows how they are a result of the social, historical, and geographical conditions (Uddin, 2005: 980). Boas is known for his work in Northern [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, working with the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] Indians, which is where he established the importance of culture (Uddin, 2005: 980). [[Lévi-Strauss]]' [[structuralism]] was a strong contributor to the ideas of ethnoscience (Uddin, 2005: 980). It, itself, was the leading idea of providing structure to the research and a guide to organizing and relating different cultures. "Ethnoscience refers to a 'reduction of chaos' achieved by a particular culture, rather than to the 'highest possible and conscious degree' to which such chaos may be reduced;" basically, the ethnoscience of a society creates its culture (Sturtevant, 1964: 100). Much of the influence of anthropology, e.g., [[geographical determinism]], was through the contributions of [[Jean Bodin]] (Harris, 1968: 42). In his text, he tried to explain why "northern people were faithful, loyal to the government, cruel, and sexually uninterested, compared to why southern people were malicious, craft, wise, expert in science but ill-adapted to political activity (Harris, 1968: 52)." The Greek historian, [[Polybius]], asserted "we mortals have an irresistible tendency to yield to climatic influences; and to this cause, and no other, may be traced the great distinctions that prevail among us in character, physical formation, complexion, as well as in most of our habits…" (quoted in Harris, 1968: 41).

Another aspect of anthropology prior to ethnoscience is [[enculturation]]. Newton and Newton described enculturation as a process whereby the novice, or "outsider", learns what is important to the "insider" (1998). [[Marvin Harris]] writes, "One of [enculturation's] most important technical expressions is the doctrine of 'psychic unity,' the belief that in the study of sociocultural differences, hereditary (genetic) differences cancel each other out, leaving 'experience' as the most significant variable" (Harris, 1968: 15). This is one of the many starts of people opening up to the idea that just because people are different, doesn't mean they are wrong in their thinking. Harris describes how religious beliefs hinder and affect the progress of anthropology and [[ethnography]]. The moral beliefs and restrictions of religion fought against anthropological ideas, possibly due to (especially at the time) to the newly hyped idea of [[evolutionism]] and [[Darwinism]] (Harris, 1968).

[[Bronislaw Malinowski]] was one of many who contributed heavily to the precursor of ethnoscience. His earlier work brought attention to [[sociological]] studies; his earliest publication focused on a family in [[Australia]], using a sociological study perspective (Harris, 1968: 547). After the [[First World War]], anthropological work was at a stand still; nothing had evolved, if not regressed (Urry, 1972: 54). This allowed him to start from scratch, and rebuild his ideas and methods (Harris, 1968: 547).

Later, however, Malinowski branched out to political evolution during [[World War II]]. The period after World War II is what led to ethnoscience; anthropologists learned their skills could be applied to problems that were affecting modern societies (Mead, 1973: 1). Malinowski said "… with his tables of [[kinship terms]], [[genealogies]], maps, plans and diagrams, proves an extensive and big organization, shows the contribution of the tribe, of the clan, of the family, and he gives a picture of the natives subjected to a strict code of behavior and good manners, to which in comparison the life at the [[Court of Versailles]] or [[Escurial]] was free and easy" (1922: 10). After World War II, there was an extreme amount of growth in the anthropological field, not only with research opportunities but academically, as well (Mead, 1973: 2).

The anthropologist [[Robin W.G. Horton|Robin Horton]], who taught at several Nigerian universities, considered the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples as incorporated within conceptual world views that bear certain similarities to, and differences from, the modern scientific worldview.  Like modern science, traditional thought provides a theoretical structure that "places things in a causal order wider than that provided by common sense" (Horton, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;53).  In contrast to modern science, he saw traditional thought as having a limited awareness of theoretical alternatives and, consequently, displaying "an absolute acceptance of the established theoretical tenets" (Horton, 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–6).

There are dozens, if not hundreds, of related methods and processes that preceded ethnoscience. Ethnoscience is just another way to study the human culture and the way people interact in society. Taking a look at the ideas and analyses prior to ethnoscience can help understand why it was developed in the first place. Although, it is not widely used and there is criticism on both ends, ethnoscience allows for a more comprehensive way to collect data and patterns of a people. This is not to say the process is its best or that there will be nothing better. That is the best part: everything evolves, even thought. Just as the ideas did in the past, they can improve over time and regress over time but change is inevitable.

==Development==

Ethnoscience is a new term and study that came into anthropological theory in the 1960s. Often referred to as "indigenous knowledge", ethnoscience introduces a perspective based on native perceptions. It is based on a complete emic perspective, which excludes all observations, interpretations and or any personal notions belonging to the ethnographer. The taxonomy and classification of indigenous systems, to name a few, used to categorize plants, animals, religion and life is adapted from a linguistic analysis. The concept of "Native Science" is also related to the understanding the role of the environment intertwined with the meaning humans place upon their lives. Understanding the language and the native people's linguistic system is one method to understand a native people's system of knowledge of organization. Not only is there categorization for things pertaining to nature and culture thought language, but more importantly and complex is the relationship between environment and culture. Ethnoscience looks at the intricacies of the connection between culture and its surrounding environment. There are also potential limitations and shortcomings in interpreting these systems of knowledge as a dictation of culture and behavior.

Since an ethnographer is not able to physically enter inside an indigenous person's mind, it is essential to not only create a setting or question-answer format to understand perspective but to analyze semantics and word order of given answer to derive an emic understanding. The main focus on a particular component of the languages is placed on its [[lexicon]]. The terms "[[etic]]" and "[[emic]]" are derived from the [[linguistics|linguistic]] terms of "[[phonetic]]" and "[[phonemic]]".

As introduced by [[Gregory Cajete]], some limitations the concept of indigenous knowledge, is the potential to bypass non-indigenous knowledge as pertinent and valuable. The labels of "indigenous" are overly accepted by those who seek more support by outsiders to further their cause. There might also be an unequal distribution of knowledge amongst a tribe or peoples. There is also the idea that culture is bound by environment. Some theorists conclude that indigenous people's culture is not operated by mental concentrations but solely by the earth that surrounds them. Some theorists go the extent to state that biological processes are based upon the availability, of lack thereof, environmental resources. The methods for sustainability are founded through the workings of the land. These techniques are exercised from the basis of tradition. The importance of the combination of ecological process, social structures, environmental ethics and spiritual ecology are crucial to the expression of the true connection between the natural world and "ecological consciousness".

The origin of Ethnoscience began between the years 1960 to 1965; deriving from the concept of "ethno- + science". Ethno- a combining form meaning "race", "culture", "people", used in the formation of compound words: ethnography. The two concepts later emerged into "ethno-science". The origin of the word 'science' involves the empiric observation of measurable quantities and the testing of hypotheses to falsify or support them. 
"Ethnoscience refers to the system of knowledge and cognition typical of a given culture...to put it another way a culture itself amounts to the sum of a given society's folk classifications, all of that society's ethnoscience, its particular ways of classifying its material and social universe" (Sturtevant 1964: 99–100). The aim of ethnoscience is to gain a more complete description of cultural knowledge. Ethnoscience has been successfully used on several studies of given cultures relating to their linguistics, folk taxonomy, and how they classify their foods, animals and plants.

===Ethnolinguistics===

Ethnoscience is the examination of the perceptions, knowledge, and classifications of the world as reflected in their use of language, which can help anthropologists understand a given culture. By using an ethnographic approach to studying a culture and learning their lexicon and syntax they are able to gain more knowledge in understanding how a particular culture classifies its material and social universe. In addition, this approach "adopted provides simultaneously a point at which the discipline of linguistics, or at least some of its general attitudes, may sensibly be used in anthropology and as a means of gaining insight not only into the nature of man but also into the nature of culture" (Videbeck and Pia, 1966).

Researchers can use linguistics to study what a given culture considers important in a given situation or unforeseen event, and can rank those potential situations in terms of their likelihood to recur. In addition, "understanding the contingencies is helpful in the task of comprehending folk taxonomies on the one hand, and, on the other, an understanding of the taxonomy is required for a full scale appreciation of criteria considered relevant in a given culture (Videbeck and Pia, 1966).

===Taxonomy and classification===

Ethnoscience can be used to analyze the kinship terminology of a given culture, using their language and according to how they view members of their society. Taxonomies "are models of analysis whose purpose is the description of particular types of hierarchical relationships between members of a given set of elements" (Perchonock and [[Oswald Werner|Werner]], 1969). For example, in our society we classify family groups by giving members the title of father, mother, sister, daughter, brother, son, grandfather, grandmother, etc.

===System of classification – among cultures===

Ethnoscience deals with how a given culture classifies certain principles in addition to how it is express through their language. By understanding a given culture through how they view the world, anthropologists attempt to eliminate any bias through translation as well as categorized their principles in their own ways. "The new methods, which focus on the discovery and description of folk systems, have come to be known as Ethnoscience. Ethnoscience analysis has thus far concentrated on systems of classification within such cultural and linguistic domains as colors, plants, and medicines" (Perchonock and [[Oswald Werner|Werner]], 1969). An ethnoscientific approach can be used to better understand a given culture and their knowledge of their culture. Using an ethnographic approach can help anthropologists understand how that given culture views and categorizes their own foods, animal kingdom, medicines, as well as plants.

===Contemporary research===
Ethnoscience can be effectively summed up as a classification system for a particular culture in the same way that a botanist would use a taxonomic system for the classification of plant species. Everything from class levels, food consumption, clothing, and material culture objects would be subjected to a taxonomic classification system. In essence, ethnoscience is a way of classifying cultural systems in a structured order to better understand the culture.
The roots of ethnoscience can be traced back to influential anthropologists such as [[Franz Boas]], [[Bronislaw Malinowski]], and [[Benjamin Whorf]] who attempted to understand other cultures from an insider's perspective. [[Ward Goodenough]] is accredited for bringing ethnoscience to the stage when he define cultural systems of knowledge by stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"A societies culture consists of whatever it is one has to know or believe in order to operate in a manner acceptable to its members. Culture is not a material phenomenon; it does not consist of things, behavior, or emotions. It is rather an organization of these things. It is the form of things that people have in mind, their models for perceiving, relating, and otherwise interpreting them."
'' (Goodenough 1957:167)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In order to properly put ethnoscience in context we must first understand the definition of ethnoscience. it is defined as "an attempt at cultural description from a totally emic perspective (a perspective in ethnography that uses the concepts and categories that are relevant and meaningful to the culture that is insider analysis) standpoint, this eliminating all of the ethnographer's own categories" (Morey and Luthans 27). Ethnoscience is also a way of learning and understanding how an individual or group perceive their environment and how they fit in with their environment as reflected in their own words and actions.

Ethnoscience has many techniques when applied to an emic perspective. Ethnosemantics, ethnographic semantics, ethnographic ethnoscience, formal analysis, and componential analysis are the terms that apply to the practice of ethnoscience. Ethnosemantics looks at the meaning of words in order to place them in context of the culture being studied. It allows for taxonomy of a certain part of the culture being looked at so that there is a clear breakdown which in turn leads to a deeper understanding of the subject at hand. Ethnographic semantics are very similar to cognitive anthropology in that its primary focus is the intellectual and rational perspectives of the culture being studied. Ethnographic semantics specifically looks at how language is used throughout the culture. Lastly, ethnographic ethnoscience is related to ethnosemantics such that, it uses a taxonomic system to understand how cultural knowledge is accessible through language. Ethnographic ethnoscience uses similar classification systems for cultural domains like ethnobotany and ethnoanatomy. Again, ethnoscience is a way of understanding a how a culture sees itself through its own language. Understanding the cultural language allows the ethnographer to have a deeper and more intimate understanding of the culture.

The '''European social model''' is a common vision many European states have for a society that combines economic growth with high [[living standard]]s and good [[working conditions]]. Historian [[Tony Judt]] has argued that the European social model "binds Europe together" in contrast to the '[[American way of life]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/17/politics1|title=The Guardian|last=Laity|first=Paul|date=17 May 2008|work=Uncomfortable truths. Interview with Tony Judt.|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European states do not all use a single [[social model]], but [[welfare state]]s in Europe do share several broad characteristics. These generally include a commitment to [[full employment]], [[social protection]]s for all citizens, [[social inclusion]], and democracy. Examples common among European countries include [[universal health care]], free higher education, strong labor protections and regulations, and generous welfare programs in areas such as unemployment insurance, retirement pensions, and public housing. The [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of the European Community]] set out several social objectives: "promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions ... proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etuc.org/a/2771|title=The European Social Model|date=21 March 2007|publisher=European Trade Union Confederation|accessdate=4 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109165943/http://www.etuc.org/a/2771|archive-date=9 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because different European states focus on different aspects of the model, it has been argued that there are four distinct social models in Europe: the Nordic, British, Mediterranean and the Continental.&lt;ref&gt;Sapir, André. 2005.

New York: Oxford University Press (USA).&lt;/ref&gt;

The general outlines of a European social model emerged during the [[Post-World War II economic expansion|post-war boom]]. [[Tony Judt]] lists a number of causes: the abandonment of [[protectionism]], the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]], cheap energy, and a desire to catch up with [[living standards]] enjoyed in the United States. The European social model also enjoyed a low degree of external competition as the Soviet bloc, China and India were not yet integrated into the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12767280&amp;source=login_payBarrier|title=The Economist|last=Charlemagne|date=11 December 2008|work=The left's resignation note|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, it has become common to question whether the European social model is sustainable in the face of low birthrates, [[globalisation]], [[Europeanisation]] and an [[Ageing of Europe|ageing population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/933|title=Europe's Ailing Social Model: Facts &amp; Fairy-Tales|author=Martin De Vlieghere|author2=Paul Vreymans|last-author-amp=yes|date=23 March 2006|work=The Brussels Journal|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bof.fi/en/suomen_pankki/ajankohtaista/puheet/2007/EL_puhe27112007.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Liikanen: "A European Social Model: an Asset or a Liability?"|date=27 November 2007|publisher=The World Political Forum|accessdate=3 January 2010|location=Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welfare state in Europe==
[[Image:Social Expenditures in the EU.jpg|thumb|right|400px]]
Some of the European welfare states have been described as the most well developed and extensive.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/cre/publish/pdfs/wp61a.pdf article]&lt;/ref&gt; A unique "European social model" is described in contrast with the social model existing in the US.

===Nordic model===
{{see also|Nordic model}}
As can be seen in the graph to the right, the Nordic model holds the highest level of [[social insurance]]. Its main characteristic is its universal provision nature which is based on the principle of "citizenship". Therefore, there exists a more generalised access, with lower conditionability, to the social provisions.

As regards labour market, these countries are characterised by important expenditures in [[active labour market policies]] whose aim is a rapid reinsertion of the [[unemployment|unemployed]] into the labour market. These countries are also characterised by a high share of [[public employment]]. Trade unions have a high membership and an important decision-making power which induces a low wage dispersion or more equitable income distribution.

The Nordic model is also characterised by a high [[tax wedge]].

===Continental model===
{{see also|Rhine capitalism}}
The Continental model has some similarities with the Nordic model. Nevertheless, it has a higher share of its expenditures devoted to pensions. The model is based on the principle of "security" and a system of subsidies which are not conditioned to employability (for example in the case of France or Belgium, there exist subsidies whose only requirement is being older than 25).

As regards the labour market, active policies are less important than in the Nordic model and in spite of a low membership rate, trade-unions have important decision-making powers in [[collective agreement]]s.

Another important aspect of the Continental model is the [[disability pension]]s.

===Anglo-Saxon model===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon economy}}
The Anglo-Saxon model features a lower level of expenditures than the previous ones. Its main particularity is its [[social assistance]] of last resort. Subsidies are directed to a higher extent to the working-age population and to a lower extent to pensions. Access to subsidies is (more) conditioned to employability (for instance, they are conditioned on having worked previously).

Active labour market policies are important. Instead, trade unions have smaller decision-making powers than in the previous models, this is one of the reasons explaining their higher income dispersion and their higher number of low-wage employments.

===Mediterranean model===&lt;!-- "Mediterranean model" redirects here --&gt;
The '''Mediterranean model'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; corresponds to southern European countries who developed their [[welfare state]] later than the previous ones (during the 1970s and 1980s). It is the model with the lowest share of expenditures and is strongly based on pensions and a low level of social assistance. There exists in these countries a higher segmentation of rights and status of persons receiving subsidies which has as one of its consequences a strongly conditioned access to social provisions.

The main characteristic of labour market policies is a rigid [[employment protection legislation]] and a frequent resort to [[early retirement]] policies as a means to improve employment conditions. Trade unions tend to have an important membership which again is one of the explanations behind a lower income dispersion than in the Anglo-Saxon model.

==Evaluating the different social models==
[[Image:Reducción en la pobreza de los Modelos Sociales Europeos.png|thumb|350px|Reduction in poverty by the different European social models. Reduction in [[Gini index]] after transfers and taxes (in percentage change).]]
[[Image:Eficiencia Gastos Sociales.jpg|thumb|350px|Efficiency of social expenditures in the four European social models]]

To evaluate the different social models, we follow the criteria used in Boeri (2002) and Sapir (2005) which consider that a social model should satisfy the following:
# Reduction in poverty. 
# Protection against labour market risks. 
# Rewards for labour participation.

===Reduction in poverty===
The graph on the right shows the reduction in inequality (as measured by the [[Gini index]]) after taking account of taxes and transfers, that is, to which extent does each social model reduce poverty without taking into account the reduction in poverty provoqued by taxes and transfers. The level of social expenditures is an indicator of the capacity of each model to reduce poverty: a bigger share of expenditures is in general associated to a higher reduction in poverty. Nevertheless, another aspect that should be taken into account is the efficiency in this poverty reduction. By this is meant that with a lower share of expenditures a higher reduction in poverty may be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =European Social Model and East Asian Economic Model – different approach to productivity and competition in economy|publisher= Asia – Europe. Partnership or Rivalry?”|date= 2010|accessdate=4 August 2016|location= Wrocław|pages= 35–47|url= http://www.proeconomics.pl/artykuly/ESMandEAEM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, the graph on the right shows that the Anglosaxon and Nordic models are more efficient than the Continental or Mediterranean ones. The Continental model appears to be the least efficient. Given its high level of social expenditures, one would expect a higher poverty reduction than that attained by this model. Remark how the Anglosaxon model is found above the average line drawn whereas the Continental is found below that line.

===Protection against labour market risks===
[[Image:Relación entre protección al empleo y % trabajadores con beneficios desempleo.jpg|thumb|350px|As can be seen, there exists a negative relationship between [[employment protection legislation]] and the share of workers receiving [[unemployment benefits]].]]

Protection against labour market risks is generally assured by two means: 
# Regulation of the labour market by means of employment protection legislation which basically increases firing costs and [[severance payments]] for the employers. This is generally referred to as providing "employment" protection.
# [[Unemployment benefit]]s which are commonly financed with taxes or [[mandatory public insurance]]s to the employees and employers. This is generally referred to as providing protection to the "worker" as opposed to "employment".

As can be seen in the graph, there is a clear trade-off between these two types of labour market instruments (remark the clear negative slope between both). Once again different European countries have chosen a different position in their use of these two mechanisms of labour market protection. These differences can be summarised as follows: 
* The Mediterranean countries have chosen a higher "employment" protection while a very low share of their unemployed workers receives unemployment benefits. 
* The Nordic countries have chosen to protect to a lesser extent "employment" and instead, an important share of their unemployed workers receives benefits. 
* The continental countries have a higher level of both mechanisms than the European average, although by a small margin. 
* The Anglo-Saxon countries base their protection on unemployment benefits and a low level of employment protection.

Evaluating the different choices is a hard task. In general there exists consensus among economists on the fact that employment protection generates inefficiencies inside firms. Instead, there is no such consensus as regards the question of whether employment protection generates a higher level of unemployment.

===Rewards for labour participation===
[[Image:Ratio Empleo-Población.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Employment rate|Employment]] and [[Unemployment rate|unemployment]] rates for each social model]]
Sapir (2005) and Boeri (2002) propose looking at the [[employment-to-population ratio]] as the best way to analyse the incentives and rewards for employment in each social model. The [[Lisbon Strategy]] initiated in 2001 established that the members of the EU should attain a 70% employment rate by 2010.

In this case, the graph shows that the countries in the Nordic and Anglosaxon model are the ones with the highest employment rate whereas the Continental and Mediterranean countries have not attained the Lisbon Strategy target.

===Conclusion===
[[Image:Tipologia de los distintos modelos sociales europeos.png|thumb|400px|Classifying the different social models according to their [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[Equity (economics)|equity]]. Elevada means high whereas Baja means low.]]
Sapir (2005) proposes as a general mean to evaluate the different social models, the following two criteria: 
# [[Economic efficiency|Efficiency]], that is, whether the model provides the incentives so as to achieve the largest number possible of employed persons, that is, the highest [[employment rate]]. 
# Equity, that is, whether the social model achieves a relatively low poverty risk.

As can be seen in the graph, according to these two criteria, the best performance is achieved by the Nordic model. The Continental model should improve its efficiency whereas the Anglosaxon model its equity. The Mediterranean model under-performs in both criteria.

Some economists consider that between the Continental model and the Anglo-Saxon, the latter should be preferred given its better results in employment, which make it more sustainable in the long term, whereas the equity level depends on the preferences of each country (Sapir, 2005). Other economists argue that the Continental model cannot be considered worse than the Anglosaxon given that it is also the result of the preferences of those countries that support it (Fitoussi et al., 2000; Blanchard, 2004). This last argument can be used to justify any policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12989">'''Frank Parsons''' (November 14, 1854 – September 26, 1908) was an American professor, social reformer, and public intellectual. Although he was educated as an engineer at [[Cornell University]], he passed the [[Massachusetts]] state bar examination and became a lawyer in 1881. Parsons was for more than a decade a lecturer at [[Boston University School of Law]] and taught at Kansas State Agricultural College from 1897 to 1899. As a leading social commentator of the [[Progressive Era]], Parsons authored a dozen books and more than 125 magazine and journal articles on a wide range of reform topics, including currency reform, regulation of monopolies, municipal ownership, establishment of direct democracy, and other matters. Parsons is also widely regarded as the father of the vocational guidance movement.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Frank Parsons was born on November 14, 1854, in [[Mount Holly, New Jersey]], the son of an Anglo-Saxon family with American antecedents dating back to the time of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Mann472&gt;Arthur Mann, "Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader," ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review,'' vol. 37, no. 3 (Dec. 1950), pg. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; The family was highly intellectual in proclivity, with a number of physicians, lawyers, and teachers dotting the family tree, particularly on Frank's mother's side.&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt;

Intellectually talented from an early age, Frank was enrolled in [[Cornell University]] at the age of 15 and graduated after just three years with a [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[civil engineering]].&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt;

===Career===

Parsons took a job as a civil engineer for a railroad located in Western Massachusetts upon graduation but he lost this position when the firm collapsed amidst the [[Panic of 1873]].&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt;

After relatively brief stints as a common laborer and a public school teacher, Parsons decided to go into the legal profession, preparing for the Massachusetts bar examination for one year before taking and passing the exam in 1881.&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt;

Unfortunately, Parsons experienced a health failure shortly after passing the bar exam and found himself compelled to move the  [[New Mexico Territory]] in search of recovery.&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt; Parsons would remain in that state for three years.&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt; Parsons established a legal practice in New Mexico but soon tired of the profession.&lt;ref name=Mann473&gt;Mann, "Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader," pg. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Parsons was employed by the publishing firm of [[Little, Brown and Company]] as a writer of law textbooks.&lt;ref name=Mann473 /&gt; Several volumes were produced during the course of this association.&lt;ref name=Mann473 /&gt;

With textbook publications came academic recognition, and in 1892 Parsons was added to the staff as a lecturer at [[Boston University School of Law]].&lt;ref name=Mann473 /&gt; He would remain in that position for the greater part of the rest of his life, leaving only in 1905 on account of competing research interests.&lt;ref name=Mann473 /&gt;

Parson's position at Boston University only occupied part of the academic year, leaving him free to work on other projects and in other capacities for much of the year.&lt;ref name=Mann475&gt;Mann, "Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader," pg. 475.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the staff of [[Kansas State University|Kansas State Agricultural College]] in 1897, in the wake of a recent [[People's Party (United States)|Populist]] electoral victory in that state and the advent of a new liberal administration at that school.&lt;ref name=Mann475 /&gt;

===Social reformer===

Parsons became interested in the ideas of economic rationalization during the [[Progressive Era]] of the 1890s. It was a time of great disparity between wealthy plutocrats, often exercising monopoly power over the economy through organized associations called [[trust (monopoly)|trusts]], and a frequently impoverished working class, racked by periodic depressions such as the 1873 event which had cost Parsons his first job.

With his characteristic energy, Parsons threw himself into the systematic study of many of the topics espoused by [[muckraker|muckraking journalists]] and intellectuals of the day.&lt;ref name=Mann474&gt;Mann, "Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader," pg. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of books followed, including tomes on monetary reform ''(Rational Money,'' 1898), market dysfunction in the communications industry ''(The Telegraph Monopoly,'' 1899), public ownership of monopoly industries ''(The City for the People,'' 1899), substitution of democracy for [[oligarchy]] ''(Direct Legislation,'' 1900), and the abuses of the railroad industry ''(The Trusts, the Railroads, and the People,'' 1906).&lt;ref name=Mann474 /&gt;

In [[Boston mayoral election, 1895|December 1895]], Parsons ran for [[Mayor of Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston-sub/doc/498288084.html |title=NAMED FOR MAYOR |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=6 |date=November 16, 1895 |accessdate=March 22, 2018 |url-access=limited |via=pqarchiver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the candidate for the Municipal Reform Party—"a fusion of [[Prohibition Party|prohibitionists]], labor, populists, and socialists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18519043/josiah_quincy_elected/ |title=Josiah Quincy Elected |newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]] |page=1 |date=December 11, 1895 |accessdate=March 22, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished third in a field of three, with 0.8% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreportofbo1895bo#page/56/mode/2up |title=Annual Report of the Board of Election Commissioners |date=1895 |page=57 |publisher=City of Boston |accessdate=March 22, 2018 |via=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his steady stream of books and pamphlets, Parsons wrote extensively for the periodical press, contributing more than 125 articles to [[B. O. Flower|B.O. Flower's]] progressive monthly, ''[[The Arena (magazine)|The Arena]]'' and other publications.&lt;ref name=Mann474 /&gt; In addition to his prolific work for ''The Arena,'' Parsons was named a contributing editor to the [[social democracy|social democratic]] monthly ''The American Fabian'' in 1896.&lt;ref name=Mann474 /&gt;

In addition to his writing activities, Parsons also emerged as a prominent public speaker, serving as a lecturer for the [[National Direct Legislation League]], as head of the lecture department of the [[Social Reform Union]], and as President of the [[National League for Promoting Public Ownership of Monopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Herringshaw (ed.), ''Herringshaw's National Library of American Biography.'' In Five Volumes. Chicago: American Publishers' Association, 1914; vol. 4, pg. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of his activity, Parsons came to be recognized as a national expert on public ownership of utilities. In 1906, he was commissioned by the [[National Civic Federation]] to travel to Great Britain to study the incidence of municipal ownership and its outcomes in that country.&lt;ref name=Mann475 /&gt;

Parsons also served as dean of the extension division of [[Ruskin Colleges|Ruskin College]] in [[Trenton, Missouri]].

===Death and legacy===

Frank Parsons died Sept. 26, 1908, in Boston, Massachusetts. He was 53 years old at the time of his death.

A memorial service in Parsons' honor was held October 25, 1908, at the People's Church in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=Service&gt;B.O. Flower, "Memorial Services in Memory of Professor Parsons in the Nation's Capital," ''The Arena,'' vol. 40, whole no. 228 (Dec. 1908), pp. 636-638.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eulogy by Rev. Alexander Kent, Parson's was remembered as a consistent analyst striving to advance the general weal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There were few men whose ability was so completely devoted to the public good.... The problem of human betterment was always uppermost in his thought. He was continually at work tracing the evils from which men suffer to their source, and showing how they might be avoided or at least greatly lessened. He was a consistent opponent of that individualism which pits men against each other in the struggle for existence, and an earnest advocate of that individuality that fits men for useful membership in the social body, and so draws them together in mutual fellowship and service."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Kent, quoted in B.O. Flower, "Memorial Services in Memory of Professor Parsons in the Nation's Capital," pg. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Parsons' papers are housed at [[Yale University Library]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, "Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader," pg. 472, fn. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The posthumous publication in 1911 of Parson's manuscript, ''Choosing a Vocation,'' and its so-called "talent-matching approach" proved to be massively influential with a generation of educationalists. Parson's book remains regarded as a classic in the field and Parsons is still in the 21st Century remembered as "the founder of the vocational guidance movement."&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: "Career Theory Models: Parson's Theory," CareersNZ, http://www.careers.govt.nz/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick Nicholas Charrington''' (4 February 1850 – 2 January 1936) was an English social reformer who renounced succession to a fortune of over £1 million in order to devote his life to temperance work.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Thorne, pseud. Cyril Arthur Edward Ranger Gull. ''The Great Acceptance: The Life Story of F. N. Charrington''. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1912 https://archive.org/details/greatacceptancel00gull&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Charrington was born in the [[Bow Road]], in the [[East End of London]]. His father was a partner in the [[Charrington Brewery]], one of London’s biggest  brewing companies. Charrington was heir to a fortune of a million and a quarter pounds. He was educated at [[Marlborough College]], but left because of illness and  finished his school career at [[Brighton College]]. He subsequently joined the family business.

At the age of 19, Charrington had a conversion experience and became an [[Evangelical Christian]]. About a year later, while walking through [[Whitechapel]], he saw a poorly dressed woman with her children begging her husband to leave a [[public house]] and give her money for food. The furious husband came out and knocked her into the gutter. Charrington went to help and was also knocked to the ground. Looking up, he saw his name on the sign above the pub.

“When I saw that sign,” he later wrote, “I was stricken just as surely as Paul on the Damascus Road. Here was the source of my family wealth, and it was producing untold human misery before my own eyes. Then and there I pledged to God that not another penny of that money should come to me.”&lt;ref&gt;Ron Lee Davis, ''Courage to Begin Again'', Harvest House, Eugene, OR, 1978, pp. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;

Charrington abandoned the family business to devote his life to helping the poor in the East End. He opened a school, led a fight to clean up the [[music halls]] and became an ardent worker for the [[Temperance Movement]]. In 1870 he founded the [[Tower Hamlets Mission]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.towerhamletsmission.org&lt;/ref&gt; and made the Great Assembly Hall in the [[Mile End Road]] a centre of Christian work in the East End of London.

In 1903 Charrington purchased [[Osea Island]] off the coast of [[Maldon District|Maldon]] in Essex and established a treatment centre for people with alcohol and opiate addictions. In return for free treatment, clients would remain on the island and work the land.

He was one of the original members of the [[London County Council]] (1889–95).

He died in the [[London Hospital]] in January 1936.

'''Freedom of panorama''' ('''FOP''') is  a provision in the [[copyright]] laws of various jurisdictions that permits taking photographs and video footage and creating other images (such as paintings) of buildings and sometimes sculptures and other art works which are permanently located in a [[public place]], without infringing on any copyright that may otherwise subsist in such works, and the publishing of such images.&lt;ref name="seiler"&gt;Seiler, D.: ''[http://www.fotorecht.de/publikationen/hundertwasserhaus3.html Gebäudefotografie in der EU – Neues vom Hundertwasserhaus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930160856/http://www.fotorecht.de/publikationen/hundertwasserhaus3.html |date=2007-09-30 }}'', in ''Photopresse'' 1/2 (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;16.

The phrase is derived from the [[German language|German]] term ''{{lang|de|Panoramafreiheit}}'' ("panorama freedom").

==Laws around the world==
Many countries have similar provisions restricting the scope of copyright law in order to explicitly permit photographs involving scenes of public places or scenes photographed from public places. Other countries, though, differ widely in their interpretation of the principle.&lt;ref name="seiler"/&gt;

====Litigation====
An example of litigation due to the heterogeneous EU legislation is the ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Hundertwasserentscheidung|Hundertwasserentscheidung]]}}'' (Hundertwasser decision), a case won by [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]] in Germany against a German company for use of a photo of an Austrian building.&lt;ref&gt;https://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?Text=I%20ZR%20192/00 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820052628/https://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?Text=I%20ZR%20192%2F00 |date=2016-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 2016 the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Swedish Supreme Court]] ruled that [[List of Wikimedia chapters|Wikimedia Sweden]] infringed on the copyright of artists of public artwork by creating a website and database of public artworks in Sweden, containing images of public artwork uploaded by the public.&lt;ref name="falkvinge-2016"&gt;

In [[Romania]], the heirs of [[Anca Petrescu]], the architect of the colossal [[Palace of the Parliament]], sued the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] for selling photos and other [[Souvenir|souvenirs]] with the image of the iconic building.

===France===
Since 7 October 2016, article L122-5 of the French Code of Intellectual Property provides for a limited freedom of panorama for works of architecture and sculpture.  The code authorizes "reproductions and representations of works of architecture and sculpture, placed permanently in public places (''voie publique''), and created by [[natural person]]s, with the exception of any usage of a commercial character".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=5DD8F8800CB25AA883378CE851D89A7D.tpdila13v_2?idArticle=LEGIARTI000033219336&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&amp;categorieLien=id&amp;dateTexte=|title=Article 5, section 11  of Code on Intellectual Property|accessdate=December 26, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127170315/https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do|archivedate=January 27, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limits to freedom of panorama in France have a drastic effect on Wikipedia articles about French architecture. Wikimedia Commons editors routinely delete any images of recent French architecture, despite the changes in the law, because Commons does not allow images where commercial use is prohibited.

===Australia===

In [[Australia]], freedom of panorama is dealt with in the federal [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act 1968]], sections 65 to 68. Section 65 provides: "The copyright in a work ... that is situated, otherwise than temporarily, in a public place, or in premises open to the public, is not infringed by the making of a painting, drawing, engraving or photograph of the work or by the inclusion of the work in a cinematograph film or in a television broadcast". This applies to any "artistic work" as defined in paragraph (c) of section 10: a "work of artistic craftsmanship" (but not a circuit layout).&lt;ref name="AU"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca1968133|Copyright Act 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, "[[street art]]" may be protected by copyright.&lt;ref name="G124v01"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/AsiCommon/Controls/BSA/Downloader.aspx?iDocumentStorageKey=62a2e433-4cab-4d6f-8dd2-dc4af24277e7&amp;iFileTypeCode=PDF&amp;iFileName=Street%20Art%20&amp;%20Copyright | title=Street Art &amp; Copyright | publisher=[[Australian Copyright Council]] | work=Information Sheet G124v01 | date=September 2014 | accessdate=8 May 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322193002/http://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/AsiCommon/Controls/BSA/Downloader.aspx?iDocumentStorageKey=62a2e433-4cab-4d6f-8dd2-dc4af24277e7&amp;iFileTypeCode=PDF&amp;iFileName=Street%20Art%20&amp;%20Copyright | archivedate=22 March 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street photographer's rights |url=http://www.artslaw.com.au/info-sheets/info-sheet/street-photographers-rights/ |website=Arts Law Information Sheet |publisher=Arts Law Centre of Australia |accessdate=8 May 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630101936/http://www.artslaw.com.au/info-sheets/info-sheet/street-photographers-rights/ |archivedate=June 30, 2014 |deadurl=no }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photographers &amp; Copyright |edition=17 |url=http://www.copyright.org.au/admin/cms-acc1/_images/732757805533a4bbed9e2a.pdf |publisher=Australian Copyright Council |accessdate=28 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702180313/http://www.copyright.org.au/admin/cms-acc1/_images/732757805533a4bbed9e2a.pdf |archivedate=July 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |page=7 |format=PDF |date=January 2014 |quote=You will generally need permission to photograph other public art, such as murals. }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Section 66 of the Act provides exceptions to copyright infringement for photos and depictions of buildings and models of buildings.&lt;ref name="AU" /&gt;

===Canada===
Section 32.2(1) of the Copyright Act (Canada) states the following:
{{quote|It is not an infringement of copyright
{{block indent|(b) for any person to reproduce, in a painting, drawing, engraving, photograph or cinematographic work
{{block indent|(i) an architectural work, provided the copy is not in the nature of an architectural drawing or plan, or}}
{{block indent|(ii) a sculpture or work of artistic craftsmanship or a cast or model of a sculpture or work of artistic craftsmanship, that is permanently situated in a public place or building;}}}}}}
The Copyright Act also provides specific protection for the incidental inclusion of another work seen in the background of a photo. Photos that "incidentally and not deliberately" include another work do not infringe copyright.

===United States===
{{further|Copyright in architecture in the United States}}
[[copyright law of the United States|United States copyright law]] contains the following provision:
{{quote|The copyright in an architectural work that has been constructed does not include the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public display of pictures, paintings, photographs, or other pictorial representations of the work, if the building in which the work is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place.|[[:s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 1/Section 120|17 U.S.&amp;nbsp;Code §&amp;nbsp;120(a)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=17 U.S. Code § 120 - Scope of exclusive rights in architectural works|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/120|access-date=4 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419101318/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/120|archivedate=19 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Former USSR===
Almost all countries from the former [[Soviet Union]] lack freedom of panorama. Exceptions are three countries whose copyright laws were amended recently. The first was [[Republic of Moldova]] in July 2010, when the law in question was approximated to EU standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authors = Eugene Stuart, Eduardo Fano, Linda Scales, Gerda Leonaviciene, Anna Lazareva | title = Intellectual Property Law and Policy.

==Two-dimensional works==
The precise extent of this permission to make pictures in public places without having to worry about copyrighted works being in the image differs amongst countries.&lt;ref name="seiler"/&gt; In most countries, it applies only to images of three-dimensional works&lt;ref name="uk_2"&gt;See ''e.g.'' Lydiate.&lt;/ref&gt; that are permanently installed in a public place, "permanent" typically meaning "for the natural lifetime of the work".&lt;ref name="ch"&gt;Rehbinder, M.: ''Schweizerisches Urheberrecht'' 3rd ed., p.&amp;nbsp;158, Stämpfli Verlag, Berne, 2000. {{ISBN|3-7272-0923-2}}.

==Public space==
Many laws have subtle differences in regard to public space and private property. Whereas the photographer's location is irrelevant in Austria,&lt;ref name="seiler"/&gt; in Germany the permission applies only if the image was taken from public ground, and without any further utilities such as ladders, lifting platforms, airplanes etc.&lt;ref name="de"/&gt; Under certain circumstances, the scope of the permission is also extended to actually private grounds, e.g. to publicly accessible private parks and castles without entrance control, however with the restriction that the owner may then demand a fee for commercial use of the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=pm&amp;Datum=2010&amp;Sort=3&amp;nr=54399&amp;pos=0&amp;anz=241 |title=Decision of the German Federal Court in favour of the Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten, December 17, 2010 |publisher=Juris.bundesgerichtshof.de |date=2010-12-17 |accessdate=2012-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014190054/http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=pm&amp;Datum=2010&amp;Sort=3&amp;nr=54399&amp;pos=0&amp;anz=241 |archivedate=October 14, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Eastern European countries the copyright laws limit this permission to non-commercial uses of the images only.&lt;ref name="elst"&gt;See e.g. for Russia: Elst, M.: ''Copyright, Freedom of Speech, and Cultural Policy in the Russian Federation'', p.&amp;nbsp;432f; Martinus Nijhoff, Leiden/Boston, 2005; {{ISBN|90-04-14087-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also international differences in the particular definition of a "public place". In most countries, this includes only outdoor spaces (for instance, in Germany),&lt;ref name="de"/&gt; while some other countries also include indoor spaces such as public museums (this is for instance the case in the UK&lt;ref name="uk"/&gt; and in [[Russia]]).&lt;ref name="ru"&gt;Elst p. 432, footnote 268. Also see [http://www.consultant.ru/popular/gkrf4/ article 1276 of part IV of the Civil Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607021156/http://www.consultant.ru/popular/gkrf4/ |date=2012-06-07 }} (in force as of January 1, 2008), clarifying this.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a controversy among Filipino photographers and establishment managements. On June 12, 2013, [[Philippine Independence Day]], pro-photography group, Bawal Mag-Shoot dito, launched at the Freedom to Shoot Day protest at [[Luneta Park]]. The group is protesting for their right to take photos on historical and public places, especially in Luneta and [[Intramuros]]. The park management imposes a fee for D-SLR photographers to shoot images for commercial purposes but it was also reported that security guards also charge 500 pesos to shoot photos even for non-commercial purposes, an act which the advocacy group branded as "extortion". The group also claimed that there is discrimination against Filipino photographers and claimed that the management is lenient on foreign photographers. There is no official policy on taking photographs of historical places and the group has called legislators to create a law on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nadezhda |last=Tanola |url=http://www.remate.ph/2013/06/photographers-to-declare-june-12-as-freedom-to-shoot-day/#.UuMvkxAhLIU |title=Photographers to declare June 12 as ‘Freedom to Shoot Day’ - Remate &amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2014-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202220640/http://www.remate.ph/2013/06/photographers-to-declare-june-12-as-freedom-to-shoot-day/#.UuMvkxAhLIU |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-terrorism laws==
Tension has arisen in countries where freedom to take pictures in public places conflicts with more recent [[anti-terrorism legislation]]. In the United Kingdom, the powers granted to police under section 44 of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] have been used on numerous occasions{{fact|date=August 2016}} to stop amateur and professional photographers from taking photographs of public areas. Under such circumstances, police are required to have "reasonable suspicion" that a person is a terrorist.&lt;ref name="photo-homeoffice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2009/012-2009/|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130125102358/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2009/012-2009/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 January 2013|title=Photography and Counter-Terrorism legislation |date=18 August 2009|publisher=The Home Office|accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Act does not prohibit photography, critics have alleged that these powers have been misused to prevent lawful public photography.&lt;ref name="bbc-terrorist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7351252.stm|title= Innocent photographer or terrorist?|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom |date=17 April 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable instances have included the investigation of a schoolboy,&lt;ref name="schoolboy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/terrorism-act-photography-fears-spark-police-response-25025|title=Terrorism Act: Photography fears spark police response|date=30 October 2008|publisher=Amateur Photographer Magazine|accessdate=2 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713150716/http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/terrorism-act-photography-fears-spark-police-response-25025|archivedate=13 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Member of Parliament]]&lt;ref name="pelling"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/4144210/Tory-MP-stopped-and-searched-by-police-for-taking-photos-of-cycle-path.html|title=Tory MP stopped and searched by police for taking photos of cycle path|date=6 January 2009|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=30 November 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223201420/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/4144210/Tory-MP-stopped-and-searched-by-police-for-taking-photos-of-cycle-path.html|archivedate=23 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[BBC]] photographer.&lt;ref name="overs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23776068-bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset.do |title=BBC man in terror quiz for photographing St Paul's sunset |last=Davenport |first=Justin |date=27 November 2009 |publisher=Evening Standard |accessdate=30 November 2009 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130161651/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23776068-bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset.do |archivedate=30 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset-6714008.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023085953/http://www.standard.co.uk/news/bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset-6714008.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 October 2012|title=BBC man in terror quiz for photographing St Paul's sunset - News - London Evening Standard|date=23 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of these powers has since been reduced, and guidance around them issued to discourage their use in relation to photography, following litigation in the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="sec44"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/justice-and-fair-trials/stop-and-search/section-44-terrorism-act |title=Section 44 Terrorism Act |publisher=Liberty |accessdate=23 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707060834/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/justice-and-fair-trials/stop-and-search/section-44-terrorism-act |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses2|House Party}}

[[File:House party in Denver Colorado.JPG|thumb|A house party in [[Denver, Colorado]].]]
A '''house party''' is typically a type of [[party]] where medium to large groups of people gather at the residence of the party's host. In modern usage, a house party is typically associated with teenage or young adult crowds, loud music, dancing, and the consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or other [[recreational drugs]]. Historically, the term has also referred to more genteel gatherings at country estates, lasting anywhere from several days to weeks.

==Organization==
A house party might be organized several months, down to just a few hours, in advance. News of a party is often spread by word of mouth, the sending of formal invitations, or on social networking websites like [[Facebook]]. In the case of the latter, the host must be particularly careful of how public the information regarding the party is made. There have been cases where hundreds of people have turned up to a party they found out about on the internet without knowing the host personally, causing massive damage to the house or the items within it. In the [[United Kingdom]], such an occurrence may be referred to as a 'Skins' party, named after a well-known [[Skins (2007 TV Series)|TV show]] set in the English city of [[Bristol]] focusing on the lives of teenagers who often participate in and host such parties.

A person who attends a house party, but has not been invited, is typically referred to as a "[[Gate crashing|gatecrasher]]". Such an activity is usually perceived negatively, although more liberal hosts may permit gatecrashers, depending on their behaviour.   

In some instances house parties do not attract large crowds, and with ten or fewer people are often referred to as a 'gathering'.{{Fact|date=August 2015}}

==House parties in history==
An early example of a house party can be seen in the play ''[[Mostellaria]]'' (''The Haunted House'') by the Roman playwright [[Plautus]]. In it a young man called Philolaches is having a great time while his father is away on business.

House parties have become a prominent feature in popular movies, particularly movies aimed at teenagers. While many have probably been present before the movie, ''[[Animal House]]'' is one of the first to properly provide a scene of a house party.

[[File:HowTheWorldWasOne.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]])]]
'''''How the World Was One: Beyond the Global Village''''' is [[Arthur C. Clarke|Arthur&amp;nbsp;C. Clarke]]'s history and survey of the [[communication]]s revolution, published in 1992.  The title includes an intentional pun; in English ''How the World Was Won'' would sound exactly the same. This work is based on an earlier work by Clarke entitled ''Voice Across the Sea'', published in 1958.

[[File:NPosthumus.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolaas Wilhelmus Posthumus|Posthumus]], director (1937-1952) and founding father of the IISH]] 
'''The International Institute of Social History''' (IISG) is one of the largest archives for labour, left and social history in the world. It is an independent scientific institute in [[Amsterdam]]. The IISG is part of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. It was founded in 1935 by [[Nicolaas Wilhelmus Posthumus|Nicolaas Posthumus]]. The large archives of the institute (ca. 50&amp;nbsp;km) harbor invaluable and extensive papers of several international social movements and currents, including papers of individuals such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialhistory.org/en/about/history History of IISG]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the institute ==
The International Institute of Social History was founded in 1935 by [[Nicolaas Wilhelmus Posthumus|Nicolaas Posthumus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergvelt|first1=Ellinoor|last2=Knegtmans|first2=Peter Jan|last3=Schilder|first3=Marian|title=Colourful professors: 375 years of portraiture in the collection of the Universiteit van Amsterdam|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcZfbSRUYjcC&amp;pg=PA121|year=2007|publisher=Amsterdam UP|isbn=9789056294496|pages=120–21|chapter=Nicolaal Wilhelmus Posthumus (1880-1960)}}&lt;/ref&gt; To examine how [[labour movement|labour relations]] develop over time, IISG collected archives from all over the world. During the first years Posthumus succeeded in obtaining many papers from anarchists ([[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]] manuscripts), other [[socialism|socialist]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] and [[Marxist]] movements from Germany and Russia.

Before the [[Germans invaded the Netherlands]] in 1940, Posthumus was able to move the most valuable archives to London. During the war, many remaining IISG archives were transported to Nazi Germany. They were not destroyed. Most of the papers were rediscovered in Hannover in 1946, and some other parts were later found in archives in Moscow in 1991, and returned to Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialhistory.org/en/about/history-iish History of IISG (more)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the International Institute of Social History moved to new premises: an old warehouse at the Cruquiusweg in the eastern part of Amsterdam. This building also housed the [[Press Museum]] but in 2017 that museum became a part of the Dutch Institute for Image and Sound (Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid) in Hilversum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beeldengeluid.nl/organisatie/persmuseum-en-beeld-en-geluid-verder-als-een-organisatie|title=Persmuseum en Beeld en Geluid: Verder als één organisatie|last=|first=|date=27 July 2018|website=Beeld en Geluid|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Archives ==
The personal archives at the International Institute of Social History are extensive, including (among many others) the collections of the papers of [[Diego Abad de Santillán]], [[Alexander Atabekian]], [[Angelica Balabanoff]], [[Bernt Carlsson]], [[Ruth Fischer]],  [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Hilferding]], [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Gustav Landauer]], [[Arthur Lehning]], [[Max Nettlau]], [[Theodor Liebknecht]], [[Toma Sik]], [[Andre Gunder Frank]] and [[Leon Trotsky]].

There are also many institutional archives, among which the archives of the Russian [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], the [[Red Army Faction]] and the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (well over 200 m.). One of its most famous archives are the archives of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and its political arm, the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (FAI). These archives were smuggled out of Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and made their way to Paris branch of the IISG in secret. The archives contain information regarding military activities, correspondence and financial documents. Other anarchist archives were destroyed during the war or remain lost which makes these collection in the IISG all the more valuable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialhistory.org/en/collections/spanish-civil-war-collection-guide|title=Spanish Civil War Collection Guide|last=|first=|date=27 July 2018|website=International Institute of Social History|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the last decades the IISG also acquired the archives of [[Greenpeace]] and [[Amnesty International]].

A related institution is the [[Swiss Social Archives]] in Zurich.

Historian of anarchism [[Paul Avrich]] wrote that the institute is the foremost repository of anarchist documents in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Avrich |first1=Paul |authorlink=Paul Avrich |title=Review of The American as Anarchist: Reflections on Indigenous Radicalism |journal=[[The American Historical Review]] |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=1467–1468 |date=1979 |doi=10.2307/1861661 |issn=0002-8762 |jstor=1861661 }}

The [[interpersonal communication]] that occurs during a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] deterioration/dissolution looks to explain the possible "why" behind the relationship [[breakup]] and the communication steps that a breakup seems to follow. Studies have looked at the predictors of breakups, the breakup process, the strategies employed, the impact of the breakups, and finally the process to move on emotionally from the broken relationship.

==Definition==
Relationship dissolution "refers to the process of the breaking up of relationships (friendship, romantic, or marital relationships) by the voluntary activity of at least one partner." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battaglia|first=D.M.|date=1998|title=Breaking Up is (Relatively) Easy to Do: A Script of the Dissolution of Close Relationships|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-03063-007|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=15|pages=829–845|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;This article examines two types of relationship dissolution, the non-marital breakup and the [[Marital breakdown|marital breakup]]. The differences are how they are experienced, how they must be studied and how they might survive. Nonmarital breakups help us understand the nature of the issues involved and the patterns of [[grief]] experienced, they are meaningful to both persons, creating crisis in [[intimacy]], [[Personal development|personal]] and [[social development]] and future [[Promise|commitment]] expectations. Surviving a nonmarital breakup provides the opportunity to self-discovery, [[generosity]], [[dignity]] and nobility of grief, and the promise of recovery (Weber, 1992). In marital breakups, more negotiation and delayed dissolution may occur because of the presence of children (Johnson, 1982) called a barrier force. Not all breakups should be considered a "failure", because they didn't last long enough or hit yearly marks as dictated by society. Some breakups may serve a distinct, positive change for one of the partners if there is [[abuse]] or other negative factors in the relationship.

==Breakup factors==
No relationship is established with the thought that it will end with [[love sickness|heartache]] and grief, at least experienced by one of the couple. Why do we bother if the common belief is that at least 50% or more marriages end in [[divorce]]? Jones &amp; Burdette, 1994, state in their work that we face two daunting risks when we pursue an [[intimate relationship]] with another: [[Social rejection|rejection]] and [[betrayal]]. This is countered with our social need to belong which usually trumps the risks. Hill, Rubin, and Peplau conducted a study in 1976 where 231 heterosexual couples agreed to complete a [[questionnaire]] about their relationship for two years. Only 128 couples survived the two years together, but it was the information gathered from the 103 couples that provided substantial information on  breakup factors.

===Predictors===
* Dissimilarity among the couples in age, [[education]], and [[physical attraction]]
* Those who said they "loved" each other stayed together compared to those who simply "liked" each other

===Process===
Hill et al. (1976) found that the peak season for a breakup is when there are changes in one's life, which may force the relationship to be examined as to whether it can be sustained over time, distance, or other change in [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Women were more likely to be the initiators of change.

===Impact===
* Men were hit harder by the breakup than the women in the Hill et al. study (1976), they felt more depressed, lonely, unhappy, less free—but less guilty
* Women were less clingy and sentimental, and more pragmatic about the future of the relationship and how it would impact their lives—they had more at stake in finding the right partner

==Duck's topographical model==
[[Steve Duck]] (1981) developed a topographical model of relationship disengagement and dissolution, whether married or not, in which he outlined four models of dissolution: pre-existing doom, mechanical failure, process loss and sudden death.

===Pre-existing doom===
* Couples who are badly  matched from the start, no matter what the [[initiation]] action involved, it could not overcome personal differences

===Mechanical failure===
* When things break, where [[communication]] may be poor or [[Social interaction|interaction]]s go badly. Without communication a relationship will never survive.

===Process loss===
* Relationships that die because they do not reach their potential, albeit a slow death, because of poor [[productivity]] or communication on one or both of the members of the dyad

===Sudden death===
New information on a partner can produce sudden death of the new relationship with a [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] violation. Davis (1973) described three conditions that produce "sudden death" in a relationship: two-sided [[subsidence]], in which both members of the couple maintain a formal relationship with no intimacy; one-sided subsidence, where one partner is dependent and hangs on, while the other actively seeks to end the relationship; and zero-sided subsidence which is an abrupt ending primarily brought on by outside factors that makes retreat or repair impossible.

==Breakup strategies==
There are at least fifteen strategies used to terminate relationships and are set apart by whether they are unilateral or bilateral and indirect or direct (Baxter, 1982, 1984).

===Unilateral and indirect===
* Withdrawal of [[moral support|supportiveness]] and [[affection]]
* Pseudo de-escalation – purports that the relationship will benefit by [[Legal separation|separation]]
* Cost escalation – attempts to make the relationship unattractive to the partner
* Relational ruses – leaking an impending breakup to a friend or third party
* Avoidance behaviors|Avoidance – from complete evasion to decreased contact

===Unilateral and direct===
* The direct dump – simple statement that the relationship is over
* Dates with other people
* Justification – explanation why the relationship is ending
* The relationship talk trick – talking about "problems"
* Threats and [[bullying]]
* Positive tone – painting the picture that "it's nobody's fault, it's just over"
* De-escalation – breaking up to see if the relationship endures

===Bilateral and indirect===
* Fadeaway – both people in the relationship grow apart

===Bilateral and direct===
* The blame game – both partners dissatisfied and blaming each other
* Negotiated farewell – realize problems cannot be solved and negotiate breakup

==Duck's Stages of dissolution==
[[Steve Duck]]'s (1982) four stages of relationship dissolution, each very distinctive with specific components, are moved through once one or both of the partners have crossed a cognitive threshold.

===Intrapsychic stage===
[[Intrapsychic]] stage begins with one partner who is dissatisfied and secretively searches for a way to "fix" the relationship. Vaughan (1986) states that uncoupling begins with a [[secret]], and Duck asserts that the secret of [[unhappiness]] is kept that way through the intrapsychic stage.

===Dyadic stage===
[[Dyad (sociology)|Dyad]]ic stage where the dissatisfied partner decides to fix the problem by confronting the other partner, thus entering into uncharted territory. This may not fix what is wrong and just continue to draw out the relationship until the unhappy partner becomes determined to depart, which will move the relationship into the next phase.

===Social stage===
Social stage is when the partners devise their accounts of how the breakup happened and how they will present it to their [[social circle]]s. If it is in fact the end, they will cross over into the final phase of relationship dissolution.

===Grave-dressing stage===
Grave-dressing stage is simply the "attempt to bury and describe the relationship" stage. Partners now create an acceptable story about their love and loss, do whatever cognitive work, including [[introspection]], [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]], [[rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]], and reassessment of self and other, which is necessary in order to get over the deceased relationship.

==Modification of Duck's Stage Model==
Stephanie Rollie and [[Steve Duck]] (2006) subsequently modified the original model after a critique of stage models that appear to suppose an orderly and relatively conscious progression through the above stages. Proposing instead five phases of breakdown, Rollie and Duck added a Resurrection Phase which was placed after "Grave Dressing" and represented the period of reconfiguration of self and preparation for new relationships.  In the modified proposal, the authors articulated changes to communication patterns and topics that would typify each phase, but clarified that the result of the communication could at any time be not simply progression to the next phase of break up but reversion to an earlier state of the relationship.

==Grief==

===Experience===
Harvey (1996) explains that when you experience a [[Grief|loss]] or a depletion of resources, you may need some time to sort out what you had in the first place, what was given up in the breakup, and what remains for you to rely on, cherish or use. Grief is not a passive experience but a series of active choices for the grieving person to confront and resolve in either the direction of [[healing]] or prolonged suffering (Neeld, 1990).

===Four central tasks of grief===
Weber (1998) outlines the following central tasks for dealing with grief.
# Express your emotions. Expressing [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]] and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]] is one of the central tasks of grief (Leick &amp; Davidsen-Nielsen, 1990). Whether you express it to a sympathetic friend or write down your feelings and thoughts in a journal (Pennebaker, 1990) which can bring long-term benefits, such as greater well-being and emotional recovery.
# What happened? Figuring out what happened by doing the cognitive work to review the relationship but also accept the reasons for the failure. Survivors of a broken relationship should write their own story on what happened (Kingma, 1987) which will provide some [[emotional release]] and a way to cope with the situation. All this is done to provide some closure to the experience.
# Realize, don't idealize. Use various strategies to lessen the pain of the breakup. One strategy is the silent [[ridicule]] where the one left behind imagines a flaw in the other partner and mentally exaggerates it to the point of [[humor]] (Phillips &amp; Judd, 1978). Once the person is seen as human with flaws, it's easier to leave him or her behind.
# Prepare to feel better. If there was a sense that something was wrong for a period of time, it can create a sense of relief when the other shoe finally drops. If the person left can get to the point of laughter over the situation, the [[healing process]] will break the bonds of misery since it's incompatible with self-imposed [[mourning]] (Frankel &amp; Tien, 1993). Look for what was actually funny about the relationship which in turn can accelerate the process of healing.

'''Legislative violence''' broadly refers to any [[violence|violent]] clashes between members of a [[legislature]], often physically, inside the legislature and triggered by divisive issues and tight votes. Such clashes have occurred in many countries across time, and notable incidents still regularly occur.

Although the sight of brawling politicians is incongruous with a legislature's stately image, its occupants, like in any other workplace, are still prone to [[stress (biology)|stress]] and [[anger]]. The confrontational nature of politics, regardless of their location, and the high stakes involved often add to the simmering tensions.&lt;ref name="bbc 2004"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3560977.stm "When politicians attack..."], [[BBC News]], March 23, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|''Morte de Césare'' (Death of Caesar) by [[Vincenzo Camuccini]]]]
Roman general and [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]] was famously [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] by a group of senators on the [[Ides of March]], 44 BC during a meeting of the [[Roman Senate]]. The senators, led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and calling themselves [[Liberatores]], had conspired in secret to kill Caesar and considered various ways to do so. Ultimately, they decided to kill him during a meeting of the senate, since only senators would be allowed in the meeting and Caesar would be alone. The senators drafted a fake petition requesting that Caesar hand over power to senate; Caesar called a meeting of the senate to read it. When Caesar met the senators at the [[Theatre of Pompey]], they stabbed him repeatedly with daggers concealed under their [[toga]]s, killing him. Caesar's assassination led to a [[civil war]] for control of the [[Roman Republic|republic]], ending ultimately with the rise of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] and the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].

In January 1988, there was a riot in the [[Tamil Nadu]] state legislative assembly over a vote of majority for [[Janaki Ramachandran]], who was serving as [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief Minister]] following the death in December 1987 of her husband [[MGR]]. The [[ADMK]] party had split, with most [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLAs]] supporting her and some supporting [[Jayalalithaa]]'s bid to become Chief Minister instead. The [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] party with its 60 MLAs was able to play "kingmaker".&lt;ref name="businessline"&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/rasheeda-bhagat/pepper-spray-pales-against-past-tn-assembly-events/article5690057.ece Both riots]&lt;/ref&gt; While the Congress-led Central Government in New Delhi ordered them to vote against Janaki, some Congress MLAs chose to resign instead, allowing the Janaki government to survive the majority vote. A riot ensued in the legislature, with members clubbing each other with microphone stands and footwear, which was finally ended by riot police who stormed the legislature and beat up everybody with their batons.&lt;ref name="businessline" /&gt; The Janaki faction was however dismissed by the Central Government under [[Article 356]] of the Indian Constitution, having survived just 24 days in office. The state was placed under [[President's rule]] for a year, until the next scheduled state assembly elections in January 1989.

On 25 March 1989, a riot broke out in the state legislative assembly in [[Tamil Nadu]] between members of the ruling [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] party and the now-unified opposition [[ADMK]] party over the reading of the state budget.&lt;ref name="caravan"&gt;[http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/titans-tn-assembly Report]&lt;/ref&gt; In the melee, [[Durai Murugan]] tried to disrobe [[Jayalalithaa]],&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/2003/03/26/stories/2003032605200400.htm 14th anniversary retrospective]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karunanidhi]] had his sunglasses broken,&lt;ref name="thehindu" /&gt; and the budget was torn up by angry rioters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jagoindian.com/jayalalithaa-chief-minister-of-tamil-nadu/ "ADMK members tearing the budget report to be read by the ruling party"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021094709/http://jagoindian.com/jayalalithaa-chief-minister-of-tamil-nadu/ |date=2014-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a dispute over the conduct of British soldiers on [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] on the day before, Independent Socialist MP [[Bernadette Devlin]] punched the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Home Secretary [[Reginald Maudling]]. Her aggression was in response to the comments made by Maudling, who was maintaining that the British Army had fired at Bloody Sunday protesters in self-defence, contrary to the testimonies of civilian eyewitnesses (including Devlin herself). She argued that she was being denied the right to speak. Her actions resulted in her being banned from the House of Commons for six months.

[[File:Lyon-griswold-brawl.jpg|thumb|''Congressional Pugilists'', a 1798 political cartoon depicting the fight between Griswold and Lyon.]]
Federalist Congressman [[Roger Griswold]] of [[Connecticut]] attacked [[Vermont]] Representative [[Matthew Lyon]] with a [[hickory]] walking stick in the chambers of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Griswold struck Lyon repeatedly about the head, shoulders and arms, while Lyon attempted to shield himself from the blows. Lyon then turned and ran to the fireplace, took up a pair of metal tongs, and having armed himself thus returned to the engagement. Griswold then tripped Lyon and struck him in the face while he lay on the ground, at which point the two were separated. After a break of several minutes, however, Lyon unexpectedly pursued Griswold again with the tongs, and the brawl was re-ignited.

The two men had a prior history of conflict. On January 30 of that year, Griswold had publicly insulted Lyon by calling him a coward, and Lyon had retaliated by spitting in Griswold's face. As a result of Lyon's actions in that case, he became the first Congressman to have charges filed against him with that body's ethics committee, although he escaped censure through a vote in the House.

Incensed, he drew a bowie knife and attacked Anthony, who was unable to defend himself despite drawing a knife of his own. Although Wilson was expelled from his office, he was later acquitted of murder.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Joshua.''Washington'' Arcadia Publishing, 2014,  pp.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Arkansas"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2958   accessdate = February 19, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Caning of Charles Sumner}}
Congressman [[Preston Brooks]] of [[South Carolina]] famously assaulted [[Charles Sumner]] of [[Massachusetts]] for a previous speech of his, saying his uncle [[Andrew Butler]] took "a mistress who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight—I mean, the harlot, Slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Brooks (accompanied by Keitt), approached and confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber. As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks began beating Sumner severely on the head with a thick [[gutta-percha]] cane with a gold head before he could reach his feet. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to bash Sumner until he ripped the desk from the floor. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks continued to beat the motionless Sumner until he broke his cane, then quietly left the chamber. Several other senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt, who had jumped into the aisle, brandishing a pistol and shouting, "Let them be!"&lt;ref&gt;Donald, David Herbert ''Charles Sumner and the Coming Civil War'' New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1960, pp.293-96&lt;/ref&gt; Keitt was censured for his actions and resigned in protest, but was overwhelmingly re-elected to his seat by his South Carolina constituency within a month.&lt;ref name="bioguide.congress.gov"&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=K000054 KEITT, Laurence Massillon, (1824–1864)]&lt;/ref&gt; For several decades following, Senators often carried walking [[Walking stick|canes]] and even [[revolver]]s in the Senate Chamber, fearing a similar assault.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Congressman Laurence Keitt of South Carolina was involved in another incident of legislative violence less than two years later, starting a massive brawl on the House floor during a tense late-night debate. Keitt became offended when [[Pennsylvania]] Congressman (and later [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]) [[Galusha A. Grow]] stepped over to the Democratic side of the House chamber while delivering an anti-slavery speech. Keitt dismissively interrupted Grow's speech to demand he sit down, calling him a "black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] puppy". Grow indignantly responded by telling Keitt that “No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me.” Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would "choke him for that". A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. [[Cadwallader Washburn]] of [[Wisconsin]] upended the [[hairpiece]] of Rep. [[William Barksdale]] of [[Mississippi]]. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Filibuster | author=Allan L.

During an anti-slavery speech by Illinois Republican [[Owen Lovejoy]] on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on April 5, 1860, Lovejoy condemned the Democratic Party for its racist views and steadfast support of slavery. As Lovejoy gave his speech condemning the evils of slavery, several of the Democrats present in the audience, such as [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]], grew irate and incensed over Lovejoy's anti-slavery remarks and threatened him with physical harm, brandishing pistols and canes, with several Republicans rushing to Lovejoy's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMEv8DNXVbIC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=%22The+principle+of+enslaving+human+beings+because+they+are+inferior%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YA6W9JoaPr&amp;sig=aO15r4OJEVD8bQUIjM34u42GjXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM9vuXwsrLAhWJeD4KHWvpAUcQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20principle%20of%20enslaving%20human%20beings%20because%20they%20are%20inferior%22&amp;f=false|title=His Brother's Blood: Speeches and Writings, 1838–64|first1=Owen|last1=Lovejoy|first2=William Frederick|last2=Moore|first3=Jane Ann|last3=Moore|first4=Paul|last4=Simon|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Illinois|chapter=Debate on Slavery, Conducted under Hostile Conditions in Congress, April 5, 1860|pages=191–200|isbn=0-252-02919-4|date=2004|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 24 February 1887 ===
The [[Indiana General Assembly]] experienced [[Black Day of the Indiana General Assembly|a massive brawl]] between Democrats and Republicans in the [[Indiana Senate]] and [[Indiana House of Representatives]]. The event began as an attempt by Democratic Governor [[Isaac P. Gray]] to be elected to the United States Senate and his own party’s attempt to thwart him. Gray was a former Republican who had been elected Governor by popular vote but was scorned as a turncoat by his new party, who maneuvered desperately (and unsuccessfully) to try to prevent his eligibility for the Senate seat. When Gray went over the head of the Democrats in arranging a [[midterm election]] for a new Lieutenant Governor, Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected with a majority of the popular vote, a situation the Democrats refused to accept despite a ruling from the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]. The matter came to a head when Robertson attempted to enter the Senate chamber to be sworn in and take his seat presiding over the session; he was attacked, beaten, and thrown bodily from the chamber by the Democrats, who then locked the chamber door, beginning four hours of intermittent mass brawling that spread throughout the [[Indiana Statehouse]]. The fight ended only after Republicans and Democrats began brandishing pistols and threatening to kill each other and the Governor was forced to deploy the [[Indianapolis Police Department]] to restore order. Subsequently, the Republican controlled House of Representatives refused to communicate with the Democratic Senate, ending the legislative session and leading to calls for United States Senators to be [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|elected by popular vote]].

=== 20 February 1902 ===
During a debate on a bill dealing with the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] of [[South Carolina]] accused Senator [[John L. McLaurin]] of South Carolina of "treachery" for siding with the Republicans in support of Philippine annexation, and alleged that McLaurin had been granted control of government patronage in South Carolina. Upon receiving word of this statement, McLaurin entered the Senate Chamber and denounced Tillman, upon which Tillman attacked him. During the fight, other senators were hit by the punches. As a result, the Senate went into closed session to debate the matter. Both senators apologized to the Senate, but almost came to blows immediately thereafter. On February 28, the Senate voted 54 to 12, with 22 abstentions, to [[Censure]] both Tillman and McLaurin. McLaurin did not seek reelection, while Tillman served in the Senate until 1918.

=== 4 March 1985 ===
On the House of Representatives chamber floor, Democrat [[Thomas Downey]] of New York confronted [[Robert Dornan]], a California Republican, and Dornan grabbed Downey's tie in response. Downey approached Dornan in response to a speech Downey had given two days earlier before the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], in which he called Downey a "[[Draft evasion|draft-dodging]] wimp" because of Downey's repeated denouncement of US-backed antigovernment [[Contras]] rebels in [[Nicaragua]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], Downey received a medical deferment from the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] because of a [[perforated eardrum]]. Downey had also been active in protesting the war. The Dornan-Downey beef originated two years earlier, when Downey spoke against Dornan's nomination for a position at the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/03/06/duel-on-the-hill/a66a3746-68c3-471a-8314-c9a30390dd46/|title=Duel on the Hill|last=Romano|first=Lois|date=1985-03-06|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Downey speech was made on Saturday, 2 March. On Monday afternoon, 4 March, Downey confronted Dornan, attracting dozens of viewers. Dornan claims Downey grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around, asking if he had actually called him a wimp. Dornan answered "I did and you are." The exchange became heated, and at some point Dornan accused Downey of having cost him the job two years earlier. According to Downey, as he began to walk away, Dornan grabbed him by the tie and collar and threatened him with "bodily harm." Dornan claimed he was just straightening Downey's tie knot, saying later, "I like all the members to look elegant on the floor, you know." Dornan, according to himself and other witnesses, then told Downey to "get out of my face." After, Downey went to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]] to tell him what had happened.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the incident, Downey released a statement and stated through a spokesman that he would not speak to reporters "until Dornan apologizes." His spokesman also said that Downey was considering filing a complaint with the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|House Sergeant at Arms]]. Several witnesses spoke about the incident. Democratic Congressman [[Mike Lowry]] said, "Dornan grabbed Downey roughly by the collar, and I mean aggressively. None of this straighten-the-tie baloney. And he told Downey, 'Don't let me catch you off the floor, where you are protected by the sergeant at arms.' I really think Downey restrained himself." Republican Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] of New Jersey, who witnessed the altercation, said, "I found it humorous that Downey had to run up to the Speaker when it was over to tell all. It was like a little classroom act . . . Very childish . . . I think he's made much to-do about nothing."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The day after the incident, House Speaker Tip O'Neill condemned the behavior, and said he told Dornan, "You can settle it on the street, but don't settle it on the House floor." He also told reporters that "discipline" would ensue if "anything like that" happened again. That day, Downey stated again, "Congressman Dornan owes me and the House of Representatives an apology." Dornan responded, "Apologize for what? For calling him a wimp? I am willing to concede that perhaps he just walks, talks and acts like a little arrogant wimp. But maybe it's disinformation. Maybe he really wears a black leather jacket by night that I don't know about."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''Lemnian deed''' is the cruel slaughter of someone as revenge. There are two possible origins for this term: the epic of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], where [[Pelasgian Creation Myth|Pelasgian]] women killed their men, and that of Herodotus narrative where the Pelasgians killed captive mothers and children.

As is usual in other nationalistic [[Epic poetry|epics]] as well, other people and tribes are deemed to have barbaric tendencies. Besides, Pelasgians of [[Lemnos]] spoke pre-Greek [[Lemnian language|Lemnian]], and were technologically inferior (as can be seen from the weapons found in burials), which further promoted their primitive nature.

== Jasonian origin ==

It is said that Pelasgian women decided to kill their men, due to the men's cheating with the mainland Thracian women. In anger, the women slaughtered the men in their sleep and lived without men for many years, until [[Jason| Jason and the Argonauts]] arrived during [[Jason#The Quest for the Golden Fleece|The Quest for the Golden Fleece]].
They mingled with the women and created a new race: the [[Minyae]].

== Pelasgian origin ==

Michael Stewart relates the story of [[Herodotus]] thus:&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Michael. "People, Places &amp; Things: Lemnos", Greek Mythology: From the Iliad to the Fall of the Last Tyrant. http://messagenetcommresearch.com/myths/ppt/Lemnos_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The historian, Herodotus, relates the story that when the Pelasgians were driven from Attika (Attica) they kidnapped a number of Athenian women and took them to Lemnos; the women were defiant and taught their children to act and speak like Athenians; the Pelasgians would not accept such rebellious attitudes and killed the captive mothers and children and thus the term Lemnian Deeds became an enduring insult to the honor and manhood of the inhabitants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Arts and culture==

===Food and cooking===
[[File:fortune cookie broken 20040628 223252 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Fortune cookie]]s, despite being associated with Chinese cuisine, were actually invented in Japan&lt;ref name="solving"/&gt; and are almost never eaten in China, where they are seen as American.&lt;ref name="snopesfortunecookie"/&gt;]]

* [[Searing]] meat may cause it to lose moisture in comparison to an equivalent piece of meat cooking without searing. Generally, the value in searing meat is that it creates a brown crust with a rich flavor via the [[Maillard reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookthink.com/reference/7/Does_searing_meat_really_seal_in_moisture|title=Does searing meat really seal in moisture?|publisher=Cookthink.com |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131214115343/http://www.cookthink.com/reference/7/Does_searing_meat_really_seal_in_moisture | archivedate = 2013-12-14| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGee"&gt;{{cite book|author=McGee, Harold|title=On Food and Cooking |edition=Revised|publisher=Scribner|date=2004|isbn=978-0-684-80001-1|page=161}} "The Searing Question".&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cooking with alcohol|Food containing wine or liquor]] retains alcohol even after cooking. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], 75% of the alcohol remains after [[flambé]]ing, 25% after one hour of baking or simmering, and 10% after two hours of baking or simmering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=USDA Table of Nutrient Retention Factors, Release 6 (2007)|url=https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/usda-table-nutrient-retention-factors-release-6-2007 |website=National Agricultural Library |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the amount of alcohol consumed while eating a dish prepared with alcohol will rarely if ever be sufficient to cause even low levels of intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weil|title=Does Alcohol Really Cook Out of Food|url=http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA400900/Does-Alcohol-Really-Cook-Out-of-Food.html|accessdate=August 20, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427083559/http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA400900/Does-Alcohol-Really-Cook-Out-of-Food.html|archivedate=April 27, 2014|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is no consistent data supporting [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) as triggering [[migraine]] headache exacerbation or other symptoms of so-called [[Glutamate flavoring|Chinese restaurant syndrome]]. Although there have been reports of an MSG-sensitive subset of the population, this has not been demonstrated in [[Placebo-controlled study|placebo-controlled]] trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tarasoff|first=L.|date=December 1993|title=Monosodium L-glutamate: A double-blind study and review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027869159390012N|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1019–35|doi=10.1016/0278-6915(93)90012-N|pmid=8282275|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freeman |first=M. |date=October 2006 |title=Reconsidering the effects of monosodium glutamate: A literature review |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=482–86 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-7599.2006.00160.x |pmid=16999713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Poisoned candy myths]] have been "thoroughly debunked". No cases of strangers killing or permanently injuring children this way have been proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xOb-19lXx8C|title=Encyclopedia of Urban Legends|last=Brunvand|first=Jan Harold|date=2012-01-01|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598847208|page=288|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Microwave ovens====
* [[Microwave ovens]] do not heat food by operating at a special resonance of water molecules in the food. The functional principle of a microwave oven is [[dielectric heating]] rather than resonance frequencies of water, and microwave ovens can therefore operate at many frequencies. Water molecules are exposed to intense electromagnetic fields in strong non-resonant microwaves to create heat. The 22&amp;nbsp;GHz resonant frequency of isolated water molecules has a wavelength too short to penetrate common foodstuffs to useful depths. The typical oven frequency of [[ISM band|2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz]] was chosen partly due to its ability to penetrate a food object of reasonable size, and partly to avoid interference with communication frequencies in use when microwave ovens became commercially available.&lt;ref name="microwave"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloomfield, Louis |url=http://www.howeverythingworks.org/page1.php?QNum=1456 |title=Question 1456 |publisher=How Everything Works |accessdate=February 9, 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131017005928/http://www.howeverythingworks.org/page1.php?QNum=1456 | archivedate = 2013-10-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Microwave ovens]] do not cook food from the inside out. 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz microwaves can only penetrate approximately {{convert|1|cm|sp=us}} into most foods. The inside portions of thicker foods are mainly heated by heat conducted from the outer portions.&lt;ref name="Püschner"&gt;{{cite web |title=Microwave Technology Penetration Depths |url=http://www.pueschner.com/en/microwave-technology/penetration-depths |website=pueschner.com |publisher=Püschner GMBH + CO KG MicrowavePowerSystems |accessdate=1 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Health |first1=Center for Devices and Radiological |title=Resources for You (Radiation-Emitting Products) - Microwave Oven Radiation |url=https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/ResourcesforYouRadiationEmittingProducts/ucm252762.htm |website=fda.gov |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=1 June 2018 |language=en |date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law, crime, and military===
* It is rarely necessary to wait 24&amp;nbsp;hours before filing a [[missing person]] report. In instances where there is evidence of violence or of an unusual absence, law enforcement agencies in the United States often stress the importance of beginning an investigation promptly.&lt;ref name="missingperson"&gt;

* No one ever claimed in court that [[Twinkie defense|Twinkies made them commit a crime]]. In the murder trial of [[Dan White]], the defense attorneys successfully argued [[diminished capacity]] as a result of severe depression.

===Religion===

====Buddhism====
* The [[Gautama Buddha|historical Buddha]] was not obese. The "chubby Buddha" or "laughing Buddha" is a 10th-century Chinese folk hero by the name of [[Budai]]. In Chinese Buddhist culture, Budai came to be revered as an [[incarnation]] of [[Maitreya]], the [[Bodhisattva]] who will become a Buddha to restore Buddhism after the teachings of the historical Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]], have been forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddha/a/laughingbuddha.htm|title=The Laughing Buddha|accessdate=January 6, 2011|publisher=about.com | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412011304/http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddha/a/laughingbuddha.htm | archivedate = 2014-04-12| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Buddha is not a god. In early Buddhism, Siddhārtha Gautama possessed no [[Salvation|salvific]] powers and strongly encouraged "self-reliance, self-discipline and individual striving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot01.htm|title=Buddhism – Major Differences |accessdate=January 6, 2011|publisher=Buddhanet.net | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131017021112/http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot01.htm | archivedate = 2013-10-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in later developments of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna Buddhism]], notably in the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land (Jìngtǔ)]] school of Chinese Buddhism, the [[Amitābha|Amitābha Buddha]] was thought to be a savior. Through faith in the Amitābha Buddha, one could be reborn in the [[Pure Land|western Pure Land]]. Although in Pure Land Buddhism the Buddha is considered a savior, he is still not considered a god in the common understanding of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/b3schchn.htm|title=The Chinese Buddhist Schools|accessdate=January 6, 2011|publisher=Buddhanet.net | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131214105638/http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/b3schchn.htm | archivedate = 2013-12-14| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity and Judaism====
[[File:Jan_Brueghel_de_Oude_en_Peter_Paul_Rubens_-_Het_aards_paradijs_met_de_zondeval_van_Adam_en_Eva.jpg|thumb|Often shown as an apple in art, the fruit in the [[Garden of Eden]] is not named in ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''.&lt;ref name="Szpek"/&gt;]]
* The [[forbidden fruit]] mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] is never identified as an [[apple]],&lt;ref name="Szpek"&gt;{{cite book|title=Voices from the University: The Legacy of the Hebrew Bible|author=Szpek, Heidi|page=92|isbn=978-0-595-25619-8|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; a misconception widely depicted in Western art. The original Hebrew texts mention only ''tree'' and ''fruit''. Early Latin translations use the word ''mali'', which can be taken to mean both "evil" and "apple". In early Germanic languages the word "apple" and its cognates usually meant simply "fruit". German and French artists commonly depict the fruit as an apple from the 12th century onwards, and [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'' from 1644 explicitly mentions the fruit as an apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Straight Dope: Was the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden an apple?|author=Adams, Cecil|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2682/was-the-forbidden-fruit-in-the-garden-of-eden-an-apple|accessdate=January 15, 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140401002830/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2682/was-the-forbidden-fruit-in-the-garden-of-eden-an-apple | archivedate = 2014-04-01| deadurl=no|date=2006-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish scholars have suggested that the fruit could have been a grape, a fig, wheat, an apricot, or an [[etrog]].&lt;ref name="forbidden"&gt;

* The idea that [[Mary Magdalene]] was a prostitute before she met Jesus is not found in the Bible or in any of the other earliest Christian writings.

Nonetheless, the number of distinct words you can derive from them is not 50, or 150, or 1500, or a million, but simply unbounded. Only stamina sets a limit.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The seven most common English words for snow are ''snow'', ''hail'', ''sleet'', ''ice'', ''icicle'', ''slush'', and ''snowflake''. English also has the related word ''glacier'' and the four common skiing terms ''pack'', ''powder'', ''crud'', and ''crust'', so one can say that at least 12 distinct words for snow exist in English.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Ancient Greek sculpture]]s were [[Ancient Greek sculpture#Painting of sculpture|originally painted bright colors]]; they only appear white today because the original pigments have deteriorated.

* The ancient Greeks did not use the word "[[idiot]]" to disparage people who did not participate in civic life or who did not vote. An ἰδιώτης was simply a private citizen as opposed to a government official. Later, the word came to mean any sort of non-expert or layman, then someone uneducated or ignorant, and much later to mean stupid or mentally deficient.&lt;ref&gt;A.W.

===Middle Ages and Renaissance===
* It is true that [[life expectancy]] in the Middle Ages and earlier was low; however, one should not infer that people usually died around the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laden |first=Greg |url=http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/05/01/falsehood-if-this-was-the-ston/ |title=Falsehood: "If this was the Stone Age, I'd be dead by now" – Greg Laden's Blog |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |date=May 1, 2011 |accessdate=December 23, 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140330055100/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/05/01/falsehood-if-this-was-the-ston/ | archivedate = 2014-03-30| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, earlier low life expectancies were very strongly influenced by high infant mortality, and the life expectancy of people who lived to adulthood was much higher. A 21-year-old man in medieval England, for example, could by one estimate expect to live to the age of 64.&lt;ref name="apps.business.ualberta.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.business.ualberta.ca/rfield/lifeexpectancy.htm |title="Expectations of Life" by H.O.

* There is no evidence that [[Vikings]] wore [[Horned helmet|horns on their helmets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World History: Societies of the Past |last=Kahn |first=Charles |date=2005 |publisher=Portage &amp; Main Press |isbn=978-1-55379-045-7 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gEXCIH4tek8C|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the image of Vikings wearing horned helmets stems from the [[scenography]] of an 1876 production of the ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' opera cycle by [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frank|first=F.|title=The Invention of the Viking Horned Helmet|date=2000|publisher=International Scandinavian and Medieval Studies in Memory of Gerd Wolfgang Weber|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/51267328/Frank-Invention-of-Horned-Helmet|ref=harv| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142627/http://www.scribd.com/doc/51267328/Frank-Invention-of-Horned-Helmet | archivedate = 2014-04-13| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vikings did not [[Vikings#Use of skulls as drinking vessels|drink out of the skulls of vanquished enemies]]. This was based on a mistranslation of the [[skald]]ic poetic use of ''ór bjúgviðum hausa'' (branches of skulls) to refer to [[drinking horn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;E. W. Gordon, ''Introduction to Old Norse'' (2nd edition, Oxford 1962) pp. lxix–lxx.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vikings did not [[Names of Iceland|name Iceland]] "[[Iceland]]" as a ploy to discourage others from settling it. [[Naddodd]] and [[Hrafna-Flóki Vilgerðarson]] both saw snow and ice on the island when they traveled there, giving the island its name.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Andrew. [https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/iceland-greenland-name-swap/ "Is Iceland Really Green and Greenland Really Icy?"], ''[[National Geographic]]'' (June 30, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

* There is no evidence that [[Iron maiden (torture)|iron maidens]] were invented in the [[Middle Ages]] or even used for torture. Instead they were pieced together in the 18th century from several [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] found in museums in order to create spectacular objects intended for (commercial) exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Wolfgang| last = Schild| date = 2000| title = Die eiserne Jungfrau.

* The [[plate armor]] of European soldiers did not stop soldiers from moving around or necessitate a crane to get them into a saddle. They would as a matter of course fight on foot and could mount and dismount without help. In fact, soldiers equipped with plate armor were more mobile than those with [[Mail (armour)|mail armor]] (chain armor), as mail was heavier and required stiff padding beneath due to its pliable nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breiding|first=Dirk|title=Department of Arms and Armor, The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aams/hd_aams.htm#weight_b|publisher=metmuseum.org|accessdate=February 23, 2012|ref=harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140426172847/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aams/hd_aams.htm | archivedate = 2014-04-26| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is true that armor used in tournaments in the late Middle Ages was significantly heavier than that used in warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madeofwynn.net/2012/10/08/medieval-anachronisms-part-3-cranes-hoisting-armored-knights/ |title=Cranes hoisting armored knights| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210602/http://madeofwynn.net/2012/10/08/medieval-anachronisms-part-3-cranes-hoisting-armored-knights/ | archivedate = 2013-10-29| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may have contributed to this misconception.
* Whether [[chastity belt]]s, devices designed to prevent women from having [[sexual intercourse]], were invented in [[medieval]] times is disputed by modern historians. Most existing chastity belts are now thought to be deliberate fakes or anti-masturbatory devices from the 19th and early 20th centuries. The latter were made due to the [[History of masturbation#Health concerns|widespread belief that masturbation could lead to insanity]], and were mostly bought by parents for their teenage children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Misconceptions About the Middle Ages|last=Keyser|first=Linda Migl|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|editor-last=Harris|editor-first=Stephen J.|chapter=The Medieval Chastity Belt Unbuckled|ref=have|editor2-last=Grigsby|editor2-first=Bryon L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
* Contrary to the popular image of the [[Pilgrim Fathers]], the early settlers of the [[Plymouth Colony]] in North America did not wear all black, and their [[capotain]]s (hats) were shorter and rounder than the widely depicted tall hat with a buckle on it. Instead, their fashion was based on that of the late [[Elizabethan era]]: [[doublet (clothing)|doublets]], [[jerkin (garment)|jerkins]] and [[ruff (clothing)|ruffs]]. Both men and women wore the same style of shoes, stockings, capes, coats and hats in a range of colors including reds, yellows, purples, and greens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ccsd.k12.wy.us/techcurr/social%20studies/05/0101pilcloth.html |title=Plymouth Colony Clothing |publisher=Web.ccsd.k12.wy.us |accessdate=February 9, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022032249/http://web.ccsd.k12.wy.us/techcurr/social%20studies/05/0101pilcloth.html |archivedate=October 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Plimoth Plantation]] historian James W.

* [[Marie Antoinette]] did not say "[[let them eat cake]]" when she heard that the French peasantry were starving due to a shortage of bread. The phrase was first published in Rousseau's ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' when Marie was only nine years old and most scholars believe that [[Rousseau]] coined it himself, or that it was said by [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria-Theresa]], the wife of [[Louis XIV]]. Even Rousseau (or Maria-Theresa) did not use the exact words but actually ''Qu'ils mangent de la brioche'', "Let them eat [[brioche]]" (a rich type of bread).

This is due to a variety of reasons only weakly dependent on the color of the blood, including [[subsurface scattering]] of light through the skin, and human color perception. 2) Many diagrams use colors to show the difference between veins (usually shown in blue) and [[arteries]] (usually shown in red).&lt;ref name="blood"&gt;

* [[Shaving]] does not cause [[terminal hair]] to grow back thicker (more dense) or darker. This belief is due to hair which has never been cut having a tapered end, whereas after cutting the edge is blunt and therefore thicker than the tapered ends; the cut hair appears to be thicker and feels coarser due to the sharper, unworn edges. The shorter hairs being less flexible than longer hairs also contributes to this effect.&lt;ref name="shaving"&gt;

Also, while Bernoulli's principle allows us to compare fluid speeds and pressures along a single streamline and... along two different streamlines that originate under identical fluid conditions, using Bernoulli's principle to compare the air above and below the curved paper in Figure 1 is nonsensical; in this case, there aren't any streamlines at all below the paper!"

* "The well-known demonstration of the phenomenon of lift by means of lifting a page cantilevered in one's hand by blowing horizontally along it is probably more a demonstration of the forces inherent in the Coanda effect than a demonstration of Bernoulli's law; for, here, an air jet issues from the mouth and attaches to a curved (and, in this case pliable) surface. The upper edge is a complicated vortex-laden mixing layer and the distant flow is quiescent, so that Bernoulli's law is hardly applicable."

''AERONAUTICS An Educator's Guide with Activities in Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education'' by NASA p. 26 http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/58152main_Aeronautics.Educator.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bernoulli's principle predicts that the decrease in pressure is associated with an increase in speed, i.e. that as the air passes over the paper it speeds up and moves faster than it was moving when it left the demonstrator's mouth. But this is not apparent from the demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;'"Demonstrations" of Bernoulli's principle are often given as demonstrations of the physics of lift. They are truly demonstrations of lift, but certainly not of Bernoulli's principle.' David F Anderson &amp; Scott Eberhardt ''Understanding Flight'' p. 229 https://books.google.com/books?id=52Hfn7uEGSoC&amp;pg=PA229
* "As an example, take the misleading experiment most often used to "demonstrate" Bernoulli's principle. Hold a piece of paper so that it curves over your finger, then blow across the top. The paper will rise. However most people do not realize that the paper would NOT rise if it was flat, even though you are blowing air across the top of it at a furious rate. Bernoulli's principle does not apply directly in this case. This is because the air on the two sides of the paper did not start out from the same source. The air on the bottom is ambient air from the room, but the air on the top came from your mouth where you actually increased its speed without decreasing its pressure by forcing it out of your mouth. As a result the air on both sides of the flat paper actually has the same pressure, even though the air on the top is moving faster. The reason that a curved piece of paper does rise is that the air from your mouth speeds up even more as it follows the curve of the paper, which in turn lowers the pressure according to Bernoulli."

* The [[Coriolis effect]] does not cause water to consistently drain from basins in a clockwise/counter-clockwise direction depending on the hemisphere. Rotation is determined by what ever minor rotation is initially present at the time the water starts to drain. The Coriolis force can impact the direction of the flow of water but only in rare circumstances. The water has to be so still that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container and the externally applied torques (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) have to be very small.

'''Litigation public relations''' is the management of the [[Public relations|communication process]] during the course of any [[Legal case|legal dispute]] or [[Adjudication|adjudicatory]] processing so as to affect the outcome or its impact on the client’s overall [[reputation]] (Haggerty, 2003).

==Background==

[[Plaintiff]]s and [[prosecutor]]s have long used mass media to get their side of the story out to the public, but the formal practice of litigation PR, a sub-specialty of crisis communication, first emerged in the early 1980s with [[Alan Hilburg]], a pioneer in litigation communications representation of [[Tobacco industry|U.S. Tobacco]] in the [[Marsee case]]. Since then, the need for litigation PR has grown tremendously as media coverage of court cases and the law has increased. Most parties to a lawsuit have important interests that expand beyond legal concerns. Negative publicity about a litigant can cause damage to an individuals reputation that a courtroom win years later may not salvage. Thus, parties to cases, whether civil or criminal, can not ignore the impact of negative publicity on public opinion (Reber, Gower, &amp; Robinson, 2006).

==Definition of Litigation PR==

'''Litigation PR''' is the management of the communication process prior to and during the course of any legal dispute or adjudicatory processing so as to affect the outcome or its impact on the client’s overall reputation (Haggerty, 2003).

'''Basic Concepts of Litigation Public Relations—'''

'''The First Concept—''''''Litigation PR''' is to influence the outcome of the court case by encouraging early or favorable settlement or by pressuring the prosecution into bringing lesser or no charges (Haggerty, 2003).

'''The Second Concept—''''''Litigation PR''' is to protect the client’s reputation before and during the trial. In this regard, litigation PR is akin to reputation management. Reputation management is about managing public perception of an organization or individual. It is about attitude toward the individual and not knowledge itself. An essential aspect of reputation management is influencing attitude about the individual and corporation, which can encourage positive activation to the benefit of the organization (Haywood, 2002).

==Litigation PR and Media Coverage==

Litigation PR on the part of [[defendant]]s is needed, especially in high-profile cases because the media have an inherent bias in favor of plaintiffs and prosecutors. When allegations are made public, the media tend to cast the lawsuit in terms of victim versus villain. News stories frequently lead with the plaintiff or prosecutors’ allegations. If the defendant’s responses are included at all, they appear well into the story. Thus, the defendant is forced on the defensive from the outset. In such situation, “working with the media to create more balanced, accurate, and less sensational coverage of a lawsuit is necessary element in defending high profile defendants" (Hantler, Schwartz, &amp; Goldberg, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;8).

==Fitzpatrick’s Six Objectives of Litigation Public Relations==

# Counteracting negative publicity. 
# Making a client’s viewpoint known.
# Ensuring balanced media coverage.
# Helping the media and the public understand complex legal issues.
# Defusing a hostile environment.
# Helping resolve the conflict (Fitzpatrick, 1996).

To achieve those objectives, the first step is to establish credibility with the media as an information source. The next step is to control the flow of information to the media so that the right message gets out. The third step is to develop a message that supports the client’s position and get that message out to the media and the public (Fitzpatrick, 1996, Haggerty, 2003, Reber, Gower, &amp; Robinson, 2006).

==Differences between Litigation PR and Other PR Practices==

*Litigation PR is highly dependent on the media. Although the practice of PR involves far more than just mediated communication, litigation PR remains dependent on the media. It is because of the media’s increased attention to lawsuits that litigation PR has become a necessity for many high-profile clients (Gibson, 1998).
*Because typical public relations campaign strategies and tactics may not be appropriate and may even be harmful at certain times during a lawsuit, the legal strategy must take procedure (Schweitzer, 2003). 
*Litigation PR is more regulated than regular public relations because of the potential to prejudice the legal process (Gibson, 1998).
*Litigation PR is directed with the emphasis of one-way, asymmetrical communication. Because the law is adversarial in nature, creating a win-lose situation, the goal of litigation PR is to reinforce the legal strategy and theory of the case to ensure a win and to reduce damage to the organization’s credibility and reputation (Reber, Gower, &amp; Robinson, 2006).

'''Matriarchy''' is a [[social system]] in which females (most notably in mammals) hold the primary power positions in roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], [[social privilege]] and control of property at the specific exclusion of males — at least to a large degree.

While those definitions apply in general English, definitions specific to the disciplines of [[anthropology]] and [[feminism]] differ in some respects. Most anthropologists hold that there are no known anthropological societies ''that are unambiguously matriarchal'', but some authors believe exceptions may exist or may have.

Matriarchies may also be confused with [[matrilineality|matrilineal]], [[matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], and [[matrifocal family|matrifocal]] societies. A few people consider any non-[[patriarchy|patriarchal]] system to be matriarchal, thus including genderally equalitarian systems ([[Peggy Reeves Sanday]] favors redefining and reintroducing the word matriarchy, especially in reference to contemporary matrilineal societies such as the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday, anthropologist, [http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100164210 Women at the Center: Life in a Modern Matriarchy], [[Cornell University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;), but most academics exclude them from matriarchies strictly defined.

In 19th-century Western scholarship, the hypothesis of matriarchy representing an early, mainly prehistoric, stage of human development gained popularity. Possibilities of so-called primitive societies were cited and the hypothesis survived into the 20th century, including in the context of [[second-wave feminism]]. This hypothesis was criticized by some authors such as Cynthia Eller in ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' and remains as a largely unsolved question to this day. Some older myths describe matriarchies.

Several modern feminists have advocated for matriarchy now or in the future and it has appeared in [[List of feminist literature|feminist literature]]. In several theologies, matriarchy has been portrayed as negative.

== Definitions, connotations, and etymology ==

Most academics exclude egalitarian nonpatriarchal systems from matriarchies more strictly defined. According to [[Heide Göttner-Abendroth]], a reluctance to accept the existence of matriarchies might be based on a specific culturally biased notion of how to define matriarchy: because in a [[patriarchy]] men rule over women, a matriarchy has frequently been conceptualized as women ruling over men,&lt;ref name="MatriarchalSocDefTheory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Göttner-Abendroth | first = Heide | author-link = Heide Göttner-Abendroth | title = Matriarchal Society: Definition and Theory | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130419055107/http://www.gift-economy.com/athanor/athanor_005.html | archive-date = 19 April 2013 | url = http://www.gift-economy.com/athanor/athanor_005.html }}&lt;br /&gt;

The word matriarchy, for a society politically led by females, especially mothers, who also control property, is often interpreted to mean the genderal opposite of patriarchy, but it is not an opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, in ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (online), entry patriarchy to entry ''matriarchy'', both as accessed November 3, 2013.{{Subscription or libraries|sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1995|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;161–162 &amp; 184 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;84}} (p.&amp;nbsp;184 n.&amp;nbsp;84 probably citing Spretnak, Charlene, ed., ''Politics of Women's Spirituality: Essays on the Rise of Spiritual Power Within the Feminist Movement'' (Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, 1982), p.&amp;nbsp;xiii (Spretnak, Charlene, ''Introduction'')).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goettner-Abendroth|2009a|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peoples and Bailey, the view of anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday is that matriarchies are not a mirror form of patriarchies but rather that a matriarchy "emphasizes maternal meanings where 'maternal symbols are linked to social practices influencing the lives of both sexes and where women play a central role in these practices{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peoples|Bailey|2012|pp=258-259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Margot Adler]] wrote, "literally,&amp;nbsp;... ["''matriarchy''"] means government by mothers, or more broadly, government and power in the hands of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=193}} (italics so in original)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Love]] and Elizabeth Shanklin wrote, "by 'matriarchy,' we mean a non-alienated society: a society in which women, those who produce the next generation, define motherhood, determine the conditions of motherhood, and determine the environment in which the next generation is reared."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Love|Shanklin|1983|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cynthia Eller]], "'matriarchy' can be thought of&amp;nbsp;... as a shorthand description for any society in which women's power is equal or superior to men's and in which the culture centers around values and life events described as 'feminine.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2000|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eller wrote that the idea of matriarchy mainly rests on two pillars, romanticism and modern social criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2011}} {{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of matriarchy was meant to describe something like a utopia placed in the past in order to legitimate contemporary social criticism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} With respect to a [[#Paleolithic and Neolithic Ages|prehistoric matriarchal Golden Age]], according to Barbara Epstein, "matriarchy&amp;nbsp;... means a social system organized around matriliny and goddess worship in which women have positions of power."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Epstein|1991|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;173 and see p.&amp;nbsp;172}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adler, in the Marxist tradition, it usually refers to a pre-class society "where women and men share equally in production and power."&lt;ref name="DrawDnMoon-2006-p194"&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Adler, "a number of feminists note that few definitions of the word [matriarchy], despite its literal meaning, include any concept of power, and they suggest that centuries of oppression have made it impossible for women to conceive of themselves with such power."&lt;ref name="DrawDnMoon-2006-p194" /&gt;

Matriarchy has often been presented as negative, in contrast to patriarchy as natural and inevitable for society, thus that matriarchy is hopeless. Love and Shanklin wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we hear the word "matriarchy", we are conditioned to a number of responses: that matriarchy refers to the past and that matriarchies have never existed; that matriarchy is a hopeless fantasy of female domination, of mothers dominating children, of women being cruel to men. Conditioning us negatively to matriarchy is, of course, in the interests of patriarchs. We are made to feel that patriarchy is natural; we are less likely to question it, and less likely to direct our energies to ending it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Love|Shanklin|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Matriarchal Studies school led by Göttner-Abendroth calls for an even more inclusive redefinition of the term: Göttner-Abendroth defines ''Modern Matriarchal Studies'' as the "investigation and presentation of non-patriarchal societies", effectively defining matriarchy as non-patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/goettnerabendroth.html ''Introduction'', in ''Second World Congress on Matriarchal Studies''].&lt;/ref&gt; She has also defined matriarchy as characterized by the sharing of power equally between the two genders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matriarchy.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=83 DeMott, Tom, ''The Investigator'' (review of Bennholdt-Thomsen, Veronika, Cornelia Giebeler, Brigitte Holzer, &amp; Marina Meneses, ''Juchitán, City of Women'' (Mexico: Consejo Editorial, 1994))], as accessed Feb. 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diane LeBow, "matriarchal societies are often described as&amp;nbsp;... egalitarian&amp;nbsp;...",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|LeBow|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; although anthropologist Ruby Rohrlich has written of "the centrality of women in an egalitarian society."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Feminist anthropology]], an approach to anthropology that tries to reduces male bias in the field}}

=== Intergenerational relationships ===
Some people who sought evidence for the existence of a matriarchy often mixed matriarchy with anthropological terms and concepts describing specific arrangements in the field of family relationships and the organization of family life, such as matrilineality and matrilocality. These terms refer to intergenerational relationships (as matriarchy may), but do not distinguish between males and females insofar as they apply to specific arrangements for sons as well as daughters from the perspective of their relatives on their mother's side. Accordingly, these concepts do not represent matriarchy as 'power of women over men'.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, Gary, Wenda Trevathan, &amp; Janet Levy, ''Anthropology: An Applied Perspective'' (Minneapolis: West Publishing Co., 1992), p.&amp;nbsp;360.{{Verify source|type=title or year|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In our society, women are the center of all things. Nature, we believe, has given women the ability to create; therefore it is only natural that women be in positions of power to protect this function....We traced our clans through women; a child born into the world assumed the clan membership of its mother. Our young women were expected to be physically strong....The young women received formal instruction in traditional planting....Since the Iroquois were absolutely dependent upon the crops they grew, whoever controlled this vital activity wielded great power within our communities. It was our belief that since women were the givers of life they naturally regulated the feeding of our people....In all countries, real wealth stems from the control of land and its resources. Our Iroquois philosophers knew this as well as we knew natural law. To us it made sense for women to control the land since they were far more sensitive to the rhythms of the Mother Earth. We did not own the land but were custodians of it. Our women decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used....In our political system, we mandated full equality. Our leaders were selected by a caucus of women before the appointments were subject to popular review....Our traditional governments are composed of an equal number of men and women. The men are chiefs and the women clan-mothers....As leaders, the women closely monitor the actions of the men and retain the right to veto any law they deem inappropriate....Our women not only hold the reigns of political and economic power, they also have the right to determine all issues involving the taking of human life. Declarations of war had to be approved by the women, while treaties of peace were subject to their deliberations.&lt;ref name="IroquoisCultureCommentary-p53-p55" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== By chronology ===

==== Earliest prehistory and undated ====
The controversy surrounding prehistoric or "primal" matriarchy began in reaction to the book by Bachofen, ''Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World'', in 1861. Several generations of ethnologists were inspired by his pseudo-evolutionary theory of archaic matriarchy. Following him and [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], several generations of scholars, usually arguing from known myths or oral traditions and examination of Neolithic female cult-figures, suggested that many ancient societies might have been matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware. According to Uwe Wesel, Bachofen's myth interpretations have proved to be untenable.&lt;ref&gt;Wesel, Uwe, ''Der Mythos vom Matriarchat. Über Bachofens Mutterrecht und die Stellung von Frauen in frühen Gesellschaften'' (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1980).{{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was further investigated by Lewis Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/morgan-lewis/ancient-society/ancient-society.zip Morgan, L., ''Ancient Society Or Researches in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization''].&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers studied the phenomenon of matriarchy afterward, but the basis was laid by the classics of sociology. The notion of a "woman-centered" society was developed by Bachofen, whose three-volume ''Myth, Religion, and Mother Right'' (1861) impacted the way classicists such as Harrison, [[Arthur Evans]], [[Walter Burkert]], and [[James Mellaart]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/books?id=reU63yfgrWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;source=gbs_slider_thumb#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Ruether, Rosemary Radford, ''Goddesses and the Divine Feminine: A Western Religious History''], p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the evidence of [[matriarchal religion]] in pre-Hellenic societies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3qhQuWPNUckC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bachofen&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ei=NEFQTMugHsT68AbzvImIAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Bachofen, Johann Jakob, ''Myth, Religion, and Mother Right''].{{Page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Susan Mann]], as of 2000, "few scholars these days find&amp;nbsp;...

The following excerpts from Lewis Morgan's ''Ancient Society'' will explain the use of the terms: "In a work of vast research, Bachofen has collected and discussed the evidence of female authority, mother-right, and of female rule, gynecocracy."{{Page needed|date=November 2013}} "Common lands and joint tillage would lead to joint-tenant houses and communism in living; so that gyneocracy seems to require for its creation, descent in the female line. Women thus entrenched in large households, supplied from common stores, in which their own gens so largely predominated in numbers, would produce the phenomena of mother right and gyneocracy, which Bachofen has detected and traced with the aid of fragments of history and of tradition."{{Page needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Friedrich Engels]], in 1884, claimed that, in the earliest stages of human social development, there was group marriage and that therefore paternity was disputable, whereas maternity was not, so that a family could be traced only through the female line, and claimed that this was connected with the dominance of women over men or a ''Mutterrecht'', which notion Engels took from Bachofen, who claimed, based on his interpretations of myths, that myths reflected a memory of a time when women dominated over men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engels|1984}} {{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bachofen, Johann Jakob, ''Das Mutterrecht.

Austrian writer Bertha Diener, also known as Helen Diner, wrote ''Mothers and Amazons'' (1930), which was the first work to focus on women's cultural history. Hers is regarded as a classic of feminist matriarchal study.&lt;ref name="Dinner party"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/helen_diner.php ''Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: The Dinner Party: Heritage Floor: Helen Diner'' (Brooklyn, N.Y.: Brooklyn Museum, last updated March 27, 2007)], as accessed March, 2008, &amp; November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Her view is that in the past all human societies were matriarchal; then, at some point, most shifted to patriarchal and degenerated. The controversy was reinforced further by the publication of ''[[The White Goddess]]'' by Robert Graves (1948) and his later analysis of classical Greek mythology and the vestiges of earlier myths that had been rewritten after a profound change in the religion of Greek civilization that occurred within its very early historical times. From the 1950s, Marija Gimbutas developed a theory of an ''[[Old European culture]]'' in Neolithic Europe which had matriarchal traits, replaced by the patriarchal system of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] with the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] beginning in the [[Bronze Age]]. According to Epstein, anthropologists in the 20th century said that "the goddess worship or matrilocality that evidently existed in many paleolithic societies was not necessarily associated with matriarchy in the sense of women's power over men. Many societies can be found that exhibit those qualities along with female subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Epstein|1991|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1970s, these ideas were taken up by popular writers of second-wave feminism and expanded with the speculations of [[Margaret Murray]] on [[witchcraft]], by the [[Goddess movement]], and in [[feminist Wicca]], as well as in works by Eisler, [[Elizabeth Gould Davis]], and [[Merlin Stone]].

"A Golden Age of matriarchy" was, according to Epstein, prominently presented by [[Charlene Spretnak]] and "encouraged" by Stone and Eisler,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Epstein|1991|pp=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, at least for the [[Neolithic]] Age, has been denounced as feminist wishful thinking in ''[[The Inevitability of Patriarchy]]'', ''[[Why Men Rule]]'', ''Goddess Unmasked'',&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Philip G., ''Goddess Unmasked'' (N.Y.: Spence Publishing, 1998 ({{ISBN|0-9653208-9-8}})); [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54600098.html Sheaffer, R., ''Skeptical Inquirer'' (1999) (review)].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' and is not emphasized in [[third-wave feminism]]. According to Eller, Gimbutas had a large part in constructing a myth of historical matriarchy by examining [[Eastern Europe]]an cultures that she asserts, by and large, never really bore any resemblance in character to the alleged universal matriarchy suggested by Gimbutas and Graves. She asserts that in "actually documented primitive societies" of recent (historical) times, paternity is never ignored and that the sacred status of goddesses does not automatically increase female social status, and believes that this affirms that utopian matriarchy is simply an inversion of [[antifeminism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

{{Refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
According to Rohrlich, "many scholars are convinced that Crete was a matriarchy, ruled by a queen-priestess"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=36}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;37 ("Minoan matriarchate" (subquoting, at p.&amp;nbsp;37 n.&amp;nbsp;7, Thomson, George, ''The Prehistoric Aegean'' (N.Y.: Citadel Press, 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;450)), Baruch, Elaine Hoffman, ''Introduction'', in Pt. Four (''Visions of Utopia''), in {{harvp|Rohrlich|Baruch|1984|p=207}} ("matriarchal societies, particularly Minoan Crete"), and {{harvp|Rohrlich|1984|p=6}} ("the Minoan matriarchy" &amp; "Minoan Crete").&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Cretan civilization" was "matriarchal" before "1500 B.C.," when it was overrun and colonized.&lt;ref&gt;Three quotations: {{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to Rohrlich, "in the early Sumerian city-states 'matriarchy seems to have left something more than a trace.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=39}}, quoting Thomson, George, ''The Prehistoric Aegean'' (N.Y.: Citadel Press, 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt;

One common misconception among historians of the Bronze Age such as Stone and Eisler is the notion that the [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semites]] were matriarchal while the Indo-Europeans practiced a patriarchal system. An example of this view is found in Stone's ''[[When God Was a Woman]]'',{{Page needed|date=July 2013}} wherein she makes the case that the worship of [[Yahweh]] was an Indo-European invention superimposed on an ancient matriarchal Semitic nation. Evidence from the [[Amorites]] and [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabs]], however, indicates that the primitive Semitic family was in fact patriarchal and patrilineal.

However, not all scholars agree. Anthropologist and Biblical scholar Raphael Patai writes in  The Hebrew Goddess that the Jewish religion, far from being pure monotheism, contained from earliest times strong polytheistic elements, chief of which was the cult of Asherah, the mother goddess. A story in the Biblical Book of Judges places the worship of Asherah in the 12th century B.C.E.  Originally a Canaanite goddess, her worship was adopted by Hebrews who intermarried with Canaanites. She was worshipped in public and was represented by carved wooden poles. Numerous small nude female figurines of clay were found all over ancient Palestine and a 7th C. Hebrew text invokes her aid for a woman giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Patai|1990|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shekinah is the name of the feminine holy spirit who embodies both divine radiance and compassion. She comforts the sick and dejected, accompanies the Jews whenever they are exiled, and intercedes with God to exercise mercy rather than to inflict retribution on sinners. While not a creation of the Hebrew Bible, Shekinah appears in a slightly later Aramaic translation of the Bible in the first or second century C.E., according to Patai. Initially portrayed as the presence of God, she later becomes distinct from God, taking on more physical attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Patai|1990|pp=96–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Indo-Europeans were known to have practiced multiple succession systems, and there is much better evidence of matrilineal customs among the Indo-European [[Celts]] and [[Germans]] than among any ancient Semitic peoples.

Women were running [[Sparta]] while the men were often away fighting. [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta]], was asked by a woman in [[Attica]] something along the lines of, "why are Spartan women the only women in the world who could rule men?" Gorgo replied, "Because we are the only women who are mothers of men."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==== Iron Age to Middle Ages ====
Arising in the period ranging from the [[Iron Age]] to the [[Middle Ages]], several early [[northwestern Europe]]an mythologies from the [[Irish mythology|Irish]] (''e.g.'', [[Macha]] and [[Scáthach]]), the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] (''e.g.'', [[Rhiannon]]), and the Germanic (''e.g.'', [[Grendel's mother]] and [[Nerthus]]) contain ambiguous episodes of primal female power which have been interpreted as folk evidence of a real potential for matriarchal attitudes in [[Iron Age|pre-Christian]] European Iron Age societies. Often transcribed from a retrospective, patriarchal, Romanised, and [[Catholic]] perspective, they hint at an earlier, culturally disturbing, era when female power could have predominated. The first-century–attested historic British figure of [[Boudicca]] indicates that Brittonnic society permitted explicit female autocracy or a form of gender equality in a form which contrasted strongly with the patriarchal structure of Mediterranean civilisation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Mythology ==

=== Amazons ===
A legendary matriarchy related by several writers was [[Amazons|Amazon]] society. According to [[Phyllis Chesler]], "in Amazon societies, women were&amp;nbsp;... mothers and their society's only political and religious leaders",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|pp=335–336}} (italics omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the only warriors and hunters;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|pp=335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; "queens were elected"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apparently "any woman could aspire to and achieve full human expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|p=336}} (italics omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their females observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Moreover, said Herodotus, "no girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. [[Julius Caesar]] spoke of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Although Strabo was sceptical about their historicity, the Amazons were taken as historical throughout [[late Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], 5.504.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Church Fathers]] spoke of the Amazons as a real people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Medieval authors continued a tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert|Ukert, F. A.]], ''Die Amazonen'' (Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1849), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===
[[Robert Graves]] suggested that a myth displaced earlier myths that had to change when a major cultural change brought patriarchy to replace a matriarchy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to this myth, in [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] is said to have swallowed his pregnant lover, the titan goddess [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], who was carrying their daughter, [[Athena]]. The mother and child created havoc inside Zeus. Either [[Hermes]] or [[Hephaestus]] split Zeus's head, allowing Athena, in full battle armor, to burst forth from his forehead. Athena was thus described as being "born" from Zeus. The outcome pleased Zeus as it didn't fulfill the prophecy of Themis which (according to Aeschylus) predicted that Zeus will one day bear a son that would overthrow him. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Celtic myth and society ===
{{main|Ancient Celtic women#Matriarchy}}

According to Adler, "there ''is'' plenty of evidence of ancient societies where women held greater power than in many societies today. For example, [[Jean Markale]]'s studies of Celtic societies show that the power of women was reflected not only in myth and legend but in legal codes pertaining to marriage, divorce, property ownership, and the right to rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=196}} (italics so in original; p.&amp;nbsp;196 n.&amp;nbsp;20 citing Markale, Jean, ''Women of the Celts'' (London: Gordon Cremonesi, 1975)).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South America ===
Bamberger (1974) examines several matriarchal myths from South American cultures and concludes that portraying the women from this matriarchal period as immoral often serves to restrain contemporary women in these societies.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} &lt;ref&gt;Bamberger, Joan, The Myth of Matriarchy: Why Men Rule in Primitive Society, in M.

[[File:Elizabeth Stanton.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Stanton]]
In [[first-wave feminism|first-wave feminist]] discourse, either [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] or [[Margaret Fuller]] (it is unclear who was first) introduced the concept of matriarchy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;55 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;15}}, citing Stanton, Elizabeth Cady, ''Address'' (Washington Woman's Rights Convention, 1869), in ''History of Woman Suffrage'', vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;351–353.&lt;/ref&gt; and the discourse was joined in by [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=57}}, citing Gage, Matilda Joslyn, ''Woman, Church and State: A Historical Account of the Status of Women through the Christian Ages; with Reminiscences of the Matriarchate'' (Watertown, Mass.: Persephone Press, 1980 (1893)), p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria Woodhull]], in 1871, called for men to open the U.S. government to women or a new constitution and government would be formed in a year;&lt;ref&gt;''A Lecture on Constitutional Equality'', also known as ''The Great Secession Speech'', speech to Woman's Suffrage Convention, New York, May 11, 1871, excerpt quoted in {{harvp|Gabriel|1998|pp=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, on a basis of equality, she ran to be elected President in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gabriel|1998|loc=''passim'', esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Lois Beachy, ''The Woman Who Ran for President: The Many Lives of Victoria Woodhull'' (Bridgehampton, N.Y.: Bridge Works, 1st ed. 1995 ({{ISBN|1-882593-10-3}}), ''passim'', esp. ch.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], in 1911 and 1914,&lt;ref&gt;The dates are those of two original editions of the same work, both cited herein.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for "a woman-centered, or better mother-centered, world"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=61}}, citing {{harvp|Gilman|2001|loc=''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described {{"'}}government by women{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=62}}, citing {{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that a government led by either sex must be assisted by the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=177}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt; both genders being "useful&amp;nbsp;... and should in our governments be alike used",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; because men and women have different qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|pp=153, 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural feminism]] includes "matriarchal worship", according to Prof. James Penner.&lt;ref&gt;Penner, James, ''Pinks, Pansies, and Punks: The Rhetoric of Masculinity in American Literary Culture'' (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2011 ({{ISBN|978-0-253-22251-0}})), p.&amp;nbsp;235.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[list of feminist literature|feminist literature]], matriarchy and patriarchy are not conceived as simple mirrors of each other.&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287"&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''matriarchy'' sometimes means "the political rule of women",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that meaning is often rejected, on the ground that matriarchy is not a mirroring of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2000|p=12}} (quoting also Mary Daly ("matriarchy 'was not patriarchy spelled with an "m.{{"'"}}, probably – per {{harvp|Eller|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;12 n.&amp;nbsp;3}} – in Daly, Mary, ''Beyond God the Father'', p.&amp;nbsp;94)).&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchy is held to be about power over others while matriarchy is held to be about power from within,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287" /&gt; [[Starhawk]] having written on that distinction&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starhawk, ''[[Dreaming the Dark: Magic, Sex, and Politics]]'' (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, 15th Anniversary ed. 1997 (original 1982) ({{ISBN|0-8070-1037-5}})), ch.&amp;nbsp;1 (original 1982 ed. cited in {{harvp|Eller|1991|p=287}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and Adler having argued that matriarchal power is not possessive and not controlling, but is harmonious with nature.{{efn|Adler wrote a matriarchy is "a realm where female things are valued and where power is exerted in non-possessive, non-controlling, and organic ways that are harmonious with nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|1979|p=187}}, as quoted in {{harvp|Eller|1991|p=287}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For radical feminists, the importance of matriarchy is that "veneration for the female principle&amp;nbsp;... somewhat lightens an oppressive system."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Castro|1990|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist utopia]]s are a form of advocacy. According to Tineke Willemsen, "a feminist utopia would&amp;nbsp;... be the description of a place where at least women would like to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Willemsen|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willemsen continues, among "type[s] of feminist utopias[,]&amp;nbsp;... [one] stem[s] from feminists who emphasize the differences between women and men. They tend to formulate their ideal world in terms of a society where women's positions are better than men's. There are various forms of matriarchy, or even a utopia that resembles the Greek myth of the Amazons.... [V]ery few modern utopias have been developed in which women are absolute autocrats."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Willemsen|1997|p=6}}.

A minority of feminists, generally [[radical feminism|radical]],&lt;ref name="AppsFLegalTheoryWLSVWR-p9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FStateWelfare-p52" /&gt; have argued that women should govern societies of women and men. In all of these advocacies, the governing women are not limited to mothers:

* Adler reported, "if feminists have diverse views on the matriarchies of the past, they also are of several minds on the goals for the future.

Some fiction caricatured the current gender hierarchy by describing a matriarchal alternative without advocating for it.

[Goodman, Whittingham, and Gilby]".&lt;ref&gt;Laing, David, ''Preface'' (from extract), in {{harvp|Knox|1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in agreement with Knox was [[Christopher Goodman]], who, according to Lee, "considered the woman ruler to be a monster in nature, and used&amp;nbsp;... scriptural argument to prove that females were barred&amp;nbsp;... from any political power",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lee|1990|pp=250, 249}}, citing Goodman, Christopher, ''How Superior Powers Ought to be Obeyd'' (N.Y.: reprint, 1931, originally 1558) (chap. on gynecocracy).&lt;/ref&gt; even if, according to Richards, the woman was "virtuous".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richards|1997|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some views included conditionality; while [[John Calvin]] said, according to Healey, "that government by a woman was a deviation from the original and proper order of nature, and therefore among the punishments humanity incurred for original sin",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|pp=372, 373}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Original sin]], in Christianity, a state of sin, or violation of God's will, due to Adam's rebellion in the Garden of Eden}} nonetheless Calvin would not always question a woman's right to inherit rule of a realm or principality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|pp=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Bullinger]], according to Healey, "held that rule by a woman was contrary to God's law but cautioned against [always] using that reason to oppose such rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richards, Bullinger said women were normally not to rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richards|1997|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1560, Calvin, in disagreeing with Knox, argued that the existence of the few women who were exceptions showed that theological ground existed for their exceptionalism.&lt;ref&gt;"There were occasionally women so endowed, that the singular good qualities which shone forth in them made it evident that they were raised up by Divine authority". Calvin, letter to William Cecil (on or after January 29, 1559 (probably 1560)), in {{harvp|Knox|1878}} (citing, at ''Preface'', n.&amp;nbsp;1, for letter, ''Zurich Letters'' (2d ser.), p.&amp;nbsp;35) (Calvin reviser, ''Commentaries on Isaiah'' (sometime in 1551–1559) (approximate title)).&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's view was much debated in Europe at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Abreu|2003|pp=168, 170–171}}, ''e.g.'', citing Aylmer (AElmer&lt;!-- "A" &amp; "E" separate letters --&gt;), John, ''An Harborowe for Faithfull and Trewe Subiects agaynst the late blowne Blast, concerninge the Gouernment of Wemen wherin be confuted all such reasons as a straunger of late made in that behalfe, with a briefe exhortation to obedience'' (1559).&lt;/ref&gt; the issue considered complicated by laws such as on inheritance&lt;ref name="PromoteWBeareRule-16CJ-p116-n45n46" /&gt; and since several women were already in office, including as Queens, according to de Abreu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Abreu|2003|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's view is not said to be widely held in modern Protestantism among leadership or laity.

=== Inclusionary ===
{{Main|thealogy|Goddess movement}}
Feminist [[thealogy]], according to Eller, conceptualized humanity as beginning with "female-ruled or equalitarian societies",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;281 and see pp.&amp;nbsp;282 &amp; 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; until displaced by patriarchies,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281"&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in the millennial future {{"'}}gynocentric,' life-loving values"&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281" /&gt; will return to prominence.&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281" /&gt; This, according to Eller, produces "a virtually infinite number of years of female equality or superiority coming both at the beginning and end of historical time".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among criticisms is that a future matriarchy, according to Eller, as a reflection of spirituality, is conceived as ahistorical,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p291n27"/&gt; and thus may be unrealistic, unreachable, or even meaningless as a goal to secular feminists.

== In popular culture ==

=== Ancient theatre ===
* Apparently as criticism, about 2,400 years ago, in 390 BC, [[Aristophanes]] wrote a play, ''[[Assemblywomen|Ecclesiazusae]]'', about women gaining legislative power and governing [[Athens]], Greece, on a limited principle of equality. In the play, according to Mansfield, Praxagora, a character, argues that women should rule because they are superior to men, not equal, and yet she declines to assert publicly her right to rule, although elected and although acting in office.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n"&gt;{{harvp|Mansfield|2006|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;37}}, citing Strauss, Leo, ''Socrates and Aristophanes'' (N.Y.: Basic Books, 1966), ch.&amp;nbsp;9, and Saxonhouse, Arlene W., ''Fear of Diversity'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), ch.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; The play, Mansfield wrote, also suggests that women would rule by not allowing politics, in order to prevent disappointment, and that affirmative action would be applied to heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; In the play, as Mansfield described it, written when Athens was a male-only democracy where women could not vote or rule, women were presented as unassertive and unrealistic, and thus not qualified to govern.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; The play, according to Sarah Ruden, was a fable on the theme that women should stay home.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ruden|2010|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobile social networking''' (MSN) is [[social networking]] where individuals with similar interests converse and connect with one another through their [[mobile phone]] and/or [[tablet computer|tablet]]. Much like web-based social networking, mobile social networking occurs in [[virtual communities]].

Many web-based social networking sites, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], have created [[mobile application]]s to give their users instant and real-time access from anywhere they have access to the Internet. Additionally, native mobile social networks have been created, such as [[Instagram]], [[Foursquare]], and [[Strava]], to allow communities to be built around mobile functionality.

More and more, the line between mobile and web is being blurred as mobile apps use existing social networks to create native communities and promote discovery, and web-based social networks take advantage of mobile features and accessibility.

As mobile web evolved from proprietary mobile technologies and networks, to full mobile access to the Internet, the distinction changed to the following types:

# Web-based social networks being extended for mobile access through [[mobile browser]]s and [[smartphone]] [[application software|apps]]
# Native mobile social networks with dedicated focus on mobile use such as [[mobile communication]], [[location-based service]]s, and [[augmented reality]]

While mobile and web-based social networking systems often work symbiotically to spread content, increase accessibility, and connect users, consumers are increasingly spending their attention on native apps compared to [[web browser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/|title=Mobile marketing statistics 2016|date=2016-10-26|newspaper=Smart Insights|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The evolution of social networking on [[mobile network]]s started in 1999 with basic [[online chat|chatting]] and [[texting]] services. With the introduction of various technologies in mobile networks, social networking has reached an advance level over four generations.&lt;ref name="buongiorno_final"&gt;[http://www.telecoms.com/files/2009/05/buongiorno_final-fmt_nl-3110-f.pdf White paper on Mobile Social Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999–2000===
Technologies used in this generation are application-based, pre-installed on mobile handsets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mobile Social Networking and Computing: A Multidisciplinary Integrated Perspective|last=Wang|first=Yufeng|last2=Ma|first2=Jianhua|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781466552753|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features include text-only chat via [[chat room]]s. The people who used these services were anonymous. The services of this generation's mobile social networks can be used on a pay-as-you-go or [[Subscription billing service|subscription-to-service]] basis.

===2004–2006===
The introduction of [[3G]] and [[camera phone]]s added many features such as uploading photos, [[mobile search]] for person based on profile, and contacting/flirting with another person anonymously. Regional distributions of these features include Japan, Korea, Australia, Western Europe and US. The applications are mostly useful for dating purposes. The services of this generation's mobile social networks can be used on a pay-as-you-go or subscription-to-service basis.

===2006–2008===
The experiments for this generation mobile social networks started in 2006. It was adopted widely in 2008/2009. This generation brought tremendous changes and made mobile social networks as a part of daily life. The features include a richer [[user experience]], automatic publishing to [[user profile|web profile]] and [[status update]]s, some [[Web 2.0]] features, search by group/join by interests, [[Alert messaging|alerts]], [[location-based service]]s and content sharing (especially music). Technologies include [[WAP 2.0]], Java on the server, [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], and voice capture. Applications introduced were customized with general interests such as music and mobile-specific [[content distribution]]. Regional distributions of this generation of mobile social networks include Japan, Korea, Western Europe, and North America. [[Online advertising|Advertising]] and ad-supported content become increasingly important. The services in this generation can be used with pay-as-you-go plans; subscription-based plans were still popular as networks increased their scale to become content distribution platforms.

===2008 – present===
Fourth generation began in 2008 and reached in 2010. All the features in third generation are advanced in this generation of social mobile networks. The features of this generation include the features of the third generation, the ability to hide/mask one's presence, asynchronous [[video chat|video conversation]], multi-point audio chat conversation with one button, and multiplayer mobile gaming. Technologies which made these features possible are Web 2.0 widgets, [[Flash Lite]], [[OpenSocial]], and [[Open Handset Alliance]]. The business model of previous generations continued along with [[virtual currency]] – the purchase and trade of virtual goods.

In parallel to the increase of various technologies in mobile networks, the number of hours spent per adult on mobile devices per day has increased dramatically since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/|title=Mobile marketing statistics 2016|date=2016-10-26|newspaper=Smart Insights|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, mobile devices have surpassed desktop/laptops as the most used device per day for internet usage. A steady increase of mobile application usage over the past few years has contributed to the rise of mobile social networks, as well as to the diversity of usage of mobile social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flurrymobile.tumblr.com/post/136677391508/stateofmobile2015|title=Media, Productivity &amp; Emojis Give Mobile Another Stunning Growth Year|newspaper=Flurry Blog|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the use of mobile social networks has increased, the location-based services within the mobile social network has also been increasing. Social network service companies now provide more location-based services for customers' wide use of the mobile devices and their convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shankar|first=P.|last2=Huang|first2=Yun-Wu|last3=Castro|first3=P.|last4=Nath|first4=B.|last5=Iftode|first5=L.|date=2012-03-01|title=Crowds replace experts: Building better location-based services using mobile social network interactions|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6199845/|journal=2012 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications|pages=20–29|doi=10.1109/PerCom.2012.6199845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Mobile social networking sites allow users to create a [[user profile|profile]], send and receive messages via phone or computer and visit an online version of a mobile site. There were different models which were adapted by different networking sites. Most of these sites have many unique features or special functions, but the main function of the site remains the same as other services. All these sites are categorized according to the following business models and usage.

=== Social network ===
Similar to there being many online social networking sites, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], there are just as many social network on mobile devices. They offer vast number of functions including multimedia posts, photo sharing, and instant messaging. Most of these mobile apps offer free international calling and texting capabilities. Today, social networking apps are not just for the social aspect, but are frequently used for professional aspects as well, such as LinkedIn, which is still constantly growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2012/05/21/facebook-vs-linkedin-whats-the-difference/#60f7f5aa792f|title=Facebook vs. LinkedIn - What's the Difference?|last=Bersin|first=Josh|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with sharing multimedia posts and instant messaging, social networks are commonly used to connect immigrants in a new country. While the thought of moving to a new country may be intimidating for many, social media can be used to connect immigrants of the same land together to make assimilation a little less stressful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Media in Industrial China|last=Wang|first=Xinyuan|publisher=UCL Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=London|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Messaging===

This model is focused on the ability to send short, text-based messages to an individual, group of close friends, or even a large group of classmates, simultaneously. This category enables messages to reach the right people as quickly as possible. Many messaging apps are very popular, maybe even more than classical texting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://onereach.com/blog/are-mobile-messaging-apps-overtaking-text-messaging-not-exactly/|title=Are Mobile Messaging Apps Overtaking Text Messaging? Not Exactly|newspaper=OneReach Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some social network platforms, such as [[Facebook]], have their own native messaging applications, similar to [[Facebook Messenger]]. Different countries have a certain messenger that is predominant, like China with [[WeChat]], Korea with [[KakaoTalk]], and the US with [[WhatsApp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://readwrite.com/2014/03/06/10-biggest-popular-mobile-messaging-apps-world-whatsapp/|title=The 10 Most Popular Mobile Messaging Apps In The World|last=6|first=Posted on March|last2=Mobile|first2=2014 in|date=2014-03-06|website=ReadWrite|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media share ===
This can be viewed as an advanced version of the messenger category. In addition to text messages, audio and video files can be transmitted among a group, such as [[Skype]] or [[OoVoo|Oovoo]], which are forms of online video chatting. In the case of [[Instagram]] and [[Vine (service)|Vine]], photos and videos of personal lives are shared to either friends or to the public. Similarly, [[Pinterest]] is used to share photos, but on a more community level. The largest media sharing app today is [[YouTube]], which allows people post videos and share with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/womensmedia/2014/05/04/things-you-should-know-about-youtube-vimeo-vine-and-instagram/#6ced8cf26027|title=Things You Should Know About YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, and Instagram|last=WomensMedia|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these services store media content online for easy storage and access.

===Local discoverability===
Some mobile social networks, such as [[Yelp]], [[Foursquare|FourSquare]] and [[Yik Yak|YikYak]], allow users to search for local venues. Many of these apps publish [[Crowdsourcing|crowd-sourced]] reviews and tips about restaurants, shops, places of interest and more. Yelp and FourSquare also personalizes each user's database according to their latest search and interest to make searching more efficient.

===Social gaming===

This model is about connecting people through both [[multi-player game]]s and competitive [[single-player game]]s. Mobile devices are always increasing their capacity for graphics performance and computing power, making them capable gaming devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2012/09/13/mobile-game-developers-discuss-iphone-5-graphics-matter/#2fa052fd6cad|title=Mobile Game Developers Discuss iPhone 5: "Graphics Matter"|last=Evangelho|first=Jason|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader in this category is [[Zynga]], creators of ''[[Farmville]]'' and ''[[Words with Friends]]'', though it has suffered a decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/10/18/zynga-social-games-growth/|title=Zynga in Slumps-Ville, But Social Games Are Still Hot|last=Review|first=MIT Technology|website=Mashable|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hearthstone (video game)|Hearthstone]]'' is another popular mobile game where players use monster and spell cards to fight each other. Many games also introduce the idea of having another player as an "ally" during game play. For example, in ''[[Naruto Blazing]]'', players can choose one person from a set of players to be on their team while fighting enemies throughout the game. Mobile social networks can also connect people outside of the mobile environment. ''[[Pokémon Go|Pokemon Go]]'' incorporated augmented reality to allow players to catch Pokemon while together physically while outside. Players can also battle each other at gyms in various locations in the world. Facebook has also integrated games through its chat messenger. For example, friends can play chess by sending "@fbchess play" to the other person or basketball by sending a basketball emoji and clicking on the emoji.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/feature/a788495/hidden-facebook-games-how-to-find-play-facebook-messengers-secret-games-basketball-chess/|title=How to find and play ALL of the hidden Facebook games|date=2016-12-17|newspaper=Digital Spy|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating===
These are location-based apps that allow users to create a profile and are matched with those who have similar interests. Some of these sites use radar to ping a user if there is a matching single profile within a certain distance. [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] was the first dating app that started the trend and has one of the largest user base. Other dating apps include [[Coffee Meets Bagel]] and [[OkCupid]]. These sites are marked with serious security measures, so that no personal details are released without the user's consent. However, there still has been several dangerous incidents that rose questions of whether Tinder-like apps are safe and should be kept around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/crimes-linked-to-tinder-and-grindr-increase-seven-fold/|title=Crimes linked to Tinder and Grindr increase seven fold|newspaper=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Music apps connect people by sharing playlists and being able to see what other people are listening to. [[Spotify]], a very popular music site, is also used to social networking in a sense that people can see what their friends are listening to at the moment as well. Users can also follow certain artists or even friends that they want to, which is a form of “liking” a post on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/spotify-branches-out-into-its-own-social-network/|title=Spotify branches out into its own social network|newspaper=CNET|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other social media music apps include radio stations like [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]] and [[last.fm]].

=== Fitness ===
Recently, mobile social networks has also been used to motivate individuals to stick to their fitness and health goals. These social networks either work as a form of encouragement by rewarding the individual when they have accomplish a goal, or as a form of punishment by disciplining those who failed to accomplish their goal through a monetary cost or social pressure. An example of this network is [http://www.pactapp.com/ PACT]. In PACT, individuals make a weekly goal to exercise more or eat healthier and set a monetary amount that you will pay if you don’t succeed. Using the app, you can prove that you were at the gym through GPS or that you ate healthy meals by uploading pictures of the meal. If you succeed in your goal, you earn cash paid by members who didn’t keep to their goals.

[[Strava]] is another mobile social network application that lets you keep track of your activities using GPS and analyze your performance through metrics such as speed and distance. Using the social network, you can meet other individuals who are also into the same activities as you and find out about new track routes or challenges or other athletic content.

=== Mobile commerce ===
Mobile commerce, or [[Mobile commerce|m-commerce]], is a branch of [[e-commerce]], that is available in a form of apps and mobile sites. In some apps like [[letgo]], it is easy for the buyer to talk to the seller about specifics about the product or negotiate the price and this assumes a form of social networking. It also narrows the search down by cities and topics to make it more efficient. Some major e-commerce sites, such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[eBay]], are also available in apps, so that people can shop anytime and anywhere. Particularly, however, some mobile social media networks add m-commerce functionalities to their applications. For instance, there is the case of the Facebook Marketplace where people can sell and purchase products through their mobile devices. Many e-commerce and m-commerce applications are also increasingly developed to interface with other applications such as mobile payment, banking, and ticketing applications so customers can easily pay or accept payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mobile Commerce|last=Bandyopadhyay|first=Karabi|publisher=PHI Learning|year=2013|isbn=9788120348059|location=Delhi|pages=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhanced Discovering Computers|last=LeVermaat|first=Misty|last2=Sebok|first2=Susan|last3=Freund|first3=Steven|last4=Frydenberg|first4=Mark|last5=Campbell|first5=Jennifer|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=9781305657458|location=Boston, MA|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is the case of Instagram, which in 2018 became open to merchants using the [[Shopify]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/09/17/instagram-stories-shopping-shopify/|title=You Can Now Shop Directly From Instagram Stories|last=King|first=Rachel|date=September 17, 2018|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Mobile payments ===
Mobile payment social networks such as [[Venmo]] and [[Square cash|Square Cash]] allow for person-to-person money transfer between family and friends, with a swipeable feed of payment details similar to Facebook's [[News Feed]].

=== Miscellaneous ===
There are still many functionalities of mobile social networks that do not fall into any specific categories. One is collecting rebates. [[Ibotta]] allows users to submit receipts to collect rebates for items they have purchased. They also added in a teamwork element where you can work with your friends to reach goals such as redeeming a certain amount of dollars or redeeming a certain amount of rebates for monetary rewards. Observers are also expecting the mobile social computing platform to be pivotal in the emergence of new technologies due to its rich sensing capabilities. For instance, it can augment real-world experiences, allowing mobile devices to bridge the physical world and the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Facebook mobile social networking ==
The rise of the digital age has made social media a lasting trend, Facebook is still the leader of social networks, were initially as web-based and then extended towards access via mobile browsers and smartphone apps. Compared with Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, Facebook continues to dominate the social media world. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, 823 million Facebook users accessed the social network exclusively through mobile device, exceed from 526 million users in the previous year. In 2016, there was Instagram started as mobile and later developed into web-based platforms as well. In 2016, there was practically 1.6 billion active users around the world.  Moreover, in the United States, a study named the usage of the most popular mobile social networking percentages showed that social media audiences spent a total of 230 billion minutes on Facebook in 2014, 80% higher than Instagram. Until January 2016, 52% of users in North America accessed social media through mobile when the global mobile social penetration rate was 27%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/topics/2478/mobile-social-networks/|title=Topic: Mobile social media|website=www.statista.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report in 2017 showed that around 1 billion users will visit Facebook via mobile devices and during this year, the US market plays a significant role with nearly 80% of Facebook users using mobile devices to access their accounts. Facebook mobile advertising revenue account for 10 billion dollars and occupy for 74% of revenue in total. It shows that by 2018, more than 75% of the Facebook users worldwide will access the service via their mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business.com/articles/best-facebook-marketing-strategies/|title=Best Facebook Marketing Strategies - business.com|work=business.com|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety issues==
Safety issues (including [[Internet security|security]], privacy, and trust) in mobile social networks are concerned about the condition of being protected against different types of failure, damage, error, accidents, harm or any other non-desirable event, while mobile carriers contact each other in mobile environments. However, lack of a protective infrastructure in these networks has turned them in to convenient targets for various perils. This is the main impulse why MSNs carry disparate and intricate safety concerns and embrace divergent safety challenging problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Najaflou |first1=Yashar |last2=Jedari |first2=Behrouz |last3=Xia |first3=Feng |last4=T. Yang |first4=Laurence |last5=S. Obaidat |first5=Mohammad |title=Safety Challenges and Solutions in Mobile Social Networks |journal=IEEE Systems Journal |date=2015 |volume=9 |issue=3 |page=834 - 854 |doi=10.1109/JSYST.2013.2284696 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6642041/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been cases where a user was caused bodily harm through mobile social media. For example, Kurt Eichenwald was sent a tweet with a flashing animated image by another user who knew that Eichenwald had epilepsy, causing a seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/12/21/twitter-seizure/|title=Twitter Agrees to Hand Over User Data After Tweet Triggers Epileptic Seizure|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these dangers, many mobile social networks such as Twitter and Facebook have implemented various methods for protecting user safety such as removing harmful users, detecting malware, and verifying a user's identity; however, these policies are still in the workings.

Other than online safety issues, the evolution of mobile devices has also introduced new offline, or physical, safety concerns. The distractions caused by mobile social networks have cause numerous accidents due to the user not paying attention to their surroundings. According to the [[National Safety Council]], nearly 330,000 injuries occur each year from accidents where the driver was texting while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edgarsnyder.com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics.html|title=Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving|website=edgarsnyder.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety issues caused by distractions from mobile social network became more prominent after the release of [[Pokémon Go|Pokemon Go]] in July 2016. In Pokemon Go, users can catch pokemon while walking around outdoors on their phones. While this game has positive impacts such as getting players to exercise, increasing museum and theme park visitors, and helping single people find dates, it has also led to more accidents. In California, two men fell over 40 feet from an ocean bluff while playing Pokemon Go.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4407012/california-men-fall-bluff-pokemon-go/|title=California Men Fall Off Ocean Bluff While Playing Pokémon Go|website=Time|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Auburn, a driver went off the road and hit a tree because he was playing Pokemon Go while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/07/14/pokmon-go-player-crashes-his-car-into-tree/87074762/|title=Pokémon Go player crashes his car into a tree|newspaper=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pittsburgh, a teenager crossed a highway to catch a pokemon and was hit by a car because she was distracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4405221/pokemon-go-teen-hit-by-car/|title=Pennsylvania Teenager Hit By Car While Playing Pokémon Go|website=Time|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another safety concern arose from mobile dating applications such as Tinder and Hinge, where single people are matched up with each other to go on dates. These environments make it much easier for criminals to commit crimes such as rape and murder because it is difficult for users to completely know the other person before agreeing to meet them face to face. In England and Wales, there were 204 reported crimes due to Tinder or Grindr in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/01/11/tinder-and-grindr-are-more-dangerous-than-ever-according-to-uk-report/|title=Tinder and Grindr are more dangerous than ever, according to UK report|last=Connolly|first=Amanda|date=2016-01-11|newspaper=The Next Web|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number rose to 412 in 2015. On November 23, 2016, [[Stephen Port]] was convicted for rape and murder of 4 men who he met on the Grindr. In April 2016, Ingrid Lyne was murdered and her accused murderer was a man she had met on a dating app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/new-details-in-murder-case-raise-questions-about-dating-app-dangers/489930421|title=New details in murder case raise questions about dating app dangers|last=Clancy|first=Amy|date=2017-02-03|newspaper=KIRO|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are many dangers to meeting people online, it has also successfully helped single people find love and marriage. Increasing the safety procedures regarding mobile dating applications is an ongoing work by the police force and by the developers of these mobile applications.

==In the United States==
[[File:Stat.png|thumb|250px|United States mobile social networking market]]
While Japan, Korea, and China have a higher usage rate of mobile social networks compared to other western countries, the United States is a prevalent user of mobile social networks. The US has a population of 303.82 million people and a mobile penetration of 72% with 219.73 million mobile subscribers in 2008. Informa forecasts the number of mobile subscribers to rise to 243.27 million by 2013.&lt;ref name="buongiorno_final"/&gt;

The mobile data market in the US is at a developed stage of growth where non-messaging data revenues account for 20% of US operators'  overall data revenues. In September 2012, the CTIA (Cellular Telephone Industries Association) announced that data service revenues rose 40% to US $14.8 billion. The CTIA announced that SMS usage had maintained its strong growth.&lt;ref name="buongiorno_final"/&gt;

Social networking once began in the online space, but it has rapidly spread to mobile platforms. Currently, consumption of mobile internet usage is being driven by mobile social networking. Data shows that the US has 220.14 million online internet users which is 72.5% of the population. Flat-rate data plans have been prevalent in the US for a number of years but the customer adoption of mobile internet was slow until 2008. However, the introduction of the iPhone has definitely increased the market for mobile internet. iPhones have transformed the mobile social network market, and today there is numerous mobile development for social network apps.&lt;ref name="buongiorno_final"/&gt;

The US mobile social networking market experienced steady growth in 2008 with 6.4 million mobile social network users. Since then, the number of mobile users has continued to grow and below is graph forecasting the growth until 2013.&lt;ref name="buongiorno_final"/&gt; According to Statista.com, the most popular social media networking app as of 2016 is Facebook at 123.55 million monthly users, surpassing the next most popular app, Facebook Messenger, which has 97.86 million monthly users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/248074/most-popular-us-social-networking-apps-ranked-by-audience/|title=Top U.S. mobile social apps by users 2016 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1998). Technophobia: the psychological impact of Information Technology. pg 155. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is based on the historical legacy of the English [[Luddite]]s, who were active between 1811 and 1816.&lt;ref name="jonesagainstechnology"/&gt;

Neo-Luddism is a leaderless movement of non-affiliated groups who resist modern technologies and dictate a return of some or all technologies to a more primitive level.&lt;ref name = Sale&gt;Sale, Kirkpatrick, America’s new Luddites. URL=http://mondediplo.com/1997/02/20luddites&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Luddites are characterized by one or more of the following practices: passively abandoning the use of technology, harming those who produce technology, advocating [[simple living]], or [[monkeywrenching|sabotaging]] technology. The modern neo-Luddite movement has connections with the [[anti-globalization movement]], [[antiscience|anti-science movement]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[radical environmentalism]], and [[deep ecology]].&lt;ref name = Sale /&gt;

Neo-Luddism is based on the concern of the technological impact on individuals, their communities, and/or the environment,&lt;ref name=christensenencyclopedia&gt;{{cite book  | last = Christensen  | first = Karen  |author2=David Levinson  | title = Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 3  | publisher = SAGE  | year = 2003  | location =   | pages = 886  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;dq=Neo-Luddism| isbn = 978-0-7619-2598-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Luddism stipulates the use of the [[precautionary principle]] for all new technologies, insisting that technologies be proven safe before adoption, due to the unknown effects that new technologies might inspire.

==Philosophy==
Neo-Luddism  calls for slowing or stopping the development of new technologies. Neo-Luddism prescribes a lifestyle that abandons specific technologies, because of its belief that this is the best prospect for the future. As Robin and Webster put it, "a return to nature and what are imagined as more natural communities." In the place of industrial capitalism, neo-Luddism prescribes small-scale agricultural communities such as those of the Amish and the [[Chipko movement]] in Nepal and India&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt; as models for the future.

Neo-Luddism denies the ability of any new technology to solve current problems, such as [[environmental degradation]],&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt; [[nuclear warfare]] and [[biological weapons]], without creating more, potentially dangerous problems.&lt;ref name=grahaminternet&gt;{{cite book  | last = Graham  | first = Gordon  | title = The Internet: a philosophical inquiry  | publisher = Routledge  | year = 1999  | location =   | page = 9  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NDr8Fh4rNQAC&amp;dq=Neo-Luddism| isbn = 978-0-415-19749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Luddites are generally opposed to [[anthropocentrism]], [[globalization]] and [[industrial capitalism]].

In 1990, attempting to reclaim the term 'Luddite' and found a unified movement, [[Chellis Glendinning]] published her "Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto". In this paper, Glendinning describes neo-Luddites as "20th century citizens—activists, workers, neighbors, social critics, and scholars—who question the predominant modern worldview, which preaches that unbridled technology represents [[Idea of Progress|progress]]."&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis"&gt;[[Chellis Glendinning|Glendinning, Chellis]]. ''[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/chellis-glendinning-notes-toward-a-neo-luddite-manifesto Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto]''. Utne Reader, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Glendinning voices an opposition to technologies that she deems destructive to communities or are materialistic and rationalistic. She proposes that technology encourages biases, and therefore should question if technologies have been created for specific interests, to perpetuate their specific values including short-term efficiency, ease of production and marketing, as well as profit. Glendinning also says that secondary aspects of technology, including social, economic and ecological implications, and not personal benefit need to be considered before adoption of technology into the technological system.&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis" /&gt;

===Vision of the future without intervention===
Neo-Luddism often establishes stark predictions about the effect of new technologies. 
Although there is not a cohesive vision of the ramifications of technology, neo-Luddism predicts that a future without technological reform has dire consequences. Neo-Luddites believe that current technologies are a threat to humanity and to the natural world in general, and that a future [[societal collapse]] is possible or even probable. 

Neo-Luddite [[Ted Kaczynski]] predicted a world with a depleted environment, an increase in [[Causes of schizophrenia#Urbanicity|psychological disorders]], with either "leftists" who aim to control humanity through technology, or technology directly controlling humanity.&lt;ref name="Kaczynski" /&gt; According to Sale, "The industrial civilization so well served by its potent technologies cannot last, and will not last; its collapse is certain within not more than a few decades.".&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]], a famous astrophysicist, predicted that the means of production will be controlled by the "machine owner" class and that without redistribution of wealth technology will create more economic inequality.&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;Stephen Hawking Says We Should Really, 2016 | http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-hawking-capitalism-robots_us_5616c20ce4b0dbb8000d9f15&lt;/ref&gt;

These predictions include changes in humanity's place in the future due to replacement of humans by computers, genetic decay of humans due to lack of natural selection, biological engineering of humans, misuse of technological power including disasters caused by [[genetically modified organism]]s, [[nuclear warfare]], and [[biological weapons]]; control of humanity using surveillance, propaganda, pharmacological control, and psychological control; humanity failing to adapt to the future manifesting as an increase in psychological disorders, widening economic and political [[Economic inequality|inequality]], widespread [[social alienation]], a loss of community, and massive [[unemployment]]; technology causing [[environmental degradation]] due to shortsightedness, overpopulation, and overcrowding.&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodore J. Kaczynski, David Skrbina; ''Technological Slavery, The Collected Writings of Theodore J. Kaczynski, a.k.a. "The Unabomber."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of intervention===
In 1990, attempting to reclaim the term 'Luddite' and found a unified movement, [[Chellis Glendinning]] published her "Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto". In this paper, Glendinning proposes destroying the following technologies: electromagnetic technologies (this includes communications, computers, appliances, and refrigeration), chemical technologies (this includes synthetic materials and medicine), [[Nuclear technology|nuclear technologies]] (this includes weapons and power as well as cancer treatment, sterilization, and smoke detection), [[genetic engineering]] (this includes crops as well as insulin production).&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis" /&gt; She argues in favor of the "search for new technological forms" which are local in scale and promote social and political freedom.

[[File:Young theodore kaczynski.jpeg|thumb|Kaczynski as a young professor at [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]], 1968|alt=A man in a suit faces the camera while he stands in front of a building.]]
In "The coming revolution", Kaczynski outlined what he saw as changes humanity will have to make in order to make society functional, "new values that will free them from the yoke of the present technoindustrial system", including:
* Rejection of all modern technology  –  "This is logically necessary, because modern technology is a whole in which all parts are interconnected; you can’t get rid of the bad parts without also giving up those parts that seem good."
* Rejection of civilization itself
* Rejection of [[Economic materialism|materialism]] and its replacement with a conception of life that values moderation and self-sufficiency while deprecating the acquisition of property or of status.
* Love and reverence toward nature or even worship of nature
* Exaltation of freedom
* Punishment of those responsible for the present situation. "Scientists, engineers, corporation executives, politicians, and so forth to make the cost of improving technology too great for anyone to try"

==Movement==
Contemporary neo-Luddites are a widely diverse group of loosely affiliated or non-affiliated groups which includes "writers, academics, students, families, [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], [[Quakers]], [[environmentalists]], "fallen-away [[yuppies]]," "ageing [[flower children]]" and "young idealists seeking a technology-free environment."&lt;ref name="jour"&gt;Doresa Banning, Modern Day Luddites, November 30, 2001, URL=http://www.jour.unr.edu/j705/RP.BANNING.LUDDITE.HTML&lt;/ref&gt; Some Luddites see themselves as victims of technology trying to prevent further victimization (such as Citizens Against Pesticide Misuse and Parents Against Underage Smartphones). Others see themselves as advocates for the natural order and resist environmental degradation by technology (such as [[Earth First!]]).&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt;

One neo-Luddite assembly was the "Second Neo-Luddite Congress", held April 13–15, 1996, at a Quaker meeting hall in [[Barnesville, Ohio]]. On February 24, 2001, the "Teach-In on Technology and Globalization" was held at [[Hunter College]] in New York city with the purpose to bring together critics of technology and globalization.&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt; The two figures who are seen as the movement's founders are [[Chellis Glendinning]] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]. Prominent neo-Luddites include educator S. D. George, ecologist Stephanie Mills, [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Scott Savage]], [[Clifford Stoll]], [[Bill McKibben]], [[Neil Postman]], [[Wendell Berry]], [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]] and [[Gene Logsdon]].&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt; Postman, however, did not consider himself a Luddite and loathed being associated with the term.{{citation_needed|date=July 2017}}

In May 2012, credit for the shooting of Roberto Adinolfi, an [[Ansaldo Nucleare]] executive, was claimed by an [[anarchist]] group who targeted him for stating that none of the deaths following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] were caused by the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] itself: &lt;blockquote&gt;Adinolfi knows well that it is only a matter of time before a European Fukushima kills on our continent [...] Science in centuries past promised us a golden age, but it is pushing us towards self destruction and slavery [...] With our action we give back to you a small part of the suffering that you scientists are bringing to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Italian anarchists kneecap nuclear executive and threaten more shootings |author=Tom Kington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/11/italian-anarchists-kneecap-nuclear-executive |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 May 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kaczynski, also known as the ''Unabomber'', initially sabotaged developments near his cabin but dedicated himself to getting back at the system after discovering a road had been built over a plateau he had considered beautiful. Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski engaged in a nationwide bombing campaign against modern technology, planting or mailing numerous home-made bombs, killing three people and injuring 23 others. In his 1995 manifesto, ''Industrial Society and Its Future'',&lt;ref name="Kaczynski" /&gt; Kaczynski states: &lt;blockquote&gt;The kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve an armed uprising against any government. It may or may not involve physical violence, but it will not be a POLITICAL revolution. Its focus will be on technology and economics, not politics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2011 in [[Mexico]] a group or person calling itself [[Individuals Tending Towards the Wild]] perpetrated an attack with a bomb at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, State of Mexico Campus]], intended for the coordinator of its Business Development Center and Technology Transfer. The attack was accompanied by the publication of a [[manifesto]] criticizing [[nanotechnology]] and [[computer science]].

URL=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/saleskelly.html&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto of the 'Second Luddite Congress', which Sale took a major part in defining, attempts to redefine neo-Luddites as people who reject violent action.&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt;

==History==
===Origins of contemporary critiques of technology in literature===
According to Julian Young, [[Martin Heidegger]] was a Luddite in his early philosophical phase and believed in the destruction of modern technology and a return to an earlier agrarian world.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Julian. ''Heidegger's Later Philosophy'', p. 80. Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Martin Heidegger#Later works: The Turn|later Heidegger]] did not see technology as wholly negative and did not call for its abandonment or destruction.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt; In ''The Question Concerning Technology'' (1953), Heidegger posited that the modern technological "mode of Being" was one which viewed the natural world, plants, animals, and even human beings as a "standing-reserve"—resources to be exploited as means to an end.&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;Wheeler, Michael, "Martin Heidegger", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/heidegger/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate this "monstrousness", Heidegger uses the example of a [[hydroelectric plant]] on the [[Rhine river]] which turns the river from an unspoiled natural wonder to just a supplier of [[hydropower]]. In this sense, technology is not just the collection of tools, but a way of being in the world and of understanding the world which is instrumental and grotesque. According to Heidegger, this way of being defines the modern way of living in the West.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt; For Heidegger, this technological process ends up reducing beings to not-beings, which Heidegger calls 'the abandonment of being' and involves the loss of any sense of awe and wonder, as well as an indifference to that loss.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt;

One of the first major contemporary anti-technological thinkers was French philosopher [[Jacques Ellul]]. In his ''The Technological Society'' (1964), Ellul argued that the rationality of technology enforces logical and mechanical organization which "eliminates or subordinates the natural world." Ellul defined ''technique'' as the entire totality of organizational methods and technology with a goal toward maximum rational efficiency. According to Ellul, technique has an impetus which tends to drown out human concerns: "The only thing that matters technically is yield, production. This is the law of ''technique''; this yield can only be obtained by the total mobilization of human beings, body and soul, and this implies the exploitation of all human psychic forces."&lt;ref&gt;Ellul, ''The Technological Society'' p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic of political and technological expansion was [[Lewis Mumford]], who wrote ''[[The Myth of the Machine]]''. The views of Ellul influenced the ideas of the infamous American neo-Luddite Kaczynski. The opening of Kaczynski's manifesto reads: "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race."&lt;ref name=Kaczynski&gt;[[The Washington Post]]: Unabomber Special Report: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski]&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[philosophy of technology|philosophers of technology]] who have questioned the validity of technological progress include [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Don Ihde]] and [[Hubert Dreyfus]].&lt;ref name=Basney&gt;Basney, Lionel.

[[File:Octavia-Hill-by-Sargent.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|alt=portrait of a Victorian woman of middle age facing the artist, head slightly to the right|Octavia Hill by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1898]]
'''Octavia Hill''' (3 December 1838 – 13 August 1912&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;) was an English social reformer, whose main concern was the welfare of the inhabitants of cities, especially London, in the second half of the nineteenth century. Born into a family with a strong commitment to alleviating  poverty, she herself grew up in straitened circumstances owing to the financial failure of her father. With no formal schooling, she worked from the age of 14 for the welfare of working people.

Hill was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with [[John Ruskin]] enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal.

Another of Hill's concerns was the availability of open spaces for poor people. She campaigned against development on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save London's [[Hampstead Heath]] and [[Parliament Hill Fields]] from being built on. She was one of the three founders of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], set up to preserve places of historic interest or natural beauty for the enjoyment of the British public. She was a founder member of the [[Charity Organization Society|Charity Organisation Society]] (now the charity Family Action) which organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work. She was a member of the [[Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09#The Royal Commission on the Poor Law|Royal Commission on the Poor Laws]] in 1905.

Hill's legacy includes the large holdings of the modern National Trust, several housing projects still run on her lines, a tradition of training for housing managers, and the museum established by the Octavia Hill Society at her birthplace.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Octavia Hill was the daughter of James Hill, corn merchant, follower of Owenism&lt;ref name=Phil&gt;James Hill, father to Octavia Hill, Follower of Owenism and founder of newspaper "The star in the East"[http://www.wisbech-society.co.uk/octavia.html "Octavia Hill: The Wisbech Society and Preservation Trust"]&lt;/ref&gt; and banker, and his third wife, Caroline Southwood Smith. He had been widowed twice, and had six children (five daughters and a son) from his previous marriages.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, Mark K., [http://www.infed.org/thinkers/octavia_hill.htm "Octavia Hill: Housing, Space and Social Reform"], The Encyclopaedia of Informal Education, 2008, accessed 14 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been impressed by the writings on education of Caroline Southwood Smith, the daughter of Dr [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], a pioneer of sanitary reform.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Darley, Gillian, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-33873?rskey=rnxST6&amp;result=1 "Hill, Octavia (1838–1912)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He had engaged Caroline as a governess for his children in 1832, and they were married in 1835, three years before Octavia was born in [[Wisbech]], [[Cambridgeshire]], her father's eighth daughter and ninth child.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The family's comfortably prosperous life was disrupted by James Hill's financial problems and his mental collapse. In 1840 he was declared bankrupt. Caroline Hill's father gave the family financial support, and took on some of Hill's paternal role.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Southwood Smith was a health and welfare reformer concerned with a range of social issues including child labour in mines and the housing of the urban poor. Caroline Hill held similar views on social reform, and her interest in progressive education, influenced by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], and Southwood Smith's daily experience in his work at the [[London Hospital]] in the [[East End of London|East End]] inspired Octavia Hill's concern for the poorest in early Victorian London. She received no formal schooling: her mother educated the family at home.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;
[[File:Ruskin-SouthwoodSmith-Maurice-Mayhew.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=four head and shoulder portraits of Victorian men|Early influences on Octavia Hill – top: [[John Ruskin]] and [[Thomas Southwood Smith]]; below: [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F.D. Maurice]] and [[Henry Mayhew]]]]
The family settled in a small cottage in [[Finchley]], now a north London suburb, but then a village.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Octavia Hill was impressed and moved by [[Henry Mayhew]]'s ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'', a book that portrayed the daily lives of slum dwellers. She was also strongly influenced by the theologian, [[Anglican]] priest and social reformer [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]], who was a family friend. She began her work on behalf of London's poor by helping to make toys for [[Ragged school]] children, and serving as secretary of the women's classes at the Working Men's College in [[Bloomsbury]] in central London.&lt;ref name=wohl&gt;Wohl, A. S., "Octavia Hill and the Homes of the London Poor", ''The Journal of British Studies'', University of Chicago Press, Vol. 10, No. 2 (May, 1971), pp. 105–31 {{DOI|10.1086/385612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A co-operative guild providing employment for "distressed gentlewomen" accepted Hill for training in glass-painting when she was 13. When the work of the guild was expanded to provide work in toy-making for Ragged school children, she was invited, at the age of 14, to take charge of the workroom.&lt;ref name=mann&gt;Mann, Peter H., "Octavia Hill: An Appraisal", ''The Town Planning Review'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (October 1952), pp. 223–37&lt;/ref&gt; The following year she began working in her spare time from the guild as a copyist for [[John Ruskin]] in [[Dulwich Art Gallery]] and the [[National Gallery]]. She was deeply aware of the dreadful living conditions of the children in her charge at the guild.

Her views on encouraging self-reliance led to her association with the [[Charity Organisation Society]] (COS), described by Hill's [[biographer]] Gillian Darley as "a contentious body which deplored dependence fostered by kindly but unrigorous philanthropy … support to the poor had to be carefully targeted and efficiently supervised. Later in life, however, she began to think the COS line … was over-harsh."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Hill was short, like all her family, and indifferent to fashion. Her friend [[Henrietta Barnett]] wrote: "She was small in stature with long body and short legs. She did not dress, she only wore clothes, which were often unnecessarily unbecoming; she had soft and abundant hair and regular features, but the beauty of her face lay in brown and very luminous eyes, which quite unconsciously she lifted upwards as she spoke on any matter for which she cared. Her mouth was large and mobile, but not improved by laughter. Indeed, Miss Octavia was nicest when she was made passionate by her earnestness."&lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt; Barnett also spoke of Hill's streak of ruthlessness. [[Gertrude Bell]] called Hill despotic. Later in Hill's life, the Bishop of London, [[Frederick Temple]], encountered her at a meeting of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and wrote, "She spoke for half an hour … I never had such a beating in all my life."&lt;ref&gt;Leak, Adrian, [http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2010/13-august/faith/for-houses-and-green-space "For houses and green space"] ''[[The Church Times]]'', 10 August 2010, accessed 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing for the poor===
[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the nineteenth century]]
Parliament and many concerned reformers had been attempting to improve the housing of the working classes since the early 1830s. When Hill began her work, the model dwelling movement had been in existence for twenty years, royal and select committees had sat to examine the problems of urban well-being, and the first of many tranches of legislation aimed at improving working class housing had been passed.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; From Hill's point of view these had all failed the poorest members of the working class, the unskilled labourers. She found that their landlords routinely ignored their obligations towards their tenants, and that the tenants were too ignorant and oppressed to better themselves.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; She tried to find new homes for her charges, but there was a severe shortage of available property, and Hill decided that her only solution was to become a landlord herself.

John Ruskin, who was interested in the co-operative guild, knew Hill from her work as his copyist and was impressed by her.&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; As an [[aesthete]] and a humanitarian he was affronted by the brutal ugliness of the slums.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, having inherited a substantial sum of money from his father, he acquired for £750 the leases of three cottages of six rooms each in Paradise Place, [[Marylebone]].{{#tag:ref|Now known as Garbutt Place.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;|group= n}}

Ruskin placed these houses, which were "in a dreadful state of dirt and neglect",&lt;ref name=times/&gt; under Hill's management. He told her that investors might be attracted to such schemes if a five percent annual return could be secured.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1866 Ruskin acquired the freehold of five more houses for Hill to manage in Freshwater Place, Marylebone.&lt;ref name=wyatt2&gt;Wyatt, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Times]]'' recorded, "The houses faced a bit of desolate ground occupied by dilapidated cowsheds and manure heaps. The needful repairs and cleaning were carried out, the waste land was turned into a playground where Mr. Ruskin had some trees planted."&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'' obituary, 15 August 1912, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

After being improved the properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. A return of five per cent on capital was obtained as promised to Ruskin; any excess over the five per cent was reinvested within the properties for the benefit of the tenants. Rent arrears were not tolerated, and bad debts were minimal. As Hill said, "Extreme punctuality, and diligence in collecting rents, and a strict determination that they shall be paid regularly, have accomplished this."&lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt;  In consequence of her prudent management, Hill was able to attract new backers, and by 1874 she had 15 housing schemes with around 3,000 tenants.&lt;ref  name=smith/&gt;

Hill's system was based on closely managing not only the buildings but the tenants; she insisted, "you cannot deal with the people and their houses separately."&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; She maintained close personal contact with all her tenants, and was strongly opposed to impersonal bureaucratic organisations and to governmental intervention in housing.&lt;ref name=morrell&gt;Morrell, Caroline, "Octavia Hill", ''The Economic History Review'', New Series, Vol. 52, No. 1 (February 1999), p. 158 {{DOI|10.1111/1468-0289.00122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her view, "municipal socialism and subsidized housing" led to indiscriminate demolition, re-housing schemes, and the destruction of communities.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt;

===Housing management===
At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants (who included [[Emma Cons]] and [[Eva McLaren]]) combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; At first Hill believed, "Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers."&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Her system required a large staff. Rent was collected on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Rent accounts were balanced in the afternoons and arrangements were made with contractors for repairs. On Thursdays and Fridays arrears were pursued, contractors' invoices paid, new tenancy lettings and tenants' moves organised.&lt;ref name=wyatt3/&gt;

If any of Hill's assistants had spare time, whether during normal working hours or in frequent voluntary after-hours working, it was used to promote tenants' associations and after-work and children's after-school clubs and societies.&lt;ref name=wyatt3&gt;Wyatt, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, Hill created the Southwark detachment of the [[Army Cadet Force]], its first independent unit, which gave training along military lines for local boys.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Hill considered that such an organisation would be more like the "real thing" than such existing outfits as the [[Church Lads' and Church Girls' Brigade|Church Lads' Brigade]] and therefore more attractive to young men "who had passed the age of make-believe". She invited a serving officer of the [[Derbyshire Regiment]] to set up the company, and such was its popularity that its numbers had to be capped at 160 cadets.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#EEEEEE |salign=center | quote =It would be wrong to assume that Octavia's principle of housing management was guided simply on the question of the payment of rent. Despite being up to date with his rent, a tenant was surprised to receive Notice to Quit, because he would not send his children to school and had overcrowded his rooms. Octavia's response to his complaint that he didn't owe any rent was that it was not the only thing she insisted upon. In her view, she could not allow anything so wrong as the neglect of children and overcrowding to continue where she had the power to prevent it!| source =  R.J. Wyatt &lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt;| align=left| width=33%}}
Hill's principles were summed up in an article of 1869: "Where a man persistently refuses to exert himself, external help is worse than useless." She was an outspoken critic of the principles of "[[outdoor relief]]" or the [[Speenhamland system]] of poor relief as operated by various Poor Law Boards. Because these systems did not encourage recipients to work, she regarded them as "a profligate use of public funds."&lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt; Under her methods, personal responsibility was encouraged. She insisted on dealing with arrears promptly; she appointed reliable caretakers; she took up on references of prospective tenants, and visited them in their homes; she paid careful attention to allocations and the placing of tenants, with regard to size of families and the size and location of the accommodation to be offered; and she made no rules that could not be properly enforced.&lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt;

In 1884, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners recognised her enlightened approach and turned to her to manage and reform their slum properties in South London, which were notorious for poverty and petty crime. Hill turned these estates into model properties, which still paid a return on investment. These estates continued to be let to tenants at affordable rents throughout much of the twentieth century, even when rent control was relaxed and open market rents substantially increased.&lt;ref name="Spencer-Thomas2018"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Octavia Hill (1838-1912) | last = Spencer-Thomas | first = Owen | work = Owen Spencer-Thomas | date = 2018 | accessdate = 2018-02-06 | url = http://sayitstraight.co.uk/local-history/biographies/octavia-hill-1838-1912/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An American admirer described her as "ruling over a little kingdom of three thousand loving subjects with an iron scepter twined with roses."&lt;ref&gt;Bremner, Robert H. "'An Iron Scepter Twined with Roses': The Octavia Hill System of Housing Management", ''The Social Service Review'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (June 1965), The University of Chicago Press, pp. 222–31 {{JSTOR|30017593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hill drove her associates hard, she drove herself harder. In 1877, she collapsed and had to take a break of several months from her work. Darley ascribes a number of contributory causes: "chronic overwork, a lack of delegation, the death of her close friend Jane Senior, the failure of a brief engagement",{{#tag:ref|Hill's fiancé was one of her helpers, the barrister and later M.P. [[Edward Bond (politician)|Edward Bond]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|group= n}} as well as an attack on her by John Ruskin.{{#tag:ref|Ruskin, by now mentally unstable, had reacted fiercely when Hill opposed his plans to sell his properties to the St. George's Company, an organisation that she regarded as financially dubious.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darley (2004) ''quoted'' by Smith&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The Hill family found a companion for her, Harriot Yorke (1843–1930). Yorke took on a great amount of the everyday work that had caused Hill's collapse. She remained her companion until Hill's death.  A further palliative was the building of a cottage, at [[Crockham Hill]] near [[Sevenoaks]] in Kent, where they could take breaks from their work in London.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

===Open spaces===
[[File:Wicken Lode1.JPG|thumb|alt=photograph of countryside scene, with water bounded by grass|[[Wicken Fen]] acquired by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 1899]]
[[File:Footpath on Hampstead Heath - geograph.org.uk - 53758.jpg|thumb|right|alt=outdoor photograph of a large, grassed open space, with trees|[[Hampstead Heath]] – saved by Octavia Hill and others]] Among Hill's concerns was that her tenants, and all urban workers, should have access to open spaces.  She believed in "the life-enhancing virtues of pure earth, clean air and blue sky."&lt;ref&gt;[http://octaviahill.org/conservation.html "Conservation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401202153/http://octaviahill.org/conservation.html |date=1 April 2010 }} The Octavia Hill Society, accessed 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883 she wrote:
{{quote|There is perhaps no need of the poor of London which more prominently forces itself on the notice of anyone working among them than that of space. ... How can it best be given? And what is it precisely which should be given? I think we want four things. Places to sit in, places to play in, places to stroll in, and places to spend a day in. The preservation of [[Wimbledon and Putney Commons|Wimbledon]] and [[Epping Forest|Epping]] shows that the need is increasingly recognised. But a visit to Wimbledon, Epping, or [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor]] means for the workman not only the cost of the journey but the loss of a whole day's wages; we want, besides, places where the long summer evenings or the Saturday afternoon may be enjoyed without effort or expense.&lt;ref&gt;Hill 1883, VII.

She campaigned hard against building on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save [[Hampstead Heath]] and [[Parliament Hill Fields]] from development.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; She was the first to use the term "Green Belt" for the protected rural areas surrounding London. Three hills in Kent (Mariners Hill, [[Toys Hill]] and [[Ide Hill]]) which she helped to protect from development form part of the belt.&lt;ref name=hillsocwho&gt;[http://octaviahill.org/who-was-octavia-hill.html "Who Was Octavia Hill?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601102028/http://octaviahill.org/who-was-octavia-hill.html |date=1 June 2010 }} The Octavia Hill Society, accessed 15 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 Hill became the treasurer of the Kyrle Society, founded in that year by her eldest sister, [[Miranda Hill|Miranda]], as a "Society for the Diffusion of Beauty". Under the slogan "Bring Beauty Home to the Poor" it aimed to bring art, books, music and open spaces into the lives of the urban poor.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Octavia, "Oratorios for the People", ''The Musical Times'', December 1884, p. 717 {{JSTOR|3356074}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a short period it flourished and expanded, and although it declined after a few years, it was a template for the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], 20 years later.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Before that, however, Hill was engaged in a campaign in 1883 to stop the construction of railways from the quarries in the fells overlooking [[Buttermere]], in the English [[Lake District]], with damaging effect on the unspoilt scenery. The campaign was led by Canon [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], who secured the support of Ruskin, Hill, and [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]], solicitor to the [[Commons Preservation Society]].&lt;ref name=rawnsleydnb&gt;Murphy, Graham. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37884 "Rawnsley, Hardwicke Drummond (1851–1920)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 15 November 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1875 onwards, Hunter had been Hill's legal adviser on the protection of open spaces in London. Both he and Rawnsley, building on an idea put forward by Ruskin, conceived of a trust that could buy and preserve places of natural beauty and historic interest for the nation.&lt;ref name=hunterdnb&gt;Chubb L.W., rev.

On 16 November 1893, Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley met in the offices of the Commons Preservation Society and agreed to launch such a trust. Hill suggested that it should be called "The Commons and Gardens Trust", but the three agreed to adopt Hunter's suggested title, the "National Trust".&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Under its full formal title, the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty was inaugurated the following year.&lt;ref name=hunterdnb/&gt; The trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and endangered buildings of historic interest; its first property was [[Alfriston Clergy House]] and its first [[nature reserve]] was [[Wicken Fen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-trust/w-thecharity/w-thecharity_our-past/w-history_trust-timeline.htm "Timeline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204142224/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-trust/w-thecharity/w-thecharity_our-past/w-history_trust-timeline.htm |date=4 February 2011 }}, The National Trust, accessed 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
The number of homes managed by Hill continued to grow. Although Ruskin had turned against her in a bout of mental instability, she found a new supporter, the [[Church Commissioners|Ecclesiastical Commissioners]], who handed over to her the management of their housing estates in several poor areas of south London.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; By the end of the nineteenth century, Hill's women workers were no longer unpaid volunteers but trained professionals. Hill's influence spread beyond the properties under her own control. Her ideas were taken up and copied, with her enthusiastic support, in continental Europe and the United States of America.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; [[Beatrice Webb]] said that she "first became aware of the meaning of the poverty of the poor," while staying with her sister, who was a rent collector for Octavia Hill in the East End.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s daughter, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice of Hesse-Darmstadt]], was taken incognito on a tour of some of Hill's properties, and she translated Hill's ''Homes of the London Poor'' into German.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=1662917|year=1990|author1=Lowry|first1=S|title=Much from little|journal=BMJ : British Medical Journal|volume=300|issue=6733|pages=1207–1208|doi=10.1136/bmj.300.6733.1207}} (free access)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those whom Hill trained was her assistant and secretary, Maud Jeffery, who was later engaged by the [[Commissioners of Crown Lands]] to run new housing estates in London on Octavia Hill's lines.&lt;ref&gt;"The Housing Business Group", ''Housing News'', Autumn 2004, [[The Crown Estate]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Even some local authorities, despite Hill's distrust, followed her model:  some of the earliest examples of municipal council housing, at [[Kensington]] and [[Camberwell]], were run on her lines, with the acquisition of working class houses, and their gradual improvement, without evictions or demolitions.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt;

[[File:Octavia hill.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hill in 1881]]

Despite her opposition to interference by national or local government in the provision of housing, Hill had to cope with the newly created [[London County Council]] and the involvement of the council and other local authorities in providing housing for the poor. In 1884 a royal commission on the housing of the working classes was set up, but the prime minister, [[William Ewart Gladstone|W.E. Gladstone]], and his ministerial colleagues vetoed a proposal to include Hill among the members of the commission.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Gladstone approved of Hill's principles but thought her difficult as a person. Had Hill's appointment not been vetoed, she would have been the first woman member of a royal commission. In the event she was one of the commission's key witnesses. She served as a member of a later royal commission, on the Poor Laws, in 1905.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U187121 "Hill, Miss Octavia",] ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007,   accessed 11 Oct 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}  The municipal authorities quickly surpassed her in the number of properties under their management.

A.S. Wohl notes that in the 1880s Hill had about £70,000 worth of property under her management, and at the end of her career she was managing the dwellings of "perhaps three or four thousand people at the most."&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; The London County Council, by contrast, had a budget of £1,500,000 for its programme of rehousing London's poor in 1901–02.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Octavia, [http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TT19010427.2.24 "Housing of the Poor"], ''The Times'', 4 March 1901, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill was opposed to other reforms that came about in the early part of the twentieth century. She was against female suffrage on the grounds that "men and women help one another because they are different, have different gifts and different spheres."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 15 July 1910, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; She also believed that provision of social services and old-age pensions by the government did more harm than good, sapping people's self-reliance.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Hill died from [[cancer]] on 13 August 1912 at her home in [[Marylebone]], at the age of 73.

==Legacy and memorials==
[[File:Octavia_Hill_(plaque).jpg|thumb|right|alt=photograph of a memorial blue plaque|Plaque at Redcross Way in South London]]
When [[John Singer Sargent]]'s portrait of her was presented by her fellow-workers in 1898, Hill made a speech in which she said, "When I am gone, I hope my friends will not try to carry out any special system, or to follow blindly in the track which I have trodden. New circumstances require various efforts, and it is the spirit, not the dead form, that should be perpetuated. ... We shall leave them a few houses, purified and improved, a few new and better ones built, a certain amount of thoughtful and loving management, a few open spaces..." But, she said, more important would be "the quick eye to see, the true soul to measure, the large hope to grasp the mighty issues of the new and better days to come  – greater ideals, greater hope, and patience to realize both."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sydney Cockerell|Cockerell, Sir Sydney]], "Octavia Hill", ''The Times'', 28 February 1935, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horace Street Trust, founded by Hill, became a model for many subsequent housing associations and developed into the present trust that bears her name, Octavia Housing. Today it owns several of the homes, including Gable Cottages, designed by Elijah Hoole, who worked with Hill for many years.&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;[http://octaviahill.org/octavia-s-legacy.html  "Legacy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528084208/http://octaviahill.org/octavia-s-legacy.html |date=28 May 2010 }}, Octavia Hill Society, accessed 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Hill's determination to provide community space can still be seen in the shape of the Red Cross site in Southwark (1888), among others. The Octavia Hill Society website states that with  a community hall, and soundly maintained attractive houses, Hill here anticipated the fundamental ingredients of town planning by some 15 years.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt;

The [[Settlement movement|Settlement Movement]] (creating integrated mixed communities of rich and poor) grew directly out of Hill's work. Her colleagues [[Samuel Augustus Barnett|Samuel]] and Henrietta Barnett, founded [[Toynbee Hall]], the first university-sponsored settlement, which together with the Women's University Settlement (later called the Blackfriars Settlement) continues to serve local communities.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; Overseas, Hill's name is perpetuated in the Octavia Hill Association in [[Philadelphia]], a small property company founded in 1896 to provide affordable housing to low and middle-income city residents.&lt;ref name="davis/"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Allen|last2=Sutherland|first2=John F.|title=Reform and Uplift Among the Philadelphia Negroes: the Diary of Helen Parrish, 1888|journal=Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography|date=October 1970|volume=94|issue=4|pages=496–99|url=https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/view/42674/42395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt;

Women who had trained under Hill formed the Association of Women Housing Workers in 1916. This later changed its name to the Society of Housing Managers in 1948. After merging with the Institute of Housing Managers in 1965, the society became the present day [[Chartered Institute of Housing]] in 1994. The CIH is a professional body for those working in the housing profession in the UK and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cih.org/about/history.htm "History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062420/http://www.cih.org/about/history.htm |date=21 July 2011 }}, Chartered Institute of Housing, accessed 15 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The training that Hill gave to Charity Organisation Society volunteers contributed to the development of modern social work, and COS continued to be instrumental in developing social work as a profession during the twentieth century. COS is still in operation today as the charity [[Family Action]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155 "1880s"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718211919/http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155 |date=18 July 2011 }}, Family Action, accessed 15 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Parliament passed the first National Trust Act, enshrining the trust's permanent purpose and giving it powers to protect property for the benefit of the nation. The trust now looks after a wide range of coast, countryside and historic buildings. According to the trust's website, "Staff, volunteers and tenants are engaged daily in providing access to open spaces for people's enjoyment, providing habitats for wildlife and in improving our environment – 'for ever, for everyone'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment.htm "For ever for everyone"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122121035/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment.htm |date=22 November 2010 }}, The National Trust, accessed 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemorations of Hill herself include a monument to her at a [[Surrey]] beauty spot, on the summit of a hill called [[Hydon Ball]] (now owned by the National Trust). Shortly after her death, the family erected a stone seat there, from which walkers can enjoy views over the Surrey countryside. The Octavia Hill Society was set up in 1992 "to promote awareness of the ideas and ideals of Octavia Hill, her family, fellow workers and their relevance in today's society nationally and internationally".&lt;ref&gt;[http://octaviahill.org/the-octavia-hill-society.html "Octavia Hill Society"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609155157/http://octaviahill.org/the-octavia-hill-society.html |date=9 June 2010 }}, The Octavia Hill Society, accessed 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under the society's auspices her birthplace at Wisbech has been turned into the Octavia Hill Birthplace Museum.

The '''Program on Negotiation''' ('''PON''') is a university [[consortium]] dedicated to developing the theory and practice of [[negotiation]] and [[dispute resolution]]. As a community of scholars and practitioners, PON serves a unique role in the world negotiation community. Founded in 1983 as a special research project at [[Harvard Law School]], PON includes faculty, students, and staff from [[Harvard University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Tufts University]].

The Program on Negotiation publishes the quarterly ''Negotiation Journal'' and the monthly ''Negotiation Briefings'' newsletter, and distributes the annual ''Harvard Negotiation Law Review''. Throughout the year PON offers a number of courses and training opportunities ranging in length from one day to an entire semester.

== History ==

In 1979, co-authors of the bestseller ''[[Getting to Yes|Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement without Giving In]]'', [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and [[William Ury]], along with Bruce Patton founded the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]] (HNP), with a mission to improve the theory, teaching, and practice of negotiation and dispute resolution, so that people could deal more constructively with conflicts ranging from the interpersonal to the international. Fisher began by asking the question of what kind of advice could be given to both sides of a dispute, and in researching this question he came in contact with various professors, including James Sebenius, [[Lawrence Susskind]], [[Frank Sander]], and [[Howard Raiffa]], who collaborated to form the Program on Negotiation.

The Program on Negotiation was founded in 1983 as the world's first teaching and research center dedicated to negotiation and dispute resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/about/|title=Welcome to the Program on Negotiation (PON)|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[umbrella organization]] with founding members from both Harvard and MIT, it soon expanded to include Tufts University as one of its consortium schools. Since the beginning, the Program on Negotiation has been multi-disciplinary, with scholars from economics, government, law, business, psychology, anthropology, education, and the arts. Faculty have focused on a wide range of research topics, including deal-making, diplomatic negotiations, international negotiations, psychological aspects of negotiations, decision-making, issues relating to ethics and trust, and labor negotiations.

Chair of the Program on Negotiation since 1994, Professor Robert H. Mnookin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/faculty/robert-mnookin-chair-pon-executive-committee/|title=Robert Mnookin, Chair, PON Executive Committee|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Samuel Williston Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. Among his recent publications are the books, ''Beyond Winning: Negotiating to Create Value in Deals and Disputes'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/shop/beyond-winning-negotiating-to-create-value-in-deals-and-disputes/|title=Beyond Winning Negotiating to Create Value in Deals and Disputes|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bargaining with the Devil: When to Negotiate, When to Fight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/shop/bargaining-with-the-devil-when-to-negotiate-when-to-fight/|title=Bargaining with the Devil When to Negotiate, When to Fight|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training ==

PON offers a number of training programs throughout the year on a variety of topics including negotiation, mediation, conflict resolution, deal design, difficult conversations, and many more. PON seminars and courses are open to the public.

=== Author Sessions ===
The Program on Negotiation offers one day Author Sessions focused on recent book publications by PON faculty members as part of its Executive Education Series. Recent courses included: Deal-Making and Negotiauctions, Creating a World-class Negotiating Organization, Bargaining with the Devil, and Negotiating International Deals.

=== Executive Education ===
Executive Education courses last for three days, covering strategies for business leaders to handle both successful day-to-day management and long-term strategies for healthy workplace environments. Executives learn tactics for dealing with dirty tricks, threats, attacks, and stonewalls from the other side of the table.

=== Harvard Negotiation Institute ===
Harvard Negotiation Institute (HNI) classes are offered every June and September on the Harvard Law School campus and cover a broad range of negotiation and mediation skills, ranging from beginning to advanced techniques. Most of the courses offered are five-day classes. However, a 2-day Intensive Negotiation Workshop for Lawyers and Working Professionals is also offered. Recent course offerings included: a mediation workshop, Creating Value in Deals and Disputes, Tools for Preparing and Negotiating Effectively, Deal Design and Implementation, and Difficult Conversations.

=== PON Seminars ===
Open to participants from all disciplines and professional fields, the PON [[Seminars]] provide negotiation and [[mediation]] courses to the community. These semester-length courses are designed to increase public awareness and understanding of successful conflict resolution efforts.

Two courses are taught each year: Negotiation and Dispute Resolution in the fall, and Mediation and Conflict Management in the spring. Both courses provide participants with a conceptual framework and practical advice for professional and personal development in dispute resolution. Faculty is drawn from the PON community of scholars and practitioners of alternative dispute resolution.

The Program on Negotiation also hosts a variety of smaller workshops and intensive two-day courses in addition to their normal course offerings, including on-site training.

== Great Negotiator Award ==

The Program on Negotiation established the [[Great Negotiator Award]] in 2000 to honor individuals of extraordinary achievement in dispute resolution. The award is designed not only to honor the accomplishments of outstanding negotiators, but also to focus public attention on the important role of negotiation as society faces increasingly complex disputes in all sectors–public and private, technological and ethical, personal and professional. PON has recognized a diverse cast of distinguished negotiators from their respective fields: [[Juan Manuel Santos]], [[2016 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient and President of [[Colombia]] (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/09/santos-receives-2017-great-negotiator-award/ |title= Santos receives 2017 Great Negotiator Award |publisher= news.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Martti Ahtisaari]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient and former President of [[Finland]] (2010); [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]], the artists who created [[The Gates]] in [[Central Park]] (2008); [[Bruce Wasserstein]], Chairman and CEO of [[Lazard]], an international financial advisory and asset management firm (2007); [[Sadako Ogata]], former [[United Nations]] high commissioner for refugees (2005); [[Richard Holbrooke]], former United States ambassador to the United Nations (2004); [[Stuart Eizenstat]], former U.S. ambassador to the [[European Union]] (2003); Ambassador [[Lakhdar Brahimi]], the United Nations’ special envoy for [[Afghanistan]] (2002); [[Charlene Barshefsky]], U.S. trade representative in the second [[Clinton administration]] (2001); and former U.S. Senator [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]] for his work in [[Northern Ireland]] (2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12608">'''Proximity marketing''' is the localized [[wireless]] distribution of advertising content associated with a particular place.  Transmissions can be received by individuals in that location who wish to receive them and have the necessary equipment to do so.

Distribution may be via a traditional localized [[Broadcasting|broadcast]], or more commonly is specifically targeted to devices known to be in a particular area.

The location of a device may be determined by:
*A [[cellular phone]] being in a particular cell 
*A [[Bluetooth]] or [[WiFi]] device being within range of a transmitter. 
*An [[Internet]] enabled device with [[GPS]] enabling it to request localized content from [[Internet]] servers.
*A [[Near field communication|NFC]] enabled phone can read a [[RFID]] chip on a product or media and launch localized content from [[internet]] servers.

Communications may be further targeted to specific groups within a given location, for example content in tourist hot spots may only be distributed to devices registered outside the local area.

Communications may be both time and place specific, e.g. content at a conference venue may depend on the event in progress.

Uses of proximity marketing include distribution of media at concerts, information (weblinks on local facilities), gaming and social applications, and advertising.

==Bluetooth-based systems==
[[Bluetooth]], a short-range [[wireless]] system supported by many mobile devices, is one transmission medium used for proximity marketing. 
The process of Bluetooth based proximity marketing involves setting up Bluetooth "broadcasting" equipment at a particular location and then sending information which can be text, images, audio or video to Bluetooth enabled devices within range of the broadcast server. These devices are often referred to as beacons. Other standard data exchange formats such as [[vCard]] can also be used. This form of proximity marketing is also referred to as [[Close Range Marketing|close range marketing]].

It used to be the case that due to security fears, or a desire to save battery life, many users keep their Bluetooth devices in OFF mode, or ON but not set to be 'discoverable'.  Because of this, often regions where Bluetooth proximity marketing is in operation it is accompanied by advising via traditional media - such as posters, television screens or field marketing teams - suggesting people make their Bluetooth handsets 'discoverable' in order to receive free content - this is often referred to as a "Call-to-Action." A 'discoverable' Bluetooth device within range of the server is automatically sent a message asking if the user would like to receive the free content.

Current mobile phones usually have bluetooth switched ON by default,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/03/12/apple-keeps-turning-bluetooth-on-when-you-update-your-iphone/ Apple Keeps Turning Bluetooth On When You Update Your iPhone]&lt;/ref&gt; and some users leave bluetooth switched on for easy connection with car kits and headsets.

In the past some implementations of Bluetooth proximity marketing require users to run Java applications on their phones to enable them to receive content. This has the advantage that only those who choose to will receive content. Others require no handset-side software.

The diversity of mobile phones is huge. Screen sizes and supported file formats varies greatly. To obtain the optimal user experience with Bluetooth Marketing, the Bluetooth system must be able to automatically recognize phone models and deliver the proper content automatically. Some businesses choose to utilize multiple proximity marketing platforms to cater to different popular models of smart phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://proxibluetoothmarketing.com/index.php/2018/01/22/what-is-proximity-marketing/|title=What is proximity marketing? - Proxi Bluetooth Marketing|date=2018-01-22|work=Proxi Bluetooth Marketing|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Android devices, a notification can be sent without having an app installed using the Eddystone-URL. The Google Nearby is an in-built service that scans for beacon signals and displays the message tied to that signal. Apps that are compatible with Physical Web can also do the same. Chrome has since withdrawn support for the Physical Web. In regions where Google is banned, Samsung's browser Closeby does the same as Nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/beacons/|title=Beacons  {{!}}  Google Developers|website=Google Developers|language=en|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On iOS devices, the relevant app needs to be installed that can then receive messages from nearby beacons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.in/BEACONS-What-They-Are-How-They-Work-And-Why-Theyre-Important/articleshow/27808938.cms|title=BEACONS: What They Are, How They Work, And Why They're Important|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wifi-based systems ==
There are systems capable of detecting certain signals periodically emitted by any electronic devices equipped with [[WiFi]] or [[Bluetooth]] technology, and the subsequent use of gathered information to detect the position or presence of, and/or flows of information to and from, said devices, in a statistical or aggregate form.

This technology is used in a manner equivalent to other systems, such as Radio-frequency Identification (RFID), which serve for locating devices within a controlled environment; it works in conjunction with signals from WiFi issuers (also called wireless tags) and receiving antennas, in different locations, so that the movements and presence of WiFi-equipped devices can be analyzed in terms of arrival time, length of visit per zone, paths of movement, general flows, etc.

The continuously increasing use of smartphones and tablets has fueled a boom in WiFi tracking technology, specially in the retail environment. Such technology can be used by managers of a physical business to ascertain how many devices are present in a given area, and to observe or optimize business marketing and management.

Technically, such technology is based on two main models:

1.    Re-use of standard [[Wireless access point|Access Point (AP)]] technologies with a  [[Captive portal|Captive Portal]], already deployed in numerous locations (airports, malls, shops, etc.). An example of this model is the Cisco [http://www.cisco.com &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] technology.

2.    Use of antennas for the detection of signals in the 2.4 or 5&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency bands, positioning the detected devices within strategic areas, in order to obtain a unique identifier about every mobile device is detected in such locations, and with the corresponding  HTML5, iOS and Android SDKs integrated in any APP or Web, allowing interaction by proximity with the users through the mobile devices. An example of this model is the Seeketing [http://www.seeketing.com &lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] technology.

The first option manifests weaker ability to detect and send messages to the public, because AP devices were created for purposes other than wireless tracking and operate by extracting information only from select devices (smartphones or tablets which have previously connected to the AP in question). In practice, and depending on the environment, as many as 10-20% of visitors access to the captive portal when they visit a point of sale

The second option is to analyze all signals detected within the bands used by the WiFi and Bluetooth technology, offering a higher detection ratio of total visitors (about 60%-70%) and extracting behavior patterns that allow the assignment of a unique identifier, each time a device is detected. Such identifiers are not linked to any data present on the device, nor to any information from the device manufacturer, so that relation to any particular user of the device cannot be made. Unlike in the above case, visitor security (in the sense of anonymity) is total.

Thanks to Seeketing SDKs for iOS, Android, and HTML5 APIs for Web pages, this model of technology allows retailers, or managers of any physical location, to send push notification to the smartphones with an APP installed, or to send SMS/WhatsAPP/Email messages to those users who previously was registered in a captive portal, even if they not are using the APs or Wifi connection to access internet.

Assignment of the same unique identifier to tracking information obtained by the antennas, APP and Webs APIs remains a challenge, and allows to have both online and offline beviour information to optimize proximity communication campaigns in a non-intrusive way.

==NFC-based systems==
[[Near Field Communication]] (NFC) [[NFC Tag|tag]]s are embedded in the NFC Smart Poster, Smart Product or Smart Book. The tag has a RFID chip with an embedded command. The command can be to open the mobile browser on a given page or offer. Any NFC-enabled phone can activate this tag by placing the device in close proximity. The information can be anything from product details, special accommodation deals, and information on local restaurants.

The German drugstore chain, Budnikowsky, launched the first NFC-enabled Smart Poster in October 2011 which allowed train commuters to tap their phones on the poster to shop and find more information. in November 2011, Atria Books/[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] launched the [[Impulse Economy]], the first NFC-enabled Smart Book.

In the UK NFC is being adopted by most of the outdoor poster contractors. Clear Channel have installed over 25,000 Adshel posters with NFC tags (and QR codes for Apple phones).

Retailers are also looking at NFC as it offers a cost effective method by which consumers can engage with brands but doesn't require integrating the technology into their IT systems - which is a barrier to many new technologies like BLE. A number of retailers have already started using NFC to enhance the shopping experience, Casino in France and Vic in Holland.

Proximity Marketing Strategy using NFC Technology has been widely adopted in Japan and uses 'pull' rather than 'push' marketing allowing the consumer the choice of where and when they receive marketing messages.

There are a number NFC-enabled phones entering the market spurred by NFC mobile wallet trials globally. NFC wallets include the [[Google Wallet]] and [[ISIS (mobile payment system)]]. While [[mobile payment]] is the driver for NFC, proximity marketing is an immediate beneficiary in-market.

Apple did not include this technology in their initial smartphone models. Apple added NFC to the [[iPhone 6]] and [[iPhone 6 Plus]].

==GSM-based systems==
Proximity Marketing via SMS relies on GSM 03.41 which defines the Short Message Service - Cell Broadcast. SMS-CB allows messages (such as advertising or public information) to be broadcast to all mobile users in a specified geographical area. In the Philippines, GSM-based proximity broadcast systems are used by select Government Agencies for information dissemination on Government-run community-based programs to take advantage of its reach and popularity ([[Philippines]] has the world's highest traffic of SMS). It is also used for commercial service known as Proxima SMS. Bluewater, a super-regional shopping centre in the UK, has a GSM based system supplied by NTL to help its GSM coverage for calls, it also allows each customer with a mobile phone to be tracked though the centre which shops they go into and for how long. The system enables special offer texts to be sent to the phone.

'''''Race Against the Machine''''' is a non-fiction book from 2011 by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] and [[Andrew McAfee]] about the interaction of digital technology, employment and organization.   The full title of the book is: ''Race Against the Machine: How the Digital Revolution Is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy''.

==Contents==
The main thesis of this book is that we are in the midst of a technological revolution that is radically redefining what work is, how value is created, and how the economy distributes that value. The authors stumbled upon these ideas after analyzing the unique economic recovery that followed the Great Recession of 2008. When the recession ended, many measures of economic health (such as GDP, corporate profits, and investment in equipment and software) rebounded quickly; however, one measure, unemployment, lagged behind. This observation led the authors to conclude that a drastic shift in the means of production was taking place. The authors believe that technology is causing this shift, simultaneously boosting the productivity of firms while also eliminating the need for many forms of human labor. As the authors came to this conclusion, they looked around to see if anyone else had begun to analyze this trend. When they found that technology was largely being left out of the mainstream discussion of unemployment, they decided that they would write this book to help get the ball rolling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Against The Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy|last=Brynjolfsson|first=Erik|last2=McAfee|first2=Andrew|publisher=Digital Frontier Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Lexington, Massachusetts|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One supporting point in the book is that the pace of automation has picked up in recent years due to a combination of increasingly clever technologies such as [[robotics]], [[numerically controlled]] machines, computerized [[inventory management software]], [[speech recognition]], speaker recognition, language translation, [[self-driving vehicles]], [[pattern recognition]] and online commerce. The authors write that businesses are increasingly substituting machines for people, and that rate at which digital technologies are advancing is exponentially higher than that of the organizations, institutions, and individuals within our economy. Additionally, the corporate use of equipment and software is increasing faster than the rate than employment.&lt;ref name=NYTimesReview&gt;Steve Lohr, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/technology/economists-see-more-jobs-for-machines-not-people.html More Jobs Predicted for Machines, Not People],'' book review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2011.10.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TechCrunch&gt;[[Andrew Keen]], ''[https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/15/keen-on-how-the-internet-is-making-us-both-richer-and-more-unequal-tctv/  Keen On How The Internet Is Making Us Both Richer and More Unequal (TCTV)],'' interview with [[Andrew McAfee]] and [[Erik Brynjolfsson]], [[TechCrunch]], 2011.11.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider&gt;JILL KRASNY, ''[http://www.businessinsider.com/mit-professors-the-99-should-shake-their-fists-at-the-tech-boom-2011-11  MIT Professors: The 99% Should Shake Their Fists At The Tech Boom]'', [[Business Insider]], 2011.11.25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheMarker&gt;Ascher Schechter, ''[http://www.themarker.com/markerweek/1.2154726  After the Working Class, Technology is Eliminating the Middle Class]'', [[TheMarker]], 2013.01.11.

Brynjolfsson and McAfee write that advanced digital technologies are making people more innovative, productive and richer, both in the short- and long-term, but potentially at the cost of increasing wealth inequality in society. In the authors' view, one of the main [[Egalitarianism|in-egalitarian]] consequences of digital technological developments is its potentially negative impact on some types of employment, such as routine information processing work. The authors appear to advocate for a collaborative partnership between computers and humans as the road to future job creation. "In medicine, law, finance, retailing, manufacturing and even scientific discovery," they write, "the key to winning the race is not to compete ''against'' machines but to compete ''with'' machines."&lt;ref name=NYTimesReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=TechCrunch/&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheMarker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt;

==Recommendations==
Given the advancement of technology, the authors have several recommendations for policymakers in the United States to increase economic prosperity, including:&lt;ref&gt;http://ebusiness.mit.edu/erik/ma2012_brynjolfsson_mcafee.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Investing more in education, starting with increasing teacher salaries
* More accountability for teachers on performance metrics, possibly including the elimination of tenure
* Focus education on useful outcomes and less on signaling prestige, time, or effort, by separating instruction from certification and testing
* More instructional hours per year for K-12 students
* Expand immigration of entrepreneurs and skilled workers, including both permanent residents and H1-B
* Teach entrepreneurship skills in higher education (outside of business schools)
* Speed the creation of startups with franchise opportunities, online guides, and clearinghouses
* Reduce regulatory barriers to new business creation
* Invest more in communication and transportation infrastructure improvements
* Invest more in government funding for basic research
* Maintain labor market fluidity and the ability to hire and fire
* Reduce payroll taxes (to make it more attractive to hire a person rather than a machine) and increase taxes on congestion and pollution
* De-couple health insurance from employment
* Keep crowdsourcing businesses like [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] lightly regulated to allow experimentation
* Eliminate tax breaks for home mortgages and reallocate the proceeds to education and research
* Reduce government subsidies for the financial services industry, to free talent for other industries
* Reform the patent system, and speed up patent adjudication
* Reduce the length of copyright terms and expand [[fair use]]

==Criticism==
Like [[Jeremy Rifkin]]'s book ''[[The End of Work]]'', ''The Race against the Machine'' has been criticized for lacking credible evidence in making predictions about future job loss.&lt;ref&gt;E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(2), 13-14]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggest the invention and distribution of computers during the 1990s increased employment, rather than decreased it.&lt;ref&gt;J Bessen, ‘How Computer Automation Affects Occupations: Technology, jobs, and skills’ (2016) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2690435 Boston University, Law &amp; Economics WP No. 15-49]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5553">A '''sacrifice zone''' or '''sacrifice area''' (often termed a '''national sacrifice zone''' or '''national sacrifice area''') is a geographic area that has been permanently impaired by environmental damage or economic disinvestment.  These zones are most commonly found in low-income and minority communities.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Commentators including [[Chris Hedges]], [[Joe Sacco]], and [[Stephen Lerner]] have argued that corporate business practices contribute to producing sacrifice zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sacrifice Zones: The Front Lines of Toxic Chemical Exposure in the United States | pmc=3114843 | page=A266 | volume=119 | issue=6 | journal=Environ Health Perspect | doi=10.1289/ehp.119-a266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/07/chris-hedges-americas-sacrifice-zones-being-destroyed-for-profit/|title=Chris Hedges: America’s devastated ‘sacrifice zones’ are the future for all of us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/02/157813661/drive-for-profit-wreaks-days-of-destruction|title=Drive For Profit Wreaks 'Days Of Destruction'|date=2 August 2012|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==

The concept of sacrifice zones was first discussed during the [[Cold War]], as a likely result of [[nuclear fallout]].&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2010/09/23/steve-lerner-book-sacrifice-zones/|title=Think Globally, Act Locally: Steve Lerner, 'Sacrifice Zones,' at Politics and Prose|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=May 2017}} According to Helen Huntington Smith,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpwashingtonpost/docview/146405625/abstract/8E2861D9F233402DPQ/5|title=The Wringing of the West|last=Huntington Smith|first=Helena|date=1975-02-16|work=The Washington Post|location=Washington, DC|pages=–1-B4|issn=01908286|accessdate=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term was first used in discussing the long-term effects of strip-mining coal in the American West in the 1970s. The [[National Academy of Sciences]]/[[National Academy of Engineering]] Study Committee on the Potential for Rehabilitating Lands Surface Mined for Coal in the Western United States produced a 1973 report that introduced the term, finding:&lt;blockquote&gt;In each zone the probability of rehabilitating an area depends upon the land use objectives, the characteristics of the site, the technology available, and the skill with which this technology is applied. At the extremes, if surface mined lands are declared national sacrifice areas, all ecological zones have a high probability of being successfully rehabilitated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3065">'''Sarah Page''' (26 August 1863 &amp;ndash; 20 January 1950), also known as '''Sarah Saunders Page''', was a New Zealand teacher, feminist, prohibitionist, socialist, social reformer, and politician.

[[File:Samuel Page 1907.jpg|thumb|upright|Samuel Page, her husband, in 1907]]
Sarah Saunders was born in [[Waimea Plains, Tasman|Waimea South]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], New Zealand in 1863. She was one of ten children of [[Alfred Saunders]], a radical politician, and grew up surrounded by [[Quakers]]. In 1896, she married Samuel Page, who was a science demonstrator at [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]] and like herself a Quaker. They were to have two sons.&lt;ref name="DNZB Page" /&gt;

With [[Ada Wells]], she was a dominating influence on the Canterbury Women's Institute. She was also active with the [[National Council of Women of New Zealand]] and was the organisation's secretary in 1905–06. She was an ardent critic of conscription and upset Prime Minister [[William Massey]] and the Minister of Internal Affairs, [[George Warren Russell]], with her criticism. Her son Robin was a conscientious objector and was imprisoned in 1918.&lt;ref name="DNZB Page" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=General Items |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=BH19180128.2.21 |accessdate=5 December 2015 |work=Bruce Herald |volume=LIV |issue=7 |date=28 January 1918 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Labour Party developed into a strong party in the 1920s, Page's extreme left views became less accepted and her influence faded.

SIDE explains the effects of anonymity and identifiability on group behavior. It has become one of several [[theories of technology]] that describe social effects of [[computer-mediated communication]].

The [[Social identity theory|social identity]] model of deindividuation effects (or SIDE model) is a theory developed in [[social psychology]] and communication studies. SIDE explains the effects of [[anonymity]] and identifiability on group behavior. It has become one of several theories examining technology that describe social effects of [[Computer-mediated communication|computer-mediated]] communication. With advancing technology it is becoming increasingly researched what the effects of having the control of being incognito on the web, and also having profiles that represent ones person is doing to relationships and communication in our lives. The SIDE model provides an alternative explanation for effects of [[anonymity]] and other "deindividuating" factors that classic deindividuation theory cannot adequately explain. To understand the model of deindividuation, it is described by scholarly articles as "the situation in which individuals act in groups and do not see themselves as individuals, thereby facilitating antinormative behavior"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Kyung Kyu|last2=Lee|first2=Ae Ri|last3=Lee|first3=Un-Kon|date=July 2018|title=Impact of anonymity on roles of personal and group identities in online communities|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378720618302490|journal=Information &amp; Management|doi=10.1016/j.im.2018.07.005|issn=0378-7206}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

== Background ==

SIDE developed as a critique of deindividuation theory. Deindividuation theory was developed to explain the phenomenon that in crowds, people become capable of acts that rational individuals would not normally endorse (see also [[Crowd psychology]]). In the crowd, so it would seem, humans become disinhibited and behave anti-normatively. Early versions of deindividuation theory&lt;ref name="Zimbardo" /&gt; saw this as a consequence of reduced self-awareness and accountability. Diener&lt;ref name="Diener" /&gt; and others later focused more exclusively on loss of self as the core psychological process underlying deindividuation.

Reicher&lt;ref name="Reicher1982"&gt;Reicher, S.D. (1982)  The determination of collective behaviour.  In Tajfel (Ed.) Social Identity and Intergroup Relations  Cambridge, CUP, and Paris, Maison des Sciences de l'Homme.&lt;/ref&gt; criticized deindividuation theory for several reasons. Among others, historical evidence and case studies strongly suggested that the psychological process proposed by deindividuation theory (a loss of self) did not occur in the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;McPhail, C. (1991). ''The myth of the madding crowd.'' New York: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] of empirical deindividuation research confirmed there was no consistent empirical evidence for the processes it proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Postmes, T., &amp; Spears, R. (1998). Deindividuation and anti-normative behavior: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 123'', 238–259.&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary: anonymity and reduced self-awareness enhanced sensitivity to local norms. SIDE researchers concluded that there is no good empirical support for the process of deindividuation, and factors that should produce deindividuation have highly variable effects on behavior.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP"&gt;Reicher, S., Spears, R., &amp; Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. European Review of Social Psychology, 6, 161–198.&lt;/ref&gt; To account for this, SIDE proposes that there are no blanket indiscriminate effects of anonymity, but that anonymity effects are influenced by, and can only be understood through, their interaction with the social context.

Reicher&lt;ref name="Reicher1982" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reicher, S. (1987). Crowd behaviour as social action. In J. C. Turner, M. A. Hogg, P. J. Oakes, S. Reicher &amp; M. S. Wetherell (Eds.), ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;171–202). Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; also challenged the conceptualization of deindividuation as a loss of self. This process assumes that individuals have a unitary self-concept that they can be more or less aware of.  Reicher and others argued that individuals do not have a unitary sense of self. [[Social identity theory]], for instance, points out that one's sense of self is made up of personal identity and multiple social identities, all of which combine to shape one's personality.  Social identities are likely to become the basis for self-definition when that social identity is salient, such as when making comparisons between "them" and "us".  One consequence of salience is "depersonalization". Note that in research on social identity, depersonalization is not the same as deindividuation or a loss of self (cf. the entry on [[Depersonalization]] to read up on what it is not).  In social identity research, the term depersonalization refers to a switch to a group level of self-categorization in which self and others are seen in terms of their group identities.

According to [[self-categorization theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S., &amp; Wetherell, M. S. (1987). ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory.'' Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; depersonalization makes perceptions of the outgroup more stereotypical.  Self-perceptions also shift: self and other ingroup members become interchangeable, and the individual self-stereotypes in terms of group attributes. Depersonalization thus transforms individuals into group members who regulate their behavior according to in-group norms. Importantly, and in contrast to deindividuation, the psychological state of depersonalization does not imply a loss of rationality or behavioural disinhibition; rather, the individual behaves rationally and regulates behaviour according to ingroup standards.  These ideas from social identity theory and self-categorization theory provided not only key ingredients for Reicher's critique of deindividuation theory, they are also the foundations upon which SIDE was modelled.

== Development ==

The model was first named by Lea and Spears&lt;ref name="LeaSpears1991"&gt;Lea, M., &amp; Spears, R. (1991). Computer-mediated communication, de-individuation and group decision-making. ''International Journal of Man Machine Studies, 34'', 283–301.&lt;/ref&gt; and later developed in a series of publications.&lt;ref&gt;Lea, M., &amp; Spears R. (1992). Paralanguage and social perception in computer-mediated communication. ''Journal of Organizational Computing'', ''2'', 321–341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PostmesSpearsLea1998"&gt;Postmes, T., Spears, R., &amp; Lea, M. (1998). Breaching or building social boundaries? SIDE-effects of computer-mediated communication. ''Communication Research'', ''25'', 689–715.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpearsLea1994"&gt;Spears, R., &amp; Lea, M. (1994). Panacea or panopticon? The hidden power in computer-mediated communication. ''Communication Research'', ''21,'' 427–459.&lt;/ref&gt; The SIDE model took Reicher's ideas about the crowd, and applied and extended them to [[computer-mediated communication]]. Early research in this domain suggested that, similar to deindividuation theory, users of online computer were prone to flaming and other disinhibitions due to a reduction in social cues.&lt;ref&gt;Kiesler, S., Siegel, J., &amp; McGuire, T. W. (1984). Social psychological aspects of computer-mediated communication. ''American Psychologist, 39,'' 1123–1134.&lt;/ref&gt; The SIDE model was developed, in first instance, to account for contradictory effects of social cues in online groups. SIDE thus assumed that effects in the crowd and in online environments showed some similar properties.

The first comprehensive statement of SIDE was by Reicher, Spears, &amp; Postmes.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP" /&gt; According to SIDE, a [[social identity approach]] can account for many of the effects observed in [[deindividuation]] research and in [[crowd psychology]], as well as in [[computer-mediated communication]].  For example, deindividuation has been found to foster group identification and to induce greater opinion polarization in small groups communicating online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Eun-Ju|title=Deindividuation Effects on Group Polarization in Computer-Mediated Communication: The Role of Group Identification, Public-Self-Awareness, and Perceived Argument Quality|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2007|volume=57|issue=2|page=385|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00348.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to understand effects of factors such as anonymity and reduced cues on group behavior, one needs to take the social and inter-group context into account.  SIDE argues that anonymity and social context in interaction have cognitive and strategic consequences.

== Cognitive SIDE ==

Group immersion and anonymity have cognitive consequences that affect the relative salience of personal and social identities.  These factors do not produce a loss of self as proposed by [[deindividuation]] theory.  Rather, anonymity and immersion in the group can enhance the [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] of social identity and thereby depersonalize social perceptions of others and the self.  SIDE argues this occurs principally because (visual) anonymity obscures individual features and interpersonal differences.  As a result of the decreased visibility of the individual within anonymous groups, the process of depersonalization is accentuated, and cognitive efforts to perceive the group as an entity are amplified.  Provided that there is some basis to perceive self and others as members of one group, anonymity therefore enhances the salience of the shared [[social identity]].  The net result is that people will tend to perceive self and others in terms of stereotypic group features, and are influenced accordingly.&lt;ref name="PostmesSpearsLea1998" /&gt;

It is important to note that anonymity does not automatically or mechanically influence the salience of social identities.  An individual can be identified in such a way that it promotes a more individuated person-perception or alternatively that it promotes a stronger social categorization. In a few instances, making the individual more identifiable may strengthen social categorization. This may happen particularly in contexts within which these social categories are potentially meaningful and therefore accessible, and when group memberships are visually clearly identifiable (as is the case for gender, certain racial characteristics, disabilities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Spears, R., Postmes, T., Lea, M., &amp; Wolbert, A. (2002). The power of influence and the influence of power in virtual groups: A SIDE look at CMC and the Internet. ''The Journal of Social Issues, 58,'' 91–108.&lt;/ref&gt;).

SIDE thus describes the cognitive process by which the salience of social identity is affected by the absence or presence of individuating information.  It is important to note that this process can only operate to the extent that some sense of groupness exists from the outset.  If individuals interact anonymously in the absence of any specific social identity or group boundaries, anonymity would have the reverse effect of accentuating one’s isolation from the group or by further obscuring group boundaries.&lt;ref name="LeaSpears1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postmes, T., Spears, R., Sakhel, K., &amp; De Groot, D. (2001). Social influence in computer-mediated communication: The effects of anonymity on group behavior. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', ''27,'' 1242–1254.&lt;/ref&gt;  Juxtaposing the two possibilities, anonymity in the group either has the effect of amplifying a shared social identity that, however rudimentary, is already in place, or it can amplify the individual independence which exists in contexts in which no shared identity is available.  The latter process, whereby anonymity provides the opportunities for people to express and develop identities independent of the social influence of the group, is further elaborated in the Strategic SIDE.

== Strategic SIDE ==

Anonymity also has strategic consequences: it affects the ability to express personal and social identities.&lt;ref name="SpearsLea1994" /&gt; Strategic concerns come into play when an out-group has more power than the ingroup, and where the norms of both groups are at odds with each other.  In such cases, the identifiability of ingroup members towards the outgroup will shift the power balance between groups: identifiability towards a more powerful outgroup limits the degree to which the ingroup's identity can be expressed freely and without sanction on those dimensions where ingroup norms conflict with out-group standards and values, and which are punishable or otherwise sanctionable. Conversely, anonymity towards a more powerful outgroup may be a convenient instrument for the ingroup to express itself on those same dimensions.

The strategic SIDE thus proposes that anonymity may be "used" by less powerful groups to express aspects of their identity. This may appear to be similar to the effects that anonymity has for [[accountability]] in classic [[deindividuation]] theory. However, unlike deindividuation theory, SIDE takes account of the inter-group context within which identifiability and anonymity occur.  By implication, a loss of accountability does not result in the disinhibited or random anti-normative behaviour of individuals that deindividuation theory is concerned with.  Rather, according to SIDE, anonymity affects the ability for a group to express its identity, and thus to engage in targeted and ingroup normative behaviour, thereby changing power relations between groups.  The close connection between identity expression and power proposed by SIDE may explain the patterned and targeted behaviour of crowds whose violent actions (if they occur) are very often symbolic, not random.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP" /&gt;

In addition to anonymity between groups, SIDE also considers strategic effects of anonymity within groups. Here, SIDE has particularly explored the consequences of anonymity (as well as isolation) from other ingroup members: On the one hand this deprives individual group members of social support from their fellows, and this may hinder their ability to express their ingroup identity in the face of a powerful and unsympathetic outgroup. On the other hand, the knowledge that other ingroup members are unable to identify the self may have consequences for (in particular) low identifiers to feel less committed to ingroup norms.

==Applications==

Today, SIDE is used to explain the effects of anonymity and social isolation in various contexts. Research on SIDE has particularly focused on crowds and collective action,&lt;ref&gt;Chan, M. (2010).

Glick cites as examples Medium (from Twitter co-founders [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]] and [[Biz Stone]]), [[Vox Media]], Sulia, Skift, [[First Look Media]] (backed by eBay founder [[Pierre Omidyar]]) and BuzzFeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glick|first=Jonathan|title=Rise of the Platishers|url=http://recode.net/2014/02/07/rise-of-the-platishers/?hubRefSrc=permalink#lf_comment=136566982|work=Re/Code|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 2014, Mark Little, the CEO of Storyful.com, now a division of News Corp., proposed "10 Principles that Power Social Journalism," including "UGC [User Generated Content] is governed by the same legal and ethical code as any other content" and "The currency of social journalism is authenticity not authority. We are not experts in every subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Little|first=Mark|title=10 Principles that Power Social Journalism|url=http://blog.storyful.com/2014/03/12/ten-principles-that-power-social-journalism/#.UzxieseT4aE|work=Storyful|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the editor of ''[[The Guardian]]'', Alan Rusbridger, said the Guardian was in the process of converting into a platform as well as a publisher. "For years, news organizations had a quasi monopoly on information simply because we had the means of distribution. I think if as a journalist you are not intensely curious about what has been created by people who are not journalists, then you’re missing out on a lot," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chozik|first=Amy|title=The Guardian’s Alan Rusbridger: ‘It’s Essential to Be Paranoid’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/magazine/the-guardians-alan-rusbridger-its-essential-to-be-paranoid.html|work=New York Times Sunday Magazine|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The new rules==

On April 1, 2014, in a column in [[GigaOM]] entitled "Social journalism and open platforms are the new normal — now we have to make them work" Mathew Ingram asked "How can media entities take advantage of this phenomenon without losing their way in the process?" and proceeded to review suggested rules for social journalism proposed by former FastCompany.com president Ed Sussman, an early adopter of the model.&lt;ref name="Ingram"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ingram|first=Mathew|title=Social Journalism and Open Platforms Are the New Normal - Now We Have to Make Them Work|url=http://gigaom.com/2014/04/01/social-journalism-and-open-platforms-are-the-new-normal-now-we-have-to-make-them-work/|work=Giga Om|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingram summarized Sussman's suggestions, including clear labeling types of contributors (e.g. staff, guest contributor, reader contribution); establishing guidelines, such as conflict of interest rules, that posters must consent to before posting; providing wiki-like tools for social improvements to content; elevating the best content with curators and algorithms; deleting weak or problematic content via curators or algorithms.&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt;

Social journalism has been attacked by media critic Michael Wolff in ''[[USA Today]]'' as the "Forbes vanity model letting ‘contributors’ write whatever they want under your brand (‘as I wrote in Forbes …’) and not having to pay them anything — ultimately, of course, devaluing your authority." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolff|first=Michael|title=New cash, new questions for Business Insider|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2014/03/16/the-future-of-business-insider/6370473/|work=USA Today|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 20, 2014 [[op-ed]] for ''[[The New York Observer]]'', former [[FastCompany.com]] president Ed Sussman argued that social journalism does not devalue the authority of brands and that the success of Forbes.com in attracting a wide audience with its 1,000+ bloggers proved that the model could be successful for traditional media companies.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt; Following revelations that some [[Forbes.com]] contributors used their columns to allegedly participate in a "pump and dump" scheme to promote, then sell stocks, Sussman followed up with "The New Rules of Social Journalism: A Proposal" in [[Pando Daily]], on March 29, 2014. Sussman proposed various rules for elevating the quality and ethics of social journalism content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sussman|first=Ed|title=The New Rules of Social Journalism|url=http://pando.com/2014/03/29/the-new-rules-of-social-journalism-a-proposal/|work=Pando Daily|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early adopter==

An early, or perhaps the first "social journalism" platform at a major media company was FastCompany.com, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sussman|first=Ed|title=The Media is Social|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/665030/media-social/|work=FastCompany.com|accessdate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the platform launched, in its first six months, FastCompany.com signed up 2,000 bloggers and 50,000 members.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt; "Fast Company is the first, but certainly not last, mainstream publication to integrate the majority of their site as a social community," wrote media analyst Jeremiah Owyang in 2008, then a senior social computing analyst for [[Forrester Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Owyang|first=Jeremiah|title=An Initial Analysis of the Fast Company Community|url=http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/02/09/an-initial-analysis-of-the-fast-company-community/|work=Web Strategist|accessdate=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ed Sussman left the website, the [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] print magazine editors reverted it to a standard journalism website.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5375">'''Technological evolution''' is a theory of radical transformation of society through technological development. This theory originated with [[Czechs|Czech]] philosopher [[Radovan Richta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Böhme|first1=Gernot|last2=Stehr|first2=Nico|title=The Knowledge Society: The Growing Impact of Scientific Knowledge on Social Relations|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400947245|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3mdDBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=radovan%20richta%20describes%20the%20radical%20transformation%20of%20society%20through%20technological%20development&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=27 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of technological evolution==
''[[Mankind in Transition|Mankind In Transition]]; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future'', Masefield Books, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Masse|title=The Automated Society; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future|date=1993|publisher=Masefield Books|isbn=1879981025|url=http://massebloomfield.com/books/the-automated-society/|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technology]] (which Richta defines as "a material entity created by the application of mental and physical effort to nature in order to achieve some value") evolves in three stages: tools, machine, automation. This evolution, he says, follows two trends:

===Development===
The pretechnological period, in which all other animal species remain today aside from some avian and primate species was a non-rational period of the early [[Prehistory|prehistoric man]].

The emergence of technology, made possible by the development of the rational faculty, paved the way for the first stage: the tool. A tool provides a mechanical advantage in accomplishing a physical task, such as an arrow, plow, or hammer that augments physical labor to more efficiently achieve his objective. Later animal-powered tools such as the plow and the horse, increased the productivity of food production about tenfold over the technology of the hunter-gatherers. Tools allow one to do things impossible to accomplish with one's body alone, such as seeing minute visual detail with a [[microscope]], manipulating heavy objects with a [[pulley]] and cart, or carrying volumes of water in a bucket.

The second technological stage was the creation of the [[machine]]. A machine (a powered machine to be more precise) is a tool that substitutes the element of human physical effort, and requires  only to control its function. Machines became widespread with the industrial revolution, though [[windmills]], a type of machine, are much older.

Examples of this include cars, trains, [[computers]], and lights. Machines allow humans to
Tremendously exceed the limitations of their bodies. Putting a machine on the farm, a tractor, increased food productivity at least tenfold over the technology of the plow and the horse.

The third, and final stage of technological evolution is the [[automation]]. The automation is a machine that removes the element of human control with an automatic algorithm. Examples of machines that exhibit this characteristic are [[digital watches]], automatic telephone switches, [[pacemakers]], and computer programs.

It's crucial to understand that the three stages outline the introduction of the fundamental types of technology, and so all three continue to be widely used today. A spear, a plow, a pen, a knife, a glove, a chicken and an optical microscope are all examples of tools.

===Theoretical implications===
The process of technological evolution culminates with the ability to achieve all the material values technologically possible and desirable by mental effort.

An [[Economics|economic]] implication of the above idea is that intellectual labour will become increasingly more important relative to physical labour. Contracts and agreements around information will become increasingly more common at the marketplace. Expansion and creation of new kinds of institutes that works with information such as    universities, book stores, patent-trading companies, etc. is considered an indication that a civilization is in technological evolution.

This highlights the importance underlining the debate over intellectual property in conjunction with decentralized distribution systems such as today's internet. Where the price of information distribution is going towards zero with ever more efficient tools to distribute information is being invented. Growing amounts of information being distributed to an increasingly larger customer base as times goes by. With growing [[disintermediation]] in said markets and growing concerns over the protection of intellectual property rights it is not clear what form markets for information will take with the evolution of the information age.

'''Technophilia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] τέχνη - ''technē'', "art, skill, craft"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dte%2Fxnh τέχνη], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and φίλος - ''philos'', "beloved, dear, friend"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfi%2Flos2 φίλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) refers generally to a strong [[enthusiasm]] for [[technology]], especially [[new technologies]] such as [[personal computer]]s, the [[Internet]], [[mobile phone]]s and [[home cinema]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;"Technophilia." The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. 2003. Houghton Mifflin Company 23 Sep. 2012 http://www.thefreedictionary.com/technophilia&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in [[sociology]] to examine individuals' interactions with [[society]] and is contrasted with [[technophobia]].

On a psychodynamic level, technophilia generates the expression of its opposite, technophobia.&lt;ref name="barry"&gt;Richards, Barry. "Technophobia and Technophilia." British Journal of Psychotherapy 10.2 (1993): 188–95. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Technophilia and technophobia are the two extremes of the relationship between [[technology and society]]. The technophile regards most or all technology positively, adopts new forms of technology enthusiastically and sees it as a means to improve life, whilst some may even view it as a means to combat social problems.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

The term technophilia is used as a way of highlighting how technology can evoke in humans strong positive futuristic feelings.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt; However, the reverential attitude towards technology that technophilia produces can sometimes inhibit realistic appraisals of the social and environmental impacts of technology on society.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt; Technophiles do not fear of the effects of technological developments on society, as do technophobes.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt; [[Technological determinism]] is the theory that humanity has little power to resist the influence that technology has on society.&lt;ref name="baym"&gt;Baym, Nancy. "Personal Connections In the Digital Age". Cambridge: Polity Press, 2010. p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word technophile is said to have originated in the 1960s as an "unflattering word introduced by technophobes." &lt;ref&gt;"Tenner, Edward. "Confessions Of A Technophile." Raritan 22.1 (2002): 135. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissism through technophilia==
Many forms of technology are seen as venerable because the user experiences them as the embodiment of their own narcissism.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt; Technophiles enjoy using technology and focus on the egocentric benefits of technology rather than seeing the potential issues associated with using technology too frequently. The notion of addiction is often negatively associated with technophilia, and describes technophiles who become too dependent on the forms of technology they possess.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt;

==Technological utopia==
Technophiles may view technology's interaction with society as creating a [[utopia]], cyber or otherwise, and a strong indescribable futuristic feeling. "In the utopian stories, technologies are seen as natural societal developments, improvements to daily life, or as forces that will transform reality for the better. Dystopian reactions emphasize fears of losing control, becoming dependent, and being unable to stop change".&lt;ref name="baym" /&gt; Both utopian and dystopian streams are weaved in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''Brave New World'' (1932) and [[George Orwell]]'s ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;On the contrast between Huxley and Orwell on that issue, see [[Michel Weber]]'s "[https://www.academia.edu/5958407/_Aldous_Huxley_and_George_Orwell_on_the_political_use_of_technoscience_2013_ Aldous Huxley and George Orwell on the political use of technoscience]," The Condemned Playground, Balliol College, Oxford University, September 1 / September 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tower music''' is a musical performance from the top of a tower. It can also designate the music composed for or played in such a performance.

In the early European Middle Ages, musical instruments on towers were used to warn of danger and mark the passage of time. At first this was done by a tower watchman, later by [[alta capella|ensembles of instrumentalists employed by the city]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Turmmusik Die Turmmusik], Duden dictionary entry, Bibliographisches Institut GmbH&lt;/ref&gt; The music became more choral, and came to by played on specific days of the week, and to mark specific dates (feast days such as Christmas and Easter, for instance). The practice largely died out in the late 19th century, but was revived in the early twentieth, and continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Gerlinde Haid: [http://www.musiklexikon.ac.at/ml/musik_T/Turmblasen.xml Turmblasen]. In: Oesterreichisches Musiklexikon. Online-Ausgabe, Wien 2002 ff., {{ISBN|3-7001-3077-5}}; Druckausgabe: Band 5, Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien 2006, {{ISBN|3-7001-3067-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern tower music is often played by volunteers. 

The tower used would often be a church tower, but the tower or balcony of a civic building might also be used. &lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Schnabel: ''Die evangelische Posaunenchorarbeit. Herkunft und Auftrag.'' Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1993, S. 174 f. ([https://books.google.de/books?id=7b0u8N6YLXIC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=Turmmusik&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q=Turmblasen&amp;f=false online] auf Google Bücher)&lt;/ref&gt;

The instruments had to be audible to someone not on the tower. This eliminated the quieter (''basse'') instruments, leaving the louder [[alta capella|(''haut'') instruments]]. Apart from bells, [[natural trumpets]], [[slide trumpet]]s, [[trombones]], [[shawms]], [[bagpipes]], and [[drum]]s were used.

Music was written specifically to be played from towers, but other works could also be used. [[Alta capella]] musicians playing the tower music would generally also perform in processions and ground-level outdoor events, and in some cases would also perform (on different instruments) indoors.

==History==
Many English cities in the 1500s had town [[alta capella|waits]], as did rich individuals and institutions. In 1571, London ordered its waits to play “upon their instruments upon the turret at the Royal Exchange every Sunday and holiday toward the evening.” (with winter break, between September to late March, excepted). These may have been London’s first regularly scheduled public concerts. London's waits also played from its walls. &lt;ref name=kimball_16&gt;[http://kimballtrombone.com/trombone-history-timeline/trombone-history-16th-century/ Timeline of trombone history], Will Kimball&lt;/ref&gt;

These civic wind bands of town pipers had been a feature of larger German towns and cities since well before the beginning of the sixteenth century, similar to the employment of [[wait (musician)|wait]]s with their [[sackbuts]] and [[shawm]]s in England.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=28}} [[Martin Luther]], one of the chief figures of the [[Reformation]], encouraged music-making in the service of God, and by around 1570 town councils were employing musicians specifically to take part in church services to supplement the organ playing.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=27}} 

One of the most popular forms of outdoors public music-making in the 17th century in Germany and central Europe was [[tower music]] (German: ''Turmmusik''), organised by the town piper (''Stadtpfeifer'') or tower master (''Turmmeister''). He and his band of musicians, also called ''Stadtpfeifer'' (the German plural is the same as the singular) played music for loud and penetrating wind or brass instruments from church towers and town hall balconies.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=28}}&lt;ref&gt;Hofer, Achim (1992). [https://books.google.de/books?id=7KcXAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Turmblasen+Turmmusik&amp;dq=Turmblasen+Turmmusik&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YM2rUKm_F5HdsgbKuoGwAQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCQ ''Blasmusikforschung''] (in German). Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1992, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The term 'tower master' seems to have been applied to various jobs. One was as the musical director of town or city music, such as Glöggl in Linz, and e.g. the theatre director Franz Pokorny (1797-1850) in [[Pressburg]] (Bratislava).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pokorny, Franz (1797-1850), Theaterdirektor |url=http://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl/oebl_P/Pokorny_Franz_1797_1850.xml |publisher=Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon (ÖBL) online |series=1815-1950, Bd. 8 (Lfg. 37) |year=1980 |p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bohuslav Martinu]]'s father, a [[sexton (office)|sexton]] and town watchman lived in the church tower in [[Polička]] as the ''turmmeister'', but in e.g. [[Cologne]] they seem to have been a type of civic constable or magistrate with arresting powers c1530&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lDSuvJtjrBcC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222 ''The Cult of the Virgin Mary in Early Modern Germany''] by Bridget Heal p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; or one competent to examine midwives c1650.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-kassel.de/upress/online/frei/978-3-89958-944-3.volltext.frei.pdf ''Rheinische Hebammengeschichte im Kontext''] ed.

Generations of the [[Bach family]] in [[Erfurt]] filled the office of Stadtpfeifer or ''Ratsmusiker'' (German: 'town council musician'). By 1600 [[Halle (Westfalen)|Halle]], [[Dresden]], [[Berlin]], [[Cologne]], [[Stettin]], [[Nordhausen]] and even [[Eisenach]] ([[J. S. Bach]]'s birthplace) with only 6,000 inhabitants, all had 'Stadpfeifers', whose job it was to sound the hours ('Stundenblasen') in the days before [[striking clock]]s were common in towers and churches.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=289}}{{sfn|Suppan|2006|pp=2002 ff}} They started around 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning to start the working day, sounded (German: ''blasen'', lit. 'blew') the mid-morning break around 10 o'clock (Latin: ''decima hora'') and the afternoon break around three or four o'clock in the afternoon. Finally, at around 9 or 10 o'clock, there was an ''Abendsegen'', or evening blessing.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=29}} Well known pieces by and for 'Stadtpfeifer' include [[Johann Hermann Schein|Johann Schein]]'s ''Banchetto musicale'' (1617) and [[Samuel Scheidt]]'s ''Ludi Musici'' (1621).{{sfn|Herbert|2006|pp=98-99}}

[[File:Matthäikirche Leipzig 1749 Foto H.-P.Haack.JPG|thumb|left|The [[St. Matthew, Leipzig|Neukirche]] (New Church}, Leipzig in 1749]]

In [[Nuremberg]] and [[Leipzig]] and there was a particular penchant for antiphonal tower music: three verses of a hymn would be echoed back and forth three times between the bands stationed in the towers of the [[St. Matthew, Leipzig|Neukirche]], [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig|St. Thomas Church]] and [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig]].{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=29}} The Leipzig Stadtpfeifer and tower master ('Turmmeister') of St. Nicholas Church from 1669 was [[Johann Pezel]] (or Petzold, etc.) whose ''Hora decima musicorum Lipsiensium'' ('Leipzig 10 o'clock music') was published the following year,&lt;ref&gt;Petzel, Johann (1670). [http://imslp.org/wiki/Hora_decima_musicorum_Lipsiensium_(Pezel%2C_Johann_Christoph) ''Hora decima musicorum Lipsiensium'']. Leipzig: G. H. Frommann.  IMSLP. Retrieved 26 September 2017.&lt;/reF&gt; as well as ''Fünff-stimmigte blasende Music'' (1685) with five-part intradas and dance pieces for brass instruments. Another Leipzig Stadtpfeifer and virtuoso trumpet player Gottfried Reiche (1667-1734){{sfn|Collins|2000|p=59}} described tower music in his preface to ''Vier und zwanzig Neue Quatricinia'' (1696) for cornett and three trombones, as "a sign of joy and peace", an embodiment of the  spiritual-cultural life of the city "certainly whenever the whole country is in mourning, or in war, or when other misfortune is to be lamented."{{efn|"Und so, wie Gottfried Reiche im Turmblasen „ein Freuden und Friedens-Zeichen“ sieht, da „wo solche Musik muss eingestellet werden, gewiss ein Land-Trauern, Krieg oder sonst ein Unglück zu beweinen ist“, so könnte die Turmmusik als ein solches „Freuden- und Friedens-Zeichen“ auch das geistig-kulturelle Leben unserer Stadt wesentlich bereichern.{{refn|name=Nikolaikirche|{{cite web| title=Turmmusik vom Nikolaikirchturm |publisher=Kulturbund der DDR, Gesellschaft für Heimatgeschichte, Kreisvorstand Altenburg |volume=Heft 1 |year=1983 |url=http://geo.viaregia.org/testbed/pool/Altenburg/T1_335_Turmmusik_vom_Nicolaikirchturm.htm |accessdate=26 September 2017}} }}  }}

Although the revival of music in churches was a particularly [[Lutheran]] initiative, Catholic areas like Vienna and [[Salzburg]] were just as keen to promote tower music.{{sfn|Spitzer|2017|p=228}} Among the most popular of tunes were the ''Heilig-Leider'', paraphrases in German of the [[Sanctus]] from the Latin [[Mass (religion)|Mass]], which came into fashion after the enlightened reforms of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]]&lt;!--Although there was never a Joseph II... --&gt; promoted the use of the [[vernacular]] in church services.{{sfn|Spitzer|2017|p=228}} According to one Stadtpfeifer named Hornbock, quoted in [[Johann Kuhnau]]'s ''Quack-Salber'': "We know from experience that when our city pipers in the festive season play a religious song with nothing but trombones from the tower, then we are greatly moved, and imagine that we hear the angels singing.".{{sfn|Spitzer|2017|p=228}}

In Austria, trombones were typically played from church towers (German ''Turmblasen'', lit 'tower blowing') or in cemeteries on [[All Souls' Day]] and the previous day ([[Hallowe'en]] in England). Their use is mentioned in a handbook explaining the multitude of church music regulations, ''Kirchenmusik-Ordnung'' (1828), by the Linz Stadtpfeifer [[Franz Xaver Glöggl|Franz Glöggl]].{{sfn|Glöggl|1828|p=}}{{efn|A review of the book shows how useful the book was in gathering together and explaining the many rules concerning music at church services.&lt;br&gt;
:"There appears an explanatory guide of musical worship, according to the existing church music-order for all functions occurring on Sundays, festivals, vespers, litanies, masses, funerals, processions etc. while chants, songs for the congregation, motets, introiten, versicles, graduals, offertories, responses etc. It explains the ritual-texts from the measurement book and Breviarium, and is found at a very cheap price.  In all countries where Roman Catholic worship prevails, through its essential usefulness of numerous sales, where the lack of such a reliable signpost has been felt for a long time: until the present moment when -wonderfully enough - under the supervision of some well-informed experts - the simple expedient of this book has been devised."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/allgemeinemusik16unkngoog/ ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'']. No. 6, 13 February 1828 (in German). Leipzig: Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Glöggl commissioned the Three Equals from Beethoven in 1812.{{sfn|Henke|Winkler|2002|pp=225-6}}{{sfn|B&amp;H Revisionsbericht|1888|p=vi}} They were both pupils of [[Johann Albrechtsberger]] (d. 1807), who wrote one of the first trombone concertos.{{sfn|Bassano|n.d.|}}

Tower music reached a peak in around 1750, and thereafter declined towards the end of the 18th century. From around 1800 official civic concerts began to replace those given by the nobility, and what has been termed "Saint Culture" ('''St''.-Kultur') suffered a split, leading on one side to the growth of professional [[symphony orchestra]]s, and on the other to amateur ''Stadtkapellen'' conducted by professional or semi-professional town music directors.{{sfn|Suppan|2006|}}

Modern tower music is common in German-speaking areas.

==Online intercultural exchange==
Online intercultural exchange is an academic field of study connected to virtual exchange. It "involves instructionally mediated processes...for social interaction between internationally distributed partner classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Online-Intercultural-Exchange-Policy-Pedagogy-Practice/ODowd-Lewis/p/book/9781138932876|title=Online Intercultural Exchange: Policy, Pedagogy, Practice (Hardback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity has its roots in [[computer-assisted language learning]] (CALL) and [[computer-mediated communication]]. OIE is not restricted to language learning but happens across many educational disciplines where there is a desire to increase the internationalization of teaching and learning.

Developments in communication technologies and the relative ease with which forms of human communication can be technically afforded internationally since the existence of the internet resulted in language teaching experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/gpg/61|title=CALL (computer assisted language learning) {{!}} LLAS Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies|website=www.llas.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecting individuals, classrooms or groups of students to work together on tasks online involves attempting to arrive at shared understanding through "negotiation of meaning"&lt;ref&gt;Long, M.

== Alternatives ==

The first World Congress on Communication for Development ('''WCCD''') was held in Rome, Italy from October 25 to 27, 2006.

== Main objective==

The '''''First World Congress on Communication for Development''''' was hosted by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and organized by [[The World Bank]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], and The Communication Initiative. It intended to clearly demonstrate to policy and decision-makers the effectiveness of "[[Communication for Development]]" in helping meet today's most pressing development challenges and to advocate among them for the systematic inclusion of communication in development policy and practice.

[[Communication for Development]] — as a process of dialogue, information sharing and building mutual understanding — is a powerful tool to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of development interventions, to assess and mitigate the political and social risks of those interventions and to build social ownership and sustainability.

== Participants==

The '''WCCD''', the first event of its kind, brought together more than 500 policymakers, development practitioners, NGO and CSO representatives, and academics/researchers active in the field. Thousands more from around the world were able to participate via webcasting and broadcasting.

== Organization and structure==

FAO and the World Bank spearheaded this event, and involved more than 75 key institutions, including multilateral and bilateral partners, media institutions, academic and research institutions, and NGOs to help organize the Congress. The three party governance structure consisted of a steering committee (to provide overall advice and guidance to the planning), a Scientific Committee (to conduct the paper review and the Mainstreaming study) and an Advisory Body.

== Invitees profile==

Nobel Prize Keynote Speakers, Highest Level of Representation from the UN and The World Bank, Italian Authorities, High Profile Public Figures, Ministries and Authorities from Developing Countries, Prime International University Representatives and Academicians.

== Themes and structure==

The Congress was structured around four broad thematic areas: Health, Governance, Sustainable Development, and Communication Labs. During the Policymakers Forum leading policy and decision-makers discussed and debated the opportunities and constraints they envisaged vis-à-vis the proposed recommendations for mainstreaming communication in development policies and programs.

A Mainstreaming and Policy Recommendations Study commissioned by the Scientific Committee served as the basis of discussions at the Policymakers' Forum, integrated the outcomes of the Forum and was then published, together with the proceedings of sessions and papers.

== Media partners==

Media Partners included [[Inter Press Service]]-IPS, [[RAI]] (Italy), [[BBC]] (UK) and CNBC (Germany). Additional media outlets were [[Al-Jazeera]] (Qatar), [[Reuters]], CNN Español, and major Latin-American media; Rome-based correspondents of the international press, together with major Italian newspapers covered the event. The BBC broadcast from the Congress site its flagship program, World Debate, while CNBC broadcast the show, Global Players.

== Expectations==

This event generated an enormous amount of interest around the world with more than 600 papers submitted through the call for papers, more than 1,700 registered through the Congress website, more than 600,000 hits on the site, and more than 2,000 people participated in pre-Congress e-discussions on Congress-related topics and themes.

One of the most extensive efforts previous to the Congress was the latinamerican seminar "Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo" (Without Communication No Development), held on August, 2006 in the city of Lima (Perú) with participants from Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Perú, Uruguay, Venezuela, Germany and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Calandria, 2007 - Source: [http://issuu.com/calandriaperu/docs/calandria-sin-comunicacion-no-hay-d Official Publication from the Seminar "Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo" (Without Communication No Development)]&lt;/ref&gt; It reunited the following Peruvian (PE) and international institutions (I - International / LA - Latinamerican): Asociación de Comunicadores Sociales Calandria (PE), CESIP (PE), CNR (Perú), Colectivo Radial Feminista (PE),  DEMUS (PE), Equipo Uno (PE), Voces Nuestras, PUCP (PE), Red Científica Peruana (PE), ILLA (PE), IEC (PE), MINSA (PE), CONAM (PE), CONCORTV (PE), IDL (PE), IUCM, Mesa de Comunicadores de Agencias de Cooperación, FELAFACS (LA), OCLAC (LA), OPS (LA), ANDI (LA), ALER (LA), AMARC (LA), Observatorio de Imprensa (LA), World Bank (I), AVINA (I), Broederlijk Delen (I), CAMECO (I), Communication for Social Change Consortium (I), FAO (I), Iniciativa de la Comunicación (I), ONU (I), OXFAM (I), UNICEF (I), USAID (I), WACC (I).&lt;ref&gt;Iniciativa de la Comunicación, 2006 - Source: [http://www.comminit.com/node/196198 Resume and list of presentations from the Seminar "Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo" (Without Communication No Development)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World news''' or '''international news''' or even '''foreign coverage''' is the [[news media]] jargon for news from abroad, about a  country or a global subject. For [[journalism]], it is a branch that deals with news either sent by [[foreign correspondent]]s or [[news agency|news agencies]], or – more recently – information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as [[telephone]], [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] or the [[internet]].

Although in most of the [[English-speaking world]] this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.

At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the [[Newspaper|courants]] of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the ''Daily Courant'' (England), the ''Nieuwe Tijudinger'' ([[Antwerp]]), the ''Relation'' ([[Strasbourg]]), the ''Avisa Relation oder Zeitung'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and the ''Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland &amp; C.'' ([[Amsterdam]]). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that [[nation-state]]s were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the [[telegraph]] made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (France), [[Reuters]] (UK), Wolff (currently [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]], Germany) and the [[Associated Press|AP]] (US).

[[War journalism]] is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).

== Foreign correspondents ==
{{Main|Correspondent}}

There are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the '''foreign correspondent''' (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the '''special envoy''' (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).

The correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.

The number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/network_tv_news_investment.php] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India: 

35 – ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, São Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich

24 – ''[[New York Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, São Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo

19 – ''[[Financial Times]]'' (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

17 – ''[[Washington Post]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogotá, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo

15 – ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo

13 – ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

13 – ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul

12 – ''[[The Hindu]]'' (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington  

When reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called '''stringers'''. Since they have no salary, stringers usually produce material for several different companies at once.

== News agencies ==
{{Main|News agency}}
A '''news agency''' is an organization of [[journalist]]s established to supply [[news]] reports to news organizations: [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. Such an agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire or news service. The bulk of major news agency services contains foreign news.

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.
