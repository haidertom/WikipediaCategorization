The '''Brussels effect''' is the process of unilateral regulatory globalisation caused by the [[European Union]] [[de facto]] (but not necessarily [[de_jure|de jure]]) externalising its laws outside its borders through market mechanisms.

== Cause ==
The combination of market size, market importance&lt;ref name=Bradford2012&gt;Bradford, Anu (2012) ''The Brussels Effect.'' Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 107, No. 1, 2012; Columbia Law and Economics Working Paper No. 533. SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2770634 &lt;/ref&gt;, relatively stringent standards and regulatory capacity&lt;ref&gt;Bach, David and Newman, Abraham (2007) – ''The European regulatory state and global public policy: micro-institutions, macro-influence'' – Journal of European Public Policy https://doi.org/10.1080/13501760701497659&lt;/ref&gt; of the European Union can have the effect that firms trading internationally find that it is not economically, legally or technically practical to maintain lower standards in non-EU markets. Non-EU companies exporting globally can find that it is beneficial to adopt standards set in Brussels uniformly throughout their business.&lt;ref&gt;''The Brussels Effect: The Rise of a Regulatory Superstate in Europe.'' Columbia Law School http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2013/january2013/brussels-effect&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal – ''Hot U.S. Import: European Regulations'' May 2018 https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-pickup-of-new-data-privacy-rules-reflects-eus-growing-influence-1525685400&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The term Brussels effect was coined in 2012 by Professor Anu Bradford of Columbia Law School&lt;ref name=Bradford2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lecture, March 2012 - "''The Brussels Effect: The Rise of a Regulatory Superstate in Europe''" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeFmR3Fkjzw&lt;/ref&gt; and named after the similar [[California effect]] that can be seen within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=David|title=Trading Up: Consumer and Environmental regulation in a global economy|date=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674900837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race to the top and race to the bottom ==
The [[California effect]] and the Brussels effect are a form of ‘race to the top’ where the most stringent standard has an appeal to companies operating across multiple regulatory environments as it makes global production and exports easier.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Why the ‘Brussels effect’ will undermine Brexit regulatory push'' July 2017 https://www.ft.com/content/fd5ca278-6654-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Why the whole world feels the ‘Brussels effect’'' November 2017 https://www.ft.com/content/7059dbf8-a82a-11e7-ab66-21cc87a2edde&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yale Insights – ''Three Questions: Prof. David Bach on the Reach of European Privacy Regulations'' https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/three-questions-prof-david-bach-on-the-reach-of-european-privacy-regulations&lt;/ref&gt; The effects are the opposite of the ''Delaware effect'', a [[race to the bottom]] where jurisdictions can purposely choose to lower its regulatory requirements in an attempt to attract businesses looking for the least stringent standard. &lt;ref name="Bloomberg NJ Del."&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robert E. Wright|title=How Delaware Became the King of U.S. Corporate Charters|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-06-08/how-delaware-became-the-king-of-u-s-corporate-charters|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=''Bloomberg View''|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
===Anti-trust===
The October 2000 $42 billion proposed acquisition of US-based Honeywell International by US-based General Electric was blocked by the EU antitrust authorities on the grounds of risking a horizontal monopoly in jet engines. The merger could not proceed because, despite the American Department of Justice having already approved the merger between these two US based entities, it was not legally possible to let the acquisition proceed in one important market, but not in another. &lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Commission – Case No COMP/M.2220 - General Electric/Honeywell http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=2_M_2220&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals===
US-based multinational [[Dow Chemical]] announced in 2006 it would comply with the EU's [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) regulation for the production and use of chemical substances across its global operation.&lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dow and REACH - Protecting human health and the environment https://reach.dow.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reach External FAQs https://consumer.dow.com/en-us/technical-support/ehs-portal/reach-external-faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airplane emissions===
In 2012 the EU included aviation into its existing [[European_Union_Emission_Trading_Scheme|Emission Trading Scheme]]. This means that any airline, regardless of their country of origin, has to purchase emissions permits for any flights within the [[European_Economic_Area|European Economic Area]]. &lt;ref&gt;European Commission – Reducing emissions from aviation https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of complying with EU aviation emission regulation puts pressure on manufacturers to design airplanes with improved efficiency and reduced emissions. As major airlines would not likely purchase airplanes specifically to fly outside the EEA, the EU’s stricter aviation standards have an impact on global airplane fleets, regardless of the jurisdiction of the airline.&lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;

===Data protection and privacy===
With the introduction of the[[Data_Protection_Directive | Data Protection Directive]] in 1995 the EU had opted for a strict top-down approach to data privacy. &lt;ref&gt;Gady, Franz-Stefan (2014) EU/U.S. Approaches to Data Privacy and the "Brussels Effect": A Comparative Analysis https://www.jstor.org/stable/43773645&lt;/ref&gt; Its successor, the EU's [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), was adopted on 14 April 2016 and had a global effect &lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Information wars: How Europe became the world’s data police'' May 2018 https://www.ft.com/content/1aa9b0fa-5786-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development – ''Europe’s Data Privacy Rules Set New Global Approach to Consumer Rights'' May 2018 https://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges/news/europe%e2%80%99s-data-privacy-rules-set-new-global-approach-to-consumer-rights&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2017, during negotiations for a new Japan-EU trade deal, Japan set up an independent agency to handle privacy complaints to conform with the EU's new privacy regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Politico.EU – ''Europe’s new data protection rules export privacy standards worldwide'' January 2018 https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-data-protection-privacy-standards-gdpr-general-protection-data-regulation/&lt;/ref&gt;
Facebook announced in April 2018 that it would implement parts of the GDPR globally&lt;ref&gt;Facebook's commitment to data protection and privacy in compliance with the GDPR https://www.facebook.com/business/news/facebooks-commitment-to-data-protection-and-privacy-in-compliance-with-the-gdpr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Complying With New Privacy Laws and Offering New Privacy Protections to Everyone, No Matter Where You Live https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/new-privacy-protections/&lt;/ref&gt;, Sonos announced in April 2018 that it would implement the GDPR globally&lt;ref&gt;We’re Updating the Sonos Privacy Statement https://blog.sonos.com/en-gb/updating-sonos-privacy-statement/&lt;/ref&gt; and Microsoft announced in May 2018 that it would implement GDPR compliance for all its customers globally.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft’s commitment to GDPR, privacy and putting customers in control of their own data https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/05/21/microsofts-commitment-to-gdpr-privacy-and-putting-customers-in-control-of-their-own-data/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23324">'''Child health and nutrition in Africa''' is concerned with the [[health care]] of [[children]] through [[Adolescence|adolescents]] in the various [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|countries of Africa]]. The right to health and a nutritious and sufficient diet are internationally recognized fundamental [[human rights]] protected by international treaties and conventions on the [[right to life]], as well as in charters, strategies and declarations. [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) 1, 4, 5 and 6 highlight, respectively, how [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[child mortality]], [[maternal health]], the eradication of [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]] and other diseases are of particular significance in the context of child health.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002335/233558E.pdf|title=Investing against Evidence: The Global State of Early Childhood Care and Education|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Kaga|first2=Y.|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100113-0|location=|pages=170–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these commitments and ideals, however, the reality is that high mortality among young children, particularly in [[Africa]], continues to be a cause for concern. Children born in developed countries such as [[Sweden]] have a less than 1 per cent risk of dying before the age of 1 year, whereas for children born in [[Developing country|developing countries]], the risk is closer to 10 per cent or higher. Within developing countries, there are significant disparities between rich and poor and [[Urban area|urban]] and [[rural area]]s.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. 2008. ''The State of the World’s Children: Child Survival''. New York, UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Extent and gravity of child health and nutrition in Africa ==
Worldwide, substantial progress has been made in the effort to reduce child mortality. The number of under-5 deaths in the world has declined from nearly 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011; and the global under-five mortality rate has dropped 41 per cent since 1990 – from 87 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 51 in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. 2012. ''Levels and Trends in Child Mortality''. New York, UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading causes of death among children under age 5 are [[pneumonia]] (18 per cent), preterm birth complications (14 per cent), [[Diarrhea|diarrhoea]] (11 per cent), complications during birth (9 per cent), and malaria (7 per cent). Globally, more than one third of under-5 deaths are attributable to undernutrition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Africa, some progress has also been registered over the decades. Compared to other regions, [[sub-Saharan Africa]] has experienced a faster rate of reduction in under-5 deaths, with the annual rate of decline doubling between 1990-2000 and 2000-2011.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. 2013. ''The State of the World’s Children: Children with Disabilities''. New York, UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt; However, child mortality figures in sub-Saharan Africa are still sobering. The region alone accounts for 3,370,000 deaths of children under 5 in 2011 (WHO, 2012) which corresponds to 9,000 children dying every day, and six children dying every minute.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Out of 3 million [[neonatal]] deaths worldwide, approximately 1.1 million are found in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 2012).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The highest rates of child mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa, where 1 in 9 children dies before age 5; and 1 in 16 children in Southern Asia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Deficiency in essential nutrients and micronutrients ==
Given that [[vitamin A]] is critical for proper functioning of the [[visual system]] and for maintaining [[Immune system|immune defences]], its deficiency remains a public health issue. An estimated 250,000 to 500,000 children deficient in vitamin A become [[Visual impairment|blind]] every year, half of them dying within 12 months of losing their sight. This deficiency accounts for 350 million cases of blindness and 670,000 deaths globally (WHO, 2001).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Africa alone, it contributes to 23 per cent of child deaths. In 2009, the prevalence of low [[serum retinol]], associated with vitamin A deficiency, was 37.7 per cent in [[Ethiopia]], 49 per cent in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], and 42 per cent in [[Madagascar]]. The immediate causes of this deficiency are the low rates of consumption of animal products, the poor bioavailability of vitamin A in cereal-based diets, the consumption of green leaves with low [[lipid]] content, and an increased bodily demand for vitamin A owing to the infections that frequently affect African children (Manga, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Manga, L. D. 2011. ''Evaluation of Vitamin A Status and its Determinants in Senegalese Children aged 12 to 59 Months''. Master’s thesis, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are equally disturbing levels of [[zinc]] deficiencies and this has seriously adverse effects on growth, the risk and severity of infections, as well as the level of immune function. Although the actual prevalence is unclear, zinc deficiency is recognized as one of the main risk factors for [[morbidity]] and mortality. It contributes to over 450,000 deaths per year among children under 5 years, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It affected 57 per cent of children under 5 in [[Senegal]], 72 per cent in [[Burkina Faso]], and 41.5 per cent in [[Nigeria]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Beye, M. F. 2011. ''Evaluation of the Status of Zinc and its Food and Health Determinants in Boys and Girls aged 12 to 59 Months''. Master’s thesis, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt; The main causes of this deficiency in children are a lack of zinc-rich easily absorbed foodstuffs (such as meat, poultry, seafood) and the over-consumption of foodstuffs that inhibit zinc absorption, such as cereals, roots and [[tuber]]s, which are among Africa’s staples.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Inadequacies in [[iodine]] intake on the other hand impair the synthesis of [[thyroid hormones]], which are critical for normal development and proper functioning of the brain and nervous system as well as the conservation of body heat and energy. Iodine deficiency causes endemic [[goitre]] and [[cretinism]] as well as [[Stunted growth|stunting]] of mental and physical development. Globally, 1.6 million people are at risk of iodine deficiency disorders and 50 million children affected by them. About 100,000 children are born each year with [[Intellectual disability|mental retardation]], most of them in Africa. This is due to the low consumption of iodine-rich foodstuffs (e.g. marine products) and the over-consumption of foodstuffs causing goitre, particularly bitter [[cassava]], which is a staple in [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kupka, R., Ndiaye, B., Sall, M. G., Camara, B. 2012. ''Senegal Struggles to Control Iodine Deficiency''. International Council for Control of Iodine De ciency Disorders (ICCIDD) Newsletter, Vol. 40, No. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anemia|Anaemia]] is quite prevalent in Africa especially among young children due mainly to a diet that is low in animal-based foodstuffs and high in  fibre-rich cereals, [[tannin]]s and [[Phytic acid|phytates]] which inhibit [[iron]] absorption. In 2006, about 67.6 per cent of children under 5, and overall 83.5 million children were anaemic.&lt;ref&gt;Sy, M. 2011. ''Evaluation of the Status of Iron and its Determinants in Senegalese Children aged 12 to 59 Months''. Master’s thesis, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt; Through its effects on metabolic processes such as [[oxygen transport]], [[oxidative metabolism]] and cell growth, iron deficiency also retards growth and development. It impairs the immune response and increases susceptibility to infection, delays [[motor development]], and diminishes concentration (impairing cognitive and behavioural capacities). It therefore prevents 40-60 per cent of African children from attaining their full mental capacities. Moreover, of the 26 health risks reported by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] [[Global Burden of Disease Study|Global Burden of Disease]] project, iron deficiency is ranked ninth in terms of years of life lost.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Preventive interventions ==

=== Breastfeeding ===
[[Breast milk]] is the ideal natural food for optimal growth and safe psychomotor development. This is due to its rich nutrients and protective factors, as well as its biospecificity (the kinetics of its composition change during lactation) and impact on mother-child relationships. These key advantages reduce child mortality rate by 13 per cent in areas where over 80 per cent of women breastfeed exclusively.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bellagio Study Group on Child Survival. 2003. ''Child survival: The unfinished revolution''. The Lancet. Child Survival Series.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Habimana, Ph. 2009. ''The Regional Situation regarding Child Health in Africa''. Brazzaville, Congo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;The Lancet. 2003. Child Survival Series.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Supplementary feeding ===
Undernourished children have lowered resistance to infection and are at greater risk of common childhood diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory infections, recurring sickness and faltering growth, often with irreversible damage to their cognitive and social development.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For current and future generations, good nutrition is a cornerstone for survival, health and development. Well-nourished children set off on a better developmental path (both physically and mentally), perform better in school, grow into healthier adults and are able to give their own children a better start in life. Supplementary feeding, when properly implemented, helps to reduce the mortality rate of children under 5 by 6 per cent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) ===
The prevention of malaria through the use of [[Long-lasting insecticidal nets|LLINs]] is a key strategy for rolling back malaria in Africa. According to model-generated estimates based on the number of LLINs supplied by the manufacturers, the number distributed by national malaria control programmes and data from household surveys, the percentage of households with at least one LLIN in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 3 per cent in 2000 to 50 per cent in 2011. Coverage rates of more than 80 per cent can reduce Africa’s child mortality rate by 7 per cent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Vaccination against Haemophilusinfluenzae type b (Hib) ===
[[Hib]], meningitis and respiratory infections are frequent and serious on account of their high mortality rates and potential consequences, which include [[Sensorineural hearing loss|sensorineural]] damage. These infections can be prevented by [[vaccination]] to reduce child mortality by 4 per cent. Hib vaccination is part of the [[Expanded Program on Immunization|Expanded Programme on Immunization]] (EPI) together with vaccines against tuberculosis, [[poliomyelitis]], [[diphtheria]], [[tetanus]], [[hepatitis B]], [[measles]] and [[yellow fever]]. EPI is a key preventive intervention in reducing infant morbidity and mortality; together with the monitoring and promotion of growth, it is a fundamental pillar in child health and development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV ===
The 25 per cent prevalence of HIV in some eastern and [[southern Africa]]n countries is a matter of concern. African countries that showed more than 20 per cent adult HIV prevalence in 2011 included [[Botswana]] (23.4 per cent), [[Lesotho]] (23.3 per cent) and [[Swaziland]] (26 per cent) (UNICEF, 2013). Globally, the number of new HIV infections continues to fall annually, although there is considerable regional variation. In sub-Saharan Africa, where most of those newly infected with HIV live, it is estimated that 1.9 million (1,700,000 – 2,100,000) people were infected in 2010. According to estimates, this represents a 16 per cent decrease compared to the number of new infections with HIV in 2001, which was 2.2 million (2,100,000-2,400,000), and a 27 per cent decrease compared to the number of new infections between 1996 and 1998, when the incidence of HIV infection in the region peaked.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF. 2011. ''Global HIV/AIDS Response: Epidemic Update and Health Sector Progress towards Universal Access - Progress Report''. Geneva, WHO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;. unaidsrstesa.org/sites/default/ les/who_2011_report_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The vast majority of children are infected before birth, during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding (if the mother is seropositive). The course of HIV and AIDS is particularly aggressive in children. Without care and treatment, the [[virus]] multiplies and destroys the child’s immune system, lowering resistance to infections such as pneumonia and other common childhood diseases. Almost half of all children infected by their mothers die before the age of 2.Thanks to a decrease in the price of drugs, increased awareness, the introduction of fixed-dose combinations of [[anti-retrovirals]] (ARVs) and more reliable forecasts of demand for paediatric ARVs, several countries have been able to distribute them for use in children, but the coverage rate remains extremely low in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. 2011. ''Global HIV-AIDS Response: Epidemic Update and Health Sector Progress towards Universal Access''. Geneva, WHO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Food fortification ===
Food fortification is a cost effective way of ensuring that a population receives adequate nutrients without altering their usual dietary practices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_iodine.html|title=Micronutrients|work=UNICEF|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Zinc supplements ===
The role of zinc in strengthening immune defences cannot be underestimated and in areas where effective preventive supplementation campaigns have been implemented, particularly in Africa, the child mortality rate has been lowered by 4 per cent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Vitamin A supplement ===
Biannual vitamin A supplements can help to reduce mortality among young children by 23 per cent.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Curative interventions ==

=== Oral rehydration solutions ===
[[Oral rehydration therapy|Oral rehydration]] is considered one of the greatest revolutions in improving child health and managing diarrhoea. With new oral rehydration solutions containing zinc, child mortality can be reduced by 15 per cent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Therapeutic feeds ===
[[F-75 (food)|F75]] and [[F-100 and F-75 (foods)|F100]] are types of therapeutic milk that is used in inpatient management of [[Severe Acute Malnutrition|severe acute malnutrition]]&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motherchildnutrition.org/malnutrition-management/info/feeding-formulas-f75-f100.html|title=Feeding formulas: What are F-75 and F-100? - Diarrhoea - Mother, Infant and Young Child Nutrition &amp; Malnutrition - Feeding practices including micronutrient deficiencies prevention, control of wasting, stunting and underweight|website=motherchildnutrition.org|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

These may be used as part of a community based food and nutrition program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5030e/y5030e05.htm#P69_5412|title=Community-based food and nutrition programmes|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Antibiotics to treat pneumonia ===
The improved availability of [[antibiotics]] to treat pneumonia, particularly in remote areas and among deprived populations, has contributed to reducing the child mortality rate by 6 per cent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other curative interventions which can help to reduce child mortality include antibiotics to treat [[sepsis]] (6 per cent), the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies to treat malaria (5 per cent) and antibiotics to treat [[dysentery]] (2 per cent).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These interventions are highly beneficial to child health and development. However, coverage rates remain low due to underdevelopment and poverty, poor health care systems with limited access to health services (less than 40 per cent in most African countries), a lack of qualified human resources resulting in part from the brain drain to [[Western world|Western]] and [[Arab world|Arab countries]], inadequate equipment, an inconsistent supply of medications and basic products with frequent shortages, a poorly structured and barely functioning programme of health promotion, and limited budgets for health (less than the 15 per cent recommended by WHO for most African countries) combined with often unorthodox financial governance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Main strategies  ==
The strategies outlined below are recommended by WHO and adopted by all African countries as part of a bolder approach to serious child health problems. Their strengths reside in the complementarity of components integrated into strategies, the effectiveness in reducing child mortality and morbidity, and the positive long-term impact generated for children, such as enhanced school performance, well-being and life chances. These strategies offer an immediate return while having a significant impact on the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) ===
[[Integrated Management of Childhood Illness|IMCI]] is a strategy that integrates various programmes for the survival of children under 5 with a view to improving the practices that are likely to have the greatest impact on their health, growth and development. This is the overarching strategy for achieving [[Millennium Development Goals|MDG]] 4 (reduction of child mortality), and it is recommended by WHO and [[UNICEF]], particularly in countries with a high child mortality rate. The strategy is simple and, according to the [[World Bank]], cost-effective. It aims to address the main causes of child mortality in settings characterized by (1) a low level of health coverage, with little or no access to diagnostic equipment and treatment, (2) a low level of health monitoring, and (3) weak links between healthcare facilities and communities. IMCI has three components: (1) improving the skills of health care workers, (2) strengthening the health care system, and (3) improving family and community practices.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. 1992. ''IMCI: A Strategy for Reducing Infant and Child Mortality''. Geneva, WHO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (EmONC) ===
Maternal and neonatal mortality in the Africa region accounts for more than half (51 per cent) of the world’s total maternal deaths, with a neonatal mortality rate of approximately 40 per thousand. The causes of these deaths could be prevented or avoided by the proper implementation of strategies for skilled care at birth and emergency [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] and neonatal care services. With the assistance of WHO, UNICEF, [[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]] and the World Bank, various African countries have developed roadmaps for accelerating the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality by improving the skills of service providers, standardizing treatment protocols, and developing quality criteria for [[Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care|EmONC]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

While effective interventions and strategies for improving the health and nutrition status of young children are available, the financial resources required to implement them in Africa are inadequate. It is essential that African governments, their domestic partners (the private sector and [[civil society]]) and their partners abroad (bilateral and multilateral cooperation) invest more heavily in mobilizing resources for early [[Child development|childhood development.]] The focus should be on optimal governance of financial resources with transparent management rules and particular emphasis on equity of care and guaranteed access for the poor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The notion of a legally sanctioned [[corporation]] remains controversial for several reasons, most of which stem from the granting of corporations both limited liability on the part of its members and the status and rights of a [[Legal personality|legal person]]. Some opponents to this granting of "personhood" to an organization with no personal liability contend that it creates a legal entity with the extensive financial resources to co-opt public policy and exploit resources and populations without any moral or legal responsibility to encourage restraint.

==Divisions between labor, management, and owners==
[[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' criticized the [[joint-stock company]] corporate form because the separation of ownership and management could lead to inefficient management.

{{Quote|The directors of such [joint-stock] companies, however, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own.... Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company.}}

The context for Adam Smith's term for "companies" in ''The Wealth of Nations'' was the joint-stock company. In the 18th century, the joint-stock company was a distinct entity created by the King of Great Britain as [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]] trading companies. These entities were sometimes awarded legal [[monopoly]] in designated regions of the world, such as the British [[East India Company]].

Furthermore, the context of the quote points to the complications inherent in chartered joint-stock companies. Each company had a Courts of Governors and day-to-day duties were overseen by local managers. Governor supervision of day-to-day operations was minimal and was exacerbated by the poor communications of the 18th century.

Bribery and corruption were inherent in this type of corporate model as the local managers sought to avoid close supervision by the Courts of Governors, politicians, and Prime Ministers. In these circumstances, Smith did not consider joint-stock company governance to be honest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adamsmithslostlegacy.com/2007/02/18th-century-chartered-joint-stock.html Adam Smith The Lost Legacy.com]&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, the East India Company demonstrated inherent flaws in the corporate form. The division between owners and managers in a joint-stock company, and the limited legal liability this division was based on guaranteed that stockholders would be apathetic about a company's activities as long as the company continued to be profitable. Just as problematic, the [[law of agency|laws of agency]] upon which the corporate form was based allowed for boards of directors to be so autonomous from and unconstrained by stockholder wishes that directors became negligent and ultimately self-interested in the management of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' 741 (Clarendon, Oxford 1776).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychopathic behavior==
Legal Scholar and Professor of Law at the [[University of British Columbia]] [[Joel Bakan]] describes the modern corporate entity as 'an institutional psychopath' and a 'psychopathic creature.' In the documentary ''[[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'', Bakan claims that corporations, when considered as natural living persons, exhibit the traits of [[antisocial personality disorder]] or [[psychopathy]]. Also in the film, [[Robert A. G. Monks]], a former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate for Senate from [[Maine]], says:

{{quote|The corporation is an [[cost externalizing|externalizing]] machine (moving its operating costs to external organizations and people), in the same way that a shark is a killing machine.|Joel Bakan&lt;ref&gt;Bakan, Joel (writer) [http://www.thecorporation.com/ The Corporation (2003)] (Documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Analogy with totalitarian regime==
[[Noam Chomsky]] and others have criticized the legal decisions that led to the creation of the modern corporation:

{{quote|Corporations, which previously had been considered artificial entities with no rights, were accorded all the rights of persons, and far more, since they are "immortal persons", and "persons" of extraordinary wealth and power. Furthermore, they were no longer bound to the specific purposes designated by State charter, but could act as they choose, with few constraints.|Noam Chomsky&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barksky, [http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/1999----02.htm Noam Chomsky and the Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214111824/http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/1999----02.htm |date=2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|When the corporatization of the state capitalist societies took place a century ago, in part in reaction to massive market failures, conservatives &amp;ndash; a breed that now scarcely exists&amp;ndash; objected to this attack on the fundamental principles of classical liberalism. And rightly so. One may recall Adam Smith's critique of the "joint stock companies" of his day, particularly if management is granted a degree of independence; and his attitude toward the inherent corruption of private power, probably a "conspiracy against the public" when businessmen meet for lunch, in his acid view, let alone when they form collectivist legal entities and alliances among them, with extraordinary rights granted, backed, and enhanced by state power.|Noam Chomsky&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chomsky | first = Noam | title = Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order | publisher = Seven Stories Press | date = 1999 | location = New York, New York, United States | pages = 175 | isbn = 978-1-888363-82-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chomsky contends that corporations transfer policy decisions out of the hands of the people and into corporate boardrooms, where public oversight is limited. The extensive financial resources of corporations and the extent to which they're employed to influence political campaigns in the United States has also been implicated as a way in which corporations undermine the democratic institutions in a society.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Resnikoff. 2007 [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20071022/resnikoff Corporations Versus Democracy]. The Nation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

"No other institution in American history—not even slavery—has ever been so consistently unpopular...with the American public. It was controversial from the outset, and it has remained controversial to this day."&lt;ref&gt;Irving Kristol. ''Reflections of a Neoconservative''. NY, 1983. p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D. Rockefeller]] was one of the first to experience that paradox in a spectacular and personal way.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Churchyard. [http://www.charleschurchyard.com/corporation.html "The Corporation and John D. Rockefeller's Bewilderment."]&lt;/ref&gt; By the last decade of the 19th century, Rockefeller found that he had become "the most hated man in the world."&lt;ref&gt;David F. Hawke. ''John D''. NY, 1980. Ch. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the middle of the 20th century, the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] noted that the corporate businesses which foreign visitors came to see and marvel at, as "showpiece[s] of American industrial achievement," were the very same ones that government attorneys scrutinized in their search for monopolistic wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Galbraith. ''American Capitalism''. NY, 1956. p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Democratization''' (or '''democratisation''') is the transition to a more democratic [[political regime]]. It also refers to substantive political changes moving in a democratic direction. It may be the transition from an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime to a full [[democracy]], a transition from an authoritarian political system to a semi-democracy or transition from a [[semi-authoritarian]] political system to a [[democracy|democratic]] political system. The outcome may be [[Democratic consolidation|consolidated]] (as it was for example in the [[United Kingdom]]) or democratization may face frequent reversals (as it has faced for example in [[Venezuela]]). Different patterns of democratization are often used to explain other political phenomena, such as whether a country goes to a war or whether its economy grows. Democratization itself is influenced by various factors, including economic development, history, and civil society. The ideal result from democratization is to ensure that the people have the right to vote and have a voice in their political system.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Causes==

There is considerable debate about the factors which affect or ultimately limit democratization. A great many things, including economics, culture, and history, have been cited as impacting on the process. Some of the more frequently mentioned factors are:


* '''Wealth'''. A higher [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP/capita]] correlates with democracy and some claim the wealthiest democracies have never been observed to fall into authoritarianism.&lt;ref name='przeworski'&gt;{{cite book | last = Przeworski | first = Adam | authorlink = Adam Przeworski| title = Democracy and Development: Political Institutions and Well-Being in the World, 1950-1990 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | location = Cambridge|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of Hitler and of the Nazis in Weimar Germany can be seen as an obvious counter-example, but although in early 1930s Germany was already an advanced economy, by that time, the country was also living in a state of economic crisis virtually since the first World War (in the 1910s), a crisis which was eventually worsened by the effects of the Great Depression. There is also the general observation that democracy was very rare before the industrial revolution. Empirical research thus lead many to believe that economic development either increases chances for a transition to democracy ([[modernization theory]]), or helps newly established democracies consolidate.&lt;ref name='przeworski'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rice|first=Tom W.|last2=Ling|first2=Jeffrey|date=2002-12-01|title=Democracy, Economic Wealth and Social Capital: Sorting Out the Causal Connections |journal=Space and Polity|volume=6|issue=3|pages=307–325|doi=10.1080/1356257022000031995|issn=1356-2576}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study finds that economic development prompts democratization but only in the medium run (10–20 years). This is because development may entrench the incumbent leader but make it more difficult for him deliver the state to a son or trusted aide when he exits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Income, Democracy, and Leader Turnover|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12135/abstract|journal = American Journal of Political Science|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 1540-5907|pages = 927–942|volume = 59|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/ajps.12135|language = en|first = Daniel|last = Treisman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the debate about whether democracy is a consequence of wealth, a cause of it, or both processes are unrelated, is far from conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Traversa | first1 = Federico | year = 2014 | title = Income and the stability of democracy: Pushing beyond the borders of logic to explain a strong correlation? | url = | journal = Constitutional Political Economy | volume =  26| issue = | pages =  121–136| doi = 10.1007/s10602-014-9175-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that economic development depends on the political stability of a country to promote democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=FENG|first1=YI|title=Democracy, Political Stability and Economic Growth|journal=British Journal of Political Science|date=July 1997|volume=27|issue=3|pages=416, 391–418|doi=10.1017/S0007123497000197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark, Robert and Golder, in their reformulation of Albert Hirschman's model of ''Exit, Voice and Loyalty'', explain how it is not the increase of wealth in a country ''per se'' which influences a democratization process, but rather the changes in the socio-economic structures that come together with the increase of wealth. They explain how these structure changes have been called out to be one of the main reasons several European countries became democratic. When their socioeconomic structures shifted because modernization made the agriculture sector more efficient, bigger investments of time and resources were used for the manufacture and service sectors. In England, for example, members of the gentry began investing more on commercial activities that allowed them to become economically more important for the state. This new kind of productive activities came with new economic power were assets became more difficult for the state to count and hence more difficult to tax. Because of this, predation was no longer possible and the state had to negotiate with the new economic elites to extract revenue. A sustainable bargain had to be reached because the state became more dependent of its citizens remaining loyal and, with this, citizens had now leverage to be taken into account in the decision making process for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=William Roberts |first2=Matt |last2=Golder |first3=Sona N. |last3=Golder |year=2013 |title=Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game |work=Unpublished manuscript |publisher=University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University |url=https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}

* '''Social equality'''. Acemoglu and Robinson argued that the relationship between [[social equality]] and democratic transition is complicated: People have less incentive to revolt in an egalitarian society (for example, [[Singapore]]), so the likelihood of democratization is lower. In a highly unequal society (for example, [[South Africa]] under [[Apartheid]]), the redistribution of wealth and power in a democracy would be so harmful to elites that these would do everything to prevent democratization. Democratization is more likely to emerge somewhere in the middle, in the countries, whose elites offer concessions because (1) they consider the threat of a revolution credible and (2) the cost of the concessions is not too high.&lt;ref name='acemoglu'&gt;{{cite book | last = Acemoglu | first = Daron |author2=James A. Robinson | title = Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expectation is in line with the empirical research showing that democracy is more stable in egalitarian societies.&lt;ref name='przeworski'/&gt;

* '''Culture'''. It is claimed by some that certain cultures are simply more conductive to democratic values than others. This view is likely to be [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]]. Typically, it is [[Western culture]] which is cited as "best suited" to democracy, with other cultures portrayed as containing values which make democracy difficult or undesirable. This argument is sometimes used by undemocratic regimes to justify their failure to implement democratic reforms. Today, however, there are many non-Western democracies. Examples include: India, Japan, Indonesia, Namibia, Botswana, Taiwan, and South Korea. Research finds that "Western-educated leaders significantly and substantively improve a country's democratization prospects".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Who Democratizes? Western-educated Leaders and Regime Transitions|last1 = Gift|first1 = Thomas|last2 = Krcmaric|first2 = Daniel|year = 2015 |journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution |doi = 10.1177/0022002715590878|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Social Capital.''' Robert Putnam argues that certain characteristics make societies more likely to have cultures of civic engagement that lead to more participatory democracies.  Putnam argues that communities with denser horizontal networks of civic association are able to better build the "norms of trust, reciprocity, and civic engagement" that lead to democratization and well-functioning participatory democracies.  Putnam contrasts communities with dense horizontal networks, to communities built around vertical networks and patron-client relations which he asserts are unlikely to build the culture of civic engagement necessary for democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Robert|date=March 1993|title=What makes democracy work?|url=|journal=National Civic Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Dictatorship type'''. The three dictatorship types, monarchy, civilian and military have different approaches to democratization as a result of their individual goals. Monarchic and civilian dictatorships seek to remain in power indefinitely through hereditary rule in the case of monarchs or through oppression in the case of civilian dictators. A military dictatorship seizes power to act as a caretaker government to replace what they consider a flawed civilian government. Military dictatorships are more likely to transition to democracy because at the onset, they are meant to be stop-gap solutions while a new acceptable government forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Living by the Sword and Dying by the Sword?

* '''Scrambled Constituencies.''' Mancur Olson theorizes that the process of democratization occurs when elites are unable to reconstitute an autocracy.  Olson suggests that this occurs when constituencies or identity groups are mixed within a geographic region.

* '''Education.''' It has long been theorized that education promotes stable and democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Capitalism and Freedom|last = Friedman|first = Milton|publisher = |year = 1962|isbn = |location = |pages = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that education leads to greater political tolerance, increases the likelihood of political participation and reduces inequality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The democratizing effect of education |journal = Research &amp; Politics|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 2053-1680|pages = 2053168015613360|volume = 2|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/2053168015613360|language = en|first = Eduardo|last = Alemán|first2 = Yeaji|last2 = Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study finds "that increases in levels of education improve levels of democracy and that the democratizing effect of education is more intense in poor countries".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Urbanization'''. There is research to suggest that greater urbanization, through various pathways, contributes to democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glaeser|first=Edward L.|last2=Steinberg|first2=Bryce Millett|date=2017|title=Transforming Cities: Does Urbanization Promote Democratic Change? |journal=Regional Studies |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=58–68 |doi=10.1080/00343404.2016.1262020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Natural Resources'''. University of California, Berkeley political scientist Thad Dunning proposes a plausible explanation for Ecuador’s return to democracy that contradicts the conventional wisdom that natural resource rents encourage authoritarian governments. Dunning proposes that there are situations where natural resource rents, such as those acquired through oil, reduce the risk of distributive or social policies to the elite because the state has other sources of revenue to finance this kind of policies that is not the elite wealth or income.&lt;ref&gt;Thad Dunning. 2008. Crude Democracy: Natural Resource Wealth and Political Regimes.Cambridge University Press. Ch. 1.Pp. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; And in countries plagued with high inequality, which was the case of Ecuador in the 1970s, the result would be a higher likelihood of democratization.&lt;ref&gt;Thad Dunning. 2008. Crude Democracy: Natural Resource Wealth and Political Regimes.Cambridge University Press. Ch. 1.Pp. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the military coup had overthrown the government in large part because of the fears of elites that redistribution would take place.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"&gt;Thad Dunning. 2008. Crude Democracy: Natural Resource Wealth and Political Regimes.Cambridge University Press. Ch. 1.Pp. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year oil became an increasing financial source for the country.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt; Although the rents were used to finance the military, the eventual second oil boom of 1979 ran parallel to the country’s re-democratization.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt; Ecuador’s re-democratization can then be attributed, as argued by Dunning, to the large increase of oil rents, which enabled not only a surge in public spending but placated the fears of redistribution that had grappled the elite circles.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt; The exploitation of Ecuador’s resource rent enabled the government to implement price and wage policies that benefited citizens at no cost to the elite and allowed for a smooth transition and growth of democratic institutions.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt;
 
* '''Foreign trade'''. A 2016 study found that preferential trade agreements "encourage the democratization of a country, in particular if the PTA partners are themselves democracies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Coevolution of Trade Agreement Networks and Democracy |journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution|date = 2016-02-01|issn = 0022-0027|pages = 164–191|volume = 60|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0022002714535431|language = en|first = Mark S.|last = Manger|first2 = Mark A.|last2 = Pickup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Democracy protests'''. Research indicates that democracy protests are associated with democratization. A 2016 study found that about a quarter of all cases of democracy protests between 1989-2011 lead to democratization.&lt;ref name='brancati'&gt;{{cite book | last = Brancati | first = Dawn | title = Democracy Protests: Origins, Features and Significance | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2016 | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Threat of civil conflict.''' Research suggests that the threat of civil conflict encourages regimes to make democratic concessions. A 2016 study found that drought-induced riots in Sub-Saharan Africa lead regimes, fearing conflict, to make democratic concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aidt|first=Toke S.|last2=Leon|first2=Gabriel|date=2016-06-01|title=The Democratic Window of Opportunity Evidence from Riots in Sub-Saharan Africa |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=60|issue=4|pages=694–717|doi=10.1177/0022002714564014|issn=0022-0027}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* '''Overthrow of dictators'''. Rebels may overthrow their dictators with the aim of establishing a democratic government, but this method is rarely successful. The death of a dictator rarely ushers in democracy. One analysis found that "of the 79 dictators who have died in office (1946-2014)... in the vast majority (92%) of cases, the regime persists after the autocrat's death."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/10/when-dictators-die/| title = When Dictators Die| website = Foreign Policy

* '''International cooperation'''. A 2002 study found that membership in international organizations "is correlated with transitions to democracy during the period from 1950 to 1992."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Democracy from the Outside-In?

* '''Foreign intervention'''. Democracies have often been imposed by military intervention, for example in Japan and Germany after WWII.&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Göran|last=Therborn|authorlink=Göran Therborn|year=1977|title=The rule of capital and the rise of democracy: Capital and suffrage (cover title) | journal=[[New&amp;nbsp;Left Review]]|series=I|volume=103|issue=[http://www.newleftreview.org/?issue=100 The advent of bourgeois democracy]|ref=harv|url=http://www.newleftreview.org/?view=1453|pages=3–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=47&amp;articleID=599 ''The Independent'']&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, [[decolonization]] sometimes facilitated the establishment of democracies that were soon replaced by authoritarian regimes. For example, Syria, after gaining independence from [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandatory control]] at the beginning of the [[Cold War]], failed to [[Democratic consolidation|consolidate]] its democracy, so it eventually collapsed and was replaced by a [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'athist dictatorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://sam.gov.tr/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/katarzyna_krokowska.pdf|title = The Fall of Democracy in Syria|last1 = Krokowska|first1 = Katarzyna|year = 2011|journal = Perceptions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, most attempts to establish democracy by military means have failed.&lt;ref name="Keen2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keen |first1=David |title=Endless War? Hidden Functions of the War on Terror |date=2006 |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''War-making'''. Jeffrey Herbst, in its acclaimed paper "War and the state in Africa", explains how democratization in European states was achieved through war making and how it is a cause of state formation missing in Africa today. He exemplifies how war caused the state to become more efficient in revenue collection, it forced leaders to improve administrative capabilities; and created and environment where populations could develop a sense of unification. European states where under constant threat of being invaded and bursting into war with their neighboring countries. This demand to be constantly vigilant enabled the development of effective revenue collection systems and, those states that did not raise sufficient revenue for war perished. War also created a common and powerful association between the state and its people, given that citizens felt threatened as a nation and, it was only as a nation that they would thrive. Fighting wars made people feel more associated with the state.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Jeffrey. “War and the State in Africa.” ''International Security'' (1990): 117-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Peace and security'''. Wars may contribute to the [[state building]] that precedes a transition to democracy, but war is also a serious obstacle to democratization. While adherants of the [[democratic peace theory]] believe that democracy comes before peace, historical evidence shows the opposite. In almost all cases, peace has come before democracy. There is little support for the hypothesis that democracy causes peace, but strong evidence for the opposite hypothesis that peace leads to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibler |first1=Douglas M. |last2=Owsiak |first2=Andrew |title=Democracy and the Settlement of International Borders, 1919–2001 |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |date=2017 |doi=10.1177/0022002717708599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gat |first1=Azar |title=The Causes of War and the Spread of Peace: Will War Rebound? |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian Welzel|Christian Welzel's]] [[Freedom Rising|human empowerment theory]] posits that existential security leads to emancipative cultural values and support for a democratic political organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Welzel |first1=Christian |title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is in agreement with theories based on [[evolutionary psychology]]. The so-called regality theory finds that people develop a psychological preference for a strong leader and an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] form of government in situations of war or perceived collective danger. On the other hand, people will support [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] values and a preference for democracy in situations of peace and safety. The consequence of this is that a society will develop in the direction of [[autocracy]] and an authoritarian government when people perceive collective danger, while the development in the democratic direction requires collective safety.&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why almost all attempts to establish democracy by violent means have failed&lt;ref name="Keen2006" /&gt;

==Transitions==

Democracy development has often been slow, violent, and marked by frequent reversals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/gratis/Berman-18-1.pdf ''Journal of Democracy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical cases===
In Great Britain, there was [[Magna Carta#17th–18th centuries|renewed interest in Magna Carta]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/videos/from-legal-document-to-public-myth-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century|title=From legal document to public myth: Magna Carta in the 17th century|website=The British Library|access-date=2017-10-16|postscript=none}}; {{Cite web|url=https://www.sal.org.uk/events/2015/06/magna-carta-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century/|title=Magna Carta: Magna Carta in the 17th Century|website=The Society of Antiquaries of London|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of England]] enacted the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628 which established certain liberties for subjects.

The [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688 established a strong Parliament that passed the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], which codified certain rights and liberties for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown....

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth.

The [[American Revolution]] (1765–1783) created the United States. The new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] established a relatively strong federal national government that included an [[President of the United States|executive]], a [[United States Supreme Court|national judiciary]], and a bicameral [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] that represented states in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the population in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="Wood, 1992"&gt;Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 70&lt;/ref&gt; In many fields, it was a success ideologically in the sense that a relatively true republic was established that never had a single dictator, but [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights]] were initially restricted to [[White American|white]] male property owners (about 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was not abolished in the southern states until the constitutional [[Reconstruction Amendments|Amendments]] of the [[Reconstruction Era]] following the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) and the [[Civil Rights Movement|Civil Rights]] given to African-Americans were only achieved in the 1960s.

The [[French Revolution]] (1789) briefly allowed a wide franchise. The [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] lasted for more than twenty years. The [[French Directory]] was more oligarchic. The [[First French Empire]] and the [[Bourbon Restoration]] restored more autocratic rule. The [[Second French Republic]] had universal male suffrage but was followed by the [[Second French Empire]]. The [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–71) resulted in the [[French Third Republic]].

The [[German Empire]] was created in 1871. It was followed by the [[Weimar Republic]] after [[World War I]]. [[Nazi Germany]] restored autocratic rule before the defeat in [[World War II]] .

The [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], after the unification of Italy in 1861, was a [[constitutional monarchy]] with the King having considerable powers. [[Italian fascism]] created a dictatorship after the World War I. World War II resulted in the [[Italian Republic]].

The [[Meiji period]], after 1868, started the modernization of Japan. Limited democratic reforms were introduced. The [[Taishō period]] (1912–1926) saw more reforms. The beginning of the [[Shōwa period]] reversed this until the end of World War II.

===Since 1972===

According to a study by [[Freedom House]], in 67 countries where dictatorships have fallen since 1972, nonviolent civic resistance was a strong influence over 70 percent of the time. In these transitions, changes were catalyzed not through foreign invasion, and only rarely through armed revolt or voluntary elite-driven reforms, but overwhelmingly by democratic civil society organizations utilizing nonviolent action and other forms of civil resistance, such as strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, and mass protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=275 Study: Nonviolent Civic Resistance Key Factor in Building Durable Democracies, May 24, 2005 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicators==
One influential survey in democratization is that of [[Freedom House]], which arose during the Cold War. Freedom House, today an institution and a think tank, produces one of the most comprehensive "freedom measures" nationally and internationally and by extension a measure of democratization. Freedom House categorizes all countries of the world according to a seven-point value system with over 200 questions on the survey and multiple survey representatives in various parts of every nation. The total raw points of every country places the country in one of three categories: Free, Partly Free, or not Free.

One study simultaneously examining the relationship between market economy (measured with one [[Index of Economic Freedom]]), economic development (measured with GDP/capita), and political freedom (measured with the Freedom House index) found that high [[economic freedom]] increases GDP/capita and a high GDP/capita increases economic freedom. A high GDP/capita also increases political freedom but political freedom did not increase GDP/capita. There was no direct relationship either way between economic freedom and political freedom if keeping GDP/capita constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ken Farr |author2=Richard A.

==Views==
[[Francis Fukuyama]] wrote another classic in democratization studies entitled ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' which spoke of the rise of [[liberal democracy]] as the final form of human government.  However it has been argued that the expansion of liberal economic reforms has had mixed effects on democratization.  In many ways, it is argued, democratic institutions have been constrained or "disciplined" in order to satisfy international capital markets or to facilitate the global flow of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Alasdair S.,''Empowerment or Discipline? Two Logics of Governmental Reform'' (December 23, 2008). Available at [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1319792 http://ssrn.com/abstract=1319792 SSRN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] wrote ''[[The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late 20th century|The Third Wave]]'', partly as response to Fukuyama, defining a global democratization trend in the world post WWII. Huntington defined three waves of democratization that have taken place in history.&lt;ref name='huntington'&gt;{{cite book | last = Huntington | first = Samuel P. | authorlink = Samuel P. Huntington | title = Democratization in the Late 20th century | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | year = 1991 | location = Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first one brought democracy to Western Europe and Northern America in the 19th century. It was followed by a rise of dictatorships during the [[Interwar period]]. The second wave began after [[World War II]], but lost steam between 1962 and the mid-1970s. The latest wave began in 1974 and is still ongoing. Democratization of [[Latin America]] and the former [[Eastern Bloc]] is part of this [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave]].

A very good example of a region which passed through all the three waves of democratization is the Middle East. During the 15th century it was a part of the Ottoman Empire. In the 19th century, "when the empire finally collapsed [...] towards the end of the First World War, the Western armies finally moved in and occupied the region".&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Bromley. ''Rethinking Middle East Politics: State Formation and Development''. (Polity Press, Cambridge, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; This was an act of both European expansion and state-building in order to democratize the region.  However, what Posusney and Angrist argue is that, "the ethnic divisions [...] are [those that are] complicating the U.S. effort to democratize Iraq". This raises interesting questions about the role of combined foreign and domestic factors in the process of democratization. In addition, Edward Said labels as 'orientalist' the predominantly Western perception of "intrinsic incompatibility between democratic values and Islam". Moreover, he states that "the Middle East and North Africa lack the prerequisites of democratization".&lt;ref&gt;ed by Marsha, Pripstein Posusney and Michele, Penner Angrist. ''Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance''. ([[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], Inc., USA, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fareed Zakaria]] has examined the security interests benefited from [[democracy promotion]], pointing out the link between levels of democracy in a country and of terrorist activity. Though it is accepted that poverty in the Muslim world has been a leading contributor to the rise of terrorism, Zakaria has noted that the primary terrorists involved in the [[9/11]] attacks were among the upper and upper-middle classes. Zakaria has suggested that the society in which [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists lived provided easy money, and therefore there existed little incentive to modernize economically or politically.&lt;ref&gt;Fareed Zakaria, The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad, W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2007, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; With little opportunity to express themselves in the political sphere, scores of young Arab men were "invited to participate"&lt;ref&gt;Fareed Zakaria, The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad, W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; through another avenue: the culture of [[Islamic fundamentalism]]. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism and its violent expression on September 11, 2001 illustrates an inherent need to express oneself politically, and a democratic government or one with democratic aspects (such as political openness) is quite necessary to provide a forum for political expression.

Larry Pardy observed that governments are motivated by political power, which is generated by two factors: legitimacy and means.  The legitimacy of a democratic government is achieved through the consent of the population through fair and open elections while its financial means are derived from a healthy tax base generated by a vibrant economy.  Economic success is based on a free market economy with the following elements: property rights, a fair and independent judiciary, security, and the rule of law. The core elements that support economic freedom convey the same basic rights onto individuals.  Conversely, there can be no rule of law for investors when governments crack down on political opponents and no property rights for industry when personal wealth can be arbitrarily seized.

According to Clark, Golder, and Golder, an application of  [[Albert O. Hirschman]]'s exit, voice, and loyalty model is that if individuals have plausible exit options, then a government may be more likely to democratize. [[James C. Scott]] argues that governments may find it difficult to claim a sovereignty over a population when that population is in motion.&lt;ref name="C. 2010 7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872296825|title=The Art of not being governed : an anarchist history of upland Southeast Asia|last=C.|first=Scott, James|date=2010|publisher=NUS Press|year=|isbn=9780300152289|location=|pages=7|oclc=872296825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott additionally asserts that exit may not solely include physical exit from the territory of a coercive state, but can include a number of adaptive responses to coercion that make it more difficult for states to claim sovereignty over a population.  These responses can include planting crops that are more difficult for states to count, or tending livestock that are more mobile.  In fact, the entire political arrangement of a state is a result of individuals adapting to the environment, and making a choice as to whether or not to stay in a territory.&lt;ref name="C. 2010 7"/&gt; If people are free to move, then the exit, voice, and loyalty model predicts that a state will have to be of that population representative, and appease the populous in order to prevent them from leaving.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf|title=Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If individuals have plausible exit options then they are better able to constrain a government’s arbitrary behaviour through threat of exit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, [[Alex Tabarrok]] argues that the reverse of this occurred in [[Ferguson, Missouri]]; those who could left the township, but ultimately the local government abused its power as people could not exit in part due to a string of excessive fines which forced them to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/03/the-ferguson-kleptocracy.html|title=The Ferguson Kleptocracy|last=Tabarrok|first=Alex|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sustainable democracy has to involve far more than fair and open elections.  It rests on a solid foundation of economic and political freedom that, for Western nations, had to be pried from governments over centuries.  It goes back at least to 1215 when King John accepted limits on his powers and conceded certain rights in the Magna Carta.   Then, as now, governments will be motivated to support rights and freedoms only when it directly impacts the government's ability to maintain and exercise political power.  It does not arise with idealistic notions of democracy and freedom, implied fiscal contracts with citizens, exhortations from donor states or pronouncements from international agencies.  Fukyama was essentially correct with his assertion regarding the end of history – that Western liberal democracy represents the endpoint of mankind's ideological evolution.  It represents a mechanism whereby our free market system efficiently allocates resources in our economy while co-existing in a symbiotic relationship with our democratic system of government.   Our governments are incentivized to protect the economy while the foundations for that economy create the conditions for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Pardy, Larry D.  Understanding the Determinants of Democracy: Opening the Black Box.  Amherst, NS: October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by political scientist Daniel Treisman, influential theories of democratization posit that autocrats "deliberately choose to share or surrender power. They do so to prevent revolution, motivate citizens to fight wars, incentivize governments to provide [[public goods]], outbid elite rivals, or limit factional violence. Examining the history of all democratizations since 1800, I show that such deliberate choice arguments may help explain up to one third of cases. In about two thirds, democratization occurred not because incumbent elites chose it but because, in trying to prevent it, they made mistakes that weakened their hold on power. Common mistakes include: calling elections or starting military conflicts, only to lose them; ignoring popular unrest and being overthrown; initiating limited reforms that get out of hand; and selecting a covert democrat as leader. These mistakes reflect well-known cognitive biases such as [[Overconfidence effect|overconfidence]] and the [[illusion of control]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treisman|first=Daniel|date=October 2017|title=Democracy by mistake|work=NBER Working Paper No. 23944 |doi=10.3386/w23944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other contexts==
Although democratization is most often thought of in the context of national or regional politics, the term can also be applied to:

===International bodies===
* International bodies (e.g. the [[United Nations]]) where there is an ongoing call for reform and altered voting structures and [[voting system]]s.

===Corporations===
The concept of democratization can also be applied in [[corporation]]s where the traditional power structure was top-down direction and the boss-knows-best (even a "[[Pointy-Haired Boss]]");   This is quite different from consultation, [[empowerment]] (of lower levels) and a diffusion of [[decision making]] (power) throughout the firm, as advocated by [[workplace democracy]] movements.

===The Internet===
The loose anarchistic structure of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] and the [[Internet]] itself have inspired some groups to call for more democratization of how [[domain name]]s are held, upheld, and lost.  They note that the [[Domain Name System]] under [[ICANN]] is the least democratic and most centralized part of the Internet, using a simple model of first-come-first-served to the names of things. [[Ralph Nader]] called this "corporatization of the dictionary."

===Knowledge===
The [[democratization of knowledge]] is the spread of knowledge among common people, in contrast to knowledge being controlled by elite groups.

===Design===
The trend that products from well-known designers are becoming cheaper and more available to masses of consumers. Also, the trend of companies sourcing design decisions from end users.&lt;ref&gt;Harry (2007). [http://mocoloco.com/the-democratization-of-design/ The Democratization of Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Demographics]] of the [[world]]''' include [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health measures, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the human population of the planet [[Earth]]. 

The overall total population of the world is approximately 7.5 billion, as of March 2018. 

Its overall population density is 50 people per km² (129.28 per sq. mile), excluding Antarctica. Nearly two-thirds of the population lives in [[Asia]] and is predominantly urban and suburban, with more than 2.5 billion in the countries of [[China]] and [[India]] combined. The world's fairly low [[literacy]] rate (83.7%) is attributable to [[poverty]]. Lower literacy rates are common in [[South Asia]], [[West Asia]], and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

The world's largest ethnic group is [[Han Chinese]] with [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] being the world's most spoken language in terms of native speakers.

Human migration has been shifting toward cities and urban centers, with the urban population jumping from 29% in 1950, to 50.5% in 2005.&lt;ref name="cia world"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA.gov World Factbook - World Statistics] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |date=1 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working backwards from the United Nations prediction that the world will be 51.3 percent urban by 2010, Dr. Ron Wimberley, Dr. Libby Morris and Dr. Gregory Fulkerson estimated 23 May 2007 to be the first time the urban population outnumbered the rural population in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/go/7334/ World Population Becomes More Urban That Rural]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historical migration of human populations begins with the movement of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' out of Africa across [[Eurasia]] about a million years ago. ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' appear to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 50,000 - 60,000 years ago, and had spread across [[Prehistory of Australia|Australia]], [[History of Asia|Asia]] and [[Paleolithic Europe|Europe]] by 30,000 years BC. [[Models of migration to the New World|Migration to the Americas]] took place 20,000 to 15,000 years ago, and by 2,000 years ago, most of the [[Pacific Islands]] were colonized.

Until c.&amp;nbsp;10,000 years ago, humans lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They generally lived in small nomadic groups known as [[band societies]]. The advent of agriculture prompted the [[Neolithic Revolution]], when access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent [[human settlement]]s. About 6,000 years ago, the first proto-states developed in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]]'s [[Nile Valley]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]]. Early human settlements were dependent on proximity to [[water resources|water]] and, depending on the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], other [[natural resources]] used for [[subsistence]]. But humans have a great capacity for altering their [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] by means of technology.

Since 1800, the [[human population]] has increased from one billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/411162.stm | accessdate = 5 February 2008 | work=BBC News | title=World's population reaches six billion | date=5 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over seven billion,&lt;ref name=7billpop&gt;{{cite web|title=UN population estimates.|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/p2k0data.asp|work=Population Division, United Nations|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, some 2.5 billion out of 6.3 billion people (39.7%) lived in [[urban area]]s. In February 2008, the U.N. estimated that half the world's population would live in [[urban area]]s by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4561183.stm | work=BBC News | first=David | last=Whitehouse | title=Half of humanity set to go urban | date=19 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems for humans living in [[city|cities]] include various forms of pollution and [[crime]],&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!-- {{cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/usrv98.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825142912/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/usrv98.htm |archivedate=25 August 2009 |df= }} --&gt;http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/usrv98.pdf Urban, Suburban, and Rural Victimization, 1993–98] U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,.

==Cities==
The World has hundreds of major cities spread across 6 continents. Most are in coastal regions.

{{As of|2005}}, the World had 62 metropolitan areas with a population of over 3,000,000 people each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/2005_world_city_populations/2005_city_population_01.html 2005 World City Populations]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, about 3 billion people live in or around urban areas.&lt;ref name="cia world" /&gt;

== Population density ==
{{See also|List of countries by population density}}

[[File:Population density countries 2018 world map, people per sq km.svg|300px|thumb|Population density (people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by country, 2018]]

The [[world's population]] is 7 billion&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html U.S. &amp; World Population Clocks]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Earth]]'s total area (including land and water) is 510 million square kilometers (197 million square miles).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA - The World Factbook] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |date=1 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the worldwide human population density is 7 billion ÷ 510 million = 13.7 per km² (35.5 per sq. mile). If only the Earth's land area of 150 million km² (58 million sq. miles) is taken into account, then human population density increases to 46.7 per km² (117.2 per sq. mile). This calculation includes all continental and island land area, including [[Antarctica]]. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to 50 people per km² (129.28 per sq. mile).&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/popdensity.htm About.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that over half of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human inhabitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and that population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh water sources, this number by itself does not give any meaningful measurement of human population density.

Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are [[city-states]], [[microstates]] or [[Dependent territory|dependencies]].&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1| version=2008 revision  | format=PDF | publisher=United Nations | author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division | year=2009 | accessdate= 12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Monaco government uses a smaller surface area figure resulting in a population density of 18,078 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These territories share a relatively small area and a high [[urbanization]] level, with an economically specialized [[city]] population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].

{{Further information|List of religious populations}}

The table below lists religions classified by philosophy; however, religious philosophy is not always the determining factor in local practice. Please note that this table includes heterodox movements as adherents to their larger philosophical category, although this may be disputed by others within that category. For example, [[Cao Đài]] is listed because it claims to be a separate category from Buddhism, while [[Hòa Hảo]] is not, even though they are similar [[new religious movement]]s.

The population numbers below are computed by a combination of census reports, random surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example United States or France), and self-reported attendance numbers, but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count. Some organizations may wildly inflate their numbers.

Since the late 19th century, the demographics of religion have changed a great deal. Some [[Western civilization|countries with a historically large Christian population]] have experienced a significant decline in the numbers of professed active Christians: see [[demographics of atheism]]. Symptoms of the decline in active participation in Christian religious life include declining recruitment for the [[priest]]hood and [[monastery|monastic life]], as well as diminishing attendance at [[Church service|church]].  On the other hand, since the 19th century, large areas of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] have been converted to Christianity, and this area of the world has the highest population growth rate.  In the realm of [[Western civilization]], there has been an increase in the number of people who identify themselves as [[secular humanism|secular humanists]]. In many countries, such as the People's Republic of China, communist governments have discouraged religion, making it difficult to count the actual number of believers. However, after the collapse of communism in numerous countries of Eastern Europe and the former [[Soviet Union]], religious life has been experiencing resurgence there, both in the form of traditional [[Eastern Christianity]] and in the forms of [[Neopaganism]] and [[Far Eastern religions]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The actual annual growth in the number of humans fell from its peak of 88.0 million in 1989, to a low of 73.9 million in 2003, after which it rose again to 75.2 million in 2006. Since then, annual growth has declined. In 2009, the human population increased by 74.6 million, which is projected to fall steadily to about 41 million per annum in 2050, at which time the population will have increased to about 9.2 billion.&lt;ref name="census1"/&gt; Each region of the globe has seen great reductions in growth rate in recent decades, though growth rates remain above 2% in some countries of the [[Middle East]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and also in [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpop.php U.S. Census Bureau, June 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701122431/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpop.php |date=1 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries experienced [[Population decline|negative population growth]], especially in [[Eastern Europe]] mainly due to low [[fertility rate]]s, high death rates and [[emigration]]. In [[Southern Africa]], growth is slowing due to the high number of [[HIV]]-related deaths. Some [[Western Europe]] countries might also encounter negative population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp?panel=2 UN population projections]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5tpNJ6FqS?url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp?panel=2 |date=28 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]]'s population began decreasing in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/02/japan-population |title=Japan sees biggest population fall |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population in the world increased from 1990 to 2008 with 1,423 million and 27% growth. Measured by persons, the increase was highest in [[India]] (290 million) and [[China]] (192 million).

According to the [[The World Factbook|CIA - The World Factbook]], the country with the highest birth rate currently is Niger at 51.26 births per 1000 people. The country with the lowest birth rate is Japan at 7.64 births per 1000 people. Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, is at 7.42 births per 1000 people. As compared to the 1950s, birth rate was at 36 births per 1000 in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uneca.org/eca_programmes/food_security_and_sustainability/programme_overview/population/fertility/crude_world.htm Uneca.org: Crude Birth Rates - The World and its Major Regions, 1950-2050] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816073652/http://www.uneca.org/eca_programmes/food_security_and_sustainability/programme_overview/population/fertility/crude_world.htm |date=16 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; birth rate has declined by 16 births per 1000 people. In July 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health announced that the adolescent birth rate continues to decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jul2011/nichd-07.htm Federal report shows drop in adolescent birth rate, July 7, 2011 News Release - National Institutes of Health (NIH)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Birth rates vary even within the same geographic areas. In Europe, as of July 2011, Ireland's birth rate is 16.5 per cent, which is 3.5 per cent higher than the next-ranked country, the UK. France has a birth rate of 12.8 per cent while Sweden is at 12.3 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-has-one-of-highest-birth-and-lowest-death-rates-in-eu-189080-Jul2011/ |title=Ireland has one of highest birth and lowest death rates in EU |work=Thejournal.ie |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a 2.4% increase in live births in the UK in 2010 alone.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/13/more-midwives-birth-rate-40-year-high |title=Call for more midwives as birth rate reaches 40-year high |work=The Guardian |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest birth rate in the UK in 40 years.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; By contrast, the birth rate in Germany is only 8.3 per 1,000, which is so low that both the UK and France, which have significantly smaller populations, produced more births in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2011/0809/1224302081071.html |title=Germany faces up to its kinder surprise |work=The Irish Times |date=9 June 2018 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth rates also vary within the same geographic area, based on different demographic groups. For example, in April 2011, the U.S. CDC announced that the birth rate for women over the age of 40 in the U.S. rose between 2007 and 2009, while it fell among every other age group during the same time span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/04/01/cdc.births.decline/index.html |title=CDC records rise in birth rate for women over 40 |work=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Taiwan's government announced that its birth rate declined in the previous year, despite the fact that it implemented a host of approaches to encourage its citizens to have babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14525525 |title=Taiwanese birth rate plummets despite measures |work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth rates ranging from 10-20 births per 1000 are considered low, while rates from 40-50 births per 1000 are considered high. There are problems associated with both an extremely high birth rate and an extremely low birth rate. High birth rates can cause stress on the government welfare and family programs to support a youthful population. Additional problems faced by a country with a high birth rate include educating a growing number of children, creating jobs for these children when they enter the workforce, and dealing with the environmental effects that a large population can produce. Low birth rates can put stress on the government to provide adequate senior welfare systems and also the stress on families to support the elders themselves. There will be less children or working age population to support the constantly growing aging population.

See [[list of countries by death rate]] for worldwide statistics.

According to the [[World Health Organization]], the 10 leading [[causes of death]] in 2002 were:
&lt;!-- ref: http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf --&gt;
# 12.6% [[Ischemic heart disease]]
#  9.7% [[Cerebrovascular disease]]
#  6.8% [[Lower respiratory infection]]s
#  4.9% [[HIV/AIDS]]
#  4.8% [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]
#  3.2% [[Diarrhoeal disease]]s
#  2.7% [[Tuberculosis]]
#  2.2% [[Trachea/bronchus/lung cancers]]
#  2.2% [[Malaria]]
#  2.1% [[Road traffic accidents]]

Causes of death vary greatly between first and third world countries.

According to [[Jean Ziegler]] (the [[United Nations]] Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food for 2000 to March 2008), mortality due to [[malnutrition]] accounted for 58% of the total mortality in 2006: "In the world, approximately 62 millions people, all causes of death combined, die each year. In 2006, more than 36 millions died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in [[micronutrients]]".&lt;ref name=Ziegler&gt;[[Jean Ziegler]], ''[[L'Empire de la honte]]'', Fayard, 2007 {{ISBN|978-2-253-12115-2}}, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the roughly 150,000 people who died each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—died of age-related causes in 2001, according to an article which counts all deaths "due to causes that kill hardly anyone under the age of 40" as age-related.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = 7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersource|| reference uses an extremely broad definition of "age-related" deaths, including even traffic accidents due to poor eyesight|date=June 2018}} In industrialized nations, the proportion was even higher according to that article, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] have the highest female ratio with 0.77 males per female. [[Qatar]] has the highest male ratio, with 2.87 males/female. For the group aged below 15, [[Sierra Leone]] has the highest female ratio with 0.96 males/female, and the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] are tied for the highest male ratio with 1.13 males/female (according to the 2006 [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]).

The value for the entire [[world population]] is 1.02 males/female,&lt;ref name="CIA Fact Book"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA Fact Book |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |publisher=The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |archivedate=1 February 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 1.07 at birth, 1.06 for those under 15, 1.02 for those between 15 and 64, and 0.78 for those over 65.

The "[[First World]]" [[G7]] members all have a sex ratio in the range of 0.95–0.98 for the total population, of 1.05–1.07 at birth, of 1.05–1.06 for the group below 15, of 1.00–1.04 for the group aged 15–64, and of 0.70–0.75 for those over 65.

Countries on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] tend to have a 'natural' ratio of about 1.05 at birth but a very high ratio of males for those over 65 ([[Saudi Arabia]] 1.13, [[United Arab Emirates]] 2.73, [[Qatar]] 2.84), indicating either an above-average mortality rate for females or a below-average mortality for males, or, more likely in this case, a large population of aging male [[foreign worker|guest workers]]. Conversely, countries of [[Eastern Europe]] (the [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]]) tend to have a 'normal' ratio at birth but a very low ratio of males among those over 65 (Russia 0.46, Latvia 0.48, Ukraine 0.52); similarly, [[Armenia]] has a far above average male ratio at birth (1.17), and a below-average male ratio above 65 (0.67). This effect may be caused by [[human migration|emigration]] and higher male mortality as result of higher post-Soviet era deaths; it may also be related to the enormous (by western standards) rate of alcoholism in the former Soviet states. Another possible contributory factor is an aging population, with a higher than normal proportion of relatively elderly people: we recall that due to higher differential mortality rates the ratio of males to females reduces for each year of age.

There is an inverse correlation between [[income and fertility]], wherein [[Developed country|developed countries]] usually have a much lower [[fertility rate]]. Various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]] may be involved, such as education and urbanization. [[Mortality rate]]s are low, [[birth control]] is understood and easily accessible, and costs are often deemed very high because of education, clothing, feeding, and social amenities. With wealth, contraception becomes affordable.  However, in countries like Iran where contraception was made artificially affordable before the economy accelerated, birth rate also rapidly declined.  Further, longer periods of time spent getting higher education often mean women have children later in life. Female labor participation rate also has substantial negative impact on fertility. However, this effect is neutralized among Nordic or liberalist countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage3.nifty.com/sociology/motion.html Graph Charts of TFR and FLR using Google Motion Chart using World Bank's World Development Index.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=November 2012}}

In [[undeveloped countries]] on the other hand, families desire children for their labour and as caregivers for their parents in old age. Fertility rates are also higher due to the lack of access to [[contraceptives]], generally lower levels of [[female education]], and lower rates of female employment in industry.

===Unemployment rate===
8.7% (2010 est.)
8.2% (2009 est.)
note: 30% combined unemployment and underemployment in many non-industrialized countries; developed countries typically 4%-12% unemployment (2007 est.)

===Demonym===
The [[demonym]] for Earth's inhabitants is [[wikt:Earthling|Earthling]] or, as either a noun or an adjective, [[wikt:Terran|Terran]].

'''Digital Radio Mondiale''' ('''DRM'''; ''mondiale'' being [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] for "worldwide") is a set of [[digital radio|digital audio broadcasting]] technologies designed to work over the bands currently used for analogue radio broadcasting including [[AM broadcasting]], particularly [[shortwave]], and [[FM broadcasting]]. DRM is more spectrally efficient than AM and FM, allowing more stations, at higher quality, into a given amount of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], using various [[MPEG-4]] [[audio coding format]]s.

Digital Radio Mondiale is also the name of the international [[non-profit]] [[consortium]] that has designed the platform and is now promoting its introduction. [[Radio France Internationale]], [[TéléDiffusion de France]], [[BBC World Service]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Voice of America]], [[Telefunken]] (now [[Transradio]]) and Thomcast (now [[Ampegon]]) took part at the formation of the DRM consortium.

The principle of DRM is that bandwidth is the limited element, and computer processing power is cheap; modern [[Central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive audio compression techniques enable more efficient use of available bandwidth, at the expense of processing resources.

==Features==

DRM can deliver up to [[frequency modulation|FM]]-comparable sound quality{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} on frequencies below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[long wave]], [[medium wave]] and [[short wave]]), which allow for very-long-distance signal propagation. The modes for these lower frequencies are often collectively known under the term "DRM30". In the VHF bands, the term "DRM+" is used. DRM+ is able to use available broadcast spectra between 30 and 300&amp;nbsp;MHz; generally this means band I (47 to 68&amp;nbsp;MHz), band II (87.5 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz) and band III (174 to 230&amp;nbsp;MHz). DRM has been designed to be able to re-use portions of existing analogue [[transmitter]] facilities such as antennas, feeders, and, especially for DRM30, the transmitters themselves, avoiding major new investment. DRM is robust against the fading and interference which often plague conventional broadcasting in these frequency ranges.

The encoding and decoding can be performed with [[digital signal processing]], so that a cheap [[embedded system|embedded]] computer with a conventional transmitter and receiver can perform the rather complex encoding and decoding.

As a digital medium, DRM can transmit other data besides the audio channels ([[datacasting]]) &amp;mdash; as well as [[RBDS|RDS]]-type [[metadata]] or [[program-associated data]] as [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) does. DRM services can be operated in many different network configurations, from a traditional AM one-service one-transmitter model to a multi-service (up to four) multi-transmitter model, either as a [[single-frequency network]] (SFN) or [[multi-frequency network]] (MFN). Hybrid operation, where the same transmitter delivers both analogue and DRM services simultaneously is also possible.

DRM incorporates technology known as Emergency Warning Features that can override other programming and activates radios which are in standby in order to receive emergency broadcasts.

==Status==
The technical standard is available free-of-charge from the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/201900_201999/201980/04.01.01_60/es_201980v040101p.pdf|title=DRM System specification|author=|date=|website=etsi.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] has approved its use in most of the world. Approval for [[ITU region|ITU region 2]] is pending amendments to existing international agreements. The inaugural broadcast took place on June 16, 2003, in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], at the ITU's [[World Radio Conference]].

Current broadcasters include [[All India Radio]], [[BBC World Service]], [[BitExpress]], [[Radio Exterior de España]], [[Radio New Zealand International]], [[Vatican Radio]], [[Radio Romania International]] and Radio Kuweit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm.org/?page_id=151|title=Digital Radio Mondiale -   Broadcast Schedule|author=|date=|website=www.drm.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until now DRM receivers have typically used a [[personal computer]]. A few manufacturers have introduced DRM receivers which have thus far remained niche products due to limited choice of broadcasts. It is expected that the transition of national broadcasters to digital services on DRM, notably All India Radio, will stimulate the production of a new generation of affordable, and efficient receivers.

[[Chengdu NewStar Electronics]] is offering the DR111 from May 2012 on which meets the minimum requirements for DRM receivers specified by the DRM consortium and is sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DR111 DRM Radio |publisher=Chengdu NewStar Electronics &amp;#124; 成都纽斯达电子公司: |year=2014 |url=http://www.cdnse.com/products/dr111 |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Overseas Service of [[All India Radio]] broadcasts daily in DRM to Western Europe on 9.95&amp;nbsp;MHz at 17:45 to 22:30 UTC.&lt;ref&gt;http://allindiaradio.gov.in/Services/Digital%20Transmission/Pages/simple.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  [[All India Radio]] is in the process of replacing and refurbishing many of its domestic AM transmitters with DRM. The project which began in 2012 is scheduled to complete during 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm.org/?page_id=2494|title=Digital Radio Mondiale -   DRM India Page|author=|date=|website=www.drm.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Broadcasting Corporation [[BBC]] has trialed the technology in the [[United Kingdom]] by broadcasting [[BBC Radio Devon]] in the Plymouth area in the MF band. The [http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/digitalmediumwave/faqs_feature.shtml trial] lasted for a year (April 2007 – April 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2009/05/11/digital_medium_wave_report_feature.shtml|title=Digital medium wave trial report|first=|last=BBC|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[BBC]] also trialed DRM+ in the FM band in 2010 from the [[Craigkelly transmitting station]] in [[Fife]], Scotland, over an area which included the city of [[Edinburgh]]. In this trial, a previously used 10&amp;nbsp;kW (ERP) FM transmitter was replaced with a 1&amp;nbsp;kW DRM+ transmitter in two different modes and the coverage compared with FM &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP199.pdf|title=BBC Research White Paper WHP199|author=|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Digital Radio Mondiale was included in the 2007 [[Ofcom]] consultation on the future of radio in the [[United Kingdom]] for the AM medium wave band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/futureradio/ The Future of Radio (Ofcom, 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043938/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/futureradio/ |date=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTÉ has also run single and multiple programme overnight tests during a similar period on the 252&amp;nbsp;kHz LW transmitter in Trim, Co.Meath, Ireland which was upgraded to support DRM after [[Atlantic 252]] closed.

The Fraunhofer Institute for integrated circuits IIS offers a package for software defined radios which can be licensed to radio manufacturers. [http://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en/pr/2016/20160310_KS_Software_DRM.html]

===International regulation===
On 28 September 2006, the [[Australia]]n spectrum regulator, the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]], announced that it had "placed an embargo on frequency bands potentially suitable for use by broadcasting services using Digital Radio Mondiale until spectrum planning can be completed" "those bands being "5,950–6,200; 7,100–7,300; 9,500–9,900; 11,650–12,050; 13,600–13,800; 15,100–15,600; 17,550–17,900; 21,450–21,850 and 25,670–26,100&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]]: [http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/radcomm/frequency_planning/spectrum_embargoes/embargo44.pdf Embargo on new frequency assignments to support domestic broadcasting services using DRM tecxhnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] [[Federal Communications Commission]] states in {{CodeFedReg|47|73|758}} that:  "For digitally modulated emissions, the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) standard shall be employed."  Part 73, section 758 is for [[high frequency|HF]] broadcasting only.

==Technological Overview==

===Audio source coding===
Useful bitrates for DRM30 range from 6.1 kbit/s (Mode D) to 34.8 kbit/s (Mode A) for a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth (±5&amp;nbsp;kHz around the central frequency). It is possible to achieve bit rates up to 72 kbit/s (Mode A) by using a standard 20&amp;nbsp;kHz (±10&amp;nbsp;kHz) wide channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.drm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DRM-guide-artwork-9-2013-1.pdf

|page=22
|publisher=DRM
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, pure digital [[HD Radio]] can broadcast 20 kbit/s using channels 10&amp;nbsp;kHz wide and up to 60 kbit/s using 20&amp;nbsp;kHz channels.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiquity.com/i/pdfs/Waveforms_AM.pdf |title=The Structure and Generation of Robust Waveforms for AM In-Band On-Channel Digital Broadcasting |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206042040/http://www.ibiquity.com/i/pdfs/Waveforms_AM.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Useful bitrate depends also on other parameters, such as:
* desired robustness to errors ([[Forward error correction|error coding]])
* power needed ([[modulation]] scheme)
* robustness in regard to propagation conditions ([[multipath propagation]], [[doppler effect]]), etc.

When DRM was originally designed, it was clear that the most robust modes offered insufficient capacity for the then state-of-the-art audio coding format [[MPEG-4]] [[HE-AAC]] (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). Therefore, the standard launched with a choice of three different audio coding systems (source coding) depending on the bitrate:
*[[MPEG-4]]  [[HE-AAC]] (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). AAC is a perceptual coder suited for voice and music and the High Efficiency is an optional extension for reconstruction of high frequencies (SBR: spectral bandwidth replication) and stereo image (PS: Parametric Stereo). 24&amp;nbsp;kHz or 12&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling frequencies can be used for core AAC (no SBR) which correspond respectively to 48&amp;nbsp;kHz and 24&amp;nbsp;kHz when using SBR oversampling.
*[[MPEG-4]] [[CELP]] which is a parametric coder suited for voice only (vocoder) but that is robust to errors and needs a small bit rate.
*[[MPEG-4]] [[HVXC]] which is also a parametric coder for speech programs that uses an even smaller bitrate than CELP.

However, with the development of [[MPEG-4]] [[xHE-AAC]], which is an implementation of MPEG [[Unified Speech and Audio Coding]], the DRM standard was updated and the two speech-only coding formats, CELP and HVXC, were replaced. USAC is designed to combine the properties of a speech and a general audio coding according to bandwidth constraints and so is able to handle all kinds of programme material. Given that there were few CELP and HVXC broadcasts on-air, the decision to drop the speech-only coding formats has passed without issue.

Many broadcasters still use the [[HE-AAC]] coding format because it still offers an acceptable audio quality, somewhat comparable to [[FM broadcasting|FM broadcast]] at bitrates above about 15 kbit/s. However, it is anticipated that in future, most broadcasters will adopt [[xHE-AAC]].

Additionally, as of v2.1, the popular Dream software can broadcast using the [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] coding format. Whilst not within the current DRM standard the inclusion of this codec is provided for experimentation. Aside from perceived technical advantages over the MPEG family such as low latency (delay between coding and decoding), this codec provides an open source (therefore free to use) alternative to the proprietary MPEG family whose use is permitted at the discretion of the patent holders, unfortunately it has a substantially lower audio quality than xHE-AAC on low bitrates, which are a key to conserve bandwidth. In fact, at 8Kbps Opus actually sounds worse than analog shortwave radio. A video showing the comparison between Opus and xHE-AAC is available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEUwScTX-R4 here]. Equipment manufacturers currently pay royalties for incorporating the MPEG codecs.

===Bandwidth===
DRM broadcasting can be done using a choice of different bandwidths:

*4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a [[simulcast]] and use the lower-sideband area of a 9&amp;nbsp;kHz raster channel for [[amplitude modulation|AM]], with a 4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102500_102599/102509/01.01.01_60/ts_102509v010101p.pdf |title=See section 5: "DRM/AM single channel simulcast"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is not good.
*5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a [[simulcast]] and use the lower-sideband area of a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz raster channel for AM, with a 5&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband. However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is marginal (7.1–16.7&amp;nbsp;kbit/s for 5&amp;nbsp;kHz). This technique could be used on the [[short wave]] bands throughout the world. 
*9&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region&amp;nbsp;1 long wave or medium wave broadcast channel.
*10&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region&amp;nbsp;2 broadcast channel. could be used to simulcast with analogue audio channel restricted to NRSC5. Occupies a full worldwide short wave broadcast channel (giving 14.8–34.8 kbit/s)
*18&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region&amp;nbsp;1 long wave or medium wave channels according to the existing frequency plan. This offers better audio quality.
*20&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region&amp;nbsp;2 or region 3 AM channel according to the existing frequency plan. This offers highest audio quality of the DRM30 standard (giving 30.6–72&amp;nbsp;kbit/s).
* 100&amp;nbsp;kHz for DRM+. This bandwidth can be used in band I, II, and III and DRM+ can transmit four different programs in this bandwidth or even one low definition digital video channel.

===Modulation===
The modulation used for DRM is coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ([[COFDM]]), where every carrier is modulated with quadrature amplitude modulation ([[QAM]]) with a selectable error coding.

The choice of transmission parameters depends on signal robustness wanted and propagation conditions. Transmission signal is affected by noise, interference, multipath wave propagation and [[Doppler effect]].

It is possible to choose among several error coding schemes and several modulation patterns: 64-QAM, 16-QAM and 4-QAM. OFDM modulation has some parameters that must be adjusted depending on propagation conditions. This is the carrier spacing which will determine the robustness against Doppler effect (which cause frequencies offsets, spread: Doppler spread) and OFDM guard interval which determine robustness against multipath propagation (which cause delay offsets, spread: delay spread). The DRM consortium has determined four different profiles corresponding to typical propagation conditions:
*A: Gaussian channel with very little multipath propagation and Doppler effect. This profile is suited for local or regional broadcasting.
*B: multipath propagation channel. This mode is suited for medium range transmission. It is nowadays frequently used.
*C: similar to mode B, but with better robustness to Doppler (more carrier spacing). This mode is suited for long distance transmission.
*D: similar to mode B, but with a resistance to large delay spread and Doppler spread. This case exists with adverse propagation conditions on very long distance transmissions. The useful bit rate for this profile is decreased.

The trade-off between these profiles stands between robustness, resistance in regards to propagation conditions and useful bit rates for the service. This table presents some values depending on these profiles. The larger the carrier spacing, the more the system is resistant to Doppler effect (Doppler spread). The larger the guard interval, the greater the resistance to long multipath propagation errors (delay spread).

The resulting low-[[bit rate]] digital information is [[modulation|modulated]] using [[COFDM]]. It can run in [[simulcast]] mode by switching between DRM and AM, and it is also prepared for linking to other alternatives (e.g., [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] or FM services).

DRM has been tested successfully on [[shortwave]], [[mediumwave]] (with 9 as well as 10 [[kHz]] [[channel spacing]]) and [[longwave]].

There is also a lower bandwidth two-way communication version of DRM as a replacement for SSB communications on HF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://n1su.com/windrm/|title=WinDRM] - software for Audio and Fast Data over HF SSB |author=|date=|website=n1su.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - note that it is ''not'' compatible with the official DRM specification. It may be possible in some future time for the 4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth DRM version used by the Amateur Radio community to be merged with the existing DRM specification.

The Dream software will receive the commercial versions and also limited transmission mode using the FAAC AAC encoder.

===Error coding===
Error coding can be chosen to be more or less robust.

The lower the protection class the higher the level of error correction.

==DRM+ ==
While the initial DRM standard covered the broadcasting bands below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz, the DRM consortium voted in March 2005 to begin the process of extending the system to the VHF bands up to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151234/http://www.drm.org/uploads/files/drm_plus_pres.pdf DRM+ Presentation], DRM.org, accessed 2009-02-02&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2009, DRM+ (Mode E) became an official broadcasting standard with the publication of the technical specification by the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]; this is effectively a new release of the whole DRM spec with the additional mode permitting operation above 30&amp;nbsp;MHz up to 174&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;ETSI ES 201 980 V3.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Wider bandwidth channels are used, which allows radio stations to use higher bit rates, thus providing higher audio quality. A 100&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM+ channel has sufficient capacity to carry one low-definition 0.7 megabit/s wide mobile TV channel: it would be feasible to distribute [[mobile TV]] over DRM+ rather than [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]] or [[DVB-H]].

DRM+ has been successfully tested in all the VHF bands, and this gives the DRM system the widest frequency usage; it can be used in band I, II and III. DRM+ can coexist with DAB in band III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm-radio-kl.eu/symposium2010/symposium2010en.htm|title=Symposium DRM+ im VHF-Band III in Kaiserslautern|author=|date=|website=www.drm-radio-kl.eu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also the present FM-band can be utilized. The ITU has published three recommendations on DRM+, known in the documents as Digital System G. This indicate  the introduction of the full DRM system (DRM 30 and DRM+).
ITU-R Rec. BS.1114 is the ITU recommendation for sound broadcasting in the frequency range 30&amp;nbsp;MHz to 3&amp;nbsp;GHz. DAB, HD-Radio and ISDB-T were already recommended in this document as Digital Systems A, C and F respectively.

In 2011, the paneuropean organisation Community Media Forum Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmfe.eu|title=Community Media Forum Europe - Information and Lobbying for the Community Media Sector|author=|date=|website=cmfe.eu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has recommended to the European Commission that DRM+ should rather be used for small scale broadcasting (local radio, community radio) than DAB/DAB+.

'''Disease burden''' is the impact of a [[health problem]] as measured by [[financial cost]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], [[morbidity]], or other indicators. It is often quantified in terms of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs) or [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALYs), both of which quantify the number of years lost due to disease (YLDs). One DALY can be thought of as one year of healthy life lost, and the overall disease burden can be thought of as a measure of the gap between current health status and the ideal health status (where the individual lives to [[old age]] free from disease and [[disability]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease.pdf | last1=Prüss-Üstün | first1=Annette | last2 = Corvalán | first2=Carlos|year =2006 |title=Preventing disease through healthy environments: Towards an estimate of the environmental burden of disease | publisher =World Health Organization | work = Quantifying environmental health impacts }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kay00"&gt;{{cite conference| first1=David |last1=Kay | first2=Annette |last2=Prüss |first3=Carlos |last3=Corvalán |title=Methodology for assessment of Environmental burden of disease |booktitle=ISEE session on environmental burden of disease |location=Buffalo |date=23–24 August 2000 |url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/methods/en/wsh0007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546204|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in June 2015, low back pain and major depressive disorder were among the top ten causes of YLDs and were the cause of more health loss than diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma combined.

==History==

The first study on the [[global burden of disease]], conducted in 1990, quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the DALY as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s.&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutgbd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;

==Modifiable risk factors==

In 2006, the WHO released a report which addressed the amount of global disease that could be prevented by reducing environmental risk factors.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt; The report found that approximately one fourth of the global disease burden and more than one third of the burden among children was due to modifiable environmental factors. The "environmentally-mediated" disease burden is much higher in developing countries, with the exception of certain [[non-communicable disease]]s, such as [[cardiovascular disease]]s and cancers, where the [[per capita]] disease burden is larger in [[developed countries]]. Children have the highest death toll, with more than 4 million environmentally-caused deaths yearly, mostly in [[developing countries]]. The [[infant death rate]] attributed to environmental causes is also 12 times higher in developing countries. 85 out of the 102 major diseases and injuries classified by WHO were due to environmental factors.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt;

To measure the environmental health impact, ''environment'' was defined as "all the physical, chemical and biological factors external to a person, and all the related behaviours".&lt;ref name="whatisenv"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease2.pdf|title=What is the environment in the context of health?|work=Environmental burden of disease series|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of ''modifiable environment'' included:
*Air, soil, and water pollution with [[chemical]]s or [[biological agent]]s
*[[Ultraviolet]] and [[ionizing radiation]]
*[[Noise pollution|Noise]] and [[electromagnetic field]]s
*[[Built environment]]
* Agricultural methods and [[irrigation]] schemes
*[[Human impact on the environment|Man-made climate change]] and ecosystem degradation
*[[Occupational hazard|Occupational risks]]
*Individual behaviors, such as hand-washing and [[food contamination]] due to unsafe water or dirty hands&lt;ref name="whatisenv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quantification"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantification of the disease burden attributable to environmental risk factors|year=2010|work=Programme on quantifying environmental health impacts|author=Department of Public Health and Environment|publisher=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/summaryEBD_updated.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain environmental factors were excluded from this definition:
*Indoor smoke from [[solid fuel]] use
*Lead
*[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]&lt;ref name="oberg10"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Öberg, M.|author2=Jaakkola, M.S.|author3=Prüss-Üstün, A.|author4=Schweizer, C.|author5=Woodward, A.|year=2010|title=Second-hand smoke: Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels|publisher=World Health Organization|work=Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Occupational [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate]]s or [[carcinogen]]s
*Outdoor air pollution

==Estimation==

The WHO developed a methodology to quantify the health of a population using summary measures, which combine information on mortality and non-fatal health outcomes. The measures quantify either health gaps or health expectancies; the most commonly used health summary measure is the DALY.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quantification" /&gt;

The exposure-based approach, which measures exposure via [[pollutant]] levels, is used to calculate the environmental burden of disease.&lt;ref name="knol05"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knol|first1=A.B.|last2=Staatsen|first2=B.A.M.|title=Trends in the environmental burden of disease in the Netherlands, 1980–2020|date=8 August 2005|publisher=National Institute of Public Health and the Environment|url=http://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/500029001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires knowledge of the outcomes associated with the relevant risk factor, exposure levels and distribution in the [[study population]], and [[dose-response relationship]]s of the pollutants.

A dose-response relationship is a function of the exposure parameter assessed for the study population.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt; Exposure distribution and dose-response relationships are combined to yield the study population's ''health impact distribution'', usually expressed in terms of [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]. The health impact distribution can then be converted into health summary measures, such as DALYs. Exposure-response relationships for a given risk factor are commonly obtained from [[epidemiological studies]].&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt; For example, the disease burden of outdoor air pollution for [[Santiago, Chile]], was calculated by measuring the concentration of [[atmospheric particulate matter]] (PM10), estimating the susceptible population, and combining these data with relevant dose-response relationships. A reduction of particulate matter levels in the air to recommended standards would cause a reduction of about 5,200 deaths, 4,700 respiratory [[hospital admission]]s, and 13,500,000 days of restricted activity per year, for a total population of 4.7 million.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;

In 2002, the WHO estimated the global environmental burden of disease by using [[risk assessment]] data to develop environmentally attributable fractions (EAFs) of mortality and morbidity for 85 categories of disease.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fewtrell07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241595759_eng.pdf|last1=Fewtrell|first1=Lorna|last2=Prüss-Üstün|first2=Annette|last3=Bos|first3=Robert|last4=Gore|first4=Fiona|last5=Bartram|first5=Jamie|title=Water, sanitation and hygiene: quantifying the health impact at national and local levels in countries with incomplete water supply and sanitation coverage|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2007|work=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, they released the first country-by-country analysis of the impact environmental factors had on health for its then 192 member states. These country estimates were the first step to assist governments in carrying out [[preventive action]]. The country estimates were divided into three parts:

;Environmental burden of disease for selected risk factors
:This presents the yearly burden, expressed in deaths and DALYs, attributable to: [[Indoor air quality|indoor air pollution]] from [[solid fuel]] use; outdoor air pollution; and unsafe water, [[sanitation]], and [[hygiene]]. Results are calculated using the exposure-based approach.
;Total environmental burden of disease for the relevant country
:The total number of deaths, DALYs per capita, and the percentage of the national burden of disease attributable to the environment represent the disease burden that could be avoided by modifying the environment as a whole.
;Environmental burden by disease category
:Each country summary was broken down by the disease group, where the annual number of DALYs per capita attributable to environmental factors were calculated for each group.&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;

==Implementation and interpretation==

The public health impacts of air pollution (annual means of PM10 and ozone), noise pollution, and radiation ([[radon]] and UV), can be quantified using DALYs. For each disease, a DALY is calculated as:
:DALYs = number of people with the disease × duration of the disease (or loss of [[life expectancy]] in the case of mortality) × severity (varying from 0 for perfect health to 1 for death)

Necessary data include [[prevalence]] data, exposure-response relationships, and weighting factors that give an indication of the severity of a certain disorder. When information is missing or vague, experts will be consulted in order to decide which alternative data sources to use. An uncertainty analysis is carried out so as to analyze the effects of different assumptions.&lt;ref name="knol05" /&gt;

===Uncertainty===

When estimating the environmental burden of disease, a number of potential sources of error may arise in the measure of exposure and exposure-risk relationship, assumptions made in applying the exposure or exposure-risk relationship to the relevant country, health statistics, and, if used, expert opinions.

Generally, it is not possible to estimate a formal [[confidence interval]], but it is possible to estimate a range of possible values the environmental disease burden may take based on different input parameters and assumptions.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt; When more than one definition has to be made about a certain element in the assessment, multiple analyses can be run, using different sets of definitions. [[Sensitivity analysis|Sensitivity]] and [[Decision analysis|decision analyses]] can help determine which sources of uncertainty affect the final results the most.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt;

==Representative examples==

===The Netherlands===

In [[the Netherlands]], air pollution is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and exposure to certain forms of radiation can lead to the development of cancer. Quantification of the health impact of the environment was done by calculating DALYs for air pollution, noise, radon, UV, and indoor dampness for the period 1980 to 2020. In the Netherlands, 2–5% of the total disease burden in 2000 could be attributed to the effects of (short-term) exposure to air pollution, noise, radon, natural UV radiation, and [[dampness]] in houses. The percentage can increase to up to 13% due to uncertainty, assuming no threshold.

Among the investigated factors, long-term PM10 exposure have the greatest impact on [[public health]]. As levels of PM10 decrease, related disease burden is also expected to decrease. Noise exposure and its associated disease burden is likely to increase to a level where the disease burden is similar to that of traffic accidents. The rough estimates do not provide a complete picture of the environmental health burden, because data are uncertain, not all environmental-health relationships are known, not all environmental factors have been included, and it was not possible to assess all potential health effects. The effects of a number of these assumptions were evaluated in an uncertainty analysis.&lt;ref name="knol05" /&gt;

===Canada===

Exposure to environmental hazards may cause [[chronic disease]]s, so the magnitude of their contribution to the Canada's total disease burden is not well understood. In order to give an initial estimate of the environmental burden of disease for four major categories of disease, the {{abbr|EAF|environmentally attributable fractions}} developed by the WHO, EAFs developed by other researchers, and data from Canadian public health institutions were used.&lt;ref name="wigmore"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wigmore, Cameron|date=2 November 2007|title=Study: Environmental burden of disease in Canada|url=https://greenparty.ca/fr/node/3079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed a total of 10,000–25,000 deaths, with 78,000–194,000 hospitalizations; 600,000–1.5 million days spent in hospital; 1.1–1.8 million restricted activity days for sufferers of [[asthma]]; 8000–24,000 new cases of cancer; 500–2,500 babies with low [[birth weight]]s; and [[Canadian dollar|C$]]3.6–9.1 billion in costs each year due to respiratory disease, cardiovascular illness, cancer, and congenital affliction associated with adverse environmental exposures.&lt;ref name="wigmore" /&gt;

==Criticism==

There is no consensus on the best measures of the public’s health. This is not surprising because measurements are used to accomplish diverse functions (e.g., population health assessment, evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions, formulation of health policies, and projection of future resource need).  The choice of measures may also depend on individual and societal values.  Measures that only consider premature death will omit the burden of living with a disease or disability, and measures that combine both in a single measure (i.e. DALYs) need to make a judgment to the significance of these measures compared to each other. Other metrics such as economic costs will not capture pain and suffering or other broader aspects of burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | issn=0033-3549 | volume=121 | issue=1 | pages=14–22 | last=Thacker | first=Stephen B |author2=Stroup, Donna F |author3=Carande-Kulis, Vilma |author4=Marks, James S |author5=Roy, Kakoli |author6= Gerberding, Julie L  | title=Measuring the Public's Health | journal=Public Health Reports | year= 2006 |pmc=1497799 | pmid=16416694 | doi=10.1177/003335490612100107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DALYs are a simplification of a complex reality, and therefore only give a crude indication of environmental health impact. Relying on DALYs may make donors take a narrow approach to health care programs. [[Foreign aid]] is most often directed at diseases with the highest DALYs, ignoring the fact that other diseases, despite having lower DALYs, are still major contributors to disease burden. Less-publicized diseases thus have little or no funding for health efforts. For example, maternal death (one of the top three killers in most poor countries) and pediatric respiratory and intestinal infections maintain a high disease burden, and safe pregnancy and the prevention of coughs in infants do not receive adequate funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | issn=0015-7120 | issue=January/February 2007 | last=Garrett | first=Laurie | title=The Challenge of Global Health | journal=Foreign Affairs | date=1 January 2007 | url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/doc/2010_GARRETT_Challenge_of_Global_Health.pdf|volume=86|pages=14–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[Science Education Resource Center]], [[Carleton College]], offers the following description: "Earth system science embraces chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics and applied sciences in transcending disciplinary boundaries to treat the Earth as an integrated system. It seeks a deeper understanding of the physical, chemical, biological and human interactions that determine the past, current and future states of the Earth. Earth system science provides a physical basis for understanding the world in which we live and upon which humankind seeks to achieve sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/earthsystem/nutshell/|title=Earth System Science in a Nutshell|publisher=[[Carleton College]] |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
For millennia, humans have speculated how the physical and living elements on the surface of the Earth combine, with gods and goddesses frequently posited to embody specific elements. The notion that the Earth, itself, is alive was a regular theme of Greek philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name="Tickell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tickell |first=Crispin |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ebulletin-archive/ebulletin/features/2000-2009/2006/11/nparticle.2006-11-20.html |title=Earth Systems Science: Are We Pushing Gaia Too Hard? |work= 46th Annual Bennett Lecture - University of Leicester |location=London |publisher=University of Leicester |date=2006 |accessdate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early scientific interpretations of the Earth system began in the field of [[geology]], initially in the Middle East&lt;ref&gt;Fielding H. Garrison, ''An introduction to the history of medicine'', W.B. Saunders, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; and China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Age of Achievement: A.D. 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century : The Achievements |series=History of civilizations of Central Asia |editor1-first=M.

As [[History of geology|geology developed as a science]], understanding of the interplay of different facets of the Earth system increased, leading to the inclusion of factors such as the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's interior]], [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|planetary geology]] and [[Biosphere|living systems]].

In many respects, the foundational concepts of Earth system science can be seen in the holistic interpretations of nature promoted by the 19th century geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |journal=Science |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596-597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] (1863–1945) saw the functioning of the [[biosphere]] as a geological force generating a dynamic disequilibrium, which in turn promoted the diversity of life. In the mid-1960s, [[James Lovelock]] first postulated a regulatory role for the biosphere in [[feedback]] mechanisms within the Earth system.

As an integrative field, Earth system science assumes the histories of a vast range of scientific disciplines, but as a discrete study it evolved in the 1980s, particularly at [[NASA]], where a committee called the Earth System Science Committee was formed in 1983. The earliest reports of NASA's ESSC, [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104410706;view=1up;seq=3 ''Earth System Science: Overview''] (1986), and the book-length [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Earth System Science: A Closer View''] (1988), constitute a major landmark in the formal development of Earth system science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Mooney| first1=Harold| title=Evolution of natural and social science interactions in global change research programs| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| date=February 26, 2013| volume= 110| issue = Supplement 1, 3665-3672| pages=3665–3672| doi=10.1073/pnas.1107484110| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/Supplement_1/3665.full| accessdate=7 September 2015| display-authors=etal| pmid=23297237| pmc=3586612| bibcode=2013PNAS..110.3665M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early works discussing Earth system science, like these NASA reports, generally emphasized the increasing human impacts on the Earth system as a primary driver for the need of greater integration among the life and geo-sciences, making the origins of Earth system science parallel to the beginnings of [[global change]] studies and programs.

== Climate science ==
[[File:Ocean &amp; Earth System.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The dynamic interaction of the Earth's [[ocean]]s, [[climate|climatological]], [[Geochemical cycle|geochemical systems]].]]
Climatology and climate change have been central to Earth system science since its inception, as evidenced by the prominent place given to climate change in the early NASA reports discussed above. The Earth's climate system is a prime example of an emergent property of the whole planetary system which cannot be fully understood without regarding it as a single integrated entity. It is also a property of the system where human impacts have been growing rapidly in recent decades, lending immense importance to the successful development and advancement of Earth system science research. As just one example of the centrality of climatology to the field, leading American climatologist [[Michael E. Mann]] is the Director of one of the earliest centers for Earth system science research, the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, and its mission statement reads, "the Earth System Science Center (ESSC) maintains a mission to describe, model, and understand the Earth's climate system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=Michael|title=Earth System Science Center|url=http://www.essc.psu.edu/|publisher=Penn State University|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Gaia hypothesis==
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}
The Gaia hypothesis posits that living systems interact with physical components of the Earth system to form a [[homeostasis|self-regulating]] whole that maintains conditions that are favourable for life. Developed initially by James Lovelock, the hypothesis attempts to account for key features of the Earth system, including the long period (several billion years) of relatively favourable climatic conditions against a backdrop of [[Sun#Main sequence|steadily increasing]] [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]]. Consequently, the Gaia hypothesis has important implications for Earth system science, as noted by NASA's Director for Planetary Science, James Green, in October 2010: "Dr. Lovelock and Dr. Margulis played a key role in the origins of what we now know as Earth system science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NASA|first1=50th Anniversary Symposium: Seeking Signs of Life|title=Opening Keynote - 'Exobiology in the Beginning'|url=http://original.livestream.com/astrobiology50th/video?clipId=pla_89adff36-bad9-43a2-b416-29a41cb9fab1|website=livestream.com|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Gaia hypothesis and Earth system science take an interdisciplinary approach to studying systems operations on a planetary-scale,&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"/&gt; they are not synonymous with one another.

== Education ==
Earth system science can be studied at a postgraduate level at some universities, with notable programs at such institutions as the [https://www.ess.uci.edu/ University of California, Irvine], [http://www.essc.psu.edu/ University of Pennsylvania], and [https://earth.stanford.edu/ess Stanford University]. In general education, the [[American Geophysical Union]], in cooperation with the [[Keck Geology Consortium]] and with support from five divisions within the [[National Science Foundation]], convened a workshop in 1996, "to define common educational goals among all disciplines in the Earth sciences". In its report, participants noted that, "The fields that make up the Earth and space sciences are currently undergoing a major advancement that promotes understanding the Earth as a number of interrelated systems". Recognizing the rise of this [[systems approach]], the workshop report recommended that an Earth system science curriculum be developed with support from the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |title=Shaping the Future of Undergraduate Earth Science Education |publisher=American Geophysical Union |accessdate=2009-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916214004/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Earth System Science Education Alliance was begun, and currently includes the participation of 40+ institutions, with over 3,000 teachers having completed an ESSEA course as of fall 2009".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth System Science Education Alliance|url=http://essea.strategies.org/background.html|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35859">The '''FIVB World Ranking''' is a ranking system for men's and women's national teams in [[volleyball]]. The teams of the member nations of [[FIVB]], volleyball's world governing body, are ranked based on their competitions results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded based on the importance of each FIVB International competitions and Continental competitions also. Under the existing system, rankings are based on a team's performance, with more recent results and more significant competitions being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team. {{as of|2017|August}} the top 3 teams in men's category are, world's no.1 [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], no.2 [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], no.3 [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] and in women's category are as follows, world's no.1 [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], no.2 [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]], no.3 [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]].

The ranking system was most recently revamped after the 2006 [[FIVB World League|World League]] (for men) and 2006 [[FIVB World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] (for women).

The rankings are used in international competitions to define the seeded teams and arrange them in pools. Specific procedures for seeding and pooling are established by the FIVB in each competition's formula, but the method usually employed is the [[serpentine system]].

==Programming==

{{main|List of programs broadcast by GMA Life TV}}

The programming of GMA Pinoy TV consists mostly of shows from the Philippines from [[GMA Network]] and [[GMA News TV]] as well as previously aired shows, documentaries, films, and sports events from the Philippines. The delay of GMA Pinoy TV's and GMA Life TV's dramas all air on one-episode delay basis. Most weekend shows are up to date, with the exception of some shows that air on a one-episode delay basis.

==Background==
This secondary channel carries programming from [[GMA News TV]] in the Philippines and some GMA Network proper's programming.

===2008===

It was launched 16 February 2008 in Japan and is available in the Middle East, North Africa, and Southern Europe through [[Orbit Showtime]].

In June 2008 it was launched in Australia and New Zealand on [[UBI World TV]]. It is now also available in the whole United States via [[Dish Network]] and [[DirecTV]].

===2009===
On 2 November 2009, it was launched in Hawaii via [[Time Warner Cable|Oceanic Time Warner Cable]] on 'a la carte' basis or packaged with another Tagalog station ([[GMA Pinoy TV]] or other channels) for Digital Cable subscribers and GMA Life TV also available via [[Time Warner Cable]] in the United States.

===2010===
In September 2010, GMA Life TV has 122,000 subscribers while its sister channel, GMA Pinoy TV has a total of 256,000 subscribers. This is based on a report that the Corporate Communications Department of GMA Network has posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/6812/GMA-Pinoy-TV-and-GMA-Life-TV-initiate-projects-that-will-enrich-lives-of-Filipinos-abroad|title=GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV initiate projects that will enrich lives of Filipinos abroad - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=16 September 2010|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, as of 3rd Quarter of 2010, GMA Life TV has around 126,000 subscribers. The number of subscribers began to substantially increase when the channel was launched during the early part of this year in other areas such us Florida (via Brighhouse Tampa), Texas (via En-Touch), Hong Kong (via PCCW), and Central California (via Comcast).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmapinoytv.com.ph/ver1/article.php?aid=163|title=gmapinoytv.com.ph|work=gmapinoytv.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
By 2011, GMA Life TV will air re-runs of previous GMA shows as QTV will be re-formatted into GMA News TV. GMA News TV will also be available in the worldwide market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gmaseven.blogspot.com//2010/12/qtv-will-be-relaunched-as-gma-news-tv.html|title=Girl Power dating wisdom|author=|date=|website=gmaseven.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/7578/gma-network-launches-gma-news-tv-on-channel-11|title=GMA-7 launches GMA News TV on Channel 11 - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=2 February 2011|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This did occur from 20 February 2011 onward, the decision was to run movies temporarily in place of the previously aired programs from the now-ceased [[Q (TV network)|QTV]].

On 28 February 2011 for the first time in GMA Worldwide, Inc. history, two programs that started airing on [[GMA Pinoy TV]] that is still running with new episodes was switched over to GMA Life TV, where it will then air its new episodes, to occupy free time slots. This then led to replays of other Kapuso shows. The shows included '''Pinoy MD''' and [[Love ni Mister, Love ni Misis]]. All this will be straightened out once [[GMA News TV]] starts its [[GMA News TV International|international operations]] sometime 2nd to 3rd Quarter of 2011.

In a report published showing GMA Network's revenues for 2010 with a total of PhP 14.299 Billion, GMA Life TV has 125,000 subscribers (an estimated 800,000 viewers count) while GMA Pinoy TV has an accounted 273,000 subscribers (around 1.8 Million viewers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/7798/gma-7-ends-2010-with-revenues-of-p14299-billion39-closes-february-with-342-points-vs-abs-cbn39s-32--points-in-nutam-ratings|title=GMA-7 ends 2010 with revenues of P14.299 billion'; closes February with 34.2 points vs ABS-CBN's 32  points in NUTAM ratings - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=11 March 2011|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gmapinoytv.com.ph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmapinoytv.com.ph/ver1/article.php?aid=382|title=gmapinoytv.com.ph|work=gmapinoytv.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2011 [[GMA Pinoy TV]] and GMA Life TV expanded even more in the United States in Florida. The Florida counties that are part of the extension include Brevard, Flagler, Lake, Marion, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Sumter and Volusia.&lt;ref name="gmapinoytv.com.ph"/&gt;

In a recent report, dated 16 May 2011, regarding the consolidated gross revenues of GMA Network, Inc. in the first quarter of 2011, it is noted that GMA Pinoy TV's subscriptions grew by 10 percent (approximately 300,000 subscribers) and GMA Life TV's subscriptions grew by 2 percent (approximately 128,000), respectively. This consisted of PhP 230 million worth of advertising and subscription revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmapinoytv.com.ph/ver1/article.php?aid=493|title=gmapinoytv.com.ph|work=gmapinoytv.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And in May/June 2011, GMA Pinoy TV/GMA Life TV sent many of its artists to various places worldwide, it's the first time that Kapuso artists were sent almost consecutively, to celebrate Philippine Independence Day/Filipino Culture Fiestas and to promote GMA Pinoy TV/GMA Life TV and its shows. They consisted of Iza Calzado &amp; Dennis Trillo who went to Hawaii on 7 May 2011, then on 28 May 2011, Jolina Magdangal and JayR visited National City in San Diego, CA. On the 113th Philippine Independence Day proper, Dennis Trillo &amp; Iza Calzado were sent this time to Hong Kong to represent GMA Pinoy TV and perform there and in Singapore, Dingdong Dantes and Rachel Ann Go were present. And on 26 June 2011, Aljur Abrenica, Jennylyn Mercado, Iza Calzado and Mark Bautista will be sent to be part of Philippine-American Friendship Day in Jersey City, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/funfare/Article.aspx?articleId=695949&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=70|title=FunFare with Ricardo F.

In another recent report with regards to GMA Network's consolidated revenues in the 2nd quarter of 2011, GMA Pinoy TV's subscribers grew to 279,000 from 274,000 (actual count) and an estimated amount of 1.85 million viewers and GMA Life TV's subscribers grew as well, an estimated 1 million viewers. Also, GMA Network recently launched GMA News TV in the past month and will be made available to all areas where GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV reaches by 3rd Quarter of 2011.

They were also launched in many parts of Detroit, Hawaii and upstate New York and New England. The channels were also launched by additional carriers in Australia and Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/8621/gma-network-consolidated-revenues-in-q2-soar-14-percent-to-p3587-billion-versus-q1|title=GMA Network consolidated revenues in Q2 soar 14 percent to P3.587 billion versus Q1 - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=3 August 2011|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in GMA history, '''Idol sa Kusina''', a program originally aired on QTV then [[GMA News TV]] and is simulcasted on GMA Life TV moves to [[GMA Pinoy TV]] on 14 July 2012.

===2013===
SingTel mio TV will launch this channel with effect from 14 June 2013 at 00:00 hrs [[Singapore Standard Time|SST]].

On 22 December 2013 GMA Life TV started airing its first Tagalog-dubbed Koreanovela, [[Full House (2004 TV series)|Full House]], followed by [[My Rosy Life|A Rosy Life]] on 20 January 2014.

===2014===
On 13 March 2014 GMA Life TV began airing its third Tagalog-dubbed Koreanovela [[Sassy Girl Chun Hyang|Sassy Girl]], followed by [[Bad Love (TV series)|Cruel Love]] on 7 April 2014 and [[Dal-ja's Spring]] on 14 April 2014.

[[Basta Every Day, Happy!]] was supposed to premiere on 12 May 2014 (in some territories like the US on the evening of 11 May 2014) and air throughout its entire duration on [[GMA Pinoy TV]] but the programming department of GMA International, GMA's international subsidiary, decided to move the show over to GMA Life TV as it adheres more to GMA Life TV's overall theme as a lifestyle channel as well as the show is a replacement for [[Chef Boy Logro: Kusina Master|Kusina Master]], so the programming department had seen that the move was done rightfully so. On 30 June 2014, [[My Rosy Life|A Rosy Life]] re-airs for the second time on GMA Life TV, followed by the second re-run of [[Sassy Girl Chun Hyang|Sassy Girl]] on 22 September 2014 and [[Bad Love (TV series)|Cruel Love]] on 17 November 2014.

==History==
[[File:Bill Gates, speaking at the UK-hosted GAVI immunisation Alliance pledging event.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Gates]], speaking at the UK-hosted Gavi pledging event in June 2011]]

Gavi was created in 2000 as a successor to the [[Children's Vaccine Initiative]], which had been launched in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gavi - About|url=http://www.gavi.org/about/|website=gavi.org|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dr. Seth Berkley has been the CEO of GAVI since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gavi.org/library/news/press-releases/2011/dr-seth-berkley-appointed-as-gavi-alliance-chief-executive-officer/|title=Dr Seth Berkley appointed as GAVI Alliance Chief Executive Officer|author=|date=|website=www.gavi.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] has donated $1.5 billion to the alliance as of January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/Pages/foundation-fact-sheet.aspx |title=Foundation Fact Sheet – Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation |publisher=Gatesfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Gavi   changed its name from "GAVI Alliance" and introduced a new logo. Both changes were revealed in August;&lt;ref name="2014_ravelo" /&gt; it had by then acquired the gavi.org [[domain name]] and changed its primary domain from gavialliance.org to gavi.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101000000*/http://www.gavi.org/ |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |accessdate=January 25, 2017 |publisher=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gavi.org/library/news/press-releases/year/2014/ |title=Press releases, 2014 |publisher=Gavi |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">'''Global Map''' is a set of digital maps that accurately cover the whole globe to express the status of global environment. It is developed through the cooperation of [[National mapping agency|National Geospatial Information Authorities]] (NGIAs) in the world. An initiative to develop Global Map under [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]], the Global Mapping Project, was advocated in 1992 by Ministry of Construction, Japan (MOC) at the time (the current [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan]]-MLIT).

Global Map is digital [[geospatial information]] in 1&amp;nbsp;km [[Optical resolution|resolution]] which satisfies the following conditions:
# Covering the whole land area of the [[globe]]
# In consistent specifications
# Easily accessible by anyone in marginal cost
The global geospatial information developed as Global Map mainly consists of the following thematic layers:
* [[Transportation]] 
* [[Border|Boundary]] 
* [[Drainage]] 
* Population Centers 
* [[Elevation]] 
* [[Vegetation]] （Percent Tree Cover） 
* [[Land Cover]] 
* [[Land Use]]

== History of the Global Mapping Project ==
Since the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in 1972, global environmental challenges have been recognized as an issue which is common to humankind. “The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the [[Earth Summit]])” in Brazil in 1992 adopted “An action plan of humankind for sustainable development: [[Agenda 21]].” Agenda 21 describes in many parts the importance of information for decision-making to appropriately cope with global environmental challenges. Especially geospatial information is regarded to be critical.

In response to the objectives of Agenda 21 and in recognition of the need for further contribution to the development of geospatial information, the MOC at the time (the current MLIT) advocated, in the same year, the Global Mapping Project, an international cooperation initiative to develop global geospatial information to understand the present status and changes of global environment. This concept was presented at the Fifth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for the Americas in New York in 1993. At the same time, resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/METHODS/CARTOG/Americas/5/EConf.86.3.pdf
|title=Report of the Fifth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for the Americas
|format=PDF
|date=January 1993
|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
calling for the promotion of the development of global geospatial data was adopted at this conference. Following this conference, a similar resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/cartog/Asia_and_Pacific/13/ECONF87.3.pdf
|title=Report of the Thirteenth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific
|format=PDF
|date=May 1994
|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was adopted at Thirteenth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific in Beijing in 1994.
 
In 1996, International Steering Committee for Global Mapping (ISCGM), which consists of heads or its equivalents of NGIAs, was established to promote the Global Mapping Project. Thus the mechanism for the international promotion was formed. The [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]] (GSI) has been serving as the secretariat of the ISCGM. In the following year, in 1997, which was five years after the Earth Summit, the nineteenth [[United Nations General Assembly#Special sessions|special session of the United Nations General Assembly]] (19th UNGASS) was held. At the paragraph 112 of the resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/spec/aress19-2.htm
|title=Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21
|date=1997-06-28
|publisher=United Nations
|accessdate=2012-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the 19th UNGASS, importance of a supportive environment to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection and processing, especially in developing countries, to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues was mentioned along with the description mentioning the significance of international cooperation, including global mapping, as a means to develop the supportive environment.

As a result of such movement, In 1998, a recommendatory letter to participate in the Global Mapping Project was sent from the [[United Nations]] to NGIAs of respective countries in the world.

Further, at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Johannesburg Summit) held in 2002, global mapping was included in the Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35984">'''Global commons''' is a term typically used to describe international, supranational, and global [[natural resources|resource]] domains in which [[common-pool resource]]s are found. Global [[commons]] include the earth's shared natural resources, such as the high [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and [[outer space]] and the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/delc/GlobalCommons/tabid/54404/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyberspace]] may also meet the definition of a global commons.

==Definition and usage==
"Global commons" is a term typically used to describe [[international]], [[supranational]], and global resource domains in which common-pool resources are found. In [[economics]], [[Common good (economics)|common goods]] are [[Rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]] and [[Excludability|non-excludable]], constituting one of the four main types of [[Good (economics)|goods]].&lt;ref&gt;For current definitions of public goods see any mainstream microeconomics textbook, e.g.: Hal R. Varian, ''Microeconomic Analysis'' {{ISBN|0-393-95735-7}}; [[Andreu Mas-Colell|Mas-Colell]], Whinston &amp; Green,  ''Microeconomic Theory'' {{ISBN|0-19-507340-1}}; or Gravelle &amp; Rees, ''Microeconomics'' {{ISBN|0-582-40487-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[common-pool resource]], also called a common property resource, is a special case of a common good (or [[public good]]) whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential users.  Examples include both natural or human-made resource domains (e.g., a "fishing hole" or an irrigation system). Unlike [[global public good]]s, global common-pool resources face problems of congestion, overuse, or degradation because they are subtractable (which makes them [[rivalrous]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0 521 40599 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "commons" originates from the term [[common land]] in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=neeson |first=Jeanette M. |last=Neeson |title=Commoners: Common Right, Enclosure and Social Change in England, 1700–1820 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1996 |ISBN=978-0521567749}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Commoners rights" referred to traditional rights held by commoners, such as [[mowing]] [[meadow]]s for [[hay]] or [[grazing]] [[livestock]] on common land held in the [[open field system]] of old [[English common law]].  [[Enclosure]] was the process that ended those traditional rights, converting open fields to [[private property]].  Today, many commons still exist in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and the [[United States]], although their extent is much reduced from the millions of acres that existed until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |last=Callander |first=Robin Fraser |year=1987 |title=A pattern of Landownership in Scotland: With Particular Reference to Aberdeenshire |place=Finzean |publisher=Haughend |oclc=60041593}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are still over 7,000 registered commons in England alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls DEFRA Database of registered common land in England] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129020728/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls |date=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "global commons" is typically used to indicate the earth's shared natural resources, such as the deep [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[outer space]] and the Northern and Southern [[polar region]]s, the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Global Environmental Politics (2nd edition) |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location=Cheltenham, UK |author=Dauvergne, Peter (ed.) |year=2012 |isbn=978-1849809405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''World Conservation Strategy'', a report on conservation published by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) in collaboration with [[UNESCO]] and with the support of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF):
{{quote|"A commons is  a tract of land or water owned or used jointly by the members of a community. The global commons includes those parts of the Earth's surface beyond [[Jurisdiction#National|national jurisdictions]]&amp;nbsp;— notably the open ocean and the living resources found there&amp;nbsp;— or held in common&amp;nbsp;— notably the atmosphere. The only landmass that may be regarded as part of the global commons is Antarctica ..."&lt;ref name="WCS"&gt;[http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/WCS-004.pdf " Chapter 18, The global commons." ''World Conservation Strategy'', International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, accessed 22 May 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Today, the [[Internet]], [[World Wide Web]] and resulting [[cyberspace]] are often referred to as global commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cigionline.org/publications/2012/10/internet-global-commons Raymond, Mark (2012). "The Internet as a Global Commons?" ''Governing the Internet: Chaos, Control or Consensus?'' The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other usages sometimes include references to open access information of all kinds, including arts and culture, language and science, though these are more formally referred to as the [[common heritage of mankind]].&lt;ref&gt;Baslar, Kemal (1998). ''The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind in International Law''. Martinus Nijhoff Pubs. {{ISBN|978-90-411-0505-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of the global commons==
The key challenge of the global commons is the design of governance structures and management systems capable of addressing the complexity of multiple public and private interests, subject to often unpredictable changes, ranging from the local to the global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Global Environmental Commons: Analytical and Political Challenges in Building Governance Mechanisms |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Brousseau, Eric |year=2012 |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0199656202 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with global public goods, management of the global commons requires pluralistic legal entities, usually international and supranational, public and private, structured to match the diversity of interests and the type of resource to be managed, and stringent enough with adequate incentives to ensure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=International Law and Global Public Goods in a Legal Pluralist World |author=Shaffer, Gregory |journal=European Journal of International Law |date=August 2012 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=669–693 |doi=10.1093/ejil/chs036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such management systems are necessary to avoid, at the global level, the classic [[tragedy of the commons]], in which common resources become [[overexploited]].&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |year=1968 |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–1248 |pmid=5699198 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H}} Also available here [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several key differences in management of resources in the global commons from those of the commons, in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc/article/view/305/229 |title=Design principles for global commons: natural resources and emerging technologies |author=Stern, Paul C |journal=International Journal of the Commons |volume=5 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level.  Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools are less likely to be relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of [[unintended consequences]] that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the [[carbon dioxide emissions]] that drive [[climate change]] continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Irreversible Climate Change Due to Carbon Dioxide Emissions. |author=Solomon, S. |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2009 |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1704–1709 |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.1704S |doi=10.1073/pnas.0812721106 |pmid=19179281 |pmc=2632717 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and species extinctions last forever.  Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at the global level, there are significant differences in [[externalities]] between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.

Several [[environmental protocol]]s have been established (see [[List of international environmental agreements]]) as a type of [[international law]], "an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources."&lt;ref&gt;Kanie, Norichike (2007). "Governance with Multi-lateral Environmental Agreements: A healthy or ill-equipped fragmentation?" ''Global Environmental Governance: Perspectives on the Current Debate'', Walter Hoffmann and Lydia Swart (eds.): 67-86. New York: Center for UN Reform Education.&lt;/ref&gt; International environmental protocols came to feature in [[environmental governance]] after trans-boundary [[pollution|environmental problems]] became widely perceived in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;Haas, Keohane and Levy (1993). ''Institutions for the Earth: Sources of effective international environmental protection.'' Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference]] in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated.&lt;ref name="zurn"&gt;Zürn, Michael (1998).

''World Politics'', 50(4):617-649.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are not a panacea for global commons issues.  Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the [[lowest common denominator]], and lack monitoring and enforcement. They also take an incremental approach to solutions where [[sustainable development]] principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.

===The global ocean===
{{Main article|World ocean|Water cycle}}

The global or [[world ocean]], as the interconnected system of the [[Earth]]'s [[ocean]]ic (or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]]) [[water]]s that comprise the bulk of the [[hydrosphere]], is a classic global commons.  It is divided into a number of principal oceanic areas that are delimited by the [[continent]]s and various oceanographic features.  In turn, oceanic waters are interspersed by many smaller seas, gulfs, and bays.  Further, most freshwater bodies ultimately empty into the ocean and are derived through the Earth's [[water cycle]] from ocean waters.  The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]] is a body of [[public international law]] governing relationships between nations in respect to navigational rights, [[mineral rights]], and jurisdiction over coastal waters.  Maritime law, also called [[Admiralty law]], is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities and [[Conflict of laws|private international law]] governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans. It deals with matters including marine commerce, [[marine navigation]], [[shipping]], [[sailor]]s, and the transportation of passengers and goods by sea. However, these bodies of law do little to nothing to protect deep oceans from human threats.

In addition to providing significant means of transportation, a large proportion of all [[life]] on Earth exists in its ocean, which contains about 300 times the habitable volume of terrestrial habitats.  Specific marine habitats include [[coral reef]]s, [[kelp forest]]s, [[seagrass meadow]]s, [[tidepool]]s, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean ([[pelagic]]) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] to huge [[cetaceans]] (whales) 30 [[meters]] (98 [[foot (length)|feet]]) in length.

At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine life resources provide food (especially [[fishery|food fish]]), medicines, and raw materials. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the [[carbon cycle]]) and of air (such as [[Global climate model|Earth's respiration]], and movement of energy through [[ecosystem]]s including the ocean). Marine organisms contribute significantly to the [[oxygen cycle]], and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's [[climate]].&lt;ref name="DMS"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm3h1q666x206h46 |title=Planktonic dimethylsulfide and cloud albedo: An estimate of the feedback response |author=Foley, Jonathan A., Karl E.

The United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]) has identified several areas of need in managing the global ocean: strengthen national capacities for action, especially in developing countries; improve fisheries management;     reinforce cooperation in semi-enclosed and regional seas; strengthen controls over ocean disposal of hazardous and nuclear wastes; and advance the Law of the Sea. Specific problems identified as in need of attention include [[Current sea level rise|rising sea levels]]; [[Marine pollution|contamination]] by hazardours chemicals (including oil spills); microbiological contamination; ocean acidification; [[Algal bloom#Harmful algal blooms|harmful algal blooms]]; and [[over-fishing]] and other [[overexploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4/report/10_Placing_Environment_at_the_Core.pdf |title=Global environment outlook: environment for development (GEO4) |publisher=World Commission on Environment and Development, The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). |authorlink=Section F,  Chapter 10: From the Periphery to the Core of Decision Making – Options for Action |year=2007 |isbn=978-9280728361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] Environmental Initiative program has identified a need for a worldwide system of very large, highly protected marine reserves where fishing and other extractive activities are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewenvironment.org/campaigns/global-ocean-legacy/id/8589941025 |title=Global Ocean Legacy |publisher=Environmental Initiative, Pew Charitable Trusts |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmosphere===
{{Main article|Air pollution|Climate change|Global warming}}

The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. A primary concern for management of the global atmosphere is [[air pollution]], the introduction into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] of [[chemical]]s, [[particulates]], or [[biomolecule|biological materials]] that cause discomfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as food crops, or damage the [[natural environment]] or [[built environment]]. [[Stratosphere|Stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's [[ecosystems]].

Pollution of breathable [[Air pollution|air]] is a central problem in the management of the global commons. Pollutants can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and may be natural or man-made.  Although controversial and limited in scope by methods of enforcement, in several parts of the world the [[polluter pays principle]], which makes the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]], is accepted. It has strong support in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Community]] (EC) countries. It is also known as extended producer responsibility (EPR). EPR seeks to shift the responsibility dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it attempts to internalise the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically resulting in producers improving the [[Waste management|waste profile]] of their products, decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for [[reuse]] and [[recycling]].

The 1979 [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]], or CLRTAP, is an early international effort to protect and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. It is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), directed by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE).  The [[Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]], or Montreal Protocol (a protocol to the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]]), is an international [[treaty]] designed to protect the [[ozone layer]] by phasing out the production of numerous substances believed to be responsible for [[ozone depletion]]. The treaty was opened for signature on 16 September 1987, and entered into force on 1 January 1989.

[[Global dimming]] is the gradual reduction in the amount of global direct [[irradiance]] at the [[Earth]]'s surface, which has been observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. Global dimming is thought to have been caused by an increase in [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[sulfate aerosol]]s in the atmosphere due to human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter7.pdf |title=Couplings between changes in Climate System and the Biogeochemistry, 7.5.3 |author1=Keneth L. Denman |author2=Guy Brasseur |publisher=IPCC |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-04-09 |format=PDF |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has interfered with the  [[hydrological cycle]] by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a [[global cooling|cooling]] effect that may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gas]]es on [[global warming]].

Along with global warming, generalized [[climate change]] is an ongoing global commons concern.  Although global warming is now a generally accepted scientific observation, the precise causes of global warming are still a matter of research and debate. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) is an international environmental treaty that sets binding obligations on industrialised countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and prevent potentially harmful anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) interference in the climate system.&lt;ref name="unfccc2005"&gt;{{cite web |title=Article 2 |work=The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. |quote=Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner |url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |accessdate=15 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028023600/http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |archivedate=28 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 192 parties to the convention, including 191 states and the [[European Union]], but not all have ratified and implemented the protocol.&lt;ref name=UNamend&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=21 January 2013 |work=United Nations |url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |title=7.c Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114190559/http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar regions===
{{Main article|Polar regions|Climate change in the Arctic|Antarctic cooling controversy}}

The eight Arctic nations  [[Canada]],  [[Denmark]] ( [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]),  [[Norway]], the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Sweden]], [[Finland]],  [[Iceland]], and [[Russia]], are all members of the treaty organization, the [[Arctic Council]], as are organizations representing six [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]]. The Council operates on consensus basis, mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |title=Chronological lists of ratifications of, accessions and successions to the Convention and the related Agreements |publisher=United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414043900/http://www.un.org/depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |archivedate=14 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the [[Antarctic Treaty]] and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System or ATS, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to [[Antarctica]], Earth's only continent without a native human population. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and currently having 50 signatory nations, sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans [[Military activity in the Antarctic|military activity on that continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |title=Information about the Antarctic Treaty and how Antarctica is governed. |accessdate=February 6, 2011 |date=December 28, 2005 |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308064504/http://www.polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |archivedate=March 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in ocean circulation appear responsible for the first exchanges of zooplankton between the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions in perhaps 800,000 years. These changes can allow the transmission of diseases from subarctic animals to Arctic ones, and vice versa, posing an additional threat to species already stressed by habitat loss and other impacts. Where these changes lead is not yet clear, but are likely to have far-reaching impacts on Arctic marine ecosystems.

===Outer space===
{{Main article|Outer space|Space law}}

Management of [[outer space]] global commons has been contentious since the successful launch of the [[Sputnik]] satellite by the former [[Soviet Union]] on 4 October 1957.  There is no clear boundary between [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, although there are several standard boundary designations: one that deals with [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]] (the [[Kármán line]]), one that depends on the velocity of charged particles in space, and some that are determined by human factors such as the height at which human blood begins to boil without a pressurized environment (the [[Armstrong line]]).

[[Space policy]] regarding a country's [[List of space agencies|civilian space program]], as well as its policy on both [[Militarisation of space|military use]] and [[Commercialization of space|commercial use]] of outer space, intersects with [[science policy]], since national space programs often perform or [[Funding of science|fund research]] in [[space science]], and also with [[defense policy]], for applications such as [[spy satellite]]s and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s.  It also encompasses government regulation of third-party activities such as commercial [[communications satellite]]s and [[private spaceflight]]&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Nathan C. |title=Space Policy:An Introduction |year=1992 |publisher=Iowa State University Press |location=Ames, IA |isbn=0-8138-1024-8 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the creation and application of [[space law]] and [[space advocacy]] organizations that exist to support the cause of space exploration.

The [[Outer Space Treaty]] provides a basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national [[sovereignty]]. It also prohibits the deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s in outer space. The treaty was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of mid-year, 2013 the treaty has been ratified by 102 states and signed by an additional 27 states.

Beginning in 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have concerned the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional [[space law]] treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. Still, there remain no legal prohibitions against deploying conventional weapons in space and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 [[Moon Treaty]] turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.

In 1976 eight equatorial states ([[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Republic of Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Zaire]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Indonesia]]) met in [[Bogotá]], Colombia to make the "Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries," also known as "the Bogotá Declaration", a claim to control the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country. These claims are not internationally accepted.

The [[International Space Station program]]me is a joint project among five participating space agencies: [[NASA]], the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (RSA), [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA). National budget constraints led to the merger of three space station projects into the [[International Space Station]]. In 1993 the partially built components for a Soviet/Russian space station [[Mir-2]], the proposed American [[Space Station Freedom|Freedom]], and the proposed European [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] merged into this multinational programme.&lt;ref name="ISSBook"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0387781440 |date=17 June 2008 |publisher=Springer-Praxis |author=John E. Catchpole |title=The International Space Station: Building for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The ISS is arguably the most expensive single item ever constructed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical.whatitcosts.com/facts-space-station.htm|title=How Much the International Space Station (ISS) Cost to Build|author=|date=14 April 2016|website=whatitcosts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be one of the most significant instances of international cooperation in modern history.

According to the original Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the RSA, the International Space Station was intended to be a laboratory, observatory and factory in space. It was also planned to provide transportation, maintenance, and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars and asteroids. In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, it was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Payette |first=Julie |title=Research and Diplomacy 350 Kilometers above the Earth: Lessons from the International Space Station |journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy |date=10 December 2012 |volume=1 |issue=4 |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2012/research-and-diplomacy-350-kilometers-above-earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and educational purposes.&lt;ref name=USNSP&gt;{{cite web |title=National Space Policy of the United States of America |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |publisher=White House; USA Federal government |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711205103/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
{{Main article|Digital commons (economics)}}

As a global system of [[computer]]s interconnected by [[telecommunication]] technologies consisting of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government resources, it is difficult to argue that the [[Internet]] is a global commons.  These computing resources are largely privately owned and subject to [[private property]] law, although many are government owned and subject to [[public law]]. The [[World Wide Web]], as a system of interlinked [[hypertext]] documents, either [[public domain]] (like Wikipedia itself) or subject to [[copyright law]], is, at best, a mixed [[good (economics)|good]].

The resultant [[Virtuality|virtual]] space or [[cyberspace]], however, is often viewed as an electronic global commons that allows for as much or more [[freedom of expression]] as any [[public space]]. Access to those [[Digital commons (economics)|digital commons]] and the actual freedom of expression allowed does vary widely by geographical area.  Management of the electronic global commons presents as many issues as do other commons.  In addition to issues related to [[digital divide|inequity in access]], issues such as [[net neutrality]], [[Internet censorship]], [[Internet privacy]], and electronic [[surveillance]] arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Governance of Cyberspace: Politics, Technology and Global Restructuring |publisher=Routledge |author=Loader, Brian D |year=2004 |isbn=978-0415147248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Governance}}
{{basic forms of government}}

'''Global governance''' or '''world governance''' is a movement towards political cooperation among [[transnationality|transnational]] actors, aimed at negotiating responses to problems that affect more than one state or region. Institutions of global [[governance]]—the [[United Nations]], the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[World Bank]], etc.—tend to have limited or demarcated [[Power in international relations|power]] to enforce compliance.  The modern question of world governance exists in the context of [[globalization]] and globalizing regimes of power: politically, economically and culturally.  In response to the acceleration of worldwide [[interdependence]], both between human societies and between humankind and the [[biosphere]], the term "global governance" may name the process of designating laws, rules, or regulations intended for a global scale.

Global governance is not a singular system. There is no "[[world government]]" but the many different regimes of global ''governance'' do have commonalities:
{{quote| While the contemporary system of global political relations is not integrated, the relation between the various regimes of global governance is not insignificant, and the system does have a common dominant organizational form. The dominant mode of organization today is bureaucratic rational—regularized, codified and rational. It is common to all modern regimes of political power and frames the transition from classical sovereignty to what David Held describes as the second regime of sovereignty—liberal international sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= Jmes | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition==

The term world governance is broadly used to designate all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. The Forum for a new World Governance defines world governance simply as "collective management of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001610/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique6&amp;lang=en Forum for a New World Governance ; ''Reasons for this Forum for a new World Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, ''[[government]]'' has been associated with "governing," or with political authority, institutions, and, ultimately, control. ''[[Governance]]'' denotes a process through which institutions coordinate and control independent social relations, and that have the ability to enforce, by force, their decisions. However, authors like [[James Rosenau]] have also used "governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority, such as in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;James Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance," ''in'' Martin Hewson and Timothy J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'' (Albany, NY: [[State University of New York]], 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some now speak of the development of "global public policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Diane |last=Stone |title=Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=19–38 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2007.00251.x |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1800/1/WRAP_Stone_Global_Agora__Transnational_Public_Policy_JPS.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adil Najam]], a scholar on the subject at the [[Pardee School of Global Studies]], [[Boston University]] has defined global governance simply as "the management of global processes in the absence of global government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailybruin.com/article/2006/10/a-closer-look-professor-seeks- | title=A Closer Look: Professor Seeks Stronger U.N. | publisher=[[The Daily Bruin]] | date=October 18, 2006 | accessdate=October 17, 2012 | author=Riazati, Saba}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas G. Weiss]], director of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at the Graduate Center ([[CUNY]]) and editor (2000–05) of the journal ''[[Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations]]'', "'Global governance'—which can be good, bad, or indifferent—refers to concrete cooperative problem-solving arrangements, many of which increasingly involve not only the United Nations of states but also 'other UNs,' namely international secretariats and other non-state actors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html The UN and Global Governance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821094009/http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html |date=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, global governance refers to the way in which global affairs are managed.

The definition is flexible in scope, applying to general subjects such as global security and order or to specific documents and agreements such as the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes|Code on the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes]]. The definition applies whether the participation is bilateral (e.g. an agreement to regulate usage of a river flowing in two countries), function-specific (e.g. a commodity agreement), regional (e.g. the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]]), or global (e.g. the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://maihold.org/mediapool/113/1132142/data/Finkelstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These "cooperative problem-solving arrangements" may be formal, taking the shape of laws or formally constituted institutions for a variety of actors (such as state authorities, [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), [[private sector]] entities, other [[civil society]] actors, and individuals) to manage collective affairs.&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be informal (as in the case of practices or guidelines) or ad hoc entities (as in the case of coalitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=International Organizations: The Politics and Processes of Global Governance, 2nd ed | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | author=Margaret P. Karns and Karen A. Mingst | year=2009 | location=[[Boulder, CO]] | page=633 | isbn=978-1-58826-698-9 | url=https://www.rienner.com/title/International_Organizations_The_Politics_and_Processes_of_Global_Governance_2nd_edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a single organization may take the nominal lead on an issue, for example the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in world trade affairs. Therefore, global governance is thought to be an international process of consensus-forming which generates guidelines and agreements that affect national governments and international corporations. Examples of such consensus would include WHO policies on health issues.

In short, global governance may be defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, Duties, obligations and privileges are established, and differences are mediated through educated professionals."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Ramesh Thakur, ''The UN and Global Governance: An Idea and Its Prospects'', [[Indiana University Press]], forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus Alexander, author of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid, an Overview of World Politics'', has described the current institutions of global governance as a system of [[global apartheid]], with numerous parallels with minority rule in the formal and informal structures of South Africa before 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics | publisher=Polity Press | author=Alexander, Titus | year= 1996 | pages=320 | url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745613536 | isbn=978-0-7456-1353-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 marked the end of [[Westphalian sovereignty|a long period of international history]] based on a policy of [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]s. Since this historic event, the planet has entered a phase of geostrategic breakdown. The national-security model, for example, while still in place for most governments, is gradually giving way to an emerging collective conscience that extends beyond the restricted framework it represents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 Blin, Arnaud ; Marin, Gustavo ; "Rethinking Global Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530202243/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 |date=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War world of the 1990s saw a new paradigm emerge based on a number of issues:

* The growing idea of globalization as a significant theme and the subsequent weakening of nation-states, points to a prospect of transferring to a global level of regulatory instruments. Upon the model that regulation was no longer working effectively at the national or regional levels.
* An intensification of environmental concerns, which received multilateral endorsement at the [[Earth Summit]]. The Summit issues, relating to the climate and [[biodiversity]], symbolized a new approach that was soon to be expressed conceptually by the term [[Global Commons]].
* The emergence of conflicts over standards: trade and the environment, trade and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]], trade and [[public health]]. These conflicts continued the traditional debate over the social effects of macroeconomic stabilization policies, and raised the question of arbitration among equally legitimate objectives in a compartmentalized governance system where the major areas of interdependence are each entrusted to a specialized international institution. Although often limited in scope, these conflicts are nevertheless symbolically powerful, as they raise the question of the principles and institutions of arbitration.
* An increased questioning of international standards and institutions by developing countries, which, having entered the global economy, find it hard to accept that industrialized countries hold onto power and give preference to their own interests. The challenge also comes from civil society, which considers that the international governance system has become the real seat of power and which rejects both its principles and procedures. Although these two lines of criticism often have conflicting beliefs and goals, they have been known to join in order to oppose the dominance of developed countries and major institutions, as demonstrated symbolically by the failure of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;For greater discussion, see: Andreani, Gilles; "Governance global : origines d'une idée"; ''Politique étrangère'', Nº 3, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;549–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

Global governance can be roughly divided into four stages:&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Agenda building|agenda-setting]]; 
# [[policy]]making, 
# [[implementation]] and [[enforcement]], and 
# [[evaluation]], [[wikt:monitoring|monitoring]], and [[adjudication]].

World authorities including international organizations and corporations achieve [[deference]] to their agenda through different means. Authority can derive from [[institution]]al status, [[expertise]], [[moral authority]], [[capacity building|capacity]], or perceived competence.&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 9–14. "If organizations like the United Nations (UN), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and Exxon are all (potentially) global governors, why are they in charge? Why does anyone pay attention to them? [...] We define authority as the ability to induce deference in others. [...] Deference to authority might take a variety of forms. Authority might cause actors to subordinate their own conscious preferences to the directives of the authority and thus, in Robert Dahl's (1957 and 1968) sense, get one actor to do what she would not otherwise do, but it might also have subtler effects. Authority might create new preferences in actors who were previously indifferent or at odds. It might change preferences in others who become persuaded to share the authority's views based on its moral standing or expertise."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James N. Rosenau]], "Global governance as disaggregated complexity"; in Ba &amp; Hoffmann (2005), pp. 140–41. "In other words, not only has the advent of network forms of organization undermined the authority of states, but in the context of our concern with GG, it has also had even more important consequences. Most notably, networks have contributed to the disaggregation of authority as well as the formation of new collectivities not founded on hierarchical principles. &lt;br&gt; If the notion that new rule systems can be founded on horizontal as well as vertical structures of authority seems awkward, it warrants reiterating that the core of effective authority lies in the compliance of those toward whom it is directed."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In its initial phase, world governance was able to draw on themes inherited from [[geopolitics]] and the theory of [[international relations]], such as peace, defense, [[geostrategy]], [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations, and [[International trade|trade relations]]. But as [[globalization]] progresses and the number of interdependences increases, the global level is also highly relevant to a far wider range of subjects. Following are a number of examples.

===Environmental governance and managing the planet===
"The crisis brought about by the accelerated pace and the probably irreversible character of the [[effect of human activity on the environment|effect of human activities on nature]] requires collective answers from governments and citizens. Nature ignores political and [[social barrier]]s, and the global dimension of the crisis cancels the effects of any action initiated unilaterally by state governments or sectoral institutions, however powerful they may be. [[Climate change]], [[ocean pollution|ocean]] and [[air pollution]], [[nuclear risk]]s and those related to [[genetic manipulation]], the reduction and [[extinction]] of resources and [[biodiversity]], and above all a development model that remains largely unquestioned globally are all among the various manifestations of this accelerated and probably irreversible effect.

This effect is the factor, in the framework of globalization, that most challenges a system of states competing with each other to the exclusion of all others: among the different fields of global governance, [[environmental management]] is the most wanting in urgent answers to the crisis in the form of collective actions by the whole of the human community. At the same time, these actions should help to model and strengthen the progressive building of this community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 Pelayo, G. (ed.) (2008, "Environmental Governance and Managing the Earth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143745/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals in this area have discussed the issue of how collective environmental action is possible. Many multilateral, environment-related agreements have been forged in the past 30 years, but their implementation remains difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Sustainable Development in a Global Context: A Success or a Nuisance?" New Global Studies 9.1 (2015): 27–56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some discussion on the possibility of setting up an international organization that would centralize all the issues related to international environmental protection, such as the proposed World Environment Organization (WEO). The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) could play this role, but it is a small-scale organization with a limited mandate. The question has given rise to two opposite views: the European Union, especially France and Germany, along with a number of NGOs, is in favor of creating a WEO; the United Kingdom, the USA, and most developing countries prefer opting for voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B. (2005), "International Environmental Governance: The next steps", in ''Synthèses'' N°02/2005. Iddri, 2005. 4 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes a "reform agenda" for global environmental governance. The main argument is that there seems to exist an unspoken but powerful consensus on the essential objectives of a system of global [[environmental governance]]. These goals would require top-quality leadership, a strong environmental policy based on knowledge, effective cohesion and coordination, good management of the institutions constituting the environmental governance system, and spreading environmental concerns and actions to other areas of international policy and action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Global_Environmental_Governance:_Elements_of_a_Reform_Agenda Najam, A., M. Papa and N. Taiyab (2007), "Global Environmental Governance: Elements of a Reform Agenda"], in Cleveland, C.J. (eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Earth'', Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A World Environment Organisation ====

The focus of environmental issues shifted to [[climate change]] from 1992 onwards.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Due to the transboundary nature of climate change, various calls have been made for a World Environment Organisation (WEO) (sometimes referred to as a Global Environment Organisation)&lt;ref&gt;Biermann, F., and Simonis, U.E., 1998. Eine Weltorganisation für Umwelt und Ent-wicklung: Ein Vorschlag [A world organization for environment and development: A proposal]. Universitas. Zeitschrift für interdisziplinäre Wissenschaft 53 (627), pp. 822–31.&lt;/ref&gt; to tackle this global problem on a global scale. At present, a single worldwide governing body with the powers to develop and enforce environmental policy does not exist.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J.P., forthcoming 2012. Environmental Governance. Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the creation of a WEO was discussed thirty years ago&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, S., and Biermann, F., 2005. The debate on a World Environment Organization: An introduction.  A World Environment Organization: Solution or Threat for Effective International Environmental Governance?, Aldershot: Ashgate, 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; but is receiving fresh attention in the light of arguably disappointing outcomes from recent, ‘environmental mega-conferences’&lt;ref&gt;Seyfang, G. and Jordan, A., 2002. “Mega” Environmental Conferences: vehicles for effective, long term environmental planning?, in: S. Stokke, and O. Thommesen, (eds) Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development, Earthscan: London: 19–26&lt;/ref&gt;(e.g.[[Rio Summit]] and [[Earth Summit 2002]]).

===== Current global environmental governance =====

International environmental organisations do exist. The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), created in 1972, coordinates the environmental activity of countries in the UN.  UNEP and similar international environmental organisations are seen as not up to the task. They are criticised as being institutionally weak, fragmented, lacking in standing and providing non-optimal environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, G., 1992. New Ways To Make International Environmental Law, American Journal of International Law, 86(2), pp. 259–83. and Voynet, D., 2000.

Global Initiative on Sustainable Development. Department of Foreign Affairs (South Africa, 23 June).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that the current decentralised, poorly funded and strictly intergovernmental regime for global environmental issues is sub-standard.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"&gt;Lodefalk, M., and Whalley, J., 2002. Reviewing Proposals for a World Environment Organization. The World Economy 25 (5) pp. 601–17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the creation of a WEO may threaten to undermine some of the more effective aspects of contemporary global environmental governance;&lt;ref&gt;Najam, A., 2003. The Case against a New International Environmental Organization. Global Governance 9 (3) pp. 367–84.&lt;/ref&gt; notably its fragmented nature, from which flexibility stems.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; This also allows responses to be more effective and links to be forged across different domains.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Even though the environment and climate change are framed as global issues, Levin states that ‘it is precisely at this level that government institutions are least effective and trust most delicate’&lt;ref&gt;Levin, S., 1998. Ecosystems and the biosphere as complex adaptive systems. Ecosystems 1 pp. 431–36&lt;/ref&gt; while Oberthur and Gehring argue that it would offer little more than institutional restructuring for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Oberthür, S. and Gehring, T., 2004. Reforming international environmental governance: an institutionalist critique of the proposal for a World Environmental Organisation. Politics, Law and Economics 4 pp. 359–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====A World Environment Organisation and the World Trade Organisation=====

Many proposals for the creation of a WEO have emerged from the trade and environment debate.&lt;ref name="Biermann"&gt;Biermann, F., 2001. The emerging debate on the need for a [[World Environmental Organization]]: a commentary. Global Environmental Politics, 1 pp. 45–55.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that instead of creating a WEO to safeguard the environment, environmental issues should be directly incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;von Moltke, K., 2001. The Organization of the Impossible. Global Environmental Politics 1 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO has “had success in integrating [[trade agreement]]s and opening up markets because it is able to apply legal pressure to nation states and resolve disputes”.&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; Greece and Germany are currently in discussion about the possibility of [[solar energy]] being used to repay some of Greece’s debt after their economy crashed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, H., 2011. Germany may buy Greeks’ sunshine. The Guardian, [online]6 October. Available at &lt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt; [Accessed 2 November 2011],&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange of resources, if it is accepted, is an example of increased international cooperation and an instance where the WTO could embrace energy trade agreements. If the future holds similar trade agreements, then an environmental branch of the WTO would surely be necessary. However critics of a WTO/WEO arrangement say that this would neither concentrate on more directly addressing underlying market failures, nor greatly improve rule-making.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"/&gt;

The creation of a new agency, whether it be linked to the WTO or not, has now been endorsed by [[Renato Ruggiero]], the former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as by the new WTO director-designate, [[Supachai Panitchpakdi]].&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; The debate over a global institutional framework for environmental issues will undoubtedly rumble on but at present there is little support for any one proposal.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

===Governance of the economy and of globalisation===
The [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]] may have undermined faith that [[laissez-faire capitalism]] will correct all serious financial malfunctioning on its own, as well as belief in the presumed independence of the economy from politics. It has been stated that, lacking in transparency and far from democratic, international financial institutions may be incapable of handling financial collapses. There are many who believe free-market capitalism may be incapable of forming the economic policy of a stable society, as it has been theorised that it can exacerbate inequalities.

Nonetheless, the debate on the potential failings of the system has led the academic world to seek solutions. According to Tubiana and Severino, "refocusing the doctrine of international cooperation on the concept of public goods offers the possibility . . . of breaking the deadlock in international negotiations on development, with the perception of shared interests breathing new life into an international solidarity that is running out of steam."&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L. and J.-M. Severino (2002), "Biens publics globaux, gouvernance mondiale et aide publique au développement", ''in'' Jacquet P., J. Pisani Ferry and L. Tubiana, ''Gouvernance mondiale'', La Documentation française, Les Rapports du CAE, N°37, pp. 349–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that a number of global public goods should be produced and supplied to the populations, but are not, and that a number of global [[externality|externalities]] should be taken into consideration, but are not. On the other hand, he contends, the international stage is often used to find solutions to completely unrelated problems under the protection of opacity and secrecy, which would be impossible in a national democratic framework.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?" ''in'' Touffut, J.-Ph. (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Cournot Centre for Economic Studies, Paris, pp. 149/164.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of international trade, Susan George states that ". . . in a rational world, it would be possible to construct a trading system serving the needs of people in both North and South. . . . Under such a system, crushing third world debt and the devastating structural adjustment policies applied by the World Bank and the IMF would have been unthinkable, although the system would not have abolished capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 George, S. (2007), "Alternative finances", ''Le Monde Diplomatique'', January.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143817/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and institutional governance===
Building a responsible world governance that would make it possible to adapt the political organization of society to globalization implies establishing a democratic political legitimacy at every level: local, national, regional and global.

Obtaining this legitimacy requires rethinking and reforming, all at the same time:
* the fuzzy maze of various international organizations, instituted mostly in the wake of World War II; what is needed is a system of international organizations with greater resources and a greater intervention capacity, more transparent, fairer, and more democratic;
* the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian system]], the very nature of states along with the role they play with regard to the other institutions, and their relations to each other; states will have to share part of their sovereignty with institutions and bodies at other territorial levels, and all with have to begin a major process to deepen democracy and make their organization more responsible;
* the meaning of citizen sovereignty in the different government systems and the role of citizens as political protagonists; there is a need to rethink the meaning of political representation and participation and to sow the seeds of a radical change of consciousness that will make it possible to move in the direction of a situation in which citizens, in practice, will play the leading role at every scale.

The political aspect of world governance is discussed in greater detail in the section [[Global governance#Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance|Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance]]

===Governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution===
Armed conflicts have changed in form and intensity since the Berlin wall came down in 1989. The events of [[9/11]], the wars [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], and repeated terrorist attacks all show that conflicts can repercuss well beyond the belligerents directly involved. The major powers and especially the United States, have used war as a means of resolving conflicts and may well continue to do so. If many in the United States believe that fundamentalist Muslim networks are likely to continue to launch attacks, in Europe nationalist movements have proved to be the most persistent terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Girard|first=Quentin|title=En Europe les actes terroristes islamiques sont rares|journal=Libération|date=July 27, 2011|url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/01012351351-en-europe-les-actes-terroristes-islamistes-sont-rares}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global War on Terrorism]] arguably presents a form of emerging global governance in the sphere of security with the United States leading cooperation among the Western states, non-Western nations and international institutions. Beyer argues that participation in this form of 'hegemonic governance' is caused both by a shared identity and ideology with the US, as well as cost-benefit considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Anna Cornelia (2010), "Counterterrorism and International Power Relations", IB Tauris, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesawar school attack 2014 is a big challenge to us. Militants from the Pakistani Taliban have attacked an army-run school in Peshawar, killing 141 people, 132 of them children, the military say.

At the same time, civil wars continue to break out across the world, particularly in areas where civil and human rights are not respected, such as Central and Eastern Africa and the Middle East. These and other regions remain deeply entrenched in permanent crises, hampered by authoritarian regimes, many of them being supported by the United States, reducing entire swathes of the population to wretched living conditions. The wars and conflicts we are faced with have a variety of causes: economic inequality, social conflict, religious sectarianism, Western imperialism, colonial legacies, disputes over territory and over control of basic resources such as water or land. They are all illustrations a deep-rooted crisis of world governance.

The resulting bellicose climate imbues international relations with competitive nationalism and contributes, in rich and poor countries alike, to increasing military budgets, siphoning off huge sums of public money to the benefit of the arms industry and military-oriented scientific innovation, hence fueling global insecurity. Of these enormous sums, a fraction would be enough to provide a permanent solution for the basic needs of the planet's population hence practically eliminating the causes of war and terrorism.

Andrée Michel argues that the arms race is not only proceeding with greater vigor, it is the surest means for Western countries to maintain their hegemony over countries of the South. Following the break-up of the Eastern bloc countries, she maintains, a strategy for the manipulation of the masses was set up with a permanent invention of an enemy (currently incarnated by Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea) and by kindling fear and hate of others to justify perpetuating the [[Military–industrial complex]] and arms sales. The author also recalls that the "Big Five" at the UN who have the veto right are responsible for 85% of arms sales around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Andrée (1999), ''Surarmement, pouvoirs, démocratie''; L'Harmattan, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals for the governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution begin by addressing [[positive peace|prevention of the causes of conflicts]], whether economic, social, religious, political, or territorial. This requires assigning more resources to improving people's living conditions—health, accommodation, food, and work—and to education, including education in the values of [[peace]], [[social justice]], and unity and diversity as two sides of the same coin representing the global village.

Resources for peace could be obtained by regulating, or even reducing military budgets, which have done nothing but rise in the past recent years. This process could go hand in hand with plans for global disarmament and the conversion of arms industries, applied proportionally to all countries, including the major powers. Unfortunately, the warlike climate of the last decade has served to relegate all plans for global disarmament, even in civil-society debates, and to pigeonhole them as a long-term goal or even a Utopian vision. This is definitely a setback for the cause of peace and for humankind, but it is far from being a permanent obstacle.

International institutions also have a role to play in resolving armed conflicts. Small international rapid deployment units could intervene in these with an exclusive mandate granted by a reformed and democratic United Nations system or by relevant regional authorities such as the European Union. These units could be formed specifically for each conflict, using armies from several countries as was the case when the [[UNIFIL]] was reinforced during the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. On the other hand, no national army would be authorized to intervene unilaterally outside its territory without a UN or regional mandate.

Another issue that is worth addressing concerns the legitimate conditions for the use of force and conduct during war. Jean-Réné Bachelet offers an answer with the conceptualization of a military ethics corresponding to the need for a "principle of humanity." The author defines this principle as follows: "All human beings, whatever their race, nationality, gender, age, opinion, or religion, belong to one same humanity, and every individual has an inalienable right to respect for his life, integrity, and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 Bachelet, Jean-René; ''Military Ethics for a Better World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143947/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance of science, education, information, and communications===
The World Trade Organization's (WTO) agenda of liberalizing public goods and services are related to culture, science, education, health, living organisms, information, and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine HACKER, “ Cultiver la créativité, corollaire de la diversité culturelle européenne ”, Revue Géoéconomie : Cinéma: le déclin de l'empire américain?, numéro 58 – été 2011 : http://www.choiseul-editions.com/documents/BC-G58.pdf?PHPSESSID=cab73ffbe617a07900584f09d655e3d0&lt;/ref&gt; This plan has been only partially offset by the [[alter-globalization movement]], starting with [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the events]] that took place at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999|1999 Seattle meeting]], and on a totally different and probably far more influential scale in the medium and long term, by the astounding explosion of collaborative practices on the [[Internet]]. However, lacking political and widespread citizen support as well as sufficient resources, [[civil society]] has not so far been able to develop and disseminate alternative plans for society as a whole on a global scale, even though plenty of proposals and initiatives have been developed, some more successful than others, to build a fairer, more responsible, and more solidarity-based world in all of these areas.

Above all, each country tries to impose their values and collective preferences within international institutions such like WTO or UNESCO, particularly in the Medias sector. This is an excellent opportunity to promote their soft power, for instance with the promotion of the cinema&lt;ref&gt;Economic warfare on the silver screen- Interview of Violaine Hacker, {{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Economic warfare on the silver screen |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= |date=1970-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as science is concerned, "[r]esearch increasingly bows to the needs of financial markets, turning competence and knowledge into commodities, making employment flexible and informal, and establishing contracts based on goals and profits for the benefit of private interests in compliance with the competition principle. The directions that research has taken in the past two decades and the changes it has undergone have drastically removed it from its initial mission (producing competence and knowledge, maintaining independence) with no questioning of its current and future missions. Despite the progress, or perhaps even as its consequence, humankind continues to face critical problems: poverty and hunger are yet to be vanquished, nuclear arms are proliferating, environmental disasters are on the rise, social injustice is growing, and so on.

Neoliberal commercialization of the commons favors the interests of pharmaceutical companies instead of the patients', of food-processing companies instead of the farmers' and consumers'. Public research policies have done nothing but support this process of economic profitability, where research results are increasingly judged by the financial markets. The system of systematically patenting knowledge and living organisms is thus being imposed throughout the planet through the 1994 WTO agreements on intellectual property. Research in many areas is now being directed by private companies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 "Atelier de la Fondation Sciences citoyennes au Forum social mondial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714091819/http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 |date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the global level, "[i]nstitutions dominating a specific sector also, at every level, present the risk of reliance on technical bodies that use their own references and deliberate in an isolated environment. This process can be observed with the 'community of patents' that promotes the patenting of living organisms, as well as with authorities controlling nuclear energy. This inward-looking approach is all the more dangerous that communities of experts are, in all complex technical and legal spheres, increasingly dominated by the major economic organizations that finance research and development."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

On the other hand, several innovative experiments have emerged in the sphere of science, such as: [[conscience clauses]] and citizens' panels as a tool for democratizing the production system: [[science shop]]s and [[Citizen science|community-based research]]. Politically committed scientists are also increasingly organizing at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/ocbr/assets/pdfs/Global%20Alliance.pdf Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research; ''Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research'']{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as education is concerned, the effect of commoditization can be seen in the serious tightening of education budgets, which affects the quality of general education as a public service. The Global Future Online report reminds us that ". . . at the half-way point towards 2015 ''(author's note: the deadline for the [[Millennium Goals]])'', the gaps are daunting: 80 million children (44 million of them girls) are out of school, with marginalized groups (26 million disabled and 30 million conflict-affected children) continuing to be excluded. And while universal access is critical, it must be coupled with improved learning outcomes—in particular, children achieving the basic literacy, numeracy and life skills essential for poverty reduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfutureonline.org/PolicyAdvocacy/GlblFutr.nsf/issues/92F9DA0279CC03A28825738B0019CDEC?OpenDocument|title=globalfutureonline.org - This website is for sale! - Global Future world vision human development child rights poverty aids peace conflict global Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.globalfutureonline.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to making the current educational system available universally, there is also a call to improve the system and adapt it to the speed of changes in a complex and unpredictable world. On this point, Edgar Morin asserts that we must "[r]ethink our way of organizing knowledge. This means breaking down the traditional barriers between disciplines and designing new ways to reconnect that which has been torn apart." The UNESCO report drawn up by Morin contains "seven principles for education of the future": detecting the error and illusion that have always parasitized the human spirit and human behavior; making knowledge relevant, i.e. a way of thinking that makes distinctions and connections; teaching the human condition; teaching terrestrial identity; facing human and scientific uncertainties and teaching strategies to deal with them; teaching understanding of the self and of others, and an ethics for humankind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 Morin, Edgar; ''Seven Complex Lessons in Education for the Future''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144020/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exponential growth of new technologies, the Internet in particular, has gone hand in hand with the development over the last decade of a global community producing and exchanging goods. This development is permanently altering the shape of the entertainment, publishing, and music and media industries, among others. It is also influencing the social behavior of increasing numbers of people, along with the way in which institutions, businesses, and civil society are organized. [[Peer-to-peer]] communities and collective knowledge-building projects such as [[Wikipedia]] have involved millions of users around the world. There are even more innovative initiatives, such as alternatives to private copyright such as [[Creative Commons]], cyber democracy practices, and a real possibility of developing them on the sectoral, regional, and global levels.

==Regional views==
Regional players, whether regional conglomerates such as [[Mercosur]] and the European Union, or major countries seen as key regional players such as China, the United States, and India, are taking a growing interest in world governance.&lt;ref name="ORF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Governance|url=http://www.orfonline.org/programme/global-governance/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of discussion of this issue can be found in the works of: Martina Timmermann ''et al.'', ''Institutionalizing Northeast Asia: Regional Steps toward Global Governance'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/institutionalizing_Northeast_Asia_web.pdf Timmermann, M. and J.

Interdependence among countries and regions hardly being refutable today, regional integration is increasingly seen not only as a process in itself, but also in its relation to the rest of the world, sometimes turning questions like "What can the world bring to my country or region?" into "What can my country or region bring to the rest of the world?" Following are a few examples of how regional players are dealing with these questions.

===Africa===
Often seen as a problem to be solved rather than a people or region with an opinion to express on international policy, Africans and Africa draw on a philosophical tradition of community and social solidarity that can serve as inspiration to the rest of the world and contribute to building world governance. One example is given by Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni when he reminds us of the relevance of the Ubuntu concept, which stresses the interdependence of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni; ''Giving Africa Voice within Global Governance: Oral History, Human Rights and the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144623/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

African civil society has thus begun to draw up proposals for governance of the continent, which factor in all of the dimensions: local, African, and global. Examples include proposals by the network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique" for "the construction of a local legitimate governance," state reform "capable of meeting the continent's development challenges," and "effective regional governance to put an end to Africa's marginalization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-gouvernance.net/fiches/bipint/fiche-bipint-63.html Network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique"; ''Changeons l’Afrique, 15 propositions pour commencer...'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Foreign-policy proposals announced by President [[Barack Obama]] include restoring the [[Global Poverty Act]], which aims to contribute to meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the world population living on less than a dollar a day by 2015. Foreign aid is expected to double to 50 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24757.html "Record $49B foreign aid budget clears House" in ''Politico'', July 9, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The money will be used to help build educated and healthy communities, reduce poverty and improve the population's health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 "In Defense of Aid" in ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', July 17, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723092252/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 |date=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of international institutions, The White House Web site advocates reform of the World Bank and the IMF, without going into any detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point/|title="A Turning Point" April 2, 2009|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613174551/https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are further points in the Obama-Biden plan for foreign policy directly related to world governance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php "Foreign Policy" in ''Organizing for America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707091922/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php |date=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty;
* global de-nuclearization in several stages including stepping up cooperation with Russia to significantly reduce stocks of nuclear arms in both countries;
* revision of the culture of secrecy: institution of a National Declassification Center to make declassification secure but routine, efficient, and cost-effective;
* increase in global funds for AIDS, TB and malaria. Eradication of malaria-related deaths by 2015 by making medicines and mosquito nets far more widely available;
* increase in aid for children and maternal health as well as access to reproductive health-care programs;
* creation of a 2-billion-dollar global fund for education. Increased funds for providing access to drinking water and sanitation;
* other similarly large-scale measures covering agriculture, small- and medium-sized enterprises and support for a model of international trade that fosters job creation and improves the quality of life in poor countries;
* in terms of energy and global warming, Obama advocates a) an 80% reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 b) investing 150 billion dollars in alternative energies over the next 10 years and c) creating a Global Energy Forum capable of initiating a new generation of climate protocols.

===Latin America===
The 21st century has seen the arrival of a new and diverse generation of left-wing governments in Latin America. This has opened the door to initiatives to launch political and governance renewal. A number of these initiatives are significant for the way they redefine the role of the state by drawing on citizen participation, and can thus serve as a model for a future world governance built first and foremost on the voice of the people. The constituent assemblies in Ecuador and Bolivia are fundamental examples of this phenomenon.

In Ecuador, social and indigenous movements were behind the discussions that began in 1990 on setting up a constituent assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml Servicio Informativo "Alai-amlatina"; Asamblea Constituyente (Ecuador)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305040740/http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml |date=2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Rafael Correa's arrival at the head of the country in November 2006, widespread popular action with the slogan "''que se vayan todos''" (let them all go away) succeeded in getting all the political parties of congress to accept a convocation for a referendum on setting up the assembly.

In April 2007, Rafael Correa's government organized a consultation with the people to approve setting up a constituent assembly. Once it was approved, 130 members of the assembly were elected in September, including 100 provincial members, 24 national members and 6 for migrants in Europe, Latin America and the USA. The assembly was officially established in November. Assembly members belonged to traditional political parties as well as the [[new social movements]]. In July 2008, the assembly completed the text for the new constitution and in September 2008 there was a referendum to approve it. Approval for the new text won out, with 63.9% of votes for compared to 28.1% of votes against and a 24.3% abstention rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleaecuador.org Asamblea Constituyente Ecuador 2008; ''Nueva Constitución del Ecuador'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution establishes the rule of law on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights (ESCER). It transforms the legal model of the social state subject to the rule of law into a "constitution of guaranteed well-being" (''Constitución del bienestar garantizado'') inspired by the ancestral community ideology of "good living" propounded by the Quechuas of the past, as well as by 21st century socialist ideology. The constitution promotes the concept of food sovereignty by establishing a protectionist system that favors domestic production and trade. It also develops a model of public aid for education, health, infrastructures and other services.

In addition, it adds to the three traditional powers, a fourth power called the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, made up of former constitutional control bodies and social movements, and mandated to assess whether public policies are constitutional or not.

The new Bolivian constitution was approved on 25 January 2009 by referendum, with 61.4% votes in favor, 38.6% against and a 90.2% turnout. The proposed constitution was prepared by a constituent assembly that did not only reflect the interests of political parties and the elite, but also represented the indigenous peoples and social movements. As in Ecuador, the proclamation of a constituent assembly was demanded by the people, starting in 1990 at a gathering of indigenous peoples from the entire country, continuing with the indigenous marches in the early 2000s and then with the Program Unity Pact (''Pacto de Unidad Programático'') established by family farmers and indigenous people in September 2004 in Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedib.org/dac ''Hacia una Asamblea Constituyente soberana y participativa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125005025/http://www.cedib.org/dac/ |date=2005-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution recognizes the autonomy of indigenous peoples, the existence of a specific indigenous legal system, exclusive ownership of forest resources by each community and a quota of indigenous members of parliament. It grants autonomy to counties, which have the right to manage their natural resources and elect their representatives directly. The ''latifundio'' system has been outlawed, with maximum ownership of 5,000 hectares allowed per person. Access to water and sanitation are covered by the constitution as human rights that the state has to guarantee, as well as other basic services such as electricity, gas, postal services, and telecommunications that can be provided by either the state or contracting companies. The new constitution also establishes a social and community economic model made up of public, private, and social organizations, and cooperatives. It guarantees private initiative and freedom of enterprise, and assigns public organizations the task of managing natural resources and related processes as well as developing public services covered by the constitution. National and cooperative investment is favored over private and international investment.
The "unitary plurinational" state of Bolivia has 36 official indigenous languages along with Spanish. Natural resources belong to the people and are administered by the state. The form of democracy in place is no longer considered as exclusively representative and/or based on parties. Thus, "the people deliberate and exercise government via their representatives and the constituent assembly, the citizen legislative initiative and the referendum . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 4. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "popular representation is exercised via the political parties, citizen groups, and indigenous peoples."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 222&lt;/ref&gt; This way, "political parties, and/or citizen groups and/or indigenous peoples can present candidates directly for the offices of president, vice-president, senator, house representative, constituent-assembly member, councilor, mayor, and municipal agent. The same conditions apply legally to all. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Latin America: "[[Amazon basin|Amazonia]] . . . is an enormous biodiversity reservoir and a major climate-regulation agent for the planet but is being ravaged and deteriorated at an accelerated pace; it is a territory almost entirely devoid of governance, but also a breeding place of grassroots organization initiatives.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; ''What Amazonia Does the World Need?'', Rio de Janeiro, 2008, p. 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Amazonia can be the fertile field of a true school of 'good' governance if it is looked after as a common and valuable good, first by Brazilians (65% of Amazonia is within Brazilian borders) and the people of the South American countries surrounding it, but also by all the Earth's inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. p. 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, "[f]rom a world-governance perspective, [Amazonia] is in a way an enormous laboratory. Among other things, Amazonia enables a detailed examination of the negative effects of productivism and of the different forms of environmental packaging it can hide behind, including 'sustainable development.' Galloping urbanization, Human Rights violations, the many different types of conflicts (14 different types of conflicts have been identified within the hundreds of cases observed in Amazonia), protection of indigenous populations and their active participation in local governance: these are among the many Amazonian challenges also affecting the planet as a whole, not to mention the environment. The hosts of local initiatives, including among the indigenous populations, are however what may be most interesting in Amazonia in that they testify to the real, concrete possibility of a different form of organization that combines a healthy local economy, good social cohesion, and a true model of sustainable development—this time not disguised as something else. All of this makes Amazonia 'a territory of solutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. pp. 34–41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arnaud Blin, the Amazonian problem helps to define certain fundamental questions on the future of humankind. First, there is the question of social justice: "[H]ow do we build a new model of civilization that promotes social justice? How do we set up a new social architecture that allows us to live together?" The author goes on to refer to concepts such as the concept of "people's territory " or even "life territory" rooted in the indigenous tradition and serving to challenge private property and social injustice. He then suggests that the emerging concept of the "responsibility to protect," following up on the "right of humanitarian intervention" and until now used to try to protect populations endangered by civil wars, could also be applied to populations threatened by economic predation and to environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The growing interest in world governance in Asia represents an alternative approach to official messages, dominated by states' nationalist visions. An initiative to develop proposals for world governance took place in Shanghai in 2006, attended by young people from every continent. The initiative produced ideas and projects that can be classified as two types: the first and more traditional type, covering the creation of a number of new institutions such as an International Emissions Organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 Expanding and Reinforcing the Objectives of the Kyoto Protocol: Inciting International Stakeholders to Engage in Greenhouse-gas Transparency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second more innovative type based on organizing network-based systems. For example, a system of cooperative control on a worldwide level among states&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Conference for Climate Change''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810043211/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-organization of civil society into networks using new technologies, a process that should serve to set up a ''Global Calling-for-Help Center'' or a new model based on citizens who communicate freely, share information, hold discussions, and seek consensus-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 Global Calling-for-Help Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144601/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would use the Internet and the media, working within several types of organizations: universities, NGOs, local volunteers and civil-society groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 World Team E. Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Greenhouse-gas Emissions and Global Mitigation Efforts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144206/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the demographic importance of the continent, the development of discussion on governance and practices in Asia at the regional level, as well as global-level proposals, will be decisive in the years ahead in the strengthening of global dialog among all sorts of stakeholders, a dialog that should produce a fairer world order.(See [[Kishore Mahbubani]]).

===Europe===
According to [[Michel Rocard]], Europe does not have a shared vision, but a collective history that allows Europeans to opt for projects for gradual political construction such as the European Union. Drawing on this observation, Rocard conceives of a European perspective that supports the development of three strategies for constructing world governance: reforming the UN, drawing up international treaties to serve as the main source of global regulations, and "the progressive penetration of the international scene by justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel ; ''World Governance. A Personal European View''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocard considers that there are a number of "great questions of the present days" including recognition by all nations of the [[International Criminal Court]], the option of an international police force authorized to arrest international criminals, and the institution of judicial procedures to deal with tax havens, massively polluting activities, and states supporting terrorist activities. He also outlines "new problems" that should foster debate in the years to come on questions such as a project for a Declaration of Interdependence, how to re-equilibrate world trade and WTO activities, and how to create world regulations for managing collective goods (air, drinking water, oil, etc.) and services (education, health, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel; ''Ibid.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ortega similarly suggests that the European Union should make a more substantial contribution to global governance, particularly through concerted action in international bodies. European states, for instance, should reach an agreement on the reform of the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ortega, Building the future: the EU's contribution to global governance, ISS, Paris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[European Strategy and Policy Analysis System]] (ESPAS), an inter-institutional pilot project of the European Union which aims to assist EU policy formulation through the identification and critical analysis of long-term global trends, highlighted the importance of expanding global governance over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System"&gt;{{cite web|last=ESPAS|title=The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System|url=http://www.espas.europa.eu/home/|publisher=EUISS|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders' views==
It is too soon to give a general account of the view of world-governance stakeholders, although interest in world governance is on the rise on the regional level, and we will certainly see different types of stakeholders and social sectors working to varying degrees at the international level and taking a stand on the issue in the years to come.

===Institutional and state stakeholders===

===Members of parliament===
The World Parliamentary Forum, open to members of parliament from all nations and held every year at the same time as the [[World Social Forum]], drew up a declaration at the sixth forum in Caracas in 2006. The declaration contains a series of proposals that express participants' opinion on the changes referred to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 World Parliamentary Forum, "Final Declaration of the Sixth World Parliamentary Forum - Caracas 2006"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144303/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional organizations===
The European Commission referred to global governance in its White Paper on European Governance. It contends that the search for better global governance draws on the same set of shared challenges humanity is currently facing. These challenges can be summed up by a series of goals: [[sustainable development]], [[security]], [[peace]] and equity (in the sense of "fairness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225182328/http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }} "Global governance: contribution of the European Union"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-state stakeholders===
The freedom of thought enjoyed by non-state stakeholders enables them to formulate truly alternative ideas on world-governance issues, but they have taken little or no advantage of this opportunity.

Pierre Calame believes that "[n]on-state actors have always played an essential role in global regulation, but their role will grow considerably in this, the beginning of the twenty-first Century . . . Non-state actors play a key role in world governance in different domains . . . To better understand and develop the non-state actors' role, it should be studied in conjunction with the general principles of governance." "Non-state actors, due to their vocation, size, flexibility, methods of organization and action, interact with states in an equal manner; however this does not mean that their action is better adapted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en Calame, Pierre ; "Non-state Actors and World Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144347/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative idea encapsulated by many not-for-profit organisations relates to ideas in the '[[Human Potential Movement]]' and might be summarised as a mission statement along these lines: 'To create an accepted framework for all humankind, that is self-regulating and which enables every person to achieve their fullest potential in harmony with the world and its place in existence.'

Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, references to the universal collective of humanity have begun using the term 'humankind' rather than 'mankind', given the gender neutral quality of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2682&amp;context=facpub Weiss, E.B. 2012. "The Coming Water Crisis: A Common Concern of Humankind"]. Transnational Environmental Law 1(1) 153-168, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Self-regulation' is meant to invoke the concept of [[regulation]] which includes [[rule-making]] such as laws, and related ideas e.g. [[legal doctrine]] as well as other frameworks. However its scope is wider than this and intended to encompass [[cybernetics]] which allows for the study of regulation in as many varied contexts as possible from the [[regulation of gene expression]] to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] for example.

===World Religious Leaders===
Since 2005, religious leaders from a diverse array of faith traditions have engaged in dialogue with G8 leaders around issues of global governance and world risk. Drawing on the cultural capital of diverse religious traditions, they seek to strengthen democratic norms by influencing political leaders to include the interests of the most vulnerable when they make their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/3/4/2158244013511830.full|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Sage Open|volume=3|issue=4|pages=215824401351183|doi=10.1177/2158244013511830|year=2013|last1=Steiner|first1=Sherrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that religion is a key to transforming or fixing global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Page, J. 2015.

==Proposals==
Several stakeholders have produced lists of proposals for a new world governance that is fairer, more responsible, solidarity-based, interconnected and respectful of the planet's diversity. Some examples are given below.

Joseph E. Stiglitz proposes a list of reforms related to the internal organization of international institutions and their external role in the framework of global-governance architecture. He also deals with global taxation, the management of global resources and the environment, the production and protection of global knowledge, and the need for a global legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2004), "The Future of Global Governance", in ''Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD)'', IPD Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other proposals are contained in the World Governance Proposal Paper: giving concrete expression to the principle of responsibility; granting civil society greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; granting national parliaments greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; re-equilibrating trade mechanisms and adopting regulations to benefit the southern hemisphere; speeding up the institution of regional bodies; extending and specifying the concept of the commons; redefining proposal and decision-making powers in order to reform the United Nations; developing independent observation, early-warning, and assessment systems; diversifying and stabilizing the basis for financing international collective action; and engaging in a wide-reaching process of consultation, a new Bretton Woods for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article455.html|title=Redefining Global Governance to Meet the Challenges of (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list provides more examples of proposals:
* the security of societies and its correlation with the need for global reforms——a controlled legally-based economy focused on stability, growth, full employment, and North-South convergence;
* equal rights for all, implying the institution of a global redistribution process;
* eradication of poverty in all countries;
* sustainable development on a global scale as an absolute imperative in political action at all levels;
* fight against the roots of terrorism and crime;
* consistent, effective, and fully democratic international institutions;
* Europe sharing its experience in meeting the challenges of globalization and adopting genuine partnership strategies to build a new form of multilateralism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 Groupe de réflexion "Europe-Mondialisation"; ''For Global Reform, a Social Democratic Approach to Globalization''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144357/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Rajesh Tandon, president of the FIM (Montreal International Forum) and of PRIA (Participatory Research in Asia), prepared a framework document entitled "Democratization of Global Governance for Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) conference." He used the document to present five principles that could provide a basis for civil society actions: "Global institutions and agenda should be subjected to democratic political accountability."
* Democratic policy at the global level requires legitimacy of popular control through representative and direct mechanisms.
* Citizen participation in decision making at global levels requires equality of opportunity to all citizens of the world.
* Multiple spheres of governance, from local to provincial to national to regional and global, should mutually support democratization of decision making at all levels.
* Global democracy must guarantee that global public goods are equitably accessible to all citizens of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 Montréal International Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144412/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 |date=2011-10-04 }} ''Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) Conference Report''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Blockchain]] and decentralized platforms can be considered as hyper-political and Global governance tools, capable to manage social interactions on large scale and dismiss traditional central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=083008085091002109121009065100004023014014073092023027101003105086026068106093094125028029021119038017111106028120127023006025122075014092018092000116116089077006022040064023094030088126123026089120094115011009112098106023016006031019067125067008114064&amp;EXT=pdf] ''Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance: Is the State Still Necessary?
 [[SSRN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Vijaya Ramachandran, Enrique Rueda-Sabater and Robin Kraft also define principles for representation of nations and populations in the system of global governance.  They propose a "Two Percent Club" that would provide for direct representation of nations with at least two percent of global population or global GDP; other nations would be represented within international fora through regional blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122466878/abstract|title=Rethinking Fundamental Principles of Global Governance: How to Represent States and Populations in Multilateral Institutions|first1=VIJAYA|last1=RAMACHANDRAN|first2=ENRIQUE J.|last2=RUEDA-SABATER|first3=ROBIN|last3=KRAFT|date=1 July 2009|journal=Governance|volume=22|issue=3|pages=341–351|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01442.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic tool or discipline==
In the light of the unclear meaning of the term "global governance" as a concept in international politics,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2014), "Rethinking Global Governance? Complexity, Authority, Power and Change", International Studies Quarterly, 58: 1, pp. 207-215&lt;/ref&gt; some authors have proposed defining it not in substantive, but in disciplinary and methodological terms. For these authors, global governance is better understood as an analytical concept or optic that provides a specific perspective on world politics different from that of conventional [[international relations]]&lt;ref&gt;K.Dingwerth and P.Pattberg, "Global Governance as a Perspective on World Politics", (2006) Global Governance vol. 12:198.&lt;/ref&gt; theory. [[Thomas G. Weiss]] and [[Rorden Wilkinson]] have even argued that global governance has the capacity to overcome some of the fragmentation of [[international relations]] as a discipline&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson 920140, "Global Governance to the Rescue: Saving International Relations?", Global Governance, 20: 1, pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when understood as a set of questions about the governance of world orders.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2019), Rethinking Global Governance, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|9781509527243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities, including those offering courses in [[international relations]], have begun to establish degree programmes in global governance.

==Context==
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}
There are those who believe that world architecture depends on establishing a system of world governance. However, the equation is currently becoming far more complicated: Whereas the process used to be about regulating and limiting the individual power of states to avoid disturbing or overturning the status quo, the issue for today's world governance is to have a collective influence on the world's destiny by establishing a system for regulating the many interactions that lie beyond the province of state action. The political homogenization of the planet that has followed the advent of what is known as liberal democracy in its many forms should make it easier to establish a world governance system that goes beyond market laissez-faire and the democratic peace originally formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]], which constitutes a sort of geopolitical laissez-faire.

Another view regarding the establishment of global governance is based on the difficulties to achieve equitable development at the world scale. "To secure for all human beings in all parts of the world the conditions allowing a decent and meaningful life requires enormous human energies and far-reaching changes in policies. The task is all the more demanding as the world faces numerous other problems, each related to or even part of the development challenge, each similarly pressing, and each calling for the same urgent attention. But, as [[Arnold Toynbee]] has said, 'Our age is the first generation since the dawn of history in which mankind dares to believe it practical to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001055/105586e.pdf UNESCO (1996), ''Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development'', Summary Version, UNESCO, Paris.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need===
Because of the heterogeneity of preferences, which are enduring despite globalization, are often perceived as an implacable homogenization process. Americans and Europeans provide a good example of this point: on some issues they have differing common grounds in which the division between the public and private spheres still exist. Tolerance for inequalities and the growing demand for redistribution, attitudes toward risk, and over property rights vs human rights, set the stage. In certain cases, globalization even serves to accentuate differences rather than as a force for homogenization. Responsibility must play its part with respect to regional and International governments, when balancing the needs of its citizenry.

With the growing emergence of a global civic awareness, comes opposition to globalization and its effects. A rapidly growing number of movements and organizations have taken the debate to the international level. Although it may have limitations, this trend is one response to the increasing importance of world issues, that effect the planet.

=== Crisis of purpose ===
Pierre Jacquet, Jean Pisani-Ferry, and [[Laurence Tubiana]] argue that "[t]o ensure that decisions taken for international integration are sustainable, it is important that populations see the benefits, that states agree on their goals and that the institutions governing the process are seen as legitimate. These three conditions are only partially being met. Taklya"

The authors refer to a "crisis of purpose" and international institutions suffering from "imbalance" and inadequacy. They believe that for these institutions, "a gap has been created between the nature of the problems that need tackling and an institutional architecture which does not reflect the hierarchy of today's problems. For example, the environment has become a subject of major concern and central negotiation, but it does not have the institutional support that is compatible with its importance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf Pierre Jacquet; Jean Pisani-Ferry; Laurence Tubiana; ''À la recherche de la gouvernance mondiale''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905000313/http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World government===
Global governance is not [[world government]], and even less [[democratic globalization]]. In fact, global governance would not be necessary, were there a world government. Domestic governments have monopolies on the use of force—the power of enforcement. Global governance refers to the political interaction that is required to solve problems that affect more than one state or region when there is no power to enforce compliance.  Problems arise, and networks of actors are constructed to deal with them in the absence of an international analogue to a domestic [[government]]. This system has been termed [[disaggregated sovereignty]].

===Consensus example===
Improved global problem solving need not involve the establishment of additional powerful formal global institutions. It does involve building consensus on norms and practices. One such area, currently under construction, is the development and improvement of accountability mechanisms. For example, the [[UN Global Compact]] brings together companies, UN agencies, labor organizations, and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles. Participation is entirely voluntary, and there is no enforcement of the principles by an outside regulatory body. Companies adhere to these practices both because they make economic sense, and because [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], especially [[shareholders]], can monitor their compliance easily. Mechanisms such as the Global Compact can improve the ability of affected individuals and populations to hold companies accountable. However, corporations participating in the UN Global Compact have been criticized for their merely minimal standards, the absence of sanction-and-control measures, their lack of commitment to social and ecological standards, minimal acceptance among corporations around the world, and the high cost involved in reporting annually to small and medium-sized business&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-ethic-now.de/gen-eng/0d_weltethos-und-wirtschaft/0d-03-neue-art/0d-03-106-global-com-kritik.php A Global Ethic Now!; ''UN Global Compact Under Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bitcoin]] &amp; Beyond: [[Blockchain]]s, Globalization, and Global Governance workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to examine the implications that blockchains pose for globalization and global governance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.balsillieschool.ca/event/bitcoin-beyond-blockchains-globalization-and-global-governance. Balsillie School&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Expansion of normative mechanisms and globalization of institutions===
One effect of globalization is the increasing regulation of businesses in the global marketplace. Jan Aart Scholte asserts, however, that these changes are inadequate to meet the needs: "Along with the general intensified globalization of social relations in contemporary history has come an unprecedented expansion of regulatory apparatuses that cover planetary jurisdictions and constituencies. On the whole, however, this global governance remains weak relative to pressing current needs for global public policy. Shortfalls in moral standing, legal foundations, material delivery, democratic credentials and charismatic leadership have together generated large legitimacy deficits in existing global regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, J.A. (2007), "Civil Society and the Legitimation of Global Governance", CSGR Working Paper No. 223/07&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals and initiatives have been developed by various sources to set up networks and institutions operating on a global scale: political parties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 Sehm-Patömaki, K. and M. Ulvila (2006), "Dialogues on Party Systems and Global Democratization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143624/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 Howard, S. (2006), "Organising Globally"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; regional authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 Forum de réseaux de régions du monde (2007), "Déclaration des régions sur leur participation à la gouvernance de la mondialisation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143711/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and members of parliament in sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipietz.net/spip.php?article1431|title=A quoi sert le Forum Parlementaire Mondial ?- Alain Lipietz|author=|date=|website=lipietz.net|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation and objectives===
One of the conditions for building a world democratic governance should be the development of platforms for citizen dialogue on the legal formulation of world governance and the harmonization of objectives.

This legal formulation could take the form of a Global Constitution. According to Pierre Calame and Gustavo Marin, "[a] Global Constitution resulting from a process for the institution of a global community will act as the common reference for establishing the order of rights and duties applicable to United Nations agencies and to the other multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article.php3?id_article=670|title=Main Points for the Discussion with the United Nations (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for formulating objectives, the necessary but insufficient ambition of the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]], which aim to safeguard humankind and the planet, and the huge difficulties in implementing them, illustrates the inadequacy of institutional initiatives that do not have popular support for having failed to invite citizens to take part in the elaboration process.

Furthermore, the Global Constitution "must clearly express a limited number of overall objectives that are to be the basis of global governance and are to guide the common action of the U.N. agencies and the multilateral institutions, where the specific role of each of these is subordinated to the pursuit of these common objectives."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Calame proposes the following objectives:
# instituting the conditions for sustainable development
# reducing inequalities
# establishing lasting peace while respecting diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Calame, P. (2003), ''La démocratie en miettes. Pour une révolution de la gouvernance'', Ed. Charles Léopold Mayer, Ed. Descartes et cie. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforming international institutions===
Is the UN capable of taking on the heavy responsibility of managing the planet's serious problems? More specifically, can the UN reform itself in such a way as to be able to meet this challenge? At a time when the financial crisis of 2008 is raising the same questions posed by the climate disasters of previous years regarding the unpredictable consequences of disastrous human management, can international financial institutions be reformed in such a way as to go back to their original task, which was to provide financial help to countries in need?

Lack of political will and citizen involvement at the international level has also brought about the submission of international institutions to the "[[neoliberal]]" agenda, particularly financial institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Rorden (2014), What's Wrong with the WTO and How to Fix it, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|978-0-745-67245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Calame gives an account of this development,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 Calame, Pierre; "Pour une gouvernance mondiale légitime, efficace et démocratique"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144903/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Joseph E. Stiglitz points out that the need for international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO has never been so great, but people's trust in them has never been so low.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?", ''in'' Jean-Philippe Touffut, (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Paris, pp. 149/164&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key aspects of the United Nations reform is the problem of the representativeness of the General Assembly. The Assembly operates on the principle of "one state, one vote," so that states of hugely varying sizes have the same effect on the vote, which distorts representativeness and results in a major loss of credibility. Accordingly, "the General Assembly has lost any real capacity to influence. This means that the mechanisms for action and consultation organized by rich countries have the leading role."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Gustave Massiah advocates defining and implementing a radical reform of the UN. The author proposes building new foundations that can provide the basis for global democracy and the creation of a Global Social Contract, rooted in the respect and protection of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as in the recognition of the strategic role of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadtm.org/spip.php?article1187|title=La réforme de l'ONU et le mouvement altermondialiste|author=|date=|website=www.cadtm.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three ‘gaps’ in global governance===
There is the jurisdictional gap, between the increasing need for global governance in many areas - such as health - and the lack of an authority with the power, or jurisdiction, to take action.
Moreover, the gap of incentive between the need for international cooperation and the motivation to undertake it. The incentive gap is said to be closing as globalization provides increasing impetus for countries to cooperate. However, there are concerns that, as Africa lags further behind economically, its influence on global governance processes will diminish. At last, the participation gap, which refers to the fact that international cooperation remains primarily the affair of governments, leaving civil society groups on the fringes of policy-making. On the other hand, globalization of communication is facilitating the development of global civil society movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225190757/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2005|title=WHO - Global Governance|author=|date=25 February 2005|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing news reports in the international media have revealed operational details about the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and its international partners' [[global surveillance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=[[Barton Gellman]] |title=Edward Snowden, after months of NSA revelations, says his mission's accomplished |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/edward-snowden-after-months-of-nsa-revelations-says-his-missions-accomplished/2013/12/23/49fc36de-6c1c-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html |date=December 24, 2013 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=December 25, 2013 |quote=Taken together, the revelations have brought to light a global surveillance system...}}&lt;/ref&gt; of foreign nationals and U.S. citizens. The reports mostly emanate from a cache of [[top secret]] documents [[Leak (news)|leaked]] by ex-NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]], which he obtained whilst working for [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], one of the largest contractors for defense and intelligence in the United States.&lt;ref name="WP20130610Security"&gt;{{cite news |title=Who holds security clearances? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/who-holds-security-clearances/2013/06/10/983744e4-d232-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_graphic.html |accessdate=February 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a trove of U.S. federal documents, Snowden's cache reportedly contains thousands of Australian, British and Canadian intelligence files that he had accessed via the exclusive "[[Five Eyes]]" network. &lt;ref name="WP20130610Security" /&gt; In June 2013, the first of Snowden's documents were published simultaneously by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'', attracting considerable public attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |title=NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order |work=The Guardian |accessdate=August 16, 2013 |quote=Exclusive: Top secret court order requiring [[Verizon]] to hand over all call data shows scale of domestic surveillance under [[Barack Obama|Obama]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disclosure continued throughout 2013, and a small portion of the estimated full cache of documents was later published by other media outlets worldwide, most notably ''[[The New York Times]]'' (United 
States), the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' (Germany), ''[[O Globo]]'' (Brazil), ''[[Le Monde]]'' (France), ''[[L'espresso]]'' (Italy), ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' (the Netherlands), ''[[Dagbladet]]'' (Norway), ''[[El País]]'' (Spain), and [[Sveriges Television]] (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSA Primary Sources |url=https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/nsadocs |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These media reports have shed light on the implications of several [[Secret treaty|secret treaties]] signed by members of the [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA community]] in their efforts to implement [[global surveillance]]. For example, ''Der Spiegel'' revealed how the German [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]] (BND) transfers "massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA",&lt;ref name="spiegelsendnsa"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Hubert Gude |author2=Laura Poitras |author3=Marcel Rosenbach |title=German intelligence Sends Massive Amounts of Data to the NSA |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligence-sends-massive-amounts-of-data-to-the-nsa-a-914821.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |date=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Swedish Television revealed the [[National Defence Radio Establishment (Sweden)|National Defence Radio Establishment]] (FRA) provided the NSA with data from its [[diplomatic cable|cable collection]], under a secret treaty signed in 1954 for bilateral cooperation on surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gunnar Rensfeldt |title=NSA 'asking for' specific exchanges from FRA – Secret treaty since 1954 |url=http://www.svt.se/ug/nsafra4 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |quote=This document, dated 18 April of this year, clearly shows that the relation is very close indeed, seemingly growing even closer.

The extent to which the media reports have responsibly informed the public is disputed. In January 2014, Obama said that "the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light"&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2014/01/17/263480199/transcript-of-president-obamas-speech-on-nsa-reforms Transcript Of President Obama's Speech On NSA Reforms] [[NPR]] January 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and critics such as [[Sean Wilentz]] have noted that many of the Snowden documents released do not concern domestic surveillance.&lt;ref name="newrepublic.com"&gt;[[Sean Wilentz]] (January 19, 2014), [https://newrepublic.com/article/116253/edward-snowden-glenn-greenwald-julian-assange-what-they-believe Would You Feel Differently About Snowden, Greenwald, and Assange If You Knew What They Really Thought?] ''[[The New Republic]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The US &amp; UK Defense establishment weigh the strategic harm in the period following the disclosures more heavily than their civic public benefit. In its first assessment of these disclosures, [[the Pentagon]] concluded that Snowden committed the biggest "theft" of U.S. secrets in the [[history of the United States]].&lt;ref name="mostpentagon" /&gt; Sir [[David Omand]], a former director of GCHQ, described Snowden's disclosure as the "most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever".&lt;ref name="omandsnowden"&gt;{{cite news |title=Snowden leaks 'worst ever loss to British intelligence' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24486649 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=February 4, 2014 |date=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Barton Gellman]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalist who led ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s coverage of Snowden's disclosures, summarized the leaks as follows:

The NSA was also getting data directly from [[telecommunications companies]] codenamed Artifice, Lithium, Serenade, SteelKnight, and X. The real identities of the companies behind these codenames were not included in the Snowden document dump because they were protected as [[Exceptionally Controlled Information]] which prevents wide circulation even to those (like Snowden) who otherwise have the necessary security clearance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ecisnowden&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ewen MacAskill |author2=Dominic Rushe |title=Snowden document reveals key role of companies in NSA data collection |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/nsa-data-collection-tech-firms |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disclosures ===
Although the exact size of Snowden's disclosure remains unknown, the following estimates have been put up by various government officials:
* At least 15,000 [[Australian Intelligence Community|Australian intelligence]] files, according to Australian officials&lt;ref name="australian20k"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Cameron Stewart |author2=Paul Maley |title=Edward Snowden stole up to 20,000 Aussie files |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/edward-snowden-stole-up-to-20000-aussie-files/story-fn59nm2j-1226775491490# |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if there is no reason to suspect U.S. citizens of wrongdoing, the [[CIA]]'s [[National Counterterrorism Center]] is allowed to examine federal government files for possible criminal behavior.

Documents leaked by Edward Snowden that were seen by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' (SZ) and ''[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]]'' revealed that several [[Telecommunication|telecom]] operators have played a key role in helping the British intelligence agency [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) tap into worldwide [[fiber-optic communication]]s. The telecom operators are:

Each of them were assigned a particular area of the international [[fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic network]] for which they were individually responsible. The following networks have been infiltrated by GCHQ: [[TAT-14]] (Europe-USA), [[Atlantic Crossing 1]] (Europe-USA), [[Circe (cable system)|Circe South]] (France-UK), [[Circe (cable system)|Circe North]] (The Netherlands-UK), [[Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe#Segment FLAG Atlantic 1 (FA-1)|Flag Atlantic-1]], [[Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe#Segment FLAG Europe Asia (FEA)|Flag Europa-Asia]], [[SEA-ME-WE 3]] (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe), [[SEA-ME-WE 4]] (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe), Solas (Ireland-UK), UK-France 3, UK-Netherlands 14, [[ULYSSES (cable system)|ULYSSES]] (Europe-UK), [[AC-2|Yellow]] (UK-USA) and [[PEC (cable system)|Pan European Crossing]].&lt;ref name="SZAug28"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://international.sueddeutsche.de/post/59603415442/british-officials-have-far-reaching-access-to-internet |title=British Officials Have Far-Reaching Access To Internet And Telephone Communications |author1=John Goetz |author2=Hans Leyendecker |author3=Frederik Obermaier |work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telecommunication companies who participated were "forced" to do so and had "no choice in the matter".&lt;ref name=SZAug28 /&gt; Some of the companies were subsequently paid by GCHQ for their participation in the infiltration of the cables.&lt;ref name="SZAug28" /&gt; According to the SZ, GCHQ has access to the majority of internet and telephone communications flowing throughout Europe, can listen to phone calls, read emails and text messages, see which websites internet users from all around the world are visiting. It can also retain and analyse nearly the entire European internet traffic.&lt;ref name="SZAug28" /&gt;

GCHQ is collecting all data transmitted to and from the United Kingdom and Northern Europe via the undersea fibre optic telecommunications cable [[SEA-ME-WE 3]]. The [[Security and Intelligence Division]] (SID) of Singapore co-operates with Australia in accessing and sharing communications carried by the SEA-ME-WE-3 cable. The [[Australian Signals Directorate]] (ASD) is also in a partnership with British, American and Singaporean intelligence agencies to tap undersea fibre optic telecommunications cables that link Asia, the Middle East and Europe and carry much of Australia's international phone and internet traffic.&lt;ref name="smhaug28"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dorling |first=Philip |title=Australian spies in global deal to tap undersea cables |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/australian-spies-in-global-deal-to-tap-undersea-cables-20130828-2sr58.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama Administration secretly won permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2011 to reverse restrictions on the National Security Agency's use of intercepted phone calls and e-mails, permitting the agency to search deliberately for Americans' communications in its massive databases. The searches take place under a surveillance program Congress authorized in 2008 under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under that law, the target must be a foreigner "reasonably believed" to be outside the United States, and the court must approve the targeting procedures in an order good for one year. But a warrant for each target would thus no longer be required. That means that communications with Americans could be picked up without a court first determining that there is probable cause that the people they were talking to were terrorists, spies or "foreign powers." The FISC extended the length of time that the NSA is allowed to retain intercepted U.S. communications from five years to six years with an extension possible for foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Both measures were done without public debate or any specific authority from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nakashima |first=Ellen |title=Obama administration had restrictions on NSA reversed in 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-administration-had-restrictions-on-nsa-reversed-in-2011/2013/09/07/c26ef658-0fe5-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_print.html |accessdate=February 3, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly sensitive signals intelligence collection program known as [[Stateroom (surveillance program)|Stateroom]] involves the interception of radio, telecommunications and internet traffic. It is operated out of the diplomatic missions of the [[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]] (Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, United States) in numerous locations around the world. The program conducted at U.S. diplomatic missions is run in concert by the U.S. intelligence agencies NSA and CIA in a joint venture group called "[[Special Collection Service]]" (SCS), whose members work undercover in shielded areas of the American Embassies and Consulates, where they are officially accredited as diplomats and as such enjoy special privileges. Under diplomatic protection, they are able to look and listen unhindered. The SCS for example used the American Embassy near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to monitor communications in Germany's government district with its parliament and the seat of the government.&lt;ref name="Spiegel20131027"&gt;{{cite news |title=Der Spiegel Cover Story: How NSA Spied on Merkel Cell Phone from Berlin Embassy – Embassy Espionage: The NSA's Secret Spy Hub in Berlin |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cover-story-how-nsa-spied-on-merkel-cell-phone-from-berlin-embassy-a-930205.html |accessdate=November 1, 2013 |newspaper=Der Spiegel |date=October 27, 2013 |author=Jacob Appelbaum, Nikolaus Blome, Hubert Gude, Ralf Neukirch, René Pfister, Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, Jörg Schindler, Gregor Peter Schmitz and Holger Stark.

''The New York Times'' reported that the NSA carries out an eavesdropping effort, dubbed Operation Dreadnought, against the Iranian leader [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]]. During his 2009 visit to [[Iranian Kurdistan]], the agency collaborated with GCHQ and the U.S.'s [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], collecting radio transmissions between aircraft and airports, examining Khamenei's convoy with satellite imagery, and enumerating military radar stations. According to the story, an objective of the operation is "communications fingerprinting": the ability to distinguish Khamenei's communications from those of other people in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="omnivore"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/world/no-morsel-too-minuscule-for-all-consuming-nsa.html?pagewanted=all |title=No Morsel Too Minuscule for All-Consuming N.S.A. |work=The New York Times |date=November 2, 2013 |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |author=Shane, Scott |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F11%2F03%2Fworld%2Fno-morsel-too-minuscule-for-all-consuming-nsa.html%3Fpagewanted%3D7%26_r%3D2%26pagewanted%3Dall&amp;date=2013-11-25 |archivedate=November 25, 2013 |quote=This "communications fingerprinting," as a document called it, is the key to what the N.S.A. does.

The same story revealed an operation code-named Ironavenger, in which the NSA intercepted e-mails sent between a country allied with the United States and the government of "an adversary".

In November 2013, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' revealed that the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] (DSD) had attempted to listen to the private phone calls of the [[president of Indonesia]] and his wife. The Indonesian foreign minister, [[Marty Natalegawa]], confirmed that he and the president had contacted the ambassador in Canberra. Natalegawa said any tapping of Indonesian politicians' personal phones "violates every single decent and legal instrument I can think of—national in Indonesia, national in Australia, international as well".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/indonesia-recalls-ambassador-yudhoyono-phone-tapping-australia Indonesia recalls Canberra ambassador over Yudhoyono phone tapping attempt, Foreign minister demands explanation after documents reveal Australian agencies targeted phones of president and his wife] The Guardian November 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a secret deal approved by British intelligence officials, the NSA has been storing and analyzing the internet and email records of UK citizens since 2007. The NSA also proposed in 2005 a procedure for spying on the citizens of the UK and other [[UKUSA Agreement|Five-Eyes nations alliance]], even where the partner government has explicitly denied the U.S. permission to do so. Under the proposal, partner countries must neither be informed about this particular type of surveillance, nor the procedure of doing so.&lt;ref name="ukusaball"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ball |first=James |title=US and UK struck secret deal to allow NSA to 'unmask' Britons' personal data |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The culture of compliance, which has allowed the American people to entrust NSA with extraordinary authorities, will not be compromised in the face of so many demands, even as we aggressively pursue legal authorities...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Strategy for Surveillance Powers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/11/23/us/politics/23nsa-sigint-strategy-document.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 23, 2013 |date=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The report, titled "[[signals intelligence|SIGINT]] Strategy 2012–2016", also said that the U.S. will try to influence the "global commercial encryption market" through "commercial relationships", and emphasized the need to "revolutionize" the analysis of its vast data collection to "radically increase operational impact".&lt;ref name="nytimessignt2016" /&gt;

On November 23, 2013, the Dutch newspaper ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' reported that the Netherlands was targeted by U.S. intelligence agencies in the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]].

==== December ====
According to the classified documents leaked by Snowden, the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] (ASD), formerly known as the Defence Signals Directorate, had offered to share intelligence information it had collected with the other intelligence agencies of the [[UKUSA Agreement]]. Data shared with foreign countries include "bulk, unselected, unminimised metadata" it had collected. The ASD provided such information on the condition that no Australian citizens were targeted. At the time the ASD assessed that "unintentional collection [of metadata of Australian nationals] is not viewed as a significant issue". If a target was later identified as being an Australian national, the ASD was required to be contacted to ensure that a warrant could be sought. Consideration was given as to whether "medical, legal or religious information" would be automatically treated differently to other types of data, however a decision was made that each agency would make such determinations on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=guardian031213&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ewen MacAskill |author2=James Ball |author3=Katharine Murphy |title=Revealed: Australian spy agency offered to share data about ordinary citizens |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaked material does not specify where the ASD had collected the intelligence information from, however Section 7(a) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 (Commonwealth) states that the ASD's role is "...to obtain intelligence about the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intelligence Services Act 2001 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00114/Html/Text#_Toc442430744 |accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is possible ASD's metadata intelligence holdings was focused on foreign intelligence collection and was within the bounds of Australian law.

''[[The Washington Post]]'' revealed that the NSA has been tracking the locations of mobile phones from all over the world by tapping into the cables that connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as well as foreign ones. In the process of doing so, the NSA collects more than five billion records of phone locations on a daily basis.

U.S. District Judge Pauley also ruled that Congress legally set up the program and that it does not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. He further ruled that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment.

According to ''The New York Times'', the NSA is monitoring approximately 100,000 computers worldwide with spy software named Quantum. Quantum enables the NSA to conduct surveillance on those computers on the one hand, and can also create a digital highway for launching cyberattacks on the other hand. Among the targets are the Chinese and Russian military, but also trade institutions within the European Union. The NYT also reported that the NSA can access and alter computers which are not connected with the internet by a secret technology in use by the NSA since 2008. The prerequisite is the physical insertion of the radio frequency hardware by a spy, a manufacturer or an unwitting user.  The technology relies on a covert channel of radio waves that can be transmitted from tiny circuit boards and USB cards inserted surreptitiously into the computers. In some cases, they are sent to a briefcase-size relay station that intelligence agencies can set up miles away from the target. The technology can also transmit malware back to the infected computer.&lt;ref name="NYT20140114" /&gt;

[[Channel 4]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' revealed the existence of [[Dishfire]], a massive [[database]] of the NSA that collects hundreds of millions of text messages on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: NSA 'collected 200&amp;nbsp;m texts per day' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25770313 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; GCHQ has been given full access to the database, which it uses to obtain personal information of Britons by exploiting a legal loophole.&lt;ref name="c4database"&gt;{{cite web |last=Geoff White |title=Revealed: UK and US spied on text messages of Brits |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/intercept-text-messages-spy-nsa-gchq-british-phone |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |date=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each day, the database receives and stores the following amounts of data:
* [[Geolocation]] data of more than 76,000 text messages and other travel information&lt;ref name="guardiandishfire" /&gt;
* Over 110,000 names, gathered from electronic [[business card]]s&lt;ref name="guardiandishfire" /&gt;

In a separate 20-page report dated 2012, GCHQ cited the popular smartphone game "[[Angry Birds]]" as an example of how an application could be used to extract user data. Taken together, such forms of data collection would allow the agencies to collect vital information about a user's life, including his or her home country, current location (through [[geolocation]]), age, gender, [[ZIP code]], [[marital status]], income, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], education level, number of children, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ball |first=James |title=NSA and GCHQ target 'leaky' phone apps like Angry Birds to scoop user data |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/nsa-gchq-smartphone-app-angry-birds-personal-data |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=January 27, 2014 |date=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=James Glanz |author2=Jeff Larson |author3=Andrew W.

According to research by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and TV network [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] the mobile phone of former German chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] was monitored from 2002 onwards, reportedly because of his government's opposition to [[Iraq War|military intervention in Iraq]]. The source of the latest information is a document leaked by Edward Snowden. The document, containing information about the National Sigint Requirement List (NSRL), had previously been interpreted as referring only to [[Angela Merkel]]'s mobile. However ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' and NDR claim to have confirmation from NSA insiders that the surveillance authorisation pertains not to the individual, but the political post – which in 2002 was still held by Schröder. According to research by the two media outlets, Schröder was placed as number 388 on the list, which contains the names of persons and institutions to be put under surveillance by the NSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA hatte auch Gerhard Schröder im Visier |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ausspaehung-des-bundeskanzlers-nsa-hatte-auch-gerhard-schroeder-im-visier-1.1880004 |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |newspaper=Süddeutsche Zeitung |date=February 4, 2014 |author=Stefan Kornelius, Hans Leyendecker und Georg Mascolo |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ottermann |first=Philip |title=NSA tapped German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder's phone – report |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/04/us-nsa-gerhard-schroeder-surveillance |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=February 4, 2014 |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: NSA spied on Merkel's predecessor too |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |work=Associated Press (AP) |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |date=February 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205020031/http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |archivedate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smale |first=Alison |title=German Paper Says U.S. Kept Tabs on Leader |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/world/europe/german-paper-says-us-kept-tabs-on-leader.html |accessdate=February 10, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guardian reported that Britain's surveillance agency GCHQ, with aid from the National Security Agency, intercepted and stored the webcam images of millions of internet users not suspected of wrongdoing. The surveillance program codenamed [[Optic Nerve (GCHQ)|Optic Nerve]] collected still images of Yahoo webcam chats (one image every five minutes) in bulk and saved them to agency databases. The agency discovered "that a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate parts of their body to the other person", estimating that between 3% and 11% of the Yahoo webcam imagery harvested by GCHQ contains "undesirable nudity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors=Spencer Ackerman and James Ball |title=UK spy agency intercepted webcam images of millions of Yahoo users |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo |accessdate=February 27, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== March ====
The NSA has built an infrastructure which enables it to covertly hack into computers on a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human oversight in the process. The NSA relies on an automated system codenamed [[TURBINE (US government project)|TURBINE]] which in essence enables the automated management and control of a large network of implants (a form of remotely transmitted malware on selected individual computer devices or in bulk on tens of thousands of devices). As quoted by ''The Intercept'', TURBINE is designed to "allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individually."&lt;ref name="TC20140312"&gt;{{cite news |title=How the NSA Plans to Infect 'Millions' of Computers with Malware |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014 |author=Ryan Gallagher and Greenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA has shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance – the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

Among other things due to TURBINE and its control over the implants the NSA is capable of:

* breaking into targeted computers and to siphoning out data from foreign Internet and phone networks
* infecting a target's computer and exfiltrating files from a hard drive
* covertly recording audio from a computer's microphone and taking snapshots with its webcam
* launching cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites
* exfiltrating data from removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer

The TURBINE implants are linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine surveillance "sensors" that the NSA has installed at locations across the world, including the agency's headquarters in Maryland and eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan and Menwith Hill, England. Codenamed as TURMOIL, the sensors operate as a sort of high-tech surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent across the Internet. When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems, the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL system can be used to send alerts or "tips" to TURBINE, enabling the initiation of a malware attack. To identify surveillance targets, the NSA uses a series of data "selectors" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors can include email addresses, IP addresses, or the unique "cookies" containing a username or other identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites such as Google, Facebook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Twitter, unique Google advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique encryption key fingerprints that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs that are sent across the Internet when a Windows computer crashes or updates.&lt;ref name="TC20140312" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Ryan |title=Compare the NSA's Facebook Malware Denial to its Own Secret Documents |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/15/nsa-facebook-malware-turbine-non-denial-denial/ |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Sean |title=NSA's automated hacking engine offers hands-free pwning of the world |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/nsas-automated-hacking-engine-offers-hands-free-pwning-of-the-world/ |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |publisher=Ars Technica |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands of Implants |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Industrial-Scale Exploitation |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/industrial-scale-exploitation/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA Technology Directorate Analysis of Converged Data |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-technology-directorate-analysis-converged-data/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=There Is More Than One Way to Quantum |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/one-way-quantum/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA Phishing Tactics and Man in the Middle Attacks |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-phishing-tactics-man-middle-attacks/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quantum Insert Diagrams |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/quantum-insert-diagrams/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TURBINE and TURMOIL |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/turbine-turmoil/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The NSA and GCHQ's QUANTUMTHEORY Hacking Tactics |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-gchqs-quantumtheory-hacking-tactics/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Menwith Hill Station Leverages XKeyscore for Quantum Against Yahoo and Hotmail |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/menwith-hill-station-leverages-xkeyscore-quantum-yahoo-hotmail/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Five Eyes Hacking Large Routers |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/five-eyes-hacking-large-routers/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Selector Types |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/selector-types/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=VPN and VOIP Exploitation With HAMMERCHANT and HAMMERSTEIN |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/vpn-voip-exploitation-hammerchant-hammerstein/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands of Implants |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/ |accessdate=March 13, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Intercept'' and [[WikiLeaks]] revealed information about which countries were having their communications collected as part of the [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]] surveillance program. On May 19, ''The Intercept'' reported that the NSA is recording and archiving nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas with a system called SOMALGET, a subprogram of [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]].

In a statement responding to the revelations, the NSA said "the implication that NSA's foreign intelligence collection is arbitrary and unconstrained is false."&lt;ref name="data pirates" /&gt;

Through its global surveillance operations the NSA exploits the flood of images included in emails, text messages, social media, videoconferences and other communications to harvest millions of images. These images are then used by the NSA in sophisticated [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition programs]] to track suspected terrorists and other intelligence targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Risen |first1=James |last2=Poitras |first2=Laura |title=N.S.A.

Above-[[Top Secret|top-secret]] documentation of a covert surveillance program named Overseas Processing Centre 1 (OPC-1) (codenamed "CIRCUIT") by [[GCHQ]] was published by ''[[The Register]]''. Based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, GCHQ taps into undersea fiber optic cables via secret spy bases near the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and Yemen. [[BT Group|BT]] and [[Vodafone]] are implicated.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Campbell, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/03/revealed_beyond_top_secret_british_intelligence_middleeast_internet_spy_base/ "Revealed: Beyond top secret British intelligence Middleeast Internet spy base"], ''[[The Register]]'', June 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish newspaper ''Dagbladet Information'' and ''The Intercept'' revealed on June 19, 2014, the NSA mass surveillance program codenamed [[RAMPART-A]]. Under RAMPART-A, 'third party' countries tap into fiber optic cables carrying the majority of the world's electronic communications and are secretly allowing the NSA to install surveillance equipment on these fiber-optic cables. The foreign partners of the NSA turn massive amounts of data like the content of phone calls, faxes, e-mails, internet chats, data from virtual private networks, and calls made using Voice over IP software like Skype over to the NSA. In return these partners receive access to the NSA's sophisticated surveillance equipment so that they too can spy on the mass of data that flows in and out of their territory. Among the partners participating in the NSA mass surveillance program are Denmark and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA 'third party' partners tap the Internet backbone in global surveillance program |accessdate=June 19, 2014 |work=Dagbladet Information |date=June 19, 2014 |url=http://www.information.dk/501280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jensen |first1=Kristian |title=Documentation: The Snowden files |url=http://www.information.dk/databloggen/501278 |accessdate=June 19, 2014 |work=Dagbladet Information |date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gallagher |first1=Ryan |title=How Secret Partners Expand NSA's Surveillance Dragnet |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/06/18/nsa-surveillance-secret-cable-partners-revealed-rampart-a |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |work=The Intercept |date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former NSA official and whistleblower [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] spoke at a [[Centre for Investigative Journalism]] conference in London. According to Binney, "at least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores." He also stated that the majority of [[Optical fiber cable|fiber optic cables]] run through the U.S., which "is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lowenstein |first1=Antony |title=The ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control |journal=The Guardian |date=July 10, 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/11/the-ultimate-goal-of-the-nsa-is-total-population-control |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' released a review of a cache provided by Snowden containing roughly 160,000 text messages and e-mails intercepted by the NSA between 2009 and 2012. The newspaper concluded that nine out of ten account holders whose conversations were recorded by the agency "were not the intended surveillance targets but were caught in a net the agency had cast for somebody else." In its analysis, ''The Post'' also noted that many of the account holders were Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gellman |first1=Barton |last2=Tate |first2=Julie |last3=Soltani |first3=Ashkan |title=In NSA-intercepted data, those not targeted far outnumber the foreigners who are |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-nsa-intercepted-data-those-not-targeted-far-outnumber-the-foreigners-who-are/2014/07/05/8139adf8-045a-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322_story.html |work=The Washington Post|date=July 5, 2014 |accessdate=Feb 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Canada
In December 2013, the Canadian government announced an extensive review of Canada's intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stewart Bell |title=Review underway into allegations that national intelligence agency illegally spied on Canadians |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/09/review-underway-into-allegations-that-national-intelligence-agency-illegally-spied-on-canadians/ |work=[[National Post]] |accessdate=December 30, 2013 |date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism and Alternative Views===
In January 2014, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] said that "the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light"&lt;ref name="npr.org" /&gt; and critics such as [[Sean Wilentz]] claimed that "the NSA has acted far more responsibly than the claims made by the leakers and publicized by the press."  In Wilentz' view "The leakers have gone far beyond justifiably blowing the whistle on abusive programs. In addition to their alarmism about [U.S.] domestic surveillance, many of the Snowden documents released thus far have had nothing whatsoever to do with domestic surveillance."&lt;ref name="newrepublic.com" /&gt; [[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]], former Moscow bureau chief for ''[[The Economist]]'', agreed, asserting that "Snowden's revelations neatly and suspiciously fits the interests of one country: Russia" and citing [[Masha Gessen]]'s statement that "The Russian propaganda machine has not gotten this much mileage out of a US citizen since [[Angela Davis]]'s murder trial in 1971."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]] (January 23, 2014), [https://www.amazon.com/The-Snowden-Operation-Greatest-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B00I0W61OY The Snowden Operation: Inside the West's Greatest Intelligence Disaster] ASIN:B00I0W61OY&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob Cesca]] objected to ''[[The New York Times]]'' failing to redact the name of an NSA employee and the specific location where an [[al Qaeda]] group was being targeted in a series of slides the paper made publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Cesca]] (January 27, 2014), [http://thedailybanter.com/2014/01/the-name-of-an-nsa-agent-exposed-in-poorly-redacted-snowden-document/ NSA Agent’s Identity Exposed in {{Sic|hide=y|Poorly|-}}Redacted Snowden Document] ''The Daily Banter]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian journalist [[Andrei Soldatov]] argued that Snowden's revelations had had negative consequences for internet freedom in Russia, as Russian authorities increased their own surveillance and regulation on the pretext of protecting the privacy of Russian users.   Snowden's name was invoked by Russian legislators who supported measures forcing platforms such as [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[Gmail]] and [[YouTube]] to locate their servers on Russian soil or install [[SORM]] black boxes on their servers so that Russian authorities could control them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Soldatov |first1=Andrei |last2=Borogan |first2=Irina |title=The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia's Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries |publisher=PublicAffairs |location=New York |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-61039-573-1 |chapter=The Snowden Affair |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=onIuCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195 |pages=195&amp;ndash;222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soldatov also contended that as a result of the disclosures, international support for having national governments take over the powers of the organizations involved in coordinating the Internet's global architectures had grown, which could lead to a Balkanization of the Internet that restricted free access to information.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Soldatov]] (January 8, 2014), [http://www.ej.ru/?a=note&amp;id=24044 ИТОГИ ГОДА. СПЕЦСЛУЖБЫ] ''ежедневный журнал'' (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation]] issued in October 2013, by [[ICANN]] and other organizations warned against "Internet fragmentation at a national level" and expressed "strong concern over the undermining of the trust and confidence of Internet users globally due to recent revelations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-07oct13-en.htm Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation] ''[[ICANN]]'' October 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, [[Freedom House]] said "[s]ome states are using the revelations of widespread surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) as an excuse to augment their own monitoring capabilities, frequently with little or no oversight, and often aimed at the political opposition and human rights activists."&lt;ref&gt;[https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2014/tightening-net-governments Tightening the Net: Governments Expand Online Controls] ''[[Freedom House]]'' Freedom on the Net 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Recession''' was a period of general economic decline observed in world markets during the late 2000s and early 2010s. The scale and timing of the recession varied from country to country.&lt;ref name=DPAD121912&gt;{{cite web |title = World Economic Situation and Prospects 2013 |url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/index.shtml |publisher = Development Policy and Analysis Division of the UN secretariat |accessdate = December 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UN011513&gt;{{cite book |title = World Economic Situation and Prospects 2013 |publisher = United Nations |isbn = 978-9211091663 |page = 200 |author = United Nations |edition = 1st |type = trade paperback |date = January 15, 2013 |quote = The global economy continues to struggle with post-crisis adjustments }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Monetary Fund]] concluded that the overall impact was the most severe since the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009"/&gt; The Great Recession stemmed from collapse of the United States real-estate market, in relation to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis of 2007 to 2008]] and U.S. [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2007 to 2009, though policies of other nations contributed also. According to the U.S. [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (the official arbiter of U.S. recessions) the US recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, thus extending over 19 months.&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;[https://www.nber.org/cycles/ US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925210636/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |date=September 25, 2008 }}, NBER, accessed August 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Recession resulted in the scarcity of valuable assets in the market economy and the collapse of the financial sector (banks) in the world economy. Some banks were bailed out by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;http://economics.mit.edu/files/1801&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slideplayer.com/slide/6075380/|title=The Macroeconomics of Asset Shortages -  ppt video online download|website=slideplayer.com|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recession was not felt equally around the world. Whereas most of the world's developed economies, particularly in North America and Europe, fell into a definitive recession, many of the newer developed economies suffered far less impact, particularly [[China]] and [[India]], whose economies grew substantially during this period.

==Terminology==
Two [[word sense|senses]] of the word "recession" exist: one sense referring broadly to "a period of reduced economic activity"&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster_recession"&gt;{{Citation |author = Merriam-Webster |title = headword "recession" |work = Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary online |url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recession |postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ongoing hardship; and the more precise sense used in [[economics]], which is [[operational definition|defined operationally]], referring specifically to the [[Inflection point|contraction phase]] of a [[business cycle]], with two or more consecutive quarters of [[GDP]] contraction. Under the academic definition, the recession ended in the United States in June or July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Gross]], [http://www.newsweek.com/id/206631?from=rss The Recession Is...

[[Robert Kuttner]] argues, “’The Great Recession,’ is a misnomer. We should stop using it. Recessions are mild dips in the business cycle that are either self-correcting or soon cured by modest fiscal or monetary stimulus. Because of the continuing deflationary trap, it would be more accurate to call this decade's stagnant economy The Lesser Depression or The Great Deflation."&lt;ref&gt;Kuttner, Robert. ''Debtors’ Prison: The Politics of Austerity Versus Possibility''. New York: Vintage Books, 2013, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Great Recession sidebar}}
The Great Recession met the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] criteria for being a [[global recession]] only in the single calendar year 2009.&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/04/22/whats-a-global-recession/|title=What's a Global Recession?|last=Davis|first=Bob|date=April 22, 2009|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/pdf/text.pdf |title = World Economic Outlook&amp;nbsp;— April 2009: Crisis and Recovery |format = PDF |work = Box 1.1 (page 11-14) |publisher = IMF |date = April 24, 2009 |accessdate = September 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That IMF definition requires a ''decline in annual real [[Gross world product|world GDP]] per{{nbhyph}}capita &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;''. Despite the fact that quarterly data are being used as [[recession]] definition criteria by all [[G-20 major economies|G20 members]], representing 85% of the [[Gross world product|world GDP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://g20.org/about-g20/g20-members/|title = G20 Members|publisher = G20.org|accessdate = January 15, 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150210155549/https://g20.org/about-g20/g20-members/|archivedate = February 10, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided—in the absence of a complete data set—not to declare/measure global recessions according to quarterly GDP data. The ''seasonally adjusted [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]{{nbhyph}}weighted real GDP'' for the G20{{nbhyph}}zone, however, is a good indicator for the world GDP, and it was measured to have suffered a direct [[quarter on quarter]] decline during the three quarters from Q3{{nbhyph}}2008 until Q1{{nbhyph}}2009,&lt;!-- 2008Q3 = -0.02%, 2008Q4 = -1.66%, 2009Q1 = -1.67% --&gt; which more accurately mark when the recession took place at the global level.&lt;ref name="stats.oecd.org"/&gt;

According  to the U.S. [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (the official arbiter of U.S. recessions) the recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, and thus extended over eighteen months.&lt;ref name="nber.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/12/01/nber-makes-it-official-recession-started-in-december-2007/ |work = The Wall Street Journal |title = NBER Makes It Official: Recession Started in December 2007 |date = December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The years leading up to the crisis were characterized by an exorbitant rise in asset prices and associated boom in economic demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/03/commodities |title = Oil prices: George Soros warns that speculators could trigger stock market crash |last = Wearden |first = Graeme |date = June 3, 2008 |publisher = The Guardian |accessdate = April 10, 2009 |location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the U.S. [[shadow banking system]] (i.e., non-depository financial institutions such as investment banks) had grown to rival the depository system yet was not subject to the same regulatory oversight, making it vulnerable to a [[bank run]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/business/economy/24panel.html|title=Greenspan Concedes Error on Regulation|last=Andrews|first=Edmund L.|date=October 24, 2008|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US mortgage-backed [[securities]], which had risks that were hard to assess, were marketed around the world, as they offered higher yields than U.S. government bonds. Many of these securities were backed by subprime mortgages, which collapsed in value when the U.S. housing bubble burst during 2006 and homeowners began to default on their mortgage payments in large numbers starting in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/14/global-recession-2009-oped-cx_nr_0115roubini.html |title = A Global Breakdown Of The Recession In 2009 |author = [[Nouriel Roubini]] |date = January 15, 2009 |work = Forbes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[subprime lending|sub-prime loan]] losses in 2007 began the crisis and exposed other risky loans and over-inflated asset prices. With loan losses mounting and the fall of [[Lehman Brothers]] on September 15, 2008, a major panic broke out on the inter-bank loan market. There was the equivalent of a bank run on the [[shadow banking system]],  resulting in many large and well established [[investment bank|investment]] and [[commercial bank|commercial]] banks in the United States and [[Europe]] suffering huge losses and even facing bankruptcy, resulting in massive public financial assistance (government bailouts).&lt;ref name="KrugmanGeithner1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/ |title = NYT-Paul Krugman-Geithner: Does He Pass The Test? |publisher = Nybooks.com |date = July 10, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global recession that followed resulted in a sharp drop in [[international trade]], rising [[unemployment]] and slumping commodity prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/01/news/economy/recession/index.htm?postversion=2008120112|title=It's official: Recession since Dec '07|last=Isidore|first=Chris|date=December 1, 2008|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several economists predicted that recovery might not appear until 2011 and that the recession would be the worst since the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/60822.html Congressional Budget Office compares downturn to Great Depression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303075017/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/60822.html |date=March 3, 2009 }}.

Governments and central banks responded with [[Fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy|monetary policies]] to stimulate national economies and reduce financial system risks. The recession has renewed interest in [[2008–09 Keynesian resurgence|Keynesian economic ideas]] on how to combat recessionary conditions.

===Panel reports===
The majority report provided by U.S. [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]], composed of six Democratic and four Republican appointees, reported its findings in January 2011. It concluded that "the crisis was avoidable and was caused by:
* Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve's failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages;
* Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk;
* An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis;
* Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels."&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/report/conclusions |title = Financial Crisis Inquiry Report-Conclusions-January 2011 |publisher = Fcic.law.stanford.edu |date = March 10, 2011 |accessdate = April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two Republican dissenting FCIC reports. One of them, signed by three Republican appointees, concluded that there were multiple causes. In his separate dissent to the majority and minority opinions of the FCIC, Commissioner [[Peter J. Wallison]] of the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI) primarily blamed U.S. housing policy, including the actions of [[Fannie Mae|Fannie]] &amp; [[Freddie Mac|Freddie]], for the crisis. He wrote: "When the bubble began to deflate in mid-2007, the low quality and high risk loans engendered by government policies failed in unprecedented numbers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_wallison_dissent.pdf |title = FCIC-Final Report Dissent of Wallison-January 2011 |format = PDF |date =  |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its "Declaration of the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy," dated November 15, 2008, leaders of the [[G20 major economies|Group of 20]] cited the following causes:
{{quote|During a period of strong global growth, growing capital flows, and prolonged stability earlier this decade, market participants sought higher yields without an adequate appreciation of the risks and failed to exercise proper due diligence. At the same time, weak underwriting standards, unsound risk management practices, increasingly complex and opaque financial products, and consequent excessive leverage combined to create vulnerabilities in the system. Policy-makers, regulators and supervisors, in some advanced countries, did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial markets, keep pace with financial innovation, or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic regulatory actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081115-1.html |title = Declaration of G20 |publisher = Whitehouse.gov |date =  |accessdate = February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Narratives===
[[File:U.S. Fixed Investment as Pct GDP.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|U.S. residential and non-residential investment fell relative to GDP during the crisis]]
There are several "narratives" attempting to place the causes of the recession into context, with overlapping elements. Five such narratives include:
# There was the equivalent of a [[bank run]] on the [[shadow banking system]], which includes investment banks and other non-depository financial entities. This system had grown to rival the depository system in scale yet was not subject to the same regulatory safeguards. Its failure disrupted the flow of credit to consumers and corporations.&lt;ref name="KrugmanGeithner1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frbatlanta.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.frbatlanta.org/news/CONFEREN/09fmc/gorton.pdf |title = Gary Gorton-NBER and Yale-Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand: Banking and the Panic of 2007-Updated May 2009 |format = PDF |date =  |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The U.S. economy was being driven by a housing bubble. When it burst, private residential investment (i.e., housing construction) fell by nearly four percent. GDP and consumption enabled by bubble-generated housing wealth also slowed. This created a gap in annual demand (GDP) of nearly $1 trillion. The U.S. government was unwilling to make up for this private sector shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/robert-samuelson-wants-people-to-be-unemployed-the-economics-of-the-economics-of-the-great-recession |title = CEPR-Dean Baker-The Economics of the Great Recession-June 29, 2014 |publisher = Cepr.net |date = June 29, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/learned-macroeconomic-helplessness/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog+Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body|title=Learned Macroeconomic Helplessness|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Record levels of [[household debt]] accumulated in the decades preceding the crisis resulted in a [[balance sheet recession]] (similar to [[debt deflation]]) once housing prices began falling in 2006. Consumers began paying off debt, which reduces their consumption, slowing down the economy for an extended period while debt levels are reduced.&lt;ref name="KrugmanGeithner1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mian and Sufi2014"&gt;{{cite book |last = Mian, Atif and |first = Sufi, Amir |year = 2014 |title = [[House of Debt]] |publisher = University of Chicago |isbn = 978-0-226-08194-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# U.S. government policies encouraged home ownership even for those who could not afford it, contributing to lax lending standards, unsustainable housing price increases, and indebtedness.&lt;ref name="Sowell 2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Housing Boom and Bust]]|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|publisher=Basic Books|year=2009|isbn=978-0-465-01880-2|pages=57–58|authorlink=Thomas Sowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Wealthy and middle-class [[flipping|house flippers]] with mid-to-good credit scores created a [[Economic bubble|speculative bubble]] in house prices, and then wrecked local housing markets and financial institutions after they defaulted on their debt en masse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1064061/house-flippers-triggered-the-us-housing-market-crash-not-poor-subprime-borrowers-a-new-study-shows/|title=House flippers triggered the US housing market crash, not poor subprime borrowers|first=Gwynn|last=Guilford|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underlying narratives #1-3 is a hypothesis that growing [[Income inequality in the United States|income inequality]] and [[Household income in the United States|wage stagnation]] encouraged families to increase their [[household debt]] to maintain their desired living standard, fueling the bubble. Further, this greater share of income flowing to the top increased the political power of business interests, who used that power to [[Deregulation|deregulate]] or limit regulation of the shadow banking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/cas/economics/pdf/upload/2012-1.pdf|title=Jon Wisman-Wage Stagnation, Rising Inequality and the Crisis of 2008-Retrieved June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10268.pdf|title=IMF-Inequality, Leverage and Crises-Kumhoff and Ranciere-November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_251-300/WP282.pdf|title=Stockhammer-Rising Inequality as a Cause of the Present Crisis-Amherst PERI-April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative #5 challenges the popular claim that subprime borrowers with shoddy credit caused the crisis by buying homes they couldn't afford.  This narrative is supported by new research showing that the biggest growth of mortgage debt during the U.S. housing boom came from those with good credit scores in the middle and top of the credit score distribution—and that these borrowers accounted for a disproportionate share of defaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/articles/rethinking-how-the-housing-crisis-happened/|title=Rethinking how the housing crisis happened|website=mitsloan.mit.edu|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade imbalances and debt bubbles===
[[File:US Private Debt to GDP by Sector.png|thumb|upright=1.6|right|U.S. households and financial businesses significantly increased borrowing (leverage) in the years leading up to the crisis]]
''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in July 2012 that the inflow of investment dollars required to fund the U.S. trade deficit was a major cause of the housing bubble and financial crisis: "The trade deficit, less than 1% of GDP in the early 1990s, hit 6% in 2006. That deficit was financed by inflows of foreign savings, in particular from East Asia and the Middle East. Much of that money went into dodgy mortgages to buy overvalued houses, and the financial crisis was the result."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.economist.com/node/21558591 |title = The Economist-Points of Light-July 14, 2012 |publisher = Economist.com |date = July 14, 2012 |accessdate = April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, NPR explained in their [[Peabody Award]] winning program "[[The Giant Pool of Money]]" that a vast inflow of savings from developing nations flowed into the mortgage market, driving the U.S. housing bubble. This pool of fixed income savings increased from around $35 trillion in 2000 to about $70 trillion by 2008. NPR explained this money came from various sources, "[b]ut the main headline is that all sorts of poor countries became kind of rich, making things like TVs and selling us oil. China, India, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia made a lot of money and banked it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/transcript |title = NPR-This American Life-The Giant Pool of Money-May 2008 |publisher = Thisamericanlife.org |date =  |accessdate = April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the crisis in Europe, [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in February 2012 that: "What we're basically looking at, then, is a balance of payments problem, in which capital flooded south after the creation of the euro, leading to overvaluation in southern Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/european-crisis-realities/ |title = NYT-Paul Krugman-European Crisis Realities-February 2012 |publisher = Krugman.blogs.nytimes.com |date = February 25, 2012 |accessdate = April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monetary policy===
Another narrative about the origin has been focused on the respective parts played by the public monetary policy (in the US notably) and by the practices of private financial institutions.  In the U.S., mortgage funding was unusually decentralised, opaque, and competitive, and it is believed that competition between lenders for revenue and market share contributed to declining underwriting standards and risky lending.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

While Alan Greenspan's role as [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] has been widely discussed (the main point of controversy remains the lowering of the [[Federal funds rate]] to 1% for more than a year, which, according to [[Austrian School|Austrian theorists]], injected huge amounts of "easy" credit-based money into the financial system and created an unsustainable economic boom),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Polleit |first = Thorsten |url = https://mises.org/story/2810 |title = Manipulating the Interest Rate: a Recipe for Disaster |publisher = Mises Institute |date = December 13, 2007 |accessdate = January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is also the argument that Greenspan's actions in the years 2002–2004 were actually motivated by the need to take the U.S. economy out of the [[early 2000s recession]] caused by the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]]—although by doing so he did not help avert the crisis, but only postpone it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Ann |last = Pettifor |url = http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/america-s-financial-meltdown-lessons-and-prospects |title = America's financial meltdown: lessons and prospects |publisher = openDemocracy |date = September 16, 2008 |accessdate = January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mises.org/story/1670|title=America's Unsustainable Boom|last=Karlsson|first=Stefan|date=November 8, 2004|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=January 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High private debt levels===
[[File:U.S. Household Debt Relative to Disposable Income and GDP.png|thumb|upright=1.15|US household debt relative to disposable income and GDP.]]
[[File:Change in household debt - v1.png|thumb|upright=1.15|right|U.S. Changes in Household Debt as a percentage of GDP for 1989-2016.  Homeowners paying down debt for 2009-2012 was a headwind to the recovery.

Another narrative focuses on high levels of private debt in the US economy.  USA [[household debt]] as a percentage of annual [[disposable personal income]] was 127% at the end of 2007, versus 77% in 1990.&lt;ref name="The End of the Affair"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12637090 |title = The End of the Affair |publisher = Economist |date = October 30, 2008 |accessdate = February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/opinion/13krugman.html|title=Opinion - Block Those Economic Metaphors|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=December 12, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with increasing mortgage payments as their adjustable rate mortgage payments increased, households began to default in record numbers, rendering mortgage-backed securities worthless.

The IMF reported in April 2012: "Household debt soared in the years leading up to the downturn. In advanced economies, during the five years preceding 2007, the ratio of household debt to income rose by an average of 39 percentage points, to 138 percent. In Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway, debt peaked at more than 200 percent of household income. A surge in household debt to historic highs also occurred in emerging economies such as Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Lithuania. The concurrent boom in both house prices and the stock market meant that household debt relative to assets held broadly stable, which masked households' growing exposure to a sharp fall in asset prices. When house prices declined, ushering in the global financial crisis, many households saw their wealth shrink relative to their debt, and, with less income and more unemployment, found it harder to meet mortgage payments. By the end of 2011, real house prices had fallen from their peak by about 41% in Ireland, 29% in Iceland, 23% in Spain and the United States, and 21% in Denmark. Household defaults, underwater mortgages (where the loan balance exceeds the house value), foreclosures, and fire sales are now endemic to a number of economies. Household [[deleveraging]] by paying off debts or defaulting on them has begun in some countries. It has been most pronounced in the United States, where about two-thirds of the debt reduction reflects defaults."&lt;ref name="imf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/pdf/c3.pdf|title=IMF-Report Extract Chapter 3&amp;nbsp;– April 2012|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/financial_markets/debt_and_deleveraging_the_global_credit_bubble_update |title = McKinsey-Debt and deleveraging: The global credit bubble and its economic consequences-Updated-July 2011 |publisher = Mckinsey.com |date = March 13, 2013 |accessdate = August 17, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130307011351/http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/financial_markets/debt_and_deleveraging_the_global_credit_bubble_update |archive-date = March 7, 2013 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-recession warnings===
The onset of the economic crisis took most people by surprise. A 2009 paper identifies twelve economists and commentators who, between 2000 and 2006, predicted a recession based on the collapse of the then-booming housing market in the United States:&lt;ref name="Bezemer"&gt;Dirk J Bezemer: ''"No One Saw This Coming" Understanding Financial Crisis Through Accounting Models'', available via: [http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/15892/1/MPRA_paper_15892.pdf MPRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906094437/http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/15892/1/MPRA_paper_15892.pdf |date=September 6, 2015 }}, esp. p. 9 and appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Baker]], [[Wynne Godley]], [[Fred Harrison (author)|Fred Harrison]], [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]], [[Eric Janszen]], [[Med Jones]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DvEDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=rational+investing+med+jones#v=onepage&amp;q=rational%20investing%20med%20jones |title=Columbia University Press, Rational Investing Book, Page 61-62 What Can Be Forecasted}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Keen]], [[Jakob Broechner Madsen|Jakob Brøchner Madsen]], Jens Kjaer Sørensen, [[Kurt Richebächer]], [[Nouriel Roubini]], [[Peter Schiff]], and [[Robert Shiller]].&lt;ref name="Bezemer"/&gt;

===Housing bubbles===
[[File:FCIC - Housing Bubbles in Multiple Countries 2002-2008.png|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Housing price appreciation in selected countries, 2002–2008]]
{{further|Real estate bubble}}
By 2007, real estate bubbles were still under way in many parts of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://lvrg.org.au/blog/2009/06/from-subprime-to-terrigenous-recession.html |title = From the subprime to the terrigenous: Recession begins at home |publisher = Land Values Research Group |date = June 2, 2009 }} (A survey of recessions or expected recessions in 40 countries, 33 of which arguably had property bubbles.)&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the [[United States housing bubble|United States]],&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]], [[British property bubble|United Kingdom]], [[Spanish property bubble|Spain]], [[The Netherlands]], [[Australia]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[New Zealand property bubble|New Zealand]], [[Irish property bubble|Ireland]], [[Polish property bubble|Poland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Poland/Price-History |title = The end of Poland's house price boom |publisher = Global Property Guide |date = August 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Africa]], [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Croatia/Price-History |title = Real estate prices in Adriatic Coast up, Zagreb down |publisher = Global Property Guide |date = August 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norway]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Latin-America/Argentina/Price-History |title = The good times are here again |publisher = Global Property Guide |date = February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baltic states]], [[India]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Asia/China/Price-History |title = Looming housing slump in China |publisher = Global Property Guide |date = September 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] said in mid-2005 that "at a minimum, there's a little 'froth' [in the U.S. housing market]...it's hard not to see that there are a lot of local bubbles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/25track.ready.html |title = 2005: In a Word |author = Monica Davey |publisher = New York Times |date = December 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'', writing at the same time, went further, saying, "[T]he worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4079027 |title = The global housing boom |date = June 16, 2005 |publisher = The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate bubbles are (by definition of the word "bubble") followed by a price decrease (also known as a ''housing price crash'') that can result in many owners holding [[negative equity]] (a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] debt higher than the current value of the property).

===Increases in uncertainty===
Increases in uncertainty can depress investment, or consumption. The 2007–2009 recession represents the most striking episode of heightened uncertainty since 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jurado|first=Kyle|last2=Ludvigson|first2=Sydney C.|last3=Ng|first3=Serena|year=2015|title=Measuring Uncertainty|journal=[[American Economic Review]]|volume=105|issue=3|pages=1177–1216|doi=10.1257/aer.20131193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/12901/longrunrisk.pdf |title = Growth-Rate and Uncertainty Shocks in Consumption: Cross-Country Evidence |first = Emi |last = Nakamura |first2 = Dmitriy |last2 = Sergeyev |first3 = Jón |last3 = Steinsson |work = |year = 2015 |ssrn = 2079921 |accessdate = March 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ineffective or inappropriate regulation===

====Regulations encouraging lax lending standards====
Several analysts, such as Peter Wallison and Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, have asserted that private lenders were encouraged to relax lending standards by government affordable housing policies.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Wallison, "Cause and Effect: Government Policies and the Financial Crisis", Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Statement of Edward Pinto, December 9, 2008, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, which initially required that 30 percent or more of Fannie's and Freddie's loan purchases be related to affordable housing. The legislation gave HUD the power to set future requirements, and eventually (under the Bush Administration){{which?|date=December 2018|text=which Bush administration?}} a 56 percent minimum was established.&lt;ref name="Wallison 1"&gt;{{cite web |author = Peter J. Wallison |title = Dissent from the Majority Report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission |publisher = American Enterprise Institute |date = January 2011 |url = http://www.aei.org |accessdate = November 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfil the requirements, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac established programs to purchase $5 trillion in affordable housing loans,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged lenders to relax underwriting standards to produce those loans.&lt;ref name="Wallison 1"/&gt;

These critics also cite, as inappropriate regulation, "The National Homeownership Strategy: Partners in the American Dream ("Strategy"), which was compiled in 1995 by Henry Cisneros, President Clinton's HUD Secretary. In 2001, the independent research company, Graham Fisher &amp; Company, stated: "While the underlying initiatives of the [Strategy] were broad in content, the main theme ... was the relaxation of credit standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Housing in the New Millennium: A Home without Equity Is Just a Rental with Debt |publisher = Ssrn.com |author = Graham Fisher |date = June 29, 2001 |ssrn = 1162456 |accessdate = November 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is also identified as one of the causes of the recession, by some critics. They contend that lenders relaxed lending standards in an effort to meet CRA commitments, and they note that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) concluded that Fannie &amp; Freddie "were not a primary cause" of the crisis and that CRA was not a factor in the crisis.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt; Further, since housing bubbles appeared in multiple countries in Europe as well, the FCIC Republican minority dissenting report also concluded that U.S. housing policies were not a robust explanation for a wider global housing bubble.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;  The view that U.S. government housing policy was a primary cause of the crisis has been widely disputed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Examining the Big Lie |publisher = The Big Picture |author = Barry Ritholtz |date = November 26, 2011 |url = http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/11/examining-the-big-lie-how-the-facts-of-the-economic-crisis-stack-up/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Paul Krugman]] referring to it as "imaginary history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Triumph of the Wrong |publisher = The New York Times |author = Paul Krugman |date = November 6, 2014 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/opinion/paul-krugman-triumph-of-the-wrong.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Derivatives====
Several sources have noted the failure of the US government to supervise or even require transparency of the [[financial instruments]] known as [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/warning/ The Warning]| Frontline&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=devils/&gt;&lt;ref name=faiola/&gt; Derivatives such as [[credit default swap]]s (CDSs) were unregulated or barely regulated. [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] noted CDSs enabled speculators to stack bets on the same mortgage securities. This is analogous to allowing many persons to buy insurance on the same house. Speculators that bought CDS protection were betting significant mortgage security defaults would occur, while the sellers (such as [[AIG]]) bet they would not.

A 2008 investigative article in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' found leading government officials at the time (Federal Reserve Board Chairman  [[Alan Greenspan]], Treasury Secretary [[Robert Rubin]], and [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] Chairman [[Arthur Levitt]])  vehemently opposed any regulation of derivatives. In 1998, [[Brooksley E. Born]], head of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], put forth a policy paper asking for feedback from regulators, lobbyists, and legislators on the question of whether derivatives should be reported, sold through a central facility, or whether capital requirements should be required of their buyers. Greenspan, Rubin, and Levitt pressured her to withdraw the paper and Greenspan persuaded [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass a resolution preventing CFTC from regulating derivatives for another six months&amp;nbsp;— when Born's term of office would expire.&lt;ref name=devils&gt;[[Bethany McLean]] and [[Joe Nocera]], ''[[All the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis]]'' Portfolio, Penguin, 2010, p.104-7&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, it was the collapse of a specific kind of derivative, the [[mortgage-backed security]], that triggered the economic crisis of 2008.&lt;ref name="faiola"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/14/AR2008101403343.html|title=What Went Wrong|date=October 15, 2008|publisher=The Washington Post|authors=Anthony Faiola, Ellen Nakashima and Jill Drew|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shadow banking system====
[[File:Securitization Market Activity.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Securitization markets were impaired during the crisis.]]

[[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2009 that the [[bank run|run]] on the [[shadow banking system]] was the fundamental cause the crisis. "As the shadow banking system expanded to rival or even surpass conventional banking in importance, politicians and government officials should have realised that they were re-creating the kind of financial vulnerability that made the Great Depression possible&amp;nbsp;– and they should have responded by extending regulations and the financial safety net to cover these new institutions. Influential figures should have proclaimed a simple rule: anything that does what a bank does, anything that has to be rescued in crises the way banks are, should be regulated like a bank." He referred to this lack of controls as "malign neglect".&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last = Krugman |first = Paul |authorlink = Paul Krugman |year = 2009 |title = [[The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008]] |publisher = W.W.

During 2008, three of the largest U.S. investment banks either went bankrupt ([[Lehman Brothers]]) or were sold at [[fire sale]] prices to other banks ([[Bear Stearns]] and [[Merrill Lynch]]). The investment banks were not subject to the more stringent regulations applied to depository banks. These failures exacerbated the instability in the global financial system. The remaining two investment banks, [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Goldman Sachs]], potentially facing failure, opted to become commercial banks, thereby subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation but receiving access to credit via the Federal Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html|title=Agency's '04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt, and Risk|last=Labaton|first=Stephen|date=October 3, 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/09/28/business/20080928-SEC-multimedia/index.html|title=The Day the S.E.C.

AIG was contractually required to post additional collateral with many creditors and counter-parties, touching off controversy when over $100&amp;nbsp;billion of U.S. taxpayer money was paid out to major global financial institutions on behalf of AIG. While this money was legally owed to the banks by AIG (under agreements made via credit default swaps purchased from AIG by the institutions), a number of Congressmen and media members expressed outrage that taxpayer money was used to bail out banks.&lt;ref name="Scott Lanman" /&gt;

Economist [[Gary Gorton]] wrote in May 2009: {{quote|Unlike the historical banking panics of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the current banking panic is a wholesale panic, not a retail panic. In the earlier episodes, depositors ran to their banks and demanded cash in exchange for their checking accounts. Unable to meet those demands, the banking system became insolvent. The current panic involved financial firms "running" on other financial firms by not renewing sale and repurchase agreements (repo) or increasing the repo margin ("haircut"), forcing massive deleveraging, and resulting in the banking system being insolvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.frbatlanta.org/news/CONFEREN/09fmc/gorton.pdf |title = Gary Gorton-NBER and Yale-Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand: Banking and the Panic of 2007-Updated May 2009 |format = PDF |date =  |accessdate = April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] reported in January 2011: {{quote|In the early part of the 20th century, we erected a series of protections&amp;nbsp;– the Federal Reserve as a [[lender of last resort]], federal deposit insurance, ample regulations&amp;nbsp;– to provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued America's banking system in the 19th century. Yet, over the past 30-plus years, we permitted the growth of a shadow banking system&amp;nbsp;– opaque and laden with short term debt&amp;nbsp;– that rivaled the size of the traditional banking system. Key components of the market&amp;nbsp;– for example, the multitrillion-dollar repo lending market, off-balance-sheet entities, and the use of over-the-counter derivatives&amp;nbsp;– were hidden from view, without the protections we had constructed to prevent financial meltdowns. We had a 21st-century financial system with 19th-century safeguards.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;}}

===Systemic crisis===
The financial crisis and the recession have been described as a symptom of another, deeper crisis by a number of economists. For example, [[Ravi Batra]] argues that growing inequality of [[financial capitalism]] produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major [[The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism|political changes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Batra |first = Ravi |url = http://www.truthout.org/weapons-mass-exploitation/1304696645 |title = Weapons of Mass Exploitation? |publisher = Truthout.org |date = May 8, 2011 |accessdate = June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Batra |first = Ravi |url = http://www.askbutwhy.com/2011/04/ravi-batra-on-thom-hartmann-show-04-29.html |title = Ravi Batra interview |publisher = Thom Hartman's radio show (at 1:15) |date = April 29, 2011 |accessdate = June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist economists [[Ailsa McKay]] and [[Margunn Bjørnholt]] argue that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within [[feminist economics]] and [[ecological economics]] that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Advances-in-Feminist-Economics-in-Times-of-Economic-Crisis.pdf|title=Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics|last2=McKay|first2=Ailsa|publisher=[[Demeter Press]]|year=2014|isbn=9781927335277|pages=7–20|chapter=Advances in Feminist Economics in Times of Economic Crisis|format=PDF|last1=Bjørnholt|first1=Margunn|author1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt|author2-link=Ailsa McKay|editor1-last=Bjørnholt|editor1-first=Margunn|editor1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt|editor2-last=McKay|editor2-first=Ailsa|editor2-link=Ailsa McKay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on the United States===
[[File:U.S. economic recovery scorecard.png|thumb|right|300px|Several major U.S. economic variables had recovered from the 2007-2009 [[Subprime mortgage crisis]] and Great Recession by the 2013-2014 time period.]]

{{Further|Great Recession in the United States|Unemployment in the United States|National debt of the United States}}
The Great Recession had a significant economic and political impact on the United States.  While the recession technically lasted from December 2007-June 2009 (the nominal GDP trough), many important economic variables did not regain pre-recession (November or Q4 2007) levels until 2011-2016. For example, real GDP fell $650 billion (4.3%) and did not recover its $15 trillion pre-recession level until Q3 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1  FRED-Real GDP-Retrieved July 7, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;  Household net worth, which reflects the value of both stock markets and housing prices, fell $11.5 trillion (17.3%) and did not regain its pre-recession level of $66.4 trillion until Q3 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TNWBSHNO FRED-Household and Non-profit net worth]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of persons with jobs (total non-farm payrolls) fell 8.6 million (6.2%) and did not regain the pre-recession level of 138.3 million until May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[ https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS FRED-All Employees Total Nonfarm Payrolls-Retrieved July 7, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;  The unemployment rate peaked at 10.0% in October 2009 and did not return to its pre-recession level of 4.7% until May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE FRED-Unemployment Rate-Retrieved July 7, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key dynamic slowing the recovery was that both individuals and businesses paid down debts for several years, as opposed to borrowing and spending or investing as had historically been the case. This shift to a [[Sectoral balances|private sector surplus]] drove a sizable government deficit.&lt;ref name="NPI"&gt;[https://www.npi.org.uk/blog/economic-policy/united-states-sector-balances-over-five-decades/ New Policy Institute-United States Sectoral Balances over Five Decades-July 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the federal government held spending at about $3.5 trillion from fiscal years 2009-2014 (thereby decreasing it as a percent of GDP), a form of austerity. Then-Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] explained during November 2012 several of the economic headwinds that slowed the recovery:
*The housing sector did not rebound, as was the case in prior recession recoveries, as the sector was severely damaged during the crisis. Millions of foreclosures had created a large surplus of properties and consumers were paying down their debts rather than purchasing homes.
*Credit for borrowing and spending by individuals (or investing by corporations) was not readily available as banks paid down their debts.
*Restrained government spending following initial stimulus efforts (i.e., austerity) was not sufficient to offset private sector weaknesses.&lt;ref name="Bernanke_Recovery"&gt;[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20121120a.htm Federal Reserve-Ben Bernanke-The Economic Recovery and Economic Policy-November 20, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the political front, widespread anger at [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|banking bailouts]] and [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus]] measures (begun by President [[George W. Bush]] and continued or expanded by President Obama) with few consequences for banking leadership, were a factor in driving the country politically rightward starting in 2010. Examples include the rise of the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] and the loss of Democratic majorities in subsequent elections. President Obama declared the bailout measures started under the Bush administration and continued during his administration as completed and mostly profitable {{as of|2014|December|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/20/business/us-signals-end-of-bailouts-of-automakers-and-wall-street.html New York Times-U.S. Declares Bank and Auto Bailouts Over, and Profitable-December 19, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2018|January|}}, bailout funds had been fully recovered by the government, when interest on loans is taken into consideration.

===Effects on Europe===
{{Further|European debt crisis|Austerity}}
[[File:Eurozone Countries Public Debt to GDP Ratio 2010 vs. 2011.png|right|thumb|Public Debt to GDP Ratio for Selected European Countries - 2008 to 2011. Source Data: Eurostat]]
[[File:Eurozone-structural1.jpg|thumb|Relationship between fiscal tightening (austerity) in [[Eurozone countries]] with their GDP growth rate, 2008–2012&lt;ref name=martin/&gt;]]
The crisis in Europe generally progressed from banking system crises to sovereign debt crises, as many countries elected to bail out their banking systems using taxpayer money. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Greece was different in that it faced large public debts rather than problems within its banking system. Several countries received bailout packages from the [[European troika|troika]] (European Commission, European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund), which also implemented a series of emergency measures.

Many European countries embarked on austerity programs, reducing their budget deficits relative to GDP from 2010 to 2011. For example, according to the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' Greece improved its budget deficit from 10.4% GDP in 2010 to 9.6% in 2011. Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, France, and Spain also improved their budget deficits from 2010 to 2011 relative to GDP.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html |title = CIA World Factbook-Greece Example |publisher = Cia.gov |date =  |accessdate = August 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurostat1"&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/euroindicators/peeis Eurostat-Selected Principal European Economic Indicators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119182304/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/euroindicators/peeis/ |date=January 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the exception of Germany, each of these countries had public-debt-to-GDP ratios that increased (i.e., worsened) from 2010 to 2011, as indicated in the chart at right. Greece's public-debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 143% in 2010 to 165% in 2011&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;  to 185% in 2014. This indicates that despite improving budget deficits, GDP growth was not sufficient to support a decline (improvement) in the debt-to-GDP ratio for these countries during this period. [[Eurostat]] reported that the debt to GDP ratio for the 17 Euro area countries together was 70.1% in 2008, 79.9% in 2009, 85.3% in 2010, and 87.2% in 2011.&lt;ref name="Eurostat1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-23042012-AP/EN/2-23042012-AP-EN.PDF |title=Eurostat News Release-Euro indicators-23 April 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919121523/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-23042012-AP/EN/2-23042012-AP-EN.PDF |archivedate=September 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''CIA World Factbook'', from 2010 to 2011, the unemployment rates in Spain, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and the UK increased. France had no significant changes, while in Germany and Iceland the unemployment rate declined.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; Eurostat reported that Eurozone unemployment reached record levels in September 2012 at 11.6%, up from 10.3% the prior year. Unemployment varied significantly by country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Smith |first = Aaron |url = http://money.cnn.com/2012/10/31/news/economy/euro-unemployment/index.html |title = Eurozone unemployment hits record high |publisher = Money.cnn.com |date = October 31, 2012 |accessdate = August 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Martin Wolf]] analysed the relationship between cumulative GDP growth from 2008-2012 and total reduction in budget deficits due to austerity policies (see chart at right) in several European countries during April 2012. He concluded that: "In all, there is no evidence here that large fiscal contractions [budget deficit reductions] bring benefits to confidence and growth that offset the direct effects of the contractions. They bring exactly what one would expect: small contractions bring recessions and big contractions bring depressions." Changes in budget balances (deficits or surpluses) [[Coefficient of determination|explained]] approximately 53% of the change in GDP, according to the equation derived from the IMF data used in his analysis.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.ft.com/martin-wolf-exchange/2012/04/27/the-impact-of-fiscal-austerity-in-the-eurozone/ |first = Martin |last = Wolf |title = The Impact of Fiscal Austerity in the Eurozone |publisher = Blogs.ft.com |date = April 27, 2012 |accessdate = August 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] analysed the relationship between GDP and reduction in budget deficits for several European countries in April 2012 and concluded that austerity was slowing growth, similar to Martin Wolf. He also wrote: "...&amp;nbsp;this also implies that 1 euro of austerity yields only about 0.4 euros of reduced deficit, even in the short run. No wonder, then, that the whole austerity enterprise is spiraling into disaster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/austerity-and-growth-again-wonkish/|title=Austerity And Growth, Again (Wonkish)|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poland]] and [[Slovakia]] are the only two members of the [[European Union]] to have avoided a GDP recession during the years affected by the Great Recession.

The financial crisis did not affect developing countries to a great extent. Experts see several reasons: Africa was not affected because it is not fully integrated in the world market. Latin America and Asia seemed better prepared, since they have experienced crises before. In Latin America, for example, banking laws and regulations are very stringent. Bruno Wenn of the German DEG suggests that Western countries could learn from these countries when it comes to regulations of financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Exceedingly high interest rates |author = Bruno Wenn |publisher = dandc.eu |date = January 2013 |url = http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/european-bank-regulators-would-do-well-learn-their-latin-american-counterparts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland fell into an economic depression in 2008 following the collapse of its banking system (''see [[2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis]]'').

==Political instability related to the economic crisis==
On February 26, 2009, an Economic Intelligence Briefing was added to the [[President's Daily Brief|daily intelligence briefings]] prepared for the [[President of the United States]]. This addition reflects the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that the global financial crisis presents a serious threat to international stability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/25/AR2009022503389.html "CIA Adds Economy To Threat Updates] White House Given First Daily Briefing" article by Joby Warrick, Washington Post Staff Writer, Thursday, February 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have argued that the economic stasis triggered social churning that got expressed through protests on a variety of issues across the developing world. In Brazil, disaffected youth rallied against a minor bus-fare hike;&lt;ref name="nytReport"&gt;Romero, Simon. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/world/americas/bus-fare-protests-hit-brazils-two-biggest-cities.html "Bus-fare protests hit Brazil's two biggest cities"],  [[The New York Times]], June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; in Turkey, they agitated against the conversion of a park to a mall&lt;ref name="guardianReport"&gt;Letsch, Constanze. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/istanbul-protesters-violent-clashes-police "Turkey protests spread after violence in Istanbul over park demolition"],  [[The Guardian]], May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Israel, they protested against high rents in Tel Aviv. In all these cases, the ostensible immediate cause of the protest was amplified by the underlying social suffering induced by the great recession.

In January 2009, the government leaders of Iceland were forced to call elections two years early after the people of Iceland staged mass protests and clashed with the police because of the government's handling of the economy.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt; Hundreds of thousands protested in France against President Sarkozy's economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/29/europe/france.4-418938.php|title=The New York Times&amp;nbsp;– Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|last=Dobbs|first=David|date=|publisher=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=April 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228220508/http://iht.com/articles/2009/01/29/europe/france.4-418938.php|archivedate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prompted by the financial crisis in Latvia, the opposition and trade unions there organised a rally against the cabinet of premier Ivars Godmanis. The rally gathered some 10–20 thousand people. In the evening the rally turned into a [[2009 Riga riot|Riot]]. The crowd moved to the building of the parliament and attempted to force their way into it, but were repelled by the state's police. In late February many Greeks took part in a massive general strike because of the economic situation and they shut down schools, airports, and many other services in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Maltezou |first = Renee |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSLP45582720090225 |title = Greeks shut airports, services to protest economy |publisher = Reuters |date = February 25, 2009 |accessdate = May 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police and protesters  clashed in Lithuania where people protesting the economic conditions were shot with rubber bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Megan K.

In addition to various levels of unrest in Europe, Asian countries have also seen various degrees of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Ian Traynor, Europe editor |url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/31/global-recession-europe-protests |title = Governments across Europe tremble as effects of global recession prompt angry people to take to the streets |work = The Guardian |date = January 31, 2009 |accessdate = May 15, 2012 |location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests have also occurred in China as demands from the west for exports have been dramatically reduced and unemployment has increased. Beyond these initial protests, the protest movement has grown and continued in 2011. In late 2011, the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protest took place in the United States, spawning several offshoots that came to be known as the [[Occupy movement]].

In 2012 the economic difficulties in Spain increased support for secession movements. In Catalonia, support for the [[Catalan separatism|secession movement]] exceeded.

The [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial phase of the crisis]] led to emergency interventions in many national financial systems. As the crisis developed into genuine recession in many major economies, economic stimulus meant to revive economic growth became the most common policy tool. After having implemented rescue plans for the banking system, major developed and emerging countries announced plans to relieve their economies. In particular, economic stimulus plans were announced in [[Chinese economic stimulus program|China]], the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|United States]], and the [[2008 European Union stimulus plan|European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2008/gb20081126_365422.htm|title=EU Proposes €200 Billion Stimulus Plan|date=November 26, 2008|work=Businessweek|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final quarter of 2008, the financial crisis saw the [[G-20 major economies|G-20 group of major economies]] assume a new significance as a focus of economic and financial crisis management.

The stimulus package was invested in key areas such as housing, rural infrastructure, transportation, health and education, environment, industry, disaster rebuilding, income-building, tax cuts, and finance.

China's export driven economy is starting to feel the impact of the economic slowdown in the United States and Europe, and the government has already cut key interest rates three times in less than two months in a bid to spur economic expansion. On November 28, 2008, the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China]] and the [[State Administration of Taxation]] jointly announced a rise in export tax rebate rates on some labour-intensive goods. These additional tax rebates will take place on December 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news |url = http://www.asia-manufacturing.com/news-232-chinesepharmaceutical-exporters-taxrebates-increases.html |title = Chinese pharmaceutical exporters to benefit from latest tax rebates increases |publisher = [[Asia Manufacturing Pharma]] |date = December 1, 2008 |accessdate = December 1, 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20081211112023/http://www.asia-manufacturing.com/news-232-chinesepharmaceutical-exporters-taxrebates-increases.html |archivedate = December 11, 2008 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stimulus package was welcomed by world leaders and analysts as larger than expected and a sign that by boosting its own economy, China is helping to stabilise the global economy. News of the announcement of the stimulus package sent markets up across the world. However, [[Marc Faber]] claimed that he thought China was still in recession on January 16.

In Taiwan, the central bank on September 16, 2008, said it would cut its required reserve ratios for the first time in eight years. The central bank added $3.59 billion into the foreign-currency interbank market the same day. Bank of Japan pumped $29.3 billion into the financial system on September 17, 2008, and the Reserve Bank of Australia added $3.45 billion the same day.&lt;ref name="World_Banks"&gt;{{Cite news |title = Germany Rescues Hypo Real Estate |url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3692522,00.html |publisher = [[Deutsche Welle]] |date = October 6, 2008 |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing and emerging economies, responses to the global crisis mainly consisted in low-rates monetary policy (Asia and the Middle East mainly) coupled with the depreciation of the currency against the dollar. There were also stimulus plans in some Asian countries, in the Middle East and in Argentina. In Asia, plans generally amounted to 1 to 3% of GDP, with the notable exception of [[Chinese economic stimulus plan|China]], which announced a plan accounting for 16% of GDP (6% of GDP per year).

===European policy responses===
Until September 2008, European policy measures were limited to a small number of countries (Spain and Italy). In both countries, the measures were dedicated to households (tax rebates) reform of the taxation system to support specific sectors such as housing. The European Commission proposed a [[2008 European Union stimulus plan|€200 billion stimulus plan]] to be implemented at the European level by the countries. At the beginning of 2009, the UK and Spain completed their initial plans, while Germany announced a new plan.

On September 29, 2008, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch authorities partially nationalised [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]]. The German government bailed out [[Hypo Real Estate]].

On October 8, 2008, the British Government announced a [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|bank rescue package]] of around £500 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/gordon-brown/4961897/Gordon-Brown-should-say-sorry-over-economy-minister-says.html |title=Gordon Brown should say 'sorry' |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=March 9, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2009 |location=London }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; ($850 billion at the time). The plan comprises three parts. The first £200 billion would be made in regard to the banks in liquidity stack. The second part will consist of the state government increasing the capital market within the banks. Along with this, £50&amp;nbsp;billion will be made available if the banks needed it, finally the government will write off any eligible lending between the British banks with a limit to £250 billion.

In early December 2008, German Finance Minister [[Peer Steinbrück]] indicated a lack of belief in a "Great Rescue Plan" and reluctance to spend more money addressing the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/172613 |title = It Doesn't Exist! |publisher = Newsweek.com |date = December 6, 2008 |accessdate = December 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, The European Union Presidency confirmed that the EU was at the time strongly resisting the US pressure to increase European budget deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Waterfield |first = Bruno |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/5048291/EU-presidency-US-and-UK-economic-recovery-plans-are-a-way-to-hell.html |title = EU resists deficits |publisher = Telegraph.co.uk |date = March 25, 2009 |accessdate = January 21, 2010 |location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010, the United Kingdom began a fiscal consolidation program to reduce debt and deficit levels while at the same time stimulating economic recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cutting the deficit: three years down, five to go?|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6683|publisher=The Institute for Fiscal Studies|accessdate=February 2, 2016|date=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other European countries also began fiscal consolidation with similar aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU fiscal consolidation after the financial crisis: Lessons from past experiences|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/eu-fiscal-consolidation-after-global-crisis-lessons-past-experiences|publisher=VOX  CEPR's Policy Portal|accessdate=February 2, 2016|date=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global responses===

Most political responses to the economic and financial crisis has been taken, as seen above, by individual nations. Some coordination took place at the European level, but the need to cooperate at the global level has led leaders to activate the [[G-20 major economies]] entity. A first summit dedicated to the crisis took place, at the Heads of state level in November 2008 ([[2008 G-20 Washington summit]]).

The [[G-20 major economies|G-20 countries]] met in a summit held on [[2008 G-20 Washington summit|November 2008 in Washington]] to address the economic crisis. Apart from proposals on international financial regulation, they pledged to take measures to support their economy and to coordinate them, and refused any resort to protectionism.

[[2009 G-20 London Summit|Another G-20 summit]] was held in London on April 2009. Finance ministers and central banks leaders of the G-20 met in [[Horsham]], England, on March to prepare the summit, and pledged to restore global growth as soon as possible. They decided to coordinate their actions and to stimulate demand and employment. They also pledged to fight against all forms of [[protectionism]] and to maintain trade and foreign investments. These actions will cost $1.1tn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7979483.stm | work=BBC News | title=G20 leaders seal tn global deal | date=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also committed to maintain the supply of credit by providing more liquidity and recapitalising the banking system, and to implement rapidly the stimulus plans. As for central bankers, they pledged to maintain low-rates policies as long as necessary. Finally, the leaders decided to help emerging and developing countries, through a strengthening of the IMF.

==Policy recommendations==

===IMF recommendation===
The IMF stated in September 2010 that the financial crisis would not end without a major decrease in unemployment as hundreds of millions of people were unemployed worldwide. The IMF urged governments to expand social safety nets and to generate job creation even as they are under pressure to cut spending. The IMF also encouraged governments to invest in skills training for the unemployed and even governments of countries, similar to that of Greece, with major debt risk to first focus on long-term economic recovery by creating jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/business/global/14euro.html|title=I.M.F. Calls for Countries to Focus on Jobs|last=Alderman|first=Liz|date=September 13, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raising interest rates===
The [[Bank of Israel]] was the first to raise interest rates after the global recession began.&lt;ref name="marketwatch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/israels-surprise-rate-cut-may-mean-other-em-cuts-2011-09-26|title=Israel rate cut suggests more emerging market cuts&amp;nbsp;– Emerging Markets Report|date=|publisher=MarketWatch|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It increased rates in August 2009.&lt;ref name="marketwatch.com"/&gt;

On October 6, 2009, [[Australia]] became the first G20 country to raise its main interest rate, with the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] moving rates up from 3.00% to 3.25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8291968.stm |title = Australia raises interest rates |publisher = BBC News |date = October 6, 2009 |accessdate = January 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norges Bank]] of [[Norway]] and the [[Reserve Bank of India]] raised interest rates in March 2010.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/business/global/20rupee.html |work = The New York Times |title = India's Central Bank Raises Interest Rates |date = March 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2017 the [[Bank of England]] raised interest rates for the first time since March 2009 from 0.25% to 0.5% in an attempt to curb inflation.

==Comparisons with the Great Depression==
{{main|Comparisons between the Great Recession and the Great Depression}}

On April 17, 2009, the then head of the IMF [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] said that there was a chance that certain countries may not implement the proper policies to avoid feedback mechanisms that could eventually turn the recession into a depression. "The free-fall in the global economy may be starting to abate, with a recovery emerging in 2010, but this depends crucially on the right policies being adopted today." The IMF pointed out that unlike the Great Depression, this recession was synchronised by global integration of markets. Such synchronized recessions were explained to last longer than typical economic downturns and have slower recoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Evans |first = Ambrose |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/5166956/IMF-warns-over-parallels-to-Great-Depression.html |title = IMF warns over parallels to Great Depression |work=The Daily Telegraph |date = April 16, 2009 |accessdate = January 21, 2010 |location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olivier Blanchard]], IMF Chief Economist, stated that the percentage of workers laid off for long stints has been rising with each downturn for decades but the figures have surged this time. "Long-term unemployment is alarmingly high: in the United States, half the unemployed have been out of work for over six months, something we have not seen since the Great Depression." The IMF also stated that a link between rising inequality within Western economies and deflating demand may exist. The last time that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes was in 1928–1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/8000561/IMF-fears-social-explosion-from-world-jobs-crisis.html|title=IMF fears 'social explosion' from world jobs crisis|date=September 13, 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="129752">The '''ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking''' are the objective merit-based method used by the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) for [[single skating|single]] &amp; [[pair skating]] and [[ice dance]], as well as [[synchronized skating]]. Only eligible skaters/teams will be considered in the ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking.

Skaters/teams receive points based on their final placement at an event and the event's weight over the current and preceding two [[Figure skating season|seasons]]. The ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking are updated after each eligible events. At the end of the current season, the points from the earliest season are deleted. If pairs and ice dance couples officially split up, their partnership will be removed from the Standings and Ranking. When a skater officially announces his or her retirement from competition, the standing and rank of the skater will be removed.

== Overview ==
The ISU Council had implemented the former world standings system for single &amp; pair skating and ice dance for several seasons before 2010. The world standings system for synchronized skating and the season's world ranking had not been implemented until 2010.

According to the "ISU Communication 1629" and "ISU Communication 1630" published by the ISU on July 21, 2010,&lt;ref name="ISU1629PDF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISU1629archived"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISU1630PDF"/&gt; the ISU Council decided to implement two types of World Standings / Ranking, namely "ISU World Standings" and "ISU Season's World Ranking", since the 2010–11 season.

The '''ISU World Standings for single &amp; pair skating and ice dance''', are taking into account results of the preceding two seasons and the current season and remains the basis for the draws at ISU events and part of the criteria for the selection of competitors for the [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating]] and other ISU events designated by the ISU Council.

The '''ISU Season's World Ranking''', is based on the results of the current ongoing season only. It has the main purpose to reflect the current competitive performances of the skaters and give the public and the media an indication of the current actual competitiveness of the skaters.

The '''ISU World Standings for synchronized skating''', are taking into account results of the preceding two seasons and the current season. The standings will also guarantee objectivity and a help for the process of individual entries to ISU events. There will be a separate ranking for "Senior" and "Junior".

The ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking do not necessarily reflect the capabilities of some skaters/teams. Due to limits on entries to events (no more than three from each country), and varying numbers of high-level skaters/teams in each country, skaters/teams from some countries may find it more difficult to qualify to compete at major events. Thus, a skater/team with a lower season's best but from a country with few high-level skaters/teams may qualify to a major event while a skater/team with a much higher season's best but from a country with more than three high-level skaters/teams may not be sent. As a result, it is possible for a skater/team who regularly scores higher to end up with a much lower world standing.

== Principles ==
Since the introduction of the world standings system, the method used to calculate the standing points of a skater has changed several times.

=== Points distribution (since the 2010–11 season) ===
==== For single &amp; pair skating and ice dance ====
According to the "ISU Communication 1629" published by the ISU on July 21, 2010,&lt;ref name="ISU1629PDF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISU1629archived"/&gt; the ''world standing'' of a skater is calculated based on the results over the current and preceding two seasons. Competitors receive points based on their final placement at an event and the event's weight. The following events receive points:
* ISU Championships ([[World Figure Skating Championships|Worlds]], [[European Figure Skating Championships|Europeans]], [[Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents]], and [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|Junior Worlds]]) and [[Figure skating at the Olympic Games|Olympic Winter Games]]: The best result by points per season, the best two results by points over three seasons.
* [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|ISU Grand Prix]] and [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Final]], [[ISU Junior Grand Prix]] and [[ISU Junior Grand Prix Final|Final]]: The two best results by points per season, the best four results by points over three seasons.
* International senior calendar competitions: The two best results by points per season, the best four results by points over three seasons.

Current and intermediate season's earned points will count 100%, and previous season's earned points will count 70%. Following the current season's World Championships, the results from the earliest season are deleted. A new partnership starts with zero points — there is no transfer of world standing points if pairs or ice dance couples split up and form a new partnership, and the previous partnership will be removed from the World Standings. When a skater officially announces his or her retirement from competition, the standing of the skater will be removed.

The ''season's world ranking'' of a skater is calculated similarly to the overall world standing but is based on the results of the ongoing season only.&lt;ref name="ISU1629PDF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISU1629archived"/&gt;

The ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking order will be updated after each event mentioned in the following table. Only eligible skaters will be considered in the ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking.

'''Inter Press Service''' ('''IPS''') is a global [[news agency]]. Its main focus is the production of news and analysis about events and processes affecting economic, social and political [[international development|development]]. The agency largely covers news on the [[Global South]], [[civil society]], and [[globalization]].

==History==
Inter Press Service was set up in 1964 as a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] international [[cooperative]] of journalists. Its founders were the Italian journalist [[Roberto Savio]] and the Argentine political scientist Pablo Piacentini. Initially, the primary objective of IPS was to fill the information gap between Europe and Latin America after the political turbulence following the [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959 (Giffard in Salwen and Garrison, 1991).&lt;ref name=history&gt;IPS, [http://www.ips.org/institutional/get-to-know-us-2/our-history/ Our history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the network expanded to include all continents, beginning with a Latin American base in Costa Rica in 1982,&lt;ref name=history/&gt; and extended its editorial focus. In 1994, IPS changed its legal status to that of a "public-benefit organization for development cooperation".

In 1996 IPS had permanent offices and correspondents in 41 countries, covering 108 nations. It had as subscribers over 600 print media, around 80 news agencies and database services, and 65 broadcast media, in addition to over 500 NGOs and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Giffard, C. Anthony (1998) "[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6dNtpqQa1zoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA194 Alternative News Agencies]" In: Boyd-Barrett, O. and Rantanen, T.; eds. (1998) ''The Globalization of News''. London: Sage Publications, p194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
[[File:Talk Nation Radio - 2011-02-28 Dahr Jamail, Uprisings and Oil in the Middle East.vorb.oga|thumb|Dahr Jamail, on his Al Jazeera and Inter Press Service News reports]]
IPS’s stated aims are to give prominence to the voices of [[marginalization|marginalized]] and vulnerable people and groups, report from the perspectives of [[developing country|developing countries]], and to reflect the views of [[civil society]]. The mainstreaming of [[gender]] in reporting and the assessment of the impacts of [[globalization]] are a priority.

IPS may be unique in its concentration on [[developing country|developing countries]] and the strong relationships with [[civil society]]. For this reason, IPS has even been termed the probably "largest and most credible of all 'alternatives' in the world of news agencies" (Boyd-Barrett and Rantanen, 1998: 174/5),&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett, Oliver and Rantanen, Terhi; eds. (1998) ''The Globalization of News'' London: Sage Publication&lt;/ref&gt; being the "first and only independent and professional news agency which provides on a daily basis information with a Third World focus and point of view" (Boyd-Barrett and Thussu, 1992: 94; cf. Giffard, 1998: 191; Fenby, 1986).

Despite all the laudable aims, it is, however, important to see that IPS has never possessed the resources to be a major player in the international media landscape. Because of its focus on longer background pieces focusses on development issues impacting the lives of people in the South instead of concise news, it is yet to be a news provider for mainstream media in developed countries. In fairness to IPS, mainstream media often rely on their own fly in and out journalists from where IPS reports.

==Legal status==
IPS is registered as an international [[non-profit organization|not-for-profit association]]. It has 'general' NGO consultative status with [[ECOSOC]] at the [[United Nations]], and the [[OECD]] status of [[Official Development Assistance|"ODA eligible international organization"]].

==Organizational structure==
Five editorial desks coordinate the network of journalists around the world: Montevideo (regional bureau for Latin America), Berlin-London (Europe and the Mediterranean), Bangkok (Asia and the Pacific), New York (North America and the Caribbean) and Johannesburg (Africa). Most of IPS's journalists and editors are native to the country or region in which they are working.

IPS receives funding from various sources: through its subscribers and media clients, as beneficiary of multilateral and national development cooperation programmes, and as recipient of project financing from [[Foundation (charity)|foundations]]. It is not, as most other agencies, financed by a country or a group of newspapers. Hence, the agency’s budget is comparatively small. Still it manages to be "roughly the sixth largest international news-gathering organization" (Rauch, 2003: 89).

==IPS's role in the mediascape==
The actual role of IPS in the international [[mediascape]] is hard to assess. Clipping services are expensive, and do not exist in many countries where IPS is strong. Additionally, in some countries news agencies are not credited in bylines. One study by the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] for media coverage of the FAO in 1991 found that of the nearly 3000 clippings with news agency bylines, 13% credited IPS, making it the third-most cited agency. IPS reports were collected from 138 different publications in 39 countries - more countries than any other agency. IPS was particularly strong in Latin America - 72% of clippings from Latin America with news agency bylines came from IPS.&lt;ref&gt;Giffard (1998:195)&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''interval signal''', or '''tuning signal''', is a characteristic sound or musical phrase used in [[international broadcasting]], [[numbers stations]], and by some domestic broadcasters, played before commencement or during breaks in transmission, but most commonly between programmes in different languages. It serves several purposes:
* It assists a listener to tune his or her radio to the correct frequency of the station. This is because most older and cheaper radio receivers do not have digital frequency readout.
* It informs other stations that the frequency is in use.
* It serves as a station identifier even if the language used in the subsequent broadcast is not one the listener understands.

The practice began in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s and was carried over into [[shortwave]] broadcasts.  The use of interval signals has declined with the advent of digital tuning systems, but has not vanished. Interval signals were not required on commercial channels in the USA, where jingles were used as identification.

== Broadcasting services and interval signals ==

The title of the "'''largest [[naval battle]] in history'''" is disputed between adherents of different criteria which include the numbers of personnel and/or vessels involved in the battle, and the total tonnage of the vessels involved. While battles fought in modern times are comparatively well-documented, the figures from those in pre-Renaissance times are generally believed to be exaggerated by contemporary chroniclers.

==The candidates==
* '''[[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]]''', September (28?) 480 BC. 371 [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ships defeated 300–600 [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] ships in this decisive battle. Greek [[trireme]]s had a crew of about 200 while their small [[Penteconter (ship)|penteconters]] had 50 oarsmen.
* '''[[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Cape Ecnomus]]''', 256 BC. One of [[Roman Republic|Rome's]] first major naval victories over its rival, the city of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], in the [[First Punic War]]. The battle itself involved around 680 ships and 300,000 personnel from both sides. Total casualties were about 40,000–50,000, of which roughly 10,000 were on the Roman side and the rest from the Carthaginian side.
*'''[[Battle of Red Cliffs|Red Cliffs]]''', winter of 208 AD. A decisive naval engagement between the forces of [[Cao Cao]] and the allied forces of [[Liu Bei]] and [[Sun Quan]], this battle resulted in the defeat of Cao Cao and confirmed the separation of China into northern and southern halves, the [[Yangtze River valley|Yangtze River Valley]] as a border. Between 270,000 and 850,000 personnel participated in this battle.
*'''[[Battle of the Masts]]''', 654 AD. The Battle of the Masts, or the Battle of [[Finike]] (Phoenix), was an engagement involving the [[Byzantine Empire]], with 500 ships and led personally by Emperor [[Constans II]], and the newly formed navy of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], commanded by Admiral [[Abu'l-Awar]], with 200 ships. The Byzantines hastily attacked, resulting in a decisive victory for the Arabs. Emperor Constans II barely escaped with his life, and this battle marked the emergence of Arabs on the Mediterranean. 
* '''[[Battle of Yamen|Yamen]]''', March 19, 1279. The battle which ended the Mongol-led [[Yuan Dynasty]]'s conquest of [[Southern Song Dynasty]]. It is claimed that more than 1,000 [[Song Dynasty]] warships were destroyed by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] near Yamen, [[Guangdong]], China.
*  '''[[Battle of Lake Poyang|Lake Poyang]]''', August 30&amp;ndash;October 4, 1363. Claimed to be the largest naval battle in terms of personnel, with a reported 850,000 sailors and soldiers involved. A [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] rebel force, said to be 200,000 strong, commanded by [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], met a [[Han (people)|Han]] rebel force, claimed to be 650,000-strong, commanded by [[Chen Youliang]], on [[Lake Poyang]], China's largest freshwater lake.
* '''[[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]]''', May 31&amp;ndash;June 1, 1916. The Imperial German Navy's [[High Seas Fleet]] commanded by Vice-Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] and the British [[Grand Fleet]] under [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Sir John Jellicoe]] engaged in battle near Jutland, Denmark during World War I. The German fleet consisted of 16 [[dreadnought]] and 6 [[Pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]] battleships, 5 [[Battlecruiser|battle cruisers]], 11 [[light cruiser]]s, and 61 fleet torpedo boats, while the numerically superior British fleet was composed of 28 battleships, 9 battle cruisers, 8 [[Armored cruiser|armoured cruisers]], 26 light cruisers, 78 destroyers, 1 [[minelayer]], and 1 [[Seaplane tender|seaplane carrier]]. Britain lost more ships and twice as many men as Germany, although ultimately the outcome was beneficial for the British as the battle resulted in the successful containment of the German fleet. In terms of total tonnage of ships involved, this was the largest surface battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Largest Naval Sea Battles in Military History|url=http://militaryhistory.norwich.edu/largest-naval-sea-battles-in-military-history/|website=Norwich University|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Philippine Sea]]''', June 19–20, 1944. The largest aircraft carrier battle in history, involving fifteen U.S. [[Fleet carrier|fleet]] and [[Light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], nine Japanese carriers, 170 other warships and some 1,700 aircraft.  In terms of tonnage, the U.S. Fifth Fleet's [[Task Force 58]] is the largest single naval formation ever to give battle.
* '''[[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]]''', October 23&amp;ndash;26, 1944. The largest in terms of [[tonnage]] of ships in the combined orders of battle, if not necessarily in terms of tonnage of the ships engaged; it is also the largest in terms of the tonnage of ships sunk, and in terms of the size of the area within which the component battles took place. The [[United States]] [[U.S. Third Fleet|Third]] and [[U.S. Seventh Fleet|Seventh]] Fleets, including some [[Royal Australian Navy|Australian]] warships, comprised 8 large [[aircraft carrier]]s, 8 [[light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], 18 [[escort carrier]]s, 12 [[Battleship#World War II|battleship]]s, 24 [[cruiser]]s, 141 [[destroyer]]s and [[destroyer escort]]s, many other ships, and around 1,500 aircraft. They won a decisive victory over [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces, which consisted of 1 large [[aircraft carrier]], 3 [[light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], nine battleships, 19 cruisers, 34 destroyers and several hundred aircraft. The opposing fleets carried a total of about 200,000 personnel. Leyte Gulf consisted of four major subsidiary battles: [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of the Sibuyan Sea (24 October)|Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]], [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October)|Battle of Surigao Strait]], [[Battle of Samar]] and [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Cape Engaño (25–26 October)|Battle of Cape Engano]], along with other actions. These are counted together by virtue of their all being caused by the Japanese operation ''Sho-Go'', which was aimed at destroying the Allied amphibious forces involved in the [[Battle of Leyte|invasion of Leyte]]. However, the individual battles were separated by distances as great as two hundred miles, as well as several days time, from the first submarine action to the Japanese withdrawal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47233">This is a list of '''longest prison sentences served''' by a single person, worldwide, without a period of freedom followed by a second conviction. These cases rarely coincide with the [[list of longest prison sentences|longest prison sentences]] given, because some countries have laws that don't allow sentences without [[parole]] or for convicts to remain in prison beyond a given number of years (regardless of their original conviction).

The second victim identified a different man as her attacker but the judge argued that both men looked alike enough.

[[Image:Midgard (Sö 56, Fyrby).jpg|350px|right|thumb|The runes ''a:miþkarþi'', [[Old Norse]] ''à Miðgarði'', meaning "in Midgard" – "in Middle Earth", on the [[Fyrby Runestone]] (Sö 56) in [[Södermanland]], [[Sweden]].]]

'''Midgard''' (an anglicised form of [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] {{lang|non|Miðgarðr}}; [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|Middangeard}}, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] ''Midgård'', [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|Middilgard}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|Mittilagart}}, [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''Midjun-gards''; "middle yard") is the name for [[Earth]] (equivalent in meaning to the Greek term {{lang |grc|[[Ecumene|οἰκουμένη]]}}, "inhabited") inhabited by and known to [[mannaz|humans]] in early Germanic cosmology, and specifically one of the [[Norse cosmology|Nine Worlds]] in [[Norse mythology]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|middangeard}}
{{wiktionary|𐌼𐌹𐌳𐌾𐌿𐌽𐌲𐌰𐍂𐌳𐍃}}
This name occurs in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] literature as {{lang|non|Miðgarðr}}. In [[Old Saxon]] ''[[Heliand]]'' it appears as {{lang|osx|Middilgard}} and in [[Old High German]] poem ''[[Muspilli]]'' it appears as {{lang |goh|Mittilagart}}. The [[Gothic language|Gothic]] form {{lang|got|Midjungards}} is attested in the [[Gospel of Luke]] as a translation of the Greek word {{lang |grc|[[Ecumene|οἰκουμένη]]}}. The word is present in [[Old English]] epic and poetry as {{lang |ang|Middangeard}}; later transformed to {{lang |enm|Middellærd}} or {{lang |enm|Mittelerde}} ("[[Middle-earth (disambiguation)|Middle-earth]]") in [[Middle English]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Midgard | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | contribution = Midgard}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All these forms are from a [[Common Germanic]] ''*midja-gardaz'' (''*meddila-'', ''*medjan-''), a compound of ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/midjaz|*midja-]]'' "middle" and ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/gardaz|*gardaz]]'' "yard, enclosure".
In early Germanic cosmology, the term stands alongside ''[[:wikt:world|world]]'' ([[Old English]] ''weorold'', [[Old Saxon]] ''werold'', [[Old High German]] ''weralt'', [[Old Frisian]] ''warld'' and [[Old Norse]] ''verǫld''), from a [[Common Germanic]] compound ''*wira-alđiz'', the "age of men".&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir E. (2003). ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology''.  Leiden: Brill. p. 462. {{ISBN|90-04-12875-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Norse==
Midgard is a realm in [[Norse mythology]]. It is one of the Nine Worlds—the only one that is completely visible to mankind (the others may intersect with this visible realm but are mostly invisible). Pictured as placed somewhere in the middle of [[Yggdrasil]], Midgard is between the land of [[Niflheim]]—the land of ice—to the north and [[Muspelheim]]—the land of fire—to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Midgard|title=Midgard {{!}} Norse mythology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midgard is surrounded by a world of water, or ocean, that is impassable. The ocean is inhabited by the great sea serpent [[Jörmungandr]] (Miðgarðsormr), who is so huge that he encircles the world entirely, grasping his own tail. The concept is similar to that of the [[Ouroboros]]. Midgard was also connected to Asgard, the home of the gods, by the [[Bifröst]], the rainbow bridge, guarded by [[Heimdallr]].

In Norse mythology, ''Miðgarðr'' became applied to the wall around the world that the gods constructed from the eyebrows of the giant [[Ymir]] as a defense against the [[Jötunn|Jotuns]] who lived in [[Jotunheim]], east of ''Manheimr'', the "home of men", a word used to refer to the entire world. The gods slew the giant [[Ymir]], the first created being, and put his body into the central void of the universe, creating the world out of his body: his flesh constituting the land, his [[Ymir's blood|blood]] the oceans, his bones the mountains, his teeth the cliffs, his hairs the trees, and his brains the clouds. Aurgelmir's skull was held by four dwarfs, Nordri, Sudri, Austri, and Vestri, who represent the four points on the compass and became the dome of heaven. The sun, moon, and stars were said to be scattered sparks in the skull.

[[Image:Sö 56, Fyrby.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Fyrby Runestone.]]
According to the [[Eddas]], Midgard will be destroyed at [[Ragnarök]], the battle at the end of the world. Jörmungandr will arise from the ocean, poisoning the land and sea with his venom and causing the sea to rear up and lash against the land. The final battle will take place on the plane of [[Vígríðr]], following which Midgard and almost all life on it will be destroyed, with the earth sinking into the sea, only to rise again, fertile and green when the cycle repeats and the creation begins again.

Although most surviving instances of the word Midgard refer to spiritual matters, it was also used in more mundane situations, as in the [[Viking Age]] [[runestone]] poem from the inscription [[Fyrby Runestone|Sö 56]] from Fyrby:

The [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] form {{lang|sv|Midgård}} or {{lang|da|Midgaard}}, the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] {{lang|no|Midgard}} or {{lang|no|Midgård}}, as well as the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] form {{lang|is|Miðgarður}}, all derive from the Old Norse term.

==Old and Middle English==
The name ''middangeard'' occurs six times in the [[Old English language|Old English]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', and is the same word as Midgard in [[Old Norse]]. The term is equivalent in meaning to the Greek term [[Oikoumene]], as referring to the known and inhabited world.

The concept of Midgard occurs many times in [[Middle English]]. The association with ''earth'' (OE ''eorðe'') in Middle English ''middellærd'', ''middelerde'' is by [[popular etymology]]; the continuation of ''geard'' "enclosure" is ''[[yard (land)|yard]]''. An early example of this transformation is from the [[Ormulum]]:

::''þatt ure Drihhtin wollde / ben borenn i þiss middellærd''

::that our Lord wanted / be born in this middle-earth.

The usage of "[[Middle-earth]]" as a name for a setting was popularized by Old English scholar [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and other fantasy works; he was originally inspired by the references to ''middangeard'' and ''[[Éarendel]]'' in the Old English poem ''[[Crist]]''.

==Old High German==
''Mittilagart'' is mentioned in the 9th-century [[Old High German]] ''[[Muspilli]]'' (v. 54) meaning "the world" as opposed to the sea and the heavens:
::''muor varsuuilhit sih, suilizot lougiu der himil,''
::''mano uallit, prinnit mittilagart''

::Sea is swallowed, flaming burn the heavens,
::Moon falls, Midgard burns

== History ==
The term "molecular epidemiology" was first coined by Kilbourne in a 1973 article entitled "The molecular epidemiology of influenza".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kilbourne ED |title=The molecular epidemiology of influenza |journal=J Infect Dis |date=Apr 1973 |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=478–87 |pmid=4121053 |doi=10.1093/infdis/127.4.478}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term became more formalized with the formulation of the first book on ''Molecular Epidemiology: Principles and Practice'' by Schulte and Perera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Molecular Epidemiology: Principles and Practice |last1=Schulte |first1= Paul A. |last2=Perera |first2=Frederica P. |year=1993 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=0-12-632346-1 |pages=588}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the heart of this book is the impact of advances in molecular research that have given rise to and enable the measurement and exploitation of the [[biomarker]] as a vital tool to link traditional molecular and epidemiological research strategies to understand the underlying mechanisms of disease in populations.

== Modern use ==
While most molecular epidemiology studies are using conventional disease designation system for an outcome (with the use of exposures at the molecular level), compelling evidence indicates that disease evolution represents inherently heterogeneous process differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual ("the unique disease principle"),&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Lochhead P, Chan AT, Nishihara R, Cho E, Wolpin BM, Meyerhardt AJ, Meissner A, Schernhammer ES, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E. Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: emerging integrative science to analyze environment, host, and disease. Mod Pathol 2013;26:465-484.&lt;/ref&gt; considering uniqueness of the [[exposome]] and its unique influence on [[Molecular pathology|molecular pathologic]] process in each individual. Studies to examine the relationship between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly, cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of standardized methodologies and guidelines as well as paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman ME, Howatt W, Blows FM, Pharoah P, Hewitt SM, Garcia-Closas M. Molecular pathology in epidemiologic studies: a primer on key considerations. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2010;19(4):966-972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, King EE, Beck AH, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E. Interdisciplinary education to integrate pathology and epidemiology: Towards molecular and population-level health science. Am J Epidemiol 2012;176:659-667.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "molecular epidemiology" for this type of research masked the presence of these challenges, and hindered the development of methods and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller LH. Invited commentary: the 21st century epidemiologist--a need for different training? Am J Epidemiol 2012;176(8):668-671.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Beck AH, King EE, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E. Ogino et al. respond to "The 21st century epidemiologist". Am J Epidemiol 2012;176:672-674.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the premise that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes.

== Analytical methods ==
The genome of a bacterial species fundamentally determines its identity. Thus, [[gel electrophoresis]] techniques like [[pulsed-field gel electrophoresis]] can be used in molecular epidemiology to comparatively analyze patterns of bacterial chromosomal fragments and to elucidate the genomic content of bacterial cells. Due to its widespread use and ability to analyse epidemiological information about most bacterial pathogens based on their molecular markers, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is relied upon heavily in molecular epidemiological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Goering, R.|title= Pulsed field gel electrophoresis: A review of application and interpretation in the molecular epidemiology of infectious disease |journal= Infection, Genetics and Evolution |date= 6 August 2010 |volume= 10|issue= 7 |pages= 866–875|pmid= 20692376|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2010.07.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Molecular epidemiology allows for an understanding of the molecular outcomes and implications of diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposure, particularly how these choices and exposures result in acquired genetic mutations and how these mutations are distributed throughout selected populations through the use of biomarkers and genetic information. Molecular epidemiological studies are able to provide additional understanding of previously-identified [[risk factor]]s and disease mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=The science and art of molecular epidemiology|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=728–729|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.728|pmid=1732025|author=Slattery, M.|pmc=1732025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific applications include:

While the use of advanced molecular analysis techniques within the field of molecular epidemiology is providing the larger field of epidemiology with greater means of analysis, [[Miquel Porta]] identified several challenges that the field of molecular epidemiology faces, particularly selecting and incorporating requisite applicable data in an unbiased manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=Incomplete overlapping of biological, clinical, and environmental information in molecular epidemiological studies: a variety of causes and a cascade of consequences|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=734–738|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.734|pmid=1732039|author=Porta, M.|pmc=1732039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limitations of molecular epidemiological studies are similar in nature to those of generic epidemiological studies, that is, samples of convenience - both of the target population and genetic information, small sample sizes, inappropriate statistical methods, poor quality control, and poor definition of target populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=The science and art of molecular epidemiology|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=728–729|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.728|pmid=1732025|author=Slattery, M.|pmc=1732025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New constitutionalism''' is derived from the classical [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] framework and represents a set of political policies that promote a new global order.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dierckx|first=Sacha|date=2013-12-01|title=After the Crisis and Beyond the New Constitutionalism?

Central ideas of neoliberalism have been advanced to create policies and practices to achieve [[global governance]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  New constitutionalism provides power to the private realm and limits power of state governance and public corporations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The transferring of power creates an informal self-regulatory setting allowing for the dismissal of public scrutiny and transparency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Constitutionalism and World Order|last=Gill|first=Stephen|last2=Cutler|first2=Claire|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-107-05369-4|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New constitutionalism has reshaped the structure of control to allow “locking in” mechanisms to occur to prevent intervention from the democratic realm and to enhance economic objectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This protects markets from regional interference and allows global influence in order to promote [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Constitutionalism: International and Private Rule in The New Global Order|last=McBride|first=Stephen|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4426-0365-3|editor-last=McBride|editor-first=Stephen|location=Toronto|pages=21|editor-last2=Teeple|editor-first2=Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of new constitutionalism is the result of [[globalization]] and the growing need for [[global hegemony]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Institutions have gained power in regards to trade, mobility, and flexibility through the framework of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the [[European Union]] are all actors contributing to the power of global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

New constitutionalism as a political order emerged in the latter half of the 20th century and the term was coined by academic[[Stephen Gill (political scientist)|Stephen Gill]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  The need for economic constitutional change was the result of crisis in political order correspondingly to the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Cold War]] as well as the progress of [[globalization]] through technological means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Since then the disciplinary has grown in acceptance due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] of 2007 and the need for largescale stabilization in its aftermath.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Theorists have subsequently developed the social and economic practices both in support and disagreement of the framework to provide a comparative outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbink|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Assessing the New Constitutionalism|url=https://www.jstor.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/stable/20434076?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=40 [2]|pages=227–245|issn=0010-4159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
New constitutionalism formed in the 1980s as the result of a growing world order and the “worldwide market revolution.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The end of the [[Cold War]] represented an ideological shift and the need for transformation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This shift was reiterated by [[Margaret Thatcher|Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher]] declaring the depletion of [[socialism]] and the rise of [[conservatism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As society progressed it allowed for the evolution of capital mobility, [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporation]] and the expansion of the world market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The [[Great Depression]] and the aftermath of [[World War II]] reflected the need for reform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Reform would redirect economic and political practices, ensuring benefits for all through the creation of global institutions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Falk, R. (2014). New Constitutionalism and geopolitics: notes on legality and legitimacy and prospects for a just new constitutionalism. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 295-312. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-liberal supremacy through the dominance of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] allowed for geopolitical reconfiguration increasing the need for new political order.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Additionally the lack of consistency among nation-state principles and the constant interruption from democratic power influenced the need to provide sustainable long term economic goals by limiting [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches of government using [[Constitution|constitutional framework]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cutler, A. Claire. (2016) "Transformations in Statehood, the Investor-State Regime, and the New Constitutionalism." ''Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies'' 23, no. 1: 95-125.&lt;/ref&gt; New constitutionalism has become prominent in the aftermath of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007 global financial crisis]] as a result of the need to bypass formal trade rules and democratic controls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneiderman, D. (2014).  How to govern differently: neo-liberal, new constitutionalism and international investment law. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 159-175. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework ==
There are four main [[Policy|policies]] to define new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The first represents the development of a constitutional structure for the global market that dictates the public, private and international powers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These international economic agreements or “[[constitution]]s” resemble political constitutions and thus ensure [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The economic power is being shifted from the national to the international as well as from the public to the private to provide growth and sustainability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Second is the separation of economic policies from domestic influence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This allows for capitalist markets to grow as well as extending the commodity form and the market forces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''' ''' This separation insulates economic policies from governing regulatory powers as well as the public demand for transparency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Economic Liberation Movement|Economic liberation]] is usually accompanied by political backlash, by disconnecting these two dynamisms suppresses democratic involvement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[World Bank Group|The World Bank]] advocates for the restriction of democratic participation and limitations imposed in the economic realm by creating a hierarchical system of representation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thirdly is creating “locking in” mechanisms which incorporate; laws, rules, regulations, procedures and institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This mechanism puts limitations on legislative and policy autonomy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Agreements are formulated to “lock in” [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] content through legal guarantees and sanctions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These agreements are difficult, even impossible to change which makes economic policies autonomous.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lastly this process diminished the need for formal accountability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  New constitutionalism has created a flexible system giving privileges to [[Multinational corporation|international corporations]] and private entities creating a “double” legal standard.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This concept diminished the “watchdog” and gives the flexibility for self-regulation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   This instrument is based on the international gold standard of the [[19th century|nineteenth century]] which gave rights to investor to avoid certain jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Permitting deregulation of financial services and trade investment avoids popular pressures and limits the need for transparency.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Minimizing liability and ensuring private authority the economic sector becomes more efficient, functional and practical.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Cutler, C. (2011). The Privatization of Authority in the Global Political Economy''.'' Edited by McBride, S., &amp; Teeple, G. ''In'' ''Relations of global power: Neoliberal order and disorder''. (p.41-59). Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4426-0365-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutions ==
At the global and regional level institutions are implementing the new constitutionalism framework to advance [[global governance]] by upholding the rights of private corporations and promoting a free [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  These institutions policies will ensure [[economic growth]] at the global level.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sinclair, S. (2014). Trade agreements, the new constitutionalism and public services. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 179-195. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global ===
The [[World Trade Organization]] [[World Trade Organization|(WTO)]] is a prominent figure in governing the [[World economy|global economy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Formally it was the responsibility of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade]] built on [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] principles but lacked the greater power adapted through new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]] represents a governing global entity which has adapted to the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] main purpose is to limit national interference in the global market and challenge any nation-state regulations that could be detrimental to the economy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Any economic alternatives that are proposed by nations can be discredited by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] as well as restricting governments ability to implement policy in international jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] represents the freedom of markets and allowing investors to capitalize in a [[world economy]], by doing so provides protection to the private sector.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Stephen McBride describes the [[World Trade Organization]] as having “quasi-judicial and quasi-constitutional aura.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The judicial and constitutional supremacy highlights the difficulty in challenging the organizations because of lock in mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Regional ===
The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] ([[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]) is a considered a regional governing entity that encompasses the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Regan]] referred to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] as a “new economic constitution.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Constitution because the agreement provided restrictions on government intrusion, rights to certain actors and enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The binding agreement afforded rights to both foreign and domestic investor to protect the interests of private capital and corporations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  By limiting government powers the agreement locked in private interests and reduced governments ability to expand or restore [[public service]]s in [[free trade]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Focus at the global level has resulted in hostility between the public and private realms within [[nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This hostility creates a political struggle between the private sector who safeguard the rights of capital and the public who want to control [[capitalism]] politically, democracy and socially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The control is being denationalized and delocalized causing negative repercussions at state level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  New constitutionalism lacks political will and can have detrimental effects to global dignity and future generations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Dividing economic policies from domestic creates disturbances within the civil society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Human rights]], [[Environmental issue|environmental concerns]] and [[public service]]s are being devalued because of the lack of economic concern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

New constitutionalism favours the [[Elitism|elitists]] providing preferential treatment and widening the [[Economic inequality|social gap]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[International financial institutions]], [[investor]]s and bond-raters are holding higher positions of authority than governments or nation-states furthering global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There is an urgent need for surveillance, policy making power, regulations and transparency economic outcomes are not solely focused on monetary gain but [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] concerns as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The absence of accountability and democratic authority has led many countries to depart from the constitutional framework and reclaim their [[sovereignty]] as independent nations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Australia]] has begun to constrain the advancements of new constitutionalism while many [[South America]] states have begun to exit the global regime completely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] have begun to form provisions to improve the democratic power within the global order and no longer allow for their governments to be immobilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:Flag of the Nordic Council.svg|thumb|Flag before 2016]]
The '''Nordic Council''' is the official body for formal inter-parliamentary co-operation among the [[Nordic countries]]. Formed in 1952, it has 87 representatives from [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] as well as from the autonomous areas of the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], and the [[Åland Islands]]. The representatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or areas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary sessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year with a specific theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an [[intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental]] forum, was established to complement the Council. The official and working languages of both the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers are Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, which comprise the first language of around 80% of the region's population and learned as a foreign language by the remaining 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/en/fakta-om-norden-1/language|title=Language|date=2008-08-06|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers are involved in various forms of cooperation with neighbouring areas, amongst them being the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague|title=Ratas meets with Benelux, Nordic, Baltic leaders in the Hague|last=ERR|date=2017-06-22|work=ERR|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Etzold, "Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting," in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region]. Nordic Council of Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During World War II, [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] were occupied by [[Germany]]; [[Finland]] was [[Winter War|under assault]] by the [[Soviet Union]]; while [[Sweden]], though neutral, still felt the war's effects. Following the war, the [[Nordic countries]] pursued the idea of a [[Scandinavian defence union]] to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland, due to its [[Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine|Paasikivi-Kekkonen policy of neutrality]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|FCMA treaty]] with the USSR, could not participate.

It was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with [[NATO]], which some were planning at the time. The [[United States]], keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.lu/plan_scandinavian_defence_union-2-6834 The plan for a Scandinavian Defence Union], [[European Navigator]]. Étienne Deschamps. Translated by the CVCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led [[Danish Prime Minister]] [[Hans Hedtoft]] to propose, in 1951, a consultative inter-parliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1952.&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/before-1952 Before 1952], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-Soviet relations thawed following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Finland joined the council in 1955.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/1953-1971 1953–1971 Finland joins in and the first Nordic rights are formulated.], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building upon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the [[Nordic Passport Union]] was created. These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There were also plans for a [[single market]] but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway applied to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

This move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The Treaty of Helsinki outlined the workings of the Council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and Nordic House in [[Reykjavík]] were created. Danish Prime Minister [[Hilmar Baunsgaard]] proposed full economic cooperation ("[[Nordek]]") in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway).&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Nordek was then abandoned.

As a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic cooperation.&lt;ref name="HM1"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 The period up to 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111240/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 representatives of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Åland Islands|Åland]] were allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish delegations.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics.&lt;ref name="HM2"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 1972–1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111152/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, although it did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on, although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more active role in [[Arctic cooperation and politics|circumpolar]] affairs.

In the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the [[Nordic Industrial Fund]], Nordtest and the [[Nordic Investment Bank]]. The Council's remit was also expanded to include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], a joint energy network was established. The Nordic Science Policy Council was set up in 1983&lt;ref name="HM2"/&gt; and, in 1984, representatives from Greenland were allowed to join the Danish delegation.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

Following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Nordic Council began to cooperate more with the [[Baltic states]] and new Baltic Sea organisations. Sweden and Finland joined the [[European Union]] (EU), the EEC's successor, in 1995. Norway had also applied, but once again voted against membership.&lt;ref name="HM3"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 After 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120103903/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; However, Norway and Iceland did join the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) which integrated them economically with the EU. The Nordic Passport Union was also subsumed into the EU's [[Schengen Area]] in 1996.

The Nordic Council became more outward-looking, to the [[Arctic]], Baltic, Europe, and [[Canada]]. The [[Øresund Bridge]] linking Sweden and Denmark led to a large amount of cross-border travel, which in turn led to further efforts to reduce barriers.&lt;ref name="HM3"/&gt; However, the initially envisioned tasks and functions of the Nordic Council have become partially dormant due to the significant overlap with the EU and EEA. In 2008 Iceland began [[Accession of Iceland to the European Union|EU membership talks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2008/11/03/further-icelandic-support-for-eu-membership/#more-4118 |title=Further Icelandic support for EU membership &amp;#124; IceNews – Daily News |publisher=Icenews.is |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but decided to annul these in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/iceland-drops-european-union-membership-bid |title=Iceland drops EU membership bid: 'interests better served outside' union |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===Language understanding===

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers have a particular focus on strengthening the [[North Germanic languages|Nordic language]] community; the main focus of their work to promote language understanding in the Nordic countries is on children and young people's understanding of written and oral Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the three mutually intelligible Scandinavian languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.comingsoon.no/en/theme/education-and-research-in-the-nordic-region/language Language co-operation], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of the Council have the ability to issue proposals in their own languages, and official documents are translated to cater to all five of the major Nordic languages. Discussions for bringing Finnish and Icelandic into equal footing with the three other languages has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/fi/ajankohtaista/uutiset/suomen-ja-islannin-kielen-asemaa-parannetaan-pohjoismaisessa-yhteistyoessae|title=Suomen ja islannin kielen asemaa parannetaan pohjoismaisessa yhteistyössä|date=2017-11-02|access-date=2018-06-01|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
=== Council ===
The Nordic Council consists of 87 representatives, elected from its members' parliaments and reflecting the relative representation of the political parties in those parliaments. It holds its main session in the autumn, while a so-called "theme session" is arranged in the spring. Each of the national delegations has its own secretariat in the national parliament. The autonomous territories{{spaced ndash}}Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Åland{{spaced ndash}}also have Nordic secretariats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/about-the-nordic-council About the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council uses the three Continental [[Scandinavian languages]] ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) as its official working languages, but also publishes material in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and [[English language|English]] for information purposes. The council refers to Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish collectively as Scandinavian and considers them to be different forms of the same language forming a common language community.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/ |title=Norden |date=11 September 2009 |work=Norden |publisher=Norden.org |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1987, under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers visits to hospitals, job centres, the police and social security offices. The languages included are Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Icelandic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428022430/http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6|date=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council does not have any formal power on its own, but each government has to implement any decisions through its national legislature. With Denmark, Norway, and Iceland being members of NATO and Finland and Sweden being [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]], the Nordic Council has not been involved in any military cooperation.

===Council of Ministers===
The original Nordic Council concentrates on inter-parliamentary cooperation. [http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers The ''Nordic Council of Ministers''], founded in 1971, is responsible for inter-governmental cooperation. Prime Ministers have ultimate responsibility but this is usually delegated to the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and the Nordic Committee for Co-operation, which co-ordinates the day-to-day work. The autonomous territories have the same representation as states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers The Nordic Council of Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secretary General ===
*[[Secretary-General of the Nordic Council]]

== Location ==
[[File:Norden Copenhagen.JPG|thumb|Nordic Council headquarters in Copenhagen. White building with Norden sign and flag at street Ved Stranden No. 18]]
The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers have their headquarters in [[Copenhagen]] and various installations in each separate country, as well as many offices in neighbouring countries. The headquarters are located at [[Ved Stranden]] No. 18, close to [[Slotsholmen]].

== Members ==
&lt;!-- Do NOT add alleged "observers" to this section. First of all, this is a section on MEMBERS, not observers, which are two different things. Cooperation with the Baltic states belongs in the next section on such cooperation. Secondly, it has been established that the Nordic Council has no official observer status (Talk:Nordic countries). As sessions are open to the public, anyone may be present and "observe" the proceedings, but that doesn't make them "observer members" in a formal sense, like at the UN, where observer status gives many formal rights. As this article already discusses, observer status for the Baltic states was explicitly rejected, and there is no evidence presented that the council has made any other decision in this matter since (more on this on Talk:Nordic countries, where the matter was debated to death) --&gt;

The Nordic Council has 8 members, 5 sovereign states and 3 self-governing regions.

==Observer, guests and other cooperation with neighbouring countries and regions==

In accordance with § 13 of the Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council the [[Sámi Parliamentary Council]] is the only institution with observer status with the Nordic Council. In accordance with § 14, the Nordic Youth Council has the status of "guest" on a permanent basis, and the Presidium "may invite representatives of popularly elected bodies and other persons to a session and grant them speaking rights" as guests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/bag-om-nordisk-raad/the-nordic-council/rules-of-procedure-for-the-nordic-council Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the council, "within the last couple of years, guests from other international and Nordic organisations have been able to take part in the debates at the Sessions. Visitors from the Baltic States and Northwest Russia are those who mostly take up this opportunity. Guests who have a connection to the theme under discussion are invited to the Theme Session."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/sessions-and-meetings/nordic-council-sessions/about-the-sessions-of-the-nordic-council About the Sessions of the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council of Ministers has established four ''Offices outside the Nordic Region'', namely in all the [[Baltic states]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]&amp;nbsp;– and the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region]. Nordic Council of Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt; The offices form part of the secretariat of the Nordic Council of Ministers; according to the Council of Ministers their primary mission is to promote cooperation between the Nordic countries and the Baltic states and to promote the Nordic countries in cooperation with their embassies within the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;''Planer och budget 2016'', p. 71, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers define [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Russia]] as "Adjacent Areas" and has formal cooperation with them under the Adjacent Areas policies framework; in recent years the cooperation has focused increasingly on Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Etzold, "Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting," in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council had historically been a strong supporter of Baltic independence from the Soviet Union. During the move towards independence in the Baltic States in 1991, Denmark and Iceland pressed for the Observer Status in the Nordic Council for the then-nonsovereign Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The move in 1991 was opposed by Norway and Finland. The move was heavily opposed by the [[Soviet Union]], accusing the Nordic Council of getting involved in its internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=sMUW5PR1FI8C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=estonia+%22nordic+council%22+%22observer+status%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wySUsuxRJH&amp;sig=CzVoYbflgNMAIdhyDNtWfiDdtk0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4KXtha3WAhUECZoKHTlSBmwQ6AEIUzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20%22nordic%20council%22%20%22observer%20status%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=sMUW5PR1FI8C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=estonia+nordic+council+observer+1991&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wySUsvpPKI&amp;sig=vVIg3P4gkhs6kJnW-goho8laWeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi53MbMjK3WAhVHQJoKHW_QDmkQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20nordic%20council%20observer%201991&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Nordic Council refused to give observer status for the three, at the time nonsovereign, Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=OMFdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=estonia+%22nordic+council%22+%22observer+status%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6PVUeUqmHs&amp;sig=cRt4I8tK-gjmM2hSIgRRlK2FyTc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4KXtha3WAhUECZoKHTlSBmwQ6AEIUDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20%22nordic%20council%22%20%22observer%20status%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nordic Council rejected the Baltic states' application for formal observer status, the council nevertheless has extensive cooperation on different levels with all neighbouring countries, including the Baltic states and Germany, especially the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Representatives of Schleswig-Holstein were present as informal guests during a session for the first time in 2016. The state has historical ties to Denmark and cross-border cooperation with Denmark and has a [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish minority]] population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html Schleswig-Holstein for the first time uses its observer status in the Nordic Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117110624/http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html |date=17 November 2016 }} (in German), Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 1 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As parliamentary representatives from Schleswig-Holstein, a member of the [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]] and a member of the [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|Social Democrats]] with ties to the Danish minority were elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/infothek/wahl18/drucks/4800/drucksache-18-4839.pdf Election of observational members to the Nordic Council], Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 3 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Sami people|Sámi]] political structures long desired formal representation in the Nordic Council's structures, and were eventually granted observer status through the Sámi Parliamentary Council. In addition, representatives of the Sámi people are de facto included in activities touching upon their interests. In addition, the [[Faroe Islands]] have expressed their wishes for full membership in the Nordic Council instead of the current associate membership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.norden.org/en/news-and-events/news/the-faroe-islands-apply-for-membership-in-the-nordic-council-and-nordic-council-of-ministers-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently{{When|date=March 2018}}, three of the members of the Nordic Council ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]], all [[Member state of the European Union|EU-member states]]), the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]] sought intensifying cooperation in the [[Digital Single Market]], as well as discussing social matters, the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], the [[European migrant crisis]] and defense cooperation. Relations with [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia]], [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|Turkey]] and the [[Brexit|United Kingdom]] was also on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nordic unification ==
{{further|Scandinavism}}
 
Some desire the Nordic Council's promotion of Nordic cooperation to go much further than at present. If the states of Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland were to merge in such an integration as some desire, it would command a gross domestic product of US$1.60 trillion, making it the twelfth largest economy in the world, larger than that of Australia, Spain, Mexico or South Korea. Gunnar Wetterberg, a Swedish historian and economist, wrote a book entered into the Nordic Council's year book that proposes the creation of a Nordic Federation from the Council in a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;Wetterberg, Gunnar (3 November 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/31188 Comment The United Nordic Federation], [[EU Observer]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health''' (PMNCH) is a multi-constituency partnership hosted by the [[World Health Organization]] and chaired by [[Graça Machel]]. PMNCH seeks to achieve universal access to comprehensive, high-quality reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health care. PMNCH works with more than 650 members in the reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) communities across seven constituencies:

# Academic research and teaching institutions 
# Donors and foundations
# Health-care professionals
# Multilateral agencies
# Non-governmental organizations

PMNCH describes itself as "a platform for knowledge, advocacy and accountability to improve women and children’s health". The Partnership is governed by a Board chaired by [[Graça Machel]].

==Main Activities==

The Partnership plays a central role in facilitating joint action on many fronts, mainly progress towards the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) 4 and 5, to
reduce child mortality and improve maternal health, as tracked by  the Countdown to 2015
initiative, and through support for the [[Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health|Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health]] (Global Strategy) and Every Woman Every Child. PMNCH enables members to share
strategies, align objectives and resources, and collectively agree on policy interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reaching Every Woman and Every Child through Partnership|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/knowledge/publications/20130620_pmnchbrochurelowres.pdf?ua=1|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMNCH’s work and support to partners is focused on three key Strategic Objectives: 
# Promotion of knowledge and innovation for action in order to enhance policy, service delivery and financing mechanisms.  
# Advocacy to mobilize and consolidate resources and greater engagement towards RMNCH.  
# Promotion of accountability for resources and results in order to strengthen monitoring of RMNCH’s efforts.

The Partnership issues annual reports on progress of commitments from more than 250 stakeholders and estimates that the Global Strategy has leveraged over US$18 billion in new and additional money for women’s and children’s health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PMNCH 2013 Report|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/knowledge/publications/2013_pmnch_report/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

PMNCH was launched in September 2005 when the world’s three leading maternal, newborn and child health alliances joined forces under the new name of The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health. 80 original members joined together from the three organizations, which included: the Partnership for Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health, hosted by the World Health Organization in Geneva; the Healthy Newborn Partnership, based at [[Save the Children]] USA; and the Child Survival Partnership, hosted by [[Unicef|UNICEF]] in New York. All three partnerships focused on accelerating action by countries—both donor and
developing countries—to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 ([[Child mortality|reduce child
mortality]]) and 5 ([[Maternal health|improve maternal health]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PMNCH History|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/about/history/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''people's history''', or '''history from below''',&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Thompson, "History from Below", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 7 April 1966, pp. 279–80.&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[historical narrative]] which attempts to account for historical events from the perspective of common people rather than leaders. There is an emphasis on [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the poor, the nonconformists, and otherwise marginal groups. The authors are typically on the left and have a Marxist model in mind, as in the approach of the [[History Workshop Journal|History Workshop]] movement in Britain in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade Matthews|title=The New Left, National Identity, and the Break-up of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfmZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "History from below" and "people's history" ==
[[Lucien Febvre]] first used the phrase "histoire vue d'en bas et non d'en haut" (history seen from below and not from above) in 1932 when praising [[Albert Mathiez]] for seeking to tell the "histoire des masses et non de vedettes" (history of the masses and not of starlets).&lt;ref&gt;When the State Trembled 1442660228 Reinhold Kramer, Tom Mitchell - 2010 "It was Lucien Febvre who first used the phrase 'history from below' when in 1932 he observed that Albert Mathiez, a founding member of the Annales tradition, had sought 'histoire des masses et non de vedettes; histoire vue d'en bas en non ..."&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in the title of [[A. L. Morton]]'s 1938 book, ''A People's History of England''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grahamstevenson.me.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=418:a-l-morton&amp;catid=13:m&amp;Itemid=114 AL Morton] Compendium of Communist Biographies, Graham Stevenson, Accessed Feb 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it was [[E. P. Thompson]]'s essay ''History from Below'' in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' (1966) which brought the phrase to the forefront of historiography from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Black and MacRaild ''Studying History'' 2007 Page 113 "E. P. Thompson's essay, 'History from below', in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' (1966), was the real starting point, not only of the term, but of attempts to define it, to intellectualise about it, and to give it a coherent agenda...."&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized among non-historians by Howard Zinn's 1980 book, ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''.

[[Guy Beiner]] has pointed out that "the Neo-Marxist flag-bearers of history from below have at times resorted to idealized and insufficiently sophisticated notions of ‘the people’, unduly ascribing to them innate progressive values".&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beiner, [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/forgetful-remembrance-9780198749356? Forgetful Remembrance: Social Forgetting and Vernacular Historiography of a Rebellion in Ulster (Oxford University Press, 2018)], pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A people's history is the history as the story of mass movements and of the outsiders.  Individuals not included in the past in other type of writing about history are part of history-from-below theory's primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the nonconformists, the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] and the otherwise forgotten people. This theory also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur.

This [[Historical revisionism|revisionist approach]] to writing history is in direct opposition to methods which tend to emphasize single great figures in history, referred to as the [[Great Man theory]]; it argues that the driving factor of history is the daily life of ordinary people, their [[social status]] and [[profession]]. These are the factors that "push and pull" on opinions and allow for trends to develop, as opposed to great people introducing ideas or initiating events.

In his book ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'', [[Howard Zinn]] wrote: "The history of any country, presented as the history of a family, conceals fierce conflicts of interest (sometimes exploding, most often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex. And in such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of the executioners."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinncol1.html chapter: Columbus, The Indians, and Human Progress]&lt;/ref&gt;

The political history of the [[world]] is the history of the various [[Politics|political entities]] created by the [[human race]] throughout their existence and the way these states define their borders. Throughout history, political entities have expanded from basic systems of [[self-governance]] and [[monarchy]] to the complex [[democracy|democratic]] and totalitarian systems that exist today. In parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type  [[Border|boundaries]], to the national definite boundaries existing today.

==Ancient history==

--&gt;In ancient history, [[Ancient civilizations|civilizations]] did not have definite boundaries as states have today, and their borders could be more accurately described as [[frontier]]s. [[Sumer#Early Dynastic Period|Early dynastic Sumer]], and [[Ancient Egypt#Early Dynastic Period|early dynastic Egypt]] were the [[first civilization]]s to define their [[border]]s. Moreover, for the past 200,000 years and up to the twentieth century, many people have lived in non-state societies. These range from relatively egalitarian [[Band society|bands]] and [[tribe]]s to complex and highly stratified [[chiefdom]]s.

The first states of sorts were those of early dynastic Sumer and early dynastic Egypt, which arose from the [[Uruk period]] and [[Predynastic Egypt]] respectively at approximately 3000BCE.&lt;ref name="ancientlocations"&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniel |first=Glyn |authorlink=Glyn Daniel |title=The First Civilizations: The Archaeology of their Origins |origyear=1968 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx9FAAAAMAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=New York |isbn=1-84212-500-1 |pages=xiii |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early dynastic [[Egypt]] was based around the [[Nile River]] in the north-east of [[Africa]], the kingdom's boundaries being based around the Nile and stretching to areas where [[oasis|oases]] existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniel |first=Glyn |authorlink=Glyn Daniel |title=The First Civilizations: The Archaeology of their Origins |origyear=1968 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx9FAAAAMAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=New York |isbn=1-84212-500-1 |pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early dynastic [[Sumer]] was located in southern [[Mesopotamia]] with its borders extending from the [[Persian Gulf]] to parts of the [[Euphrates River|Euphrates]] and [[Tigris River|Tigris]] [[river]]s.&lt;ref name="ancientlocations"/&gt;

By 2500 BCE the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], located in modern-day India, Pakistan and Afghanistan had formed. The civilization's boundaries extended 600&amp;nbsp;km inland from the [[Arabian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Patrica S |author2=Stephen G Hyslop |author3=[[Douglas Brinkley]] |author4=Esther Ferington |author5=Lee Hassig |author6=Dale-Marie Herring |editor=Toni Eugene |title=Almanac of World History |year=2003 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |isbn=0-7922-5092-3 |pages=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5gPAQAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

336 BCE saw the rise of [[Alexander the Great]], who forged an empire from various vassal states stretching from modern [[Greece]] to the Indian subcontinent, bringing Mediterranean nations into contact with those of central and southern Asia, much as the Persian Empire had before him. The boundaries of this empire extended hundreds of kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=de Blois |first=Lukas |author2=[[Robartus van der Spek]] |title=An Introduction to the Ancient World |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, US |isbn=0-415-12773-4 |pages=131 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9o3Ti6H2_BQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Empire (27 BCE - 476 CE) was the first western civilization known to accurately define their borders, although these borders could be more accurately described as frontiers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wrt-intertext.syr.edu/IX/arras.html |title=A World Defined By Boundaries |accessdate=2008-11-21 |work=Intertext |publisher=Syracuse University |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the Empire defining its borders with precision, the borders were allowed to trail off and were, in many cases, part of territory indirectly ruled by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=David H |author2=Jouni Häkli |title=Boundaries and Place: European Borderlands in Geographical Context |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edb-7VL6H0cC |year=2002 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0-8476-9883-1 |pages=19 |chapter=The 'Civilisational' Roots of European National Boundaries |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=edb-7VL6H0cC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman and Greek ideals of nationhood can be seen to have strongly influenced Western views on the subject, with the basis of many governmental systems being on authority or ideas borrowed from Rome or the Greek city-states. Notably, the European states of the Dark Ages and Middle Ages gained their authority from the Roman Catholic religion, and modern democracies are based in part on the example of Ancient Athens.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

After the death of Prophet [[Muhammad]] in 632, the [[Quran]] and the teachings of [[Islam]] inspired the genesis of a new civilization. In less than a century, the Islamic [[Caliphate]] rapidly extended its reach from the Atlantic Ocean and Andalusia in the west to Central Asia in the east. The subsequent [[Muslim]] empires of the [[Umayyads]], [[Abbasids]], [[Fatimids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Seljuqs]], [[Safavids]], [[Mughals]], and [[Ottomans]] were among the most influential and distinguished powers in the world during Middle Ages. The period between the 8th and 13th century saw a flourishing of trade, as well as several advances in science, engineering, medicine and mathematics.
In Western Europe, briefly mostly united into a single state under [[Charlemagne]] around 800CE, a few countries, including [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]], had already effectively become [[nation state]]s by 1,000CE, with a kingdom ([[Icelandic Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] in Iceland's case) largely co-terminus with a people mostly sharing a language and culture.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Over most of the continent, the peoples were emerging around ethnic, linguistic and geographical groups, but this was not reflected in political entities. In particular, [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]], though recognised by other nations as countries where the [[French people|French]], [[Italian people|Italians]] and [[German people|Germans]] lived, did not exist as states largely matching the countries for centuries, and struggles to form them, and define their borders, as states were a major cause of wars in Europe until the 20th century. In the course of this process, some countries, such as [[Poland]] under the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]] and [[France]] in the [[High Middle Ages]], almost ceased to exist as states for periods. The [[Low Countries]], in the Middle Ages as distinct a country as France, became permanently divided, today into [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]. [[Spain]] was formed as a nation state by the dynastic union of small Christian kingdoms, augmented by the final campaigns of the [[Reconquista]] against [[Al-Andaluz]], the vanished country of Islamic [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

200 years after the Aztec and Toltec empires began, northern and central [[Asia]] saw the rise of the [[Mongol]] empire.

Exploiting opportunities left open by the Mongolian advance and recession as well as the spread of Islam, Russians took control of their homeland around 1613, after many years being dominated by the Tartars (Mongols). After gaining independence, the Russian princes began to expand their borders under the leadership of many [[tsars]].&lt;ref name="almanac"/&gt; Notably, [[Catherine the Great]] seized the vast western part of [[Ukraine]] from the [[Poles]], expanding Russia's size massively.

In the 15th and 16th centuries three major [[Muslim]] empires formed: the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empire in the Middle East, the Balkans and Northern Africa; the [[Safavid Empire]] in Greater Iran; and the [[Mughul]] Empire in South Asia. These imperial powers were made possible by the discovery and exploitation of [[gunpowder]] and more efficient administration. By the end of the 19th century, all three had declined, and by the early 20th century, with the Ottomans' defeat in [[World War I]], the last Muslim empire collapsed.

In 1700, [[Charles II of Spain]] died, naming [[Phillip of Anjou]], [[Louis XIV]]'s grandson, his heir. Charles' decision was not well met by the British, who believed that Louis would use the opportunity to ally [[France]] and [[Spain]] and attempt to take over Europe. Britain formed the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] with [[Holland]], [[Austria]] and a majority of the [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]] and declared war against Spain in 1702. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] lasted 11 years, and ended when the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] was signed in 1714.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frey|first=Marsha|author2=Linda Frey|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1995|edition=illustrated|isbn=0-313-27884-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrJmCvFY6ocC|accessdate=2009-01-29|title=The Treaties of the War of the Spanish Succession}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than 50 years later, in 1740, war broke out again, sparked by the invasion of [[Silesia]], part of [[Austria]], by King [[Frederick II of Prussia]].

Human '''prehistory''' is the period between the use of the first [[stone tools]] {{circa}} 3.3 million years ago by [[hominin]]s and the invention of [[Writing system|writing systems]]. The earliest writing systems appeared {{circa}} 5,300 years ago, but it took thousands of years for writing to be widely adopted and it was not used in some human cultures until the 19th century or even until present. The end of prehistory therefore came at very different dates in different places, and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently.

[[Sumer]] in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus valley civilization]] and [[ancient Egypt]] were the first civilizations to develop their own scripts, and to keep historical records; this took place already during the early [[Bronze Age]]. Neighboring civilizations were the first to follow. Most other civilizations reached the end of prehistory during the [[Iron Age]].  The [[three-age system]] of division of prehistory into the [[Stone Age]], followed by the Bronze Age and Iron Age, remains in use for much of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]], but is not generally used in those parts of the world where [[metalworking|the working of hard metals]] arrived abruptly with contact with [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian cultures]], such as [[the Americas]], [[Oceania]], [[Australasia]] and much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].  These areas also, with some exceptions in [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian civilizations]] in the Americas, did not develop complex writing systems before the arrival of Eurasians, and their prehistory reaches into relatively recent periods; for example 1788 is usually taken as the end of the [[prehistory of Australia]].     

The period when a culture is written about by others, but has not developed its own writing is often known as the [[protohistory]] of the culture.  By definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary Entry|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/prehistory|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no written records from human prehistory, so dating of prehistoric materials is crucial. Clear techniques for dating were not well-developed until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Graslund, Bo. 1987. ''The birth of prehistoric chronology.'' Cambridge:Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is concerned with human prehistory, the time since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appeared until the beginning of recorded history. Earlier periods are also called "prehistoric"; there are separate articles for the overall [[history of the Earth]] and the [[history of life]] before humans.

;Beginning: The term "prehistory" can refer to the vast span of time since the [[big bang|beginning]] of the [[Universe]] or the Earth, but more often it refers to the period since [[life]] appeared on Earth, or even more specifically to the time since human-like beings appeared.&lt;ref name="fagan07"&gt;Fagan, Brian. 2007. ''World Prehistory: A brief introduction'' New York: Prentice-Hall, Seventh Edition, Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="renfrew"&gt;Renfrew, Colin. 2008. ''Prehistory: The Making of the Human Mind.'' New York: Modern Library&lt;/ref&gt;
;End:The date marking the end of prehistory in a particular culture or region, that is, the date when relevant [[List of languages by first written accounts|written historical]] records become a useful academic resource, varies enormously from region to region. For example, in [[Egypt]] it is generally accepted that prehistory ended around 3200 BCE, whereas in [[New Guinea]] the end of the prehistoric era is set much more recently, at around 1900 [[Common Era|common era]]. In Europe the relatively well-documented classical cultures of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] had neighbouring cultures, including the [[Celts]] and to a lesser extent the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], with little or no writing, and historians must decide how much weight to give to the often highly prejudiced accounts of these "prehistoric" cultures in Greek and Roman literature.
;Time periods: In dividing up human prehistory in Eurasia, historians typically use the [[three-age system]], whereas scholars of pre-human time periods typically use the [[chronostratigraphy|well-defined]] [[geologic record]] and its internationally defined [[stratum]] base within the [[era (geology)|geologic time scale]]. The three-age system is the [[periodization]] of human prehistory into three consecutive [[time period]]s, named for their respective predominant tool-making technologies:
:*[[Stone Age]]
:*[[Bronze Age]]
:*[[Iron Age]]&lt;ref name="Minds"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Matthew Daniel Eddy (Ed.) |title=Prehistoric Minds: Human Origins as a Cultural Artefact |date=2011 |publisher=Royal Society of London |url=https://www.academia.edu/3088568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the term===
The notion of "prehistory" began to surface during the Enlightenment in the work of antiquarians who used the word 'primitive' to describe societies that existed before written records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=Matthew Daniel |title=The Line of Reason: Hugh Blair, Spatiality and the Progressive Structure of Language |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society |year=2011 |volume=65 |pages=9–24 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1112084 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0098}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the word prehistory in English, however, occurred in the ''Foreign [[Quarterly Review]]'' in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Prehistoric Mind as a Historical Artefact|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|year=2011|volume=65|pages=1–8|url=https://www.academia.edu/1130650|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the geologic time scale for pre-human time periods, and of the three-age system for human prehistory, is a system that emerged during the late nineteenth century in the work of British, German and Scandinavian [[Archaeology|archeologists]], [[Antiquarian|antiquarians]] and [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref name="Minds"/&gt;

==Means of research==
The main source for prehistory is [[archaeology]], but some scholars are beginning to make more use of evidence from the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name="Iberia"&gt;The Prehistory of Iberia: Debating Early Social Stratification and the State edited by María Cruz Berrocal, Leonardo García Sanjuán, Antonio Gilman. Pg 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge"&gt;Historical Archaeology: Back from the Edge. Edited by Pedro Paulo A. Funari, Martin Hall, Sian Jones. Pg 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pal"&gt;Through the Ages in Palestinian Archaeology: An Introductory Handbook. By Walter E. Ras. Pg 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been articulated by advocates of [[deep history]].

The primary researchers into human prehistory are archaeologists and physical [[anthropologists]] who use excavation, geologic and geographic surveys, and other scientific analysis to reveal and interpret the nature and behavior of pre-literate and non-literate peoples.&lt;ref name="fagan07"/&gt; Human population [[geneticists]] and [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] are also providing valuable insight for these questions.&lt;ref name="renfrew"/&gt; Cultural anthropologists help provide context for societal interactions, by which objects of human origin pass among people, allowing an analysis of any article that arises in a human prehistoric context.&lt;ref name="renfrew"/&gt; Therefore, data about prehistory is provided by a wide variety of natural and social sciences, such as [[paleontology]], [[biology]], [[archaeology]], [[palynology]], [[geology]], [[archaeoastronomy]], [[comparative linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[molecular genetics]] and many others.

Human prehistory differs from history not only in terms of its [[chronology]] but in the way it deals with the activities of [[archaeological culture]]s rather than named [[nation]]s or [[individual]]s. Restricted to material processes, remains and artifacts rather than written records, prehistory is anonymous. Because of this, reference terms that prehistorians use, such as [[Neanderthal]] or [[Iron Age]] are modern labels with definitions sometimes subject to debate.

== Stone Age ==
The concept of a "Stone Age" is found useful in the archaeology of most of the world, though in the [[archaeology of the Americas]] it is called by different names and begins with a [[Lithic stage]], or sometimes [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]].  The sub-divisions described below are used for Eurasia, and not consistently across the whole area. 

=== Palaeolithic ===

"Palaeolithic" means "Old Stone Age", and begins with the first use of [[stone tool]]s. The Paleolithic is the earliest period of the [[Stone Age]].

The early part of the Palaeolithic is called the [[Lower Palaeolithic]], which predates ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', beginning with ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (and related species) and with the earliest stone tools, dated to around 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;The Essence of Anthropology 3rd ed.

Pg 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of [[control of fire]] by early humans during the Lower Palaeolithic Era is uncertain and has at best limited scholarly support. The most widely accepted claim is that ''H. erectus'' or ''[[Homo ergaster|H. ergaster]]'' made fires between 790,000 and 690,000&amp;nbsp;BP (before the present period) in a site at [[Bnot Ya'akov Bridge]], [[Israel]]. The use of fire enabled early humans to cook food, provide warmth, and have a light source at night.

=== Mesolithic ===
{{Main|Mesolithic}}
[[File:Dugout boats Kierikki Centre Oulu 20130526.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Dugout canoe]]]]
The "Mesolithic", or "Middle Stone Age" (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "''mesos''", "middle", and "''lithos''", "stone") was a period in the development of human [[technology]] between the Palaeolithic and [[Neolithic]] periods of the Stone Age.

The Mesolithic period began at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, some 10,000 BP, and ended with [[Agriculture#History|the introduction of agriculture]], the date of which varied by geographic region. In some areas, such as the [[Near East]], agriculture was already underway by the end of the [[Pleistocene]], and there the Mesolithic is short and poorly defined. In areas with limited [[glacial]] impact, the term "[[Epipalaeolithic]]" is sometimes preferred.

Regions that experienced greater environmental effects as the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] ended have a much more evident Mesolithic era, lasting millennia. In [[Northern Europe]], societies were able to live well on rich food supplies from the [[marsh]]lands fostered by the warmer climate. Such conditions produced distinctive human behaviours that are preserved in the material record, such as the [[Maglemosian]] and [[Azilian]] cultures. These conditions also delayed the coming of the Neolithic until as late as 4000 BCE (6,000 [[Before Present|BP]]) in northern Europe.

Remains from this period are few and far between, often limited to [[midden]]s. In forested areas, the first signs of [[deforestation]] have been found, although this would only begin in earnest during the Neolithic, when more space was needed for [[agriculture]].

The Mesolithic is characterized in most areas by small composite [[flint]] tools — [[microlith]]s and [[microburin]]s. [[Fishing tackle]], stone [[adze]]s and wooden objects, e.g. [[canoe]]s and [[bow (weapon)|bows]], have been found at some sites. These technologies first occur in Africa, associated with the Azilian cultures, before spreading to Europe through the [[Ibero-Maurusian]] culture of Northern Africa and the [[Kebaran]] culture of the [[Levant]]. Independent discovery is not always ruled out.

Settlements became more permanent with some having circular houses with single rooms made of [[mudbrick]].

===Chalcolithic===
{{Main|Chalcolithic}}
[[File:Los Millares recreacion cuadro.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a Copper Age walled city, [[Los Millares]], [[Iberia]]]]
In Old World archaeology, the "Chalcolithic", "Eneolithic" or "Copper Age" refers to a transitional period where early [[copper]] metallurgy appeared alongside the widespread use of stone tools. During this period, some weapons and tools were made of copper. This period was still largely Neolithic in character. It is a phase of the [[Bronze Age]] before it was discovered that adding [[tin]] to [[copper]] formed the harder [[bronze]]. The Copper Age was originally defined as a transition between the [[Neolithic]] and the Bronze Age. However, because it is characterized by the use of metals, the Copper Age is considered a part of the Bronze Age rather than the Stone Age.
[[File:TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Chalcolithic copper mine in [[Timna Valley]], [[Negev Desert]], [[Israel]]]]
An archaeological site in [[Serbia]] contains the oldest securely dated evidence of copper making at high temperature, from 7,500 years ago. The find in June 2010 extends the known record of copper smelting by about 800 years, and suggests that copper smelting may have been invented in separate parts of Asia and Europe at that time rather than spreading from a single source.&lt;ref name="archaeology.ws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbian site may have hosted first copper makers|author=|date=July 17, 2010|work=ScienceNews|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/60563/description/Serbian_site_may_have_hosted_first_copper_makers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[metallurgy]] may have occurred first in the [[Fertile Crescent]], where it gave rise to the Bronze Age in the [[4th millennium BCE]] (the traditional view), though finds from the [[Vinča culture]] in Europe have now been securely dated to slightly earlier than those of the Fertile Crescent. [[Timna Valley]] contains evidence of copper mining 9,000 to 7,000 years ago. The process of transition from [[Neolithic]] to Chalcolithic in the Middle East is characterized in archaeological stone tool assemblages by a decline in high quality raw material procurement and use. North Africa and the Nile Valley imported its iron technology from the [[Near East]] and followed the Near Eastern course of Bronze Age and [[Iron Age]] development. However the [[Iron Age]] and Bronze Age occurred simultaneously in much of Africa.

== Bronze Age ==
{{Main|Bronze Age}}
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|[[Ox]]-drawn [[plow]], [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], c. 1200 BCE.]]

The Bronze Age is the earliest period in which some civilizations have reached the end of prehistory, by introducing written records. The Bronze Age or parts thereof are thus considered to be part of prehistory only for the regions and civilizations who adopted or developed a system of keeping written records during later periods.  The [[History of writing|invention of writing]] coincides in some areas with the early beginnings of the Bronze Age. Soon after the appearance of writing, people started creating texts including written accounts of events and records of administrative matters.

The term Bronze Age refers to a period in human cultural development when the most advanced [[metalworking]] (at least in systematic and widespread use) included techniques for [[smelting]] [[copper]] and [[tin]] from naturally occurring outcroppings of ores, and then combining them to cast [[bronze]]. These naturally occurring ores typically included arsenic as a common impurity. Copper/tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before 3000 BCE. The Bronze Age forms part of the [[three-age system]] for prehistoric societies. In this system, it follows the [[Neolithic]] in some areas of the world.

While copper is a common ore, deposits of tin are rare in the [[Old World]], and often had to be traded or carried considerable distances from the few mines, stimulating the creation of extensive trading routes.  In many areas as far apart as China and England, the valuable new material was used for weapons but for a long time apparently not available for agricultural tools.  Much of it seems to have been hoarded by social elites, and sometimes deposited in extravagant quantities, from [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s and [[Copper Hoard Culture|Indian copper hoards]] to European [[hoard]]s of unused axe-heads.

By the end of the Bronze Age large states, which are often called empires, had arisen in Egypt, China, [[Anatolia]] (the [[Hittites]]) and [[History of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], all of them literate.

== Iron Age ==
{{Main|Iron Age|Classical antiquity}}

The Iron Age is not part of prehistory for all civilizations who had introduced written records during the Bronze Age. Most remaining civilizations did so during the Iron Age, often through conquest by the empires, which continued to expand during this period.  For example, in most of Europe conquest by the [[Roman Empire]] means that the term Iron Age is replaced by "Roman", "[[Gallo-Roman]]" and similar terms after the conquest.

In archaeology, the Iron Age refers to the advent of [[ferrous metallurgy]]. The adoption of [[iron]] coincided with other changes in some past cultures, often including more sophisticated agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles, which makes the archaeological Iron Age coincide with the "[[Axial Age]]" in the history of philosophy.  Although iron ore is common, the metalworking techniques necessary to use iron are very different from those needed for the metal used earlier, and iron was slow-spreading and for long mainly used for weapons, while bronze remained typical for tools, as well as art.

'''Sharp power''' is the use of manipulative diplomatic policies by one country to influence and undermine the political system of a target country.  Sharp power can include attempts by one country to manipulate and manage information about itself in the news media and educational systems of another country, for the purpose of misleading or dividing public opinion in a target country, or for masking or diverting attention away from negative information about itself.  

Sharp power is distinguished from [[soft power]], which are attractive policies that project a positive impression of one country and promote greater understanding with another country, ultimately to influence the decisions of another country through persuasion.  Soft power policies can include [[student exchange program|student exchanges]] and the sponsoring of [[Cultural diplomacy | cultural and sporting events]].  Sharp power is also distinct from [[hard power]], which are coercive policies by one country to compel another country into taking action or changing its decisions.  Hard power can include [[war | military force]], [[economic sanctions]], and [[coercive diplomacy|diplomatic threats]].  

The term "sharp power" was coined in November of 2017 by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]], and published in an article in [[Foreign Affairs | Foreign Affairs Magazine]], to describe aggressive and subversive policies employed by authoritarian governments as a projection of state power in democratic countries, policies that cannot be described as either hard power or soft power.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meaning of Sharp Power:  How Authoritarian States Project Influence|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2017-11-16/meaning-sharp-power|publisher=Foreign Affairs|author=Christopher Walker and Jessica Ludwig|date=Nov 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NED article specifically names the Russian state-funded [[RT (TV network) | RT News Network]] and the Chinese state-sponsored [[Confucius Institute | Confucius Institute educational partnerships]] as examples of sharp power.  According NED, autocratic states "are not necessarily seeking to 'win hearts and minds,' the common frame of reference for soft power efforts, but they are surely seeking to manipulate their target audiences by distorting the information that reaches them."  

Since 2018, the term "sharp power" has been used in news articles, scholarly discussions, and Congressional hearings.  Even representatives of the Chinese Communist Party have used the term, dismissing Western claims that their country has engaged in sharp power practices.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference spokesman addresses Western charges of China using 'sharp power'.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLe5ZF6qeX8|publisher=China Global Television Network|date=Mar 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shortwave relay stations''' are transmitter sites used by international broadcasters to extend their coverage to areas that cannot be reached easily from their home state. E.g., the BBC operates an extensive net of relay stations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WUO4U8L5N_cC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=BBC+Cyprus+relay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xZ2_zgGDoe&amp;sig=CvCV-2Gyiyhp3edNcWdIhBPelIc&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=4xkZSoOZO9LL_AaUwODrDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA168,M1 BBC Cyprus relay.] Retrieved 2011-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

These days the programs are fed to the relay sites by satellite, cable/optical fiber or the Internet. Frequencies, transmitter power and antennas depend on the desired coverage. Some regional relays even operate in the medium wave or FM bands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/institutional/2009/03/000000_listen.shtml How to listen to the BBC.] Retrieved 2011-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relay stations are also important to reach listeners in countries that practice [[radio jamming]]. Depending on the effect of the [[shortwave]] dead zone the target countries can jam the programs only locally, e.g. for bigger cities. For this purpose [[Radio Free Europe]]/[[Radio Liberty]] with studios in [[Munich]], Germany operated a relay station in Portugal, in the extreme west of Europe, to reach then-communist Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IQ8QN69KZQQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA113&amp;lpg=RA1-PA113&amp;dq=Radio+Free+europe+portugal+relay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SRxNpMwTc5&amp;sig=Lw1vvEYB7vrJ0fUJ_03252D7jX8&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=_x4ZSujpBYLK_gab443ZDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 Radio Free Europe.] Retrieved 2011-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations in design ==
Two and only one broadcasting technology couples all of the components of a traditional shortwave relay station into one unit: the [[ALLISS]] module. For persons totally unfamiliar with the concepts of how shortwave relay stations operate this design may be the most understandable.

The ALLISS module is a fully rotatable [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] system for high power (typically 500&amp;nbsp;kW only) [[shortwave radio]] [[broadcasting]]—it essentially is a '''self contained shortwave relay station'''.

Most of the world's shortwave relay stations do not use this technology, due to its cost (15m EUR per ALLISS module: Transmitter + Antenna + Automation equipment).

== Planning and design ==
A traditional shortwave relay station—depending on how many transmitters and antennas that it will have—may take up to two years to plan.  After planning is completed, it may take up to five years to construct the relay station.

The historically long design and planning cycle for shortwave relay stations ended in the 1990s. Many advanced software planning tools (not related to the relay station design proper) became available. Choosing a series of  sites for a relay station is about 100 times faster using [[Google Earth]], for example. With the modern graphical version of Ioncap, simplified propagation studies can completed in less than a week for any chosen site.

In some cases, existing relay stations can have their designs more or less duplicated, thus  speeding up development time. However, there is one general exception to this: the [[ALLISS]] Module. From initial planning to deployment of ALLISS Modules may take a mere 1.5 years to 9 months depending on the number of modules deployed at one time in a particular sector of a country.

=== Graphic examples ===
{{clear}}

=== How relay stations operate ===
These are considered general operating parameters:
* 20 hours per day, but geopolitical reasons may dictate some stations run 24 hours per day (a 168-hour week)
* Generally 360 days per year, depending on the number of redundant transmitters and antennas
* Relay Stations generally consume from 250 kilowatts (kW) to 10 megawatts (MW)
* A single 100&amp;nbsp;kW SW transmitter consumes 225&amp;nbsp;kW RMS as a general rule
* A single 300&amp;nbsp;kW SW transmitter consumes 625&amp;nbsp;kW RMS as a general rule
* Modulator efficiency: Class-B modulators have about a 65% efficiency level, but digital (PDM or PSM or hybrid variants) modulators have about an 85% efficiency level as a general rule (for Amplitude Modulation)
* Broadcast times and frequencies are under [[ITU]] regulation

=== How relay stations are designed ===
General requirements of shortwave relay stations:
* Road access (fairly universal)
* HVAC mains access building or transformer in the transmitter building itself
* Staff quarters (if the relay station is not fully automated)
* Incoming audio processing centre, but since the mid-1980s this has evolved into one to five rack units
* Transmitter hall (50&amp;nbsp;kW, 100&amp;nbsp;kW, 250&amp;nbsp;kW, 300&amp;nbsp;kW, 500&amp;nbsp;kW [[shortwave]] transmitter)
* Switch matrix (but these are not typically used by [[ALLISS]] modules)
* [[Balun]]s (but their use is not always required nor universal)
* [[antenna tuner]]s (sometimes called ATUs or [[roller coasters]] because of their appearance)
* Feeder lines (coax cable and open feeder lines are the most common feeders in use)
* HRS-type antennas, or occasionally [[log-periodic]] (horizontal)
* In parts of the developing world [[log-periodic]] (horizontal) antennas are used to provide less directional gain to a target area.

=== Where the broadcast programs go ===
* generally to target areas that are more than 300&amp;nbsp;km from the transmitter site
* most shortwave relay station target areas are 1500&amp;nbsp;km to 3500&amp;nbsp;km from the transmitter site

=== Mobile relay stations ===
The IEEE Book series "The History of International Broadcasting" (Volume I) describes mobile shortwave relay stations used by the German propaganda ministry during WWII, to avoid them being located by [[radio direction finding]] and bombed by the Allies.    They consisted of a generator truck, transmitter truck and an antenna truck, and are thought to have had a radiated power of about 50&amp;nbsp;kW.  Radio Industry Zagreb (RIZ Transmitters) currently produces mobile shortwave transmitters.

== Notable sites : Issoudun ==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The International broadcasting center of TDF (Télédiffusion de France) is at [[Issoudun]]/[[Saint-Aoustrille]].  As of 2011, Issoudun is utilized by [[TDF Group|TDF]] for [[shortwave]] transmissions. The site uses 12 rotary [[ALLISS]] antennas fed by 12 transmitters of 500&amp;nbsp;kW each to transmit shortwave broadcasts by [[Radio France Internationale]] (RFI), along with other broadcast services.

It was at once an action against censorship and surveillance, and a commemoration of late "open-Internet activist" [[Aaron Swartz]].&lt;ref name="International Business Times" /&gt; In the US, a main goal of the protest was to encourage passage of the [[USA Freedom Act]], a bill that seeks to reign in telephone data collection. Additionally, the banner urged people to call Congress and voice opposition to the [[FISA Improvements Act]], which the ACLU called "a dream come true for the NSA" that would "codify the NSA's unconstitutional call-records program and allow bulk collection of location data from mobile phone users."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wagstaff|first=Keith|title=Reddit, Tumblr and More Protest NSA With 'Day We Fight Back'|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/reddit-tumblr-more-protest-nsa-day-we-fight-back-n26416|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the US, the goal was similar. A ''Guardian'' op-ed described the activists' objective globally as "to push authorities toward policies favoring liberty and privacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gilmore|first=Dan|title=Get ready: the day we fight back against mass surveillance is coming|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/nsa-fighting-back-against-surveillence-state|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers posted to their website: "Together we will push back against powers that seek to observe, collect, and analyze our every digital action.Together, we will make it clear that such behavior is not compatible with democratic governance. Together, if we persist, we will win this fight."&lt;ref name=PC4,000 /&gt; Rainey Reitman, director of activism at the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]], said, "The idea is to really harness the outrage of the Internet community in speaking out in one big voice on Feb. 11." The protest comes a month after President Obama made a surveillance reform speech introducing his proposed changes to the collection of US citizens' data. Critics said the reformations wouldn't be "nearly enough".g&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite news |last=Hattem|first=Julian|title="The idea is to really harness the outrage of the Internet community in speaking out in one big voice on Feb. 11," said Rainey Reitman, the director of activism at the Electronic Frontier Foundation|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/197859-thousands-of-sites-to-protest-nsa-spying |publisher=The Hill|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers compared the February protest with the SOPA protest two years prior, saying, "Today we face a different threat, one that undermines the Internet and the notion that any of us live in a genuinely free society". The threats were 'International counterparts like [[Five Eyes]] and [[Tempora]], mass surveillance, and programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], Canada's [[Communications Security Establishment Canada|CSEC]] airport monitoring activities'.&lt;ref name=CH&gt;{{cite news |last=Rickwood|first=Lee|title=Protesting mass surveillance: Canada called to join The Day We Fight Back|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/technology/Protesting+mass+surveillance+Canada+called+join+Fight+Back/9468059/story.html|work=Calgary Herald|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

=== Promotion ===
The Day We Fight Back was promoted in a trailer for an upcoming documentary about Aaron Swartz, currently titled ''The Internet's Own Boy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/11/aaron-swartz-documentary_n_4578257.html |title=Aaron Swartz Documentary Clip Reveals Activist's Thoughts On NSA, Pushes Day Of Action |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] |first=Joanna |last=Zelman |date=January 11, 2014 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the clip, the late activist comments on [[Global surveillance|mass surveillance]]: "It is shocking to think that the accountability is so lax that they don't even have sort of basic statistics about how big the spying programme is. If the answer is, 'Oh, we're spying on so many people we can't possibly even count them,' then that's an awful lot of people." Five months after Swartz's death, the scale of a vast global surveillance program would be [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|revealed]] in great detail through the release of top-secret NSA documents by [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name="guardian20140111"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/11/aaron-swartz-death-first-anniversary |title=Hacking of MIT website marks first anniversary of Aaron Swartz's death |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Martin |last=Pengelly |date=January 11, 2014 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amy Goodman]] of [[Democracy Now!]] promoted The Day We Fight Back in an opinion article in the ''[[Athens News]]'', noting Swartz's role in the digital rights movement calling for "another fight for the freedom of the Internet" without him.&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.athensnews.com/ohio/article-41560-aaron-swartz-the-life-we-lost-and-the-day-we-fight-back.html |title=Aaron Swartz: The life we lost and the day we fight back |work=Athens News |first=Amy |last=Goodman |date=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reddit "Ask Me Anything" ===
Comparing the opposition to surveillance with the previous defeat of SOPA, in which Demand Progress and Aaron Swartz had been deeply involved, the organizers took to Reddit and called for a month of activities culminating in the February 11 "day of action"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1uw05k/aaron_swartz_passed_away_a_year_ago_tomorrow_we/ |title=Aaron Swartz passed away a year ago tomorrow.

Those participating were [[Cory Doctorow]] of [[BoingBoing]]; [[Brian Knappenberger]], who made the films ''The Internet's Own Boy'', a documentary about Aaron Swartz, and ''[[We Are Legion]]'', a film about the hacker group "Anonymous"; [[David Segal (politician)|David Segal]], co-founder of [[Demand Progress]]; Peter Eckersley of [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]; and [[Sina Khanifar]], website developer for "The Day We Fight Back" and several other activist projects.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Doctorow and Eckersley indicated they had been close friends of Swartz.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

:Two years ago, reddit and its users joined in fighting back against dangerous Internet censorship legislation during the SOPA protests. You blacked out your websites and started hundreds of creative campaigns to defeat a piece of legislation that threatened freedom on the Internet.

:In the last 6 months we've seen that government agencies, namely the NSA and GCHQ and others, have broken laws and twisted legal interpretations to create an infrastructure of mass surveillance of all of us online. This creates a dark form of censorship as people become afraid to speak freely -- and it's one that undermines our security and our right to privacy as well. As users of the Internet, we have a responsibility to defend its freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Segal|first=David|title=We are "The Day We Fight Back" Organizers, Ask Us Anything|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm761/we_are_the_day_we_fight_back_organizers_ask_us/|publisher=Reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspiration from Aaron Swartz ===
{{main|Aaron Swartz}}
[[File:Aaron Swartz profile.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aaron Swartz]]]] 
Aaron Swartz was an American activist who founded the online group [[Demand Progress]], known for its campaign against the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA). Swartz, a fellow at Harvard, was arrested by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department|MIT police]] after systematically downloading [[academic journal]] articles from [[JSTOR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/0711/MIT_also_pressing_charges_against_hacking_suspect.html |title=MIT also pressing charges against hacking suspect |first=Josh |last=Gerstein |date=July 22, 2011 |work=Politico |quote=[Swartz's] alleged use of MIT facilities and Web connections to access the JSTOR database ... resulted in two state felony charges for breaking into a 'depository' and breaking &amp; entering in the daytime, according to local prosecutors. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Commonwealth v.

[[Wikipedia]] did not participate. Reddit ... added an inconspicuous banner to its homepage. Sites like Tumblr, Mozilla and [[DuckDuckGo]], which were listed as organizers, did not include the banner on their homepages. The eight major technology companies—Google, [[Microsoft]], Facebook, AOL, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], Twitter, Yahoo and LinkedIn ... only participated Tuesday insofar as having a joint website flash the protest banner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/the-day-the-internet-didnt-fight-back/ |title=The Day the Internet Didn't Fight Back |work=[[The New York Times]] |series=Bits |first=Nicole |last=Perlroth |date=February 11, 2014 |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6360">The "'''too connected to fail'''" ('''TCTF''') concept refers to a [[financial institution]] which is so connected to other institutions that its failure would probably lead to a huge turnover in the whole system.&lt;ref&gt;Haldane, A.G. &amp; May R. M. (2011). Systemic Risk in Banking Ecosystems. ''Nature''. 469(7330): 351–5. {{doi|10.1038/nature09659}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the "[[too big to fail]]" theory, this approach takes into consideration the highly connected network feature of the financial system rather than the absolute size of one particular institution.

== Relevance of TCTF: systemic risk ==

The 2007/2008 [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis]] highlighted that a small turmoil can cause a big fallback in the financial system – mainly because financial institutions form a highly interconnected network. From a [[network science]] point of view this means that some nodes (institutions) have very high degree, i.e. they are linked to many other nodes. As a consequence, they play a central role in the system, which can be highly important in the case of disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;Chan-Lau, J. A. (2010). Balance Sheet Network Analysis of Too-Connected-to-Fail Risk in Global and Domestic Banking Systems. ''IMF Working Paper''. WP/10/107. April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of this effect led to the revival of [[macroprudential regulation]].

== Measuring TCTF ==

Determining which institute is TCTF is not as straightforward as in the case of the "[[too big to fail]]" theory. In this case one doesn't have easily measurable metrics like assets’ value or the volume of financial services. However, there are some approaches trying to establish a clear method in order to identify the key institutions in the network.

=== Eigenvector Centrality ===

Nacaskul&lt;ref&gt;Nacaskul, P. (2010) Systemic Import Analysis (SIA) – Application of Entropic Eigenvector Centrality (EEC) Criterion for a Priori Ranking of Financial Institutions in Terms of Regulatory-Supervisory Concern, with Demonstrations on Stylised Small Network Topologies and Connectivity Weights, 14 May 2010, Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Asian Research Financial Stability Network Workshop, 29 March 2012, Bank Negara Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur. {{ssrn|1618693}}. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.1618693}}.&lt;/ref&gt; posits that a financial institution is systemically important if it is highly connected (e.g. via [[interbank lending market]]/[[money market]] channel) to systemically important banks. Those, in turn, are systemically important if they are highly connnected to systemically important banks, and so on. The recursive definition is equivalent to performing [[eigendecomposition of a matrix]] of connectivity weights and assigning systemic importance in proportion to the values of the principal eigenvector. The "entropic" factor correction is introduced therein to correct for the possibility that performing eigendecomposition on weighted connectivity matrices may occasionally yield "degenerate" systemic importance scores (all financial institutions identical in terms of systemic importance). Nacaskul &amp; Sabborriboon&lt;ref&gt;Nacaskul, P. &amp; Sabborriboon, W. (2011) Systemic Risk – Identification, Assessment and Monitoring based on Eigenvector Centrality Analysis of Thai Interbank Connectivity Matrices, 27 December 2011. {{ssrn|2710476}}. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.2710476}}.&lt;/ref&gt; then extends the Systemic Importance Analysis (SIA) above, which focuses on systemic leverage each individual financial institution exerts on the overall system, to Systemic Vulnerability Analysis (SVA), whereby the overall system is assessed as to how vulnerable it is to disproportionate systemic leverages exerted by individual financial institutions, and applied the methodology to Thai interbank money-market funding matrix.

=== Node degree ===

If one defines the links connecting the different nodes in the network, then the TCTF feature of a certain node can be examined using [[network science]] methodology. The most simple way of thinking about the role of an institution is the number of connections it has, which is called the degree of the node. Depending on the type of the network one can define in and out-degree. Knowing the key players one can test the risk involved in the network by simulating targeted attacks (shocks).

One example for this method is the paper of León et al.,&lt;ref&gt;León, C., Machado, C., Cepeda, F. &amp; Sarmiento, M. (2011) Too-Connected-To-Fail Institutions and Payments System's Stability: Assessing Challenges for Financial Authorities. ''Borradores de Economia''. No. 644, 2011. {{ssrn|2101221}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which analyzed the systemic risk within Colombia’s financial market. They defined an institution's in-degree as its share in total traded value, and the out-degree as its share of total number of connections based on transactions in the paying system. Using these metrics they constructed an index of [[centrality]] that let them identify the key institutions in the system, and made it possible to test the network's resistance to shocks.

=== DebtRank (feedback centrality) ===

Another way to measure the TCTF feature of an institution is based on the concept of feedback [[centrality]]. One example for this is the DebtRank introduced in the paper of Battiston et al.&lt;ref&gt;Battiston, S., Puliga, M., Kaushik, R., Tasca, P. &amp; Caldarelli, G. (2012). [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00541 DebtRank: Too Central to Fail? Financial Networks, the FED and Systemic Risk]. ''Scientific Reports'' 2. 541. 2 August 2012. {{doi|10.1038/srep00541}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors defined financial institutions as nodes and directed edges as lending relations weighted by the amount of outstanding debt. Then, they computed the DebtRank for every node, which measures that in the case of the distress of the particular node what fraction of the total economic value is potentially affected. By doing this they identified the key financial institutions in the US between 2008 and 2010.

'''Triadization''' (or '''triadisation''') is a proposed alternative to the theory of [[globalization]]. It states that political, economic and [[Social integration|socio-cultural integration]] have been limited to three regions of the world: [[Japan]] and the [[newly industrialized countries]] of [[Southeast Asia]], [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt; Milward, Bob. Globalisation?: Internationalisation and Monopoly Capitalism : Historical Processes and Capitalist Dynamism. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Outside of these regions, according to the theory, the effects of so-called "globalization" have not been felt, and hence it cannot be truly called "global". Instead, the [[economic interdependence]] between the countries of the "triad" supposedly leads to the alienation of the [[developing world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dadalos.org/globalisation/grundkurs_2/triadisierung.htm |title=D@dalos - Globalisation: Triadisation |publisher=Dadalos.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011821/http://www.dadalos.org/globalisation/grundkurs_2/triadisierung.htm |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This alienation is described by the theory as the result of the fact that "fragmentation of the world into regional blocks is taking place, featured in the tendency to strengthen economic interdependence and transactions within them but not among them". &lt;ref&gt;Tadic, Tadija. "The Globalization Debate: The Sceptics." PANOECONOMICUS (2006): 179-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This further entrenches the position of the triad, and prevents the growth of the rest of the world.

'''Water scarcity''' is the lack of [[fresh water]] resources to meet [[Capitalism#Supply and demand|water demand]]. It affects every continent and was listed in 2015 by the [[World Economic Forum]] as the largest [[Global Risks Report|global risk]] in terms of potential impact over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/01/why-world-water-crises-are-a-top-global-risk/ |title=Water crises are a top global risk |publisher=World Economic Forum |date=16 January 2015 |access-date=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is manifested by partial or no satisfaction of expressed demand, economic competition for water quantity or quality, disputes between users, irreversible depletion of [[groundwater]], and negative impacts on the [[Environment (biology)|environment]].&lt;ref name="FAO2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3015e/i3015e.pdf |title=Coping with water scarcity.

A mere 0.014% of all [[Water distribution on Earth|water on Earth]] is both fresh and easily [[Water supply|accessible]]. Of the remaining water, 97% is saline and a little less than 3% is hard to access. Technically, there is a sufficient amount of freshwater on a global scale. However, due to unequal distribution (exacerbated by [[climate change]]) resulting in some very wet and some very dry geographic locations, plus a sharp rise in global freshwater demand in recent decades driven by industry, humanity is facing a '''water crisis'''. Demand is expected to outstrip supply by 40% in 2030, if current trends continue.&lt;ref name="weforum17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCDO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdo.nl/sites/default/files/Globaliseringsreeks%203%20Water.pdf |title=Water, bron van ontwikkeling, macht en conflict |publisher=NCDO, Netherlands |date=8 January 2012 |access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of global water scarcity is the geographic and temporal mismatch between [[freshwater]] demand and availability.&lt;ref&gt;S. L. Postel, G. C. Daily, P. R. Ehrlich, Human appropriation of renewable fresh water. [[Science (journal)|Science]] '''271''', 785–788 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. H. G.

Threats |work= WWF |year = 2013 |access-date = 20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the global level and on an annual basis, enough freshwater is available to meet such demand, but [[Spatial analysis|spatial]] and temporal variations of water demand and availability are large, leading to (physical) water scarcity in several parts of the world during specific times of the year.&lt;ref name="7 billion" /&gt; All causes of water scarcity are related to human interference with the [[water cycle]]. Scarcity varies over time as a result of natural [[hydrology|hydrological]] variability, but varies even more so as a function of prevailing economic policy, planning and management approaches. Scarcity can be expected to intensify with most forms of [[economic development]], but, if correctly identified, many of its causes can be predicted, avoided or mitigated.&lt;ref name="FAO2012"/&gt;

Some countries have already proven that decoupling water use from [[economic growth]] is possible. For example, in Australia, water consumption declined by 40% between 2001 and 2009 while the economy grew by more than 30%.&lt;ref name="decoupling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.unep.org/northamerica/news/2016/half-world-face-severe-water-stress-2030-unless-water-use-decoupled-economic-growth-says |title=Half the world to face severe water stress by 2030 unless water use is "decoupled" from economic growth, says International Resource Panel |publisher=[[UN Environment]] |date=21 March 2016 |access-date=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Resource Panel]] of the [[United Nations|UN]] states that governments have tended to invest heavily in largely inefficient solutions: mega-projects like [[dam]]s, [[canal]]s, [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s, pipelines and water reservoirs, which are generally neither environmentally sustainable nor economically viable. The most [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]] way of decoupling water use from economic growth, according to the scientific panel, is for [[government]]s to create [[Systems ecology|holistic]] water [[Integrated water resources management|management plans]] that take into account the entire water cycle: from source to distribution, economic use, [[Water treatment|treatment]], [[Reclaimed water|recycling]], reuse and return to the environment.&lt;ref name="decoupling" /&gt;

==Supply &amp; demand==
[[File:GlobalWaterWithdrawals.jpg|thumb|Global use of freshwater, 2016 FAO data]]
[[File:Annualglobalwaterconsumption.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Global water consumption 1900-2025, by region, in billions m3 per year]]
The total amount of easily accessible freshwater on Earth, in the form of [[surface water]] ([[rivers]] and [[lakes]]) or [[groundwater]] (in [[aquifer]]s, for example), is 14.000 cubic kilometres (nearly 3359 cubic miles). Of this total amount, 'just' 5.000 cubic kilometres are being used and reused by humanity. Hence, in theory, there is more than enough freshwater available to meet the demands of the current world population of 7 billion people, and even support [[population growth]] to 9 billion or more. Due to the unequal geographical distribution and especially the unequal consumption of water, however, it is a scarce resource in some parts of the world and for some parts of the population.&lt;ref name="NCDO" /&gt;

Scarcity as a result of consumption is caused primarily by the extensive use of water in [[agriculture]]/[[Animal husbandry|livestock breeding]] and [[industry]]. People in developed countries generally use about 10 times more water daily than those in [[developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="nextgrcr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/08/how-water-shortages-lead-food-crises-conflicts |title=Why fresh water shortages will cause the next great global crisis |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 March 2015 |access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of this is ''indirect use'' in water-intensive agricultural and industrial production processes of [[consumer goods]], such as fruit, oil seed crops and cotton. Because many of these production chains have been globalised, a lot of water in developing countries is being used and polluted in order to produce goods destined for consumption in developed countries.&lt;ref name="NCDO" /&gt;

==Physical  &amp;  economic scarcity==
Water scarcity can result from two mechanisms:

* [[physical water scarcity|physical (absolute) water scarcity]]
* [[economic water scarcity]]

Physical water scarcity results from inadequate natural water resources to supply a region's demand, and economic water scarcity results from poor management of the sufficient available water resources. According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]], the latter is found more often to be the cause of countries or regions experiencing water scarcity, as most countries or regions have enough water to meet household, industrial, agricultural, and environmental needs, but lack the means to provide it in an accessible manner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;United Nations Development Programme (2006). [http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-report-2006 Human Development Report 2006: Beyond Scarcity–Power, Poverty and the Global Water Crisis]. Basingstoke, United Kingdom:Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;
Around one fifth of the world's population currently live in regions affected by [[Physical water scarcity]], where there is inadequate water resources to meet a country's or regional demand, including the water needed to fulfill the demand of ecosystems to function effectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is over development of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater as well as other forms of exploitation or overuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2006_Chapter_4.pdf|title = Water scarcity, risk and vulnerability|accessdate = 2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic water scarcity]] is caused by a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers or other water sources, or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. One quarter of the world's population is affected by economic water scarcity. Economic water scarcity includes a lack of infrastructure, causing the people without reliable access to water to have to travel long distances to fetch water, that is often contaminated from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Large parts of Africa suffer from economic water scarcity; developing water infrastructure in those areas could therefore help to reduce poverty. Critical conditions often arise for economically poor and politically weak communities living in already dry environment. Consumption increases with GDP per capita in most developed countries the average amount is around 200–300 litres daily. In underdeveloped countries (e.g. African countries such as Mozambique), average daily water consumption per capita was below 10 L. This is against the backdrop of international organisations, which recommend a minimum of 20 L of water (not including the water needed for washing clothes), available at most 1&amp;nbsp;km from the household. Increased water consumption is correlated with increasing income, as measured by GDP per capita. In countries suffering from water shortages water is the subject of speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =Drought and water shortages in Asia as a threat and economic problem|journal=Journal of Modern Science|date= 2015|accessdate=5 August 2016|location= Józefów|pages= 235–250|url= http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.desklight-95d2a7ec-8c5f-474d-84ed-8b8baed8f8c0/c/235_PDFsam_Joms_3_26_2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human right to water==
[[File:Mwamongu water source.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In [[Meatu district]], [[Simiyu Region]], Tanzania (Africa), water most often comes from open holes dug in the sand of dry riverbeds, and it is invariably contaminated. Many children are deprived of an education primarily due to this daily task.&lt;ref name="safe"&gt;[https://www.unicef.org/media/media_53234.html Lack of safe water and sanitation in schools affects children’s learning – and their lives] [[Unicef]] Published 5 April 2010.

Retrieved 03 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Further|Right to water}}
The [[United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] established a foundation of five core attributes for water security. They declare that the human [[right to water]] entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible, and affordable water for personal and domestic use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Millennium Development Goals (MDG)===
{{Main|Millennium Development Goals}}
At the 2000 [[Millennium Summit]], the United Nations addressed the effects of economic water scarcity by making increased access to safe drinking water an international development goal. During this time, they drafted the Millennium Development Goals and all 189 UN members agreed on eight goals. MDG 7 sets a target for reducing the proportion of the population without sustainable safe drinking water access by half by 2015. This would mean that more than 600 million people would gain access to a safe source of drinking water. In 2016, the  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] replaced the Millennium Development Goals

==Effects on environment==
Water scarcity has many negative impacts on the environment, including lakes, rivers, wetlands and other fresh water resources. The resulting water overuse that is related to water scarcity, often located in areas of irrigation agriculture, harms the environment in several ways including increased [[salinity]], [[nutrient pollution]], and the loss of [[floodplains]] and wetlands.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article77.html|title = Water Scarcity Index – Vital Water Graphics|accessdate = 20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, water scarcity makes flow management in the rehabilitation of urban streams problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.E. Lawrence |author2=C.P.W. Pavia |author3=S. Kaing|author4=H.N. Bischel|author5=R.G. Luthy|author6= V.H. Resh |title= Recycled Water for Augmenting Urban Streams in Mediterranean-climate Regions: A Potential Approach for Riparian Ecosystem Enhancement |journal=Hydrological Sciences Journal |year=2014 |volume=59 |pages= 488–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the last hundred years, more than half of the Earth's wetlands have been destroyed and have disappeared.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These wetlands are important not only because they are the habitats of numerous inhabitants such as mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and [[invertebrates]], but they support the growing of rice and other food crops as well as provide [[water filtration]] and protection from storms and flooding. Freshwater lakes such as the [[Aral Sea]] in central Asia have also suffered. Once the fourth largest freshwater lake, it has lost more than 58,000 square km of area and vastly increased in salt concentration over the span of three decades.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Subsidence, or the gradual sinking of landforms, is another result of water scarcity. The [[U.S. Geological Survey]] estimates that subsidence has affected more than 17,000 square miles in 45 U.S. states, 80 percent of it due to groundwater usage. In some areas east of [[Houston, Texas]] the land has dropped by more than nine feet due to subsidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/scarcity/surprisingcosts.php Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution] Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Retrieved 2/10/14.&lt;/ref&gt; Brownwood, a subdivision near [[Baytown, Texas]], was abandoned due to frequent flooding caused by subsidence and has since become part of the [[Baytown Nature Center]].

===Climate change===
[[Aquifer]] drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of [[fossil water]] increases the total amount of water within the hydrosphere subject to transpiration and evaporation processes, thereby causing accretion in water vapour and cloud cover, the primary absorbers of infrared radiation in the earth's atmosphere. Adding water to the system has a forcing effect on the whole earth system, an accurate estimate of which hydrogeological fact is yet to be quantified.

==Depletion of freshwater resources==
[[File:AralShip.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An abandoned ship in the former [[Aral Sea]], near [[Aral, Kazakhstan]]]]
Apart from the conventional surface water sources of freshwater such as rivers and lakes, other resources of freshwater such as groundwater and glaciers have become more developed sources of freshwater, becoming the main source of clean water. [[Groundwater]] is water that has pooled below the surface of the Earth and can provide a usable quantity of water through springs or wells. These areas where groundwater is collected are also known as aquifers. [[Glaciers]] provide freshwater in the form [[meltwater]], or freshwater melted from snow or ice, that supply streams or springs as temperatures rise. More and more of these sources are being drawn upon as conventional sources' usability decreases due to factors such as pollution or disappearance due to climate changes. The exponential growth rate of the human population is a main contributing factor in the increasing use of these types of water resources.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;WWAP (World Water Assessment Programme). 2012. ''The United Nations World Water Development Report 4: Managing Water under Uncertainty and Risk''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groundwater===
Until recent 2015, groundwater was not a highly utilized resource. In the 1960s, more and more groundwater aquifers developed. Changes in knowledge, technology and funding have allowed for focused development into abstracting water from groundwater resources away from surface water resources. These changes allowed for progress in society such as the "agricultural groundwater revolution", expanding the irrigation sector allowing for increased food production and development in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Giordano, M. and Volholth, K. (ed.) 2007. ''The Agricultural Groundwater Revolution''. Wallingford, UK, Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International (CABI).&lt;/ref&gt; Groundwater supplies nearly half of all drinking water in the world.&lt;ref&gt;WWAP (World Water Assessment Programme). 2009. ''Water in a Changing World. World Water Development Report 3.'' Paris/London, UNESCO Publishing/Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; The large volumes of water stored underground in most aquifers have a considerable [[buffer capacity]] allowing for water to be withdrawn during periods of drought or little rainfall.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is crucial for people that live in regions that cannot depend on [[precipitation]] or surface water as a supply alone, instead providing reliable access to water all year round. As of 2010, the world's aggregated groundwater abstraction is estimated at approximately 1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per year, with 67% used for irrigation, 22% used for domestic purposes and 11% used for industrial purposes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The top ten major consumers of abstracted water (India, China, United States of America, Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Italy) make up 72% of all abstracted water use worldwide.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Groundwater has become crucial for the livelihoods and food security of 1.2 to 1.5 billion rural households in the poorer regions of Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture. 2007. ''Water for Food, Water for Life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture''. London/Colomb, Earthscan/International Water Management Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Although groundwater sources are quite prevalent, one major area of concern is the renewal rate or recharge rate of some groundwater sources. [[Abstracting]] from groundwater sources that are non-renewable could lead to exhaustion if not properly monitored and managed.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S. and Loucks, D. 2006. ''Non-renewable Groundwater Resources''. UNESCO-IHP Groundwater series No. 10. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time. Reduction of natural outflows, decreasing stored volumes, declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping, induced salinity and other water quality changes, land subsidence, degraded springs and reduced baseflows. Human pollution is also harmful to this important resource.

To set up a big plant near a water abundant area, bottled water companies need to extract groundwater from a source at a rate more than the replenishment rate leading to the persistent decline in the groundwater levels. The groundwater is taken out, bottled, and then shipped all over the country or world and this water never goes back. When the water table depletes beyond a critical limit, bottling companies just move from that area leaving a grave water scarcity. Groundwater depletion impacts everyone and everything in the area who uses water: farmers, businesses, animals, ecosystems, tourism, and the regular guy getting his water from a well. Millions of gallons of water out of the ground leaves the water table depleted uniformly and not just in that area because the water table is connected across the landmass. Bottling Plants generate water scarcity and impact ecological balance. They lead to water stressed areas which bring in droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gasson |first1=Christopher |title=Don’t waste a drop |url=https://www.globalwaterintel.com/dont-waste-drop-water-mining/ |website=www.globalwaterintel.com |publisher=Mining Magazine |accessdate=30 August 2018 |ref=www.globalwaterintel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glaciers===
Glaciers are noted as a vital water source due to their contribution to [[stream flow]]. Rising global temperatures have noticeable effects on the rate at which glaciers melt, causing glaciers in general to shrink worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, K. 2005. The Karakoram Anomaly? Glacier expansion and the ‘elevation effect’, Karakoram Himalaya. Mountain Research and Development, Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 332–40&lt;/ref&gt; Although the meltwater from these glaciers are increasing the total water supply for the present, the disappearance of glaciers in the long term will diminish available water resources. Increased meltwater due to rising global temperatures can also have negative effects such as flooding of lakes and dams and catastrophic results.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, K., 1982. Natural Dams and Outburst Floods of the Karakoram Himalaya. Proceedings of the Symposium on Hydrological Aspects of Alpine and High Mountain Areas. International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) Publication No. 138. Wallingford, UK, IAHS Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
[[File:Collecting clean water in rural Sindh (5367575654).jpg|thumb|right|In 2012 in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] a shortage of clean water led people to queue to collect it where available]]
Hydrologists today typically assess water scarcity by looking at the population-water equation. This is done by comparing the amount of total available water resources per year to the population of a country or region. A popular approach to measuring water scarcity has been to rank countries according to the amount of annual water resources available per person. For example, according to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a country or region is said to experience "water stress" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When water supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, the country faces "water scarcity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations' [[FAO]] states that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/issues/scarcity.html FAO Hot issues: Water scarcity]. Fao.org. Retrieved on 27 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank adds that [[climate change]] could profoundly alter future patterns of both water availability and use, thereby increasing levels of water stress and insecurity, both at the global scale and in sectors that depend on water.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, 2009 {{cite web|url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi |title=Water and Climate Change: Understanding the Risks and Making Climate-Smart Investment Decisions |pages=21–24 |accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways of measuring water scarcity include examining the physical existence of water in nature, comparing nations with lower or higher volumes of water available for use. This method often fails to capture the accessibility of the water resource to the population that may need it. Others have related water availability to population.

Another measurement, calculated as part of a wider assessment of water management in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). (2007) [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Assessment/ ''Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.''] Earthscan/IWMI.&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used. It therefore divided water scarcity into 'physical' and 'economic'. [[Physical water scarcity]] is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. Water stress harms living things because every organism needs water to live.

===Renewable freshwater resources===
Renewable freshwater supply is a metric often used in conjunction when evaluating water scarcity. This metric is informative because it can describe the total available water resource each country contains. By knowing the total available water source, an idea can be gained about whether a country is prone to experiencing physical water scarcity. This metric has its faults in that it is an average; precipitation delivers water unevenly across the planet each year and annual renewable water resources vary from year to year. This metric also does not describe the accessibility of water to individuals, households, industries, or the government. Lastly, as this metric is a description of a whole country, it does not accurately portray whether a country is experiencing water scarcity. Canada and Brazil both have very high levels of available water supply, but still experience various water related problems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It can be observed that tropical countries in Asia and Africa have low availability of freshwater resources.

The following table displays the average annual renewable freshwater supply by country including both surface-water and groundwater supplies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.worldwater.org/datav7/data_table_1_total_renewable_freshwater_supply_by_country.pdf|title = Total Renewable Freshwater Supply, by Country|accessdate = 5 November 2013|website = The World's Water}}&lt;/ref&gt; This table represents data from the UN FAO AQUASTAT, much of which are produced by modeling or estimation as opposed to actual measurements.

==Water stress==
[[File:AfriqueStressHydrique2025.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|GEO-2000 estimate for 2025, 25 African countries are expected to suffer from water shortage or water stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GEO-2000 overview overview|url=http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO2000/pdfs/ov-e.pdf|website=unep.org|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[United Nations]] (UN) estimates that, of 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (1 quadrillion acre-feet) of water on [[Earth]], just 200,000 cubic kilometers (162.1 billion acre-feet) represent fresh water available for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution]. Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than one in every six people in the world is water stressed, meaning that they do not have sufficient access to potable water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those that are water stressed make up 1.1 billion people in the world and are living in developing countries. According to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a country or region is said to experience "water stress" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When a country is below 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, the country then faces water scarcity . In 2006, about 700 million people in 43 countries were living below the 1,700 cubic metres per person threshold.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Water stress is ever intensifying in regions such as China, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which contains the largest number of water stressed countries of any region with almost one fourth of the population living in a water stressed country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The world's most water stressed region is the Middle East with averages of 1,200 cubic metres of water per person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In China, more than 538 million people are living in a water-stressed region. Much of the water stressed population currently live in river basins where the usage of water resources greatly exceed the renewal of the water source.

===Changes in climate===
Another popular opinion is that the amount of available freshwater is decreasing because of [[climate change]]. Climate change has caused receding glaciers, reduced stream and river flow, and shrinking lakes and ponds. Many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly. Although the total fresh water supply is not used up, much has become polluted, salted, unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for drinking, industry and agriculture. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World’s Water Problems'' FT Press (USA), 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A New York Times article, "Southeast Drought Study Ties Water Shortage to Population, Not [[Global Warming]]", summarizes the findings of Columbia University researcher on the subject of the droughts in the American Southeast between 2005 and 2007. The findings published in the ''Journal of Climate'' say that the water shortages resulted from population size more than rainfall. Census figures show that Georgia’s population rose from 6.48 to 9.54 million between 1990 and 2007.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Dean, Cornelia (2 October 2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/science/earth/02drought.html Southeast Drought Study Ties Water Shortage to Population, Not Global Warming]. ''NY Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; After studying data from weather instruments, computer models, and tree ring measurements, they found that the droughts were not unprecedented and result from normal climate patterns and random weather events. "Similar droughts unfolded over the last thousand years", the researchers wrote, "Regardless of [[climate change]], they added, similar weather patterns can be expected regularly in the future, with similar results."&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt; As the temperature increases, rainfall in the Southeast will increase but because of [[evaporation]] the area may get even drier. The researchers concluded with a statement saying that any rainfall comes from complicated internal processes in the atmosphere and are very hard to predict because of the large amount of variables.

==Water crisis==
When there is not enough [[potable water]] for a given population, the threat of a ''water crisis'' is realized.&lt;ref name="Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet"&gt;[http://c-faculty.chuo-u.ac.jp/~mikenix1/tlr/rsch/iss/water/Water%20Reading%20X.pdf Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet]. Peopleandplanet.net (11 November 2002). Retrieved on 27 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations]] and other world organizations consider a variety of regions to have water crises of global concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17551&amp;Cr=&amp;Cr1 |title=World water crisis worsened by corruption, repression: UN report |publisher=Un.org |date=20 February 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060603001032/http://www.nrdc.org/international/summit/summit3.asp UN World Summit on Sustainable Development]. Released by NRDC at the World Summit for Sustainable Development, 29 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations, such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], argue that there are no water crises in such places, but steps must still be taken to avoid one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/news/2003/15254-en.html "No global water crisis – but may developing countries will face water scarcity"]. FAO.org. 12 March 2003.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of water crisis===
There are several principal manifestations of the water crisis.
* Inadequate access to safe [[drinking water]] for about 885 million people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inadequate access to [[sanitation]] for 2.5 billion people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_44093.html |title=Updated Numbers: WHO-UNICEF JMP Report 2008 |publisher=Unicef.org |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which often leads to [[water pollution]]
* [[Groundwater]] [[overdrafting]] (excessive use) leading to diminished [[agriculture|agricultural]] yields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/WORMKA/ |title=Water is Life – Groundwater drawdown |publisher=Academic.evergreen.edu |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overuse and [[pollution]] of water resources harming [[biodiversity]]
* Regional conflicts over scarce water resources sometimes resulting in [[war]]fare.

[[Waterborne diseases]] caused by lack of [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. For children under age five, waterborne diseases are a leading cause of death. According to the [[World Bank]], 88 percent of all waterborne diseases are caused by unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is the underlying tenuous balance of safe water supply, but controllable factors such as the management and distribution of the water supply itself contribute to further scarcity.

A 2006 United Nations report focuses on issues of governance as the core of the water crisis, saying "There is enough water for everyone" and "Water insufficiency is often due to mismanagement, corruption, lack of appropriate institutions, bureaucratic inertia and a shortage of investment in both human capacity and physical infrastructure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001444/144409E.pdf Water, a shared responsibility. The United Nations World Water Development Report 2], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Official data also shows a clear correlation between access to safe water and GDP per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.gapminder.org/videos/gapcasts/gapcast-9-public-services/
 | title=Public Services
 | publisher=Gapminder video
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed, primarily by economists, that the water situation has occurred because of a lack of property rights, government regulations and subsidies in the water sector, causing prices to be too low and consumption too high.&lt;ref&gt;Segerfeldt, Fredrik (25 August 2005), [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4462 "Private Water Saves Lives"], ''Financial Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zetland, David (1 August 2008) [http://aguanomics.com/2008/08/running-out-of-water.html "Running Out of Water"]. aguanomics.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zetland, David (14 July 2008) [http://aguanomics.com/2008/07/water-crisis.html "Water Crisis"]. aguanomics.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegetation and wildlife are fundamentally dependent upon adequate freshwater resources. [[Marsh]]es, [[bog]]s and [[riparian zone]]s are more obviously dependent upon sustainable water supply, but forests and other upland ecosystems are equally at risk of significant productivity changes as water availability is diminished. In the case of wetlands, considerable area has been simply taken from wildlife use to feed and house the expanding human population. But other areas have suffered reduced productivity from gradual diminishing of freshwater inflow, as upstream sources are diverted for human use. In seven states of the U.S. over 80 percent of all historic [[wetland]]s were filled by the 1980s, when Congress acted to create a "[[no net loss (wetlands)|no net loss]]" of wetlands.

In [[Europe]] extensive loss of wetlands has also occurred with resulting [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]]. For example, many bogs in [[Scotland]] have been developed or diminished through human population expansion. One example is the [[Portlethen Moss]] in [[Aberdeenshire]].

[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Deforestation in Madagascar|Deforestation of the Madagascar Highland Plateau]] has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]

On [[Madagascar]]'s highland plateau, a massive transformation occurred that eliminated virtually all the heavily forested vegetation in the period 1970 to 2000. The [[slash and burn]] agriculture eliminated about ten percent of the total country's native biomass and converted it to a barren wasteland. These effects were from [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the necessity to feed poor indigenous peoples, but the adverse effects included widespread gully erosion that in turn produced heavily silted rivers that "run red" decades after the [[deforestation]]. This eliminated a large amount of usable fresh water and also destroyed much of the riverine ecosystems of several large west-flowing rivers. Several fish species have been driven to the edge of extinction and some, such as the disturbed Tokios [[coral reef]] formations in the [[Indian Ocean]], are effectively lost.
In October 2008, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman and former chief executive of Nestlé, warned that the production of biofuels will further deplete the world's water supply.

===Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts===
There are many other countries of the world that are severely impacted with regard to [[human]] [[health]] and inadequate drinking water. The following is a partial list of some of the countries with significant populations (numerical population of affected population listed) whose only consumption is of contaminated water:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/specialsession/about/sgreport-pdf/03_SafeDrinkingWater_D7341Insert_English.pdf Safe Drinking Water]. WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sudan]] (12.3 million)
* [[Venezuela]] (5.0 million)
* [[Ethiopia]] (2.7 million)
* [[Tunisia]] (2.1 million)
* [[Cuba]] (1.3 million)
Several world maps showing various aspects of the problem can be found in this [https://www.newscientist.com/data/images/archive/2670/26700101.jpg graph] article.&lt;ref&gt;Chenoweth, Jonathan (28 August 2008) [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19926700.100-looming-water-crisis-simply-a-management-problem.html "Looming water crisis simply a management problem"]. ''[[New Scientist]]'', pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water deficits, which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as [[Chinese water crisis|China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HG21Df01.html |title=India grows a grain crisis |publisher=Atimes.com |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water tables are falling in scores of countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) due to widespread overpumping using powerful diesel and electric pumps. Other countries affected include [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Mexico]]. This will eventually lead to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even with the overpumping of its [[aquifers]], China is developing a grain deficit. When this happens, it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages. Unless population growth can be slowed quickly, it is feared that there may not be a practical non-violent or humane solution to the emerging world water shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Seg/PB2ch03_ss6.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331153400/http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Seg/PB2ch03_ss6.htm |archivedate=2009-03-31 |title=Water Scarcity Crossing National Borders |author=Brown, Lester R.|publisher=Earth Policy Institute|date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R.

After China and India, there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits — [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], Mexico, and Pakistan.

According to a UN climate report, the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] glaciers that are the sources of [[Asia]]'s biggest rivers – [[Ganges]], [[Indus]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yangtze]], [[Mekong]], [[Salween]] and [[Yellow]] – could disappear by 2035 as temperatures rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/42387/story.htm |title=Vanishing Himalayan Glaciers Threaten a Billion |publisher=Planetark.com |date=5 June 2007 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that the source used by the UN climate report actually stated 2350, not 2035.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8387737.stm|title=Himalayan glaciers melting deadline 'a mistake' |date=5 December 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 December 2009|first=Pallava|last=Bagla}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2.4 billion people live in the [[drainage basin]] of the Himalayan rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090215045754/http://www.peopleandplanet.net/pdoc.php?id=3024 Big melt threatens millions, says UN]. peopleandplanet.net. 4 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; India, China, Pakistan, [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Myanmar]] could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades.

==Outlook==
[[File:Madagascar well.jpg|thumb|Wind and solar power such as this installation in a village in northwest [[Madagascar]] can make a difference in safe water supply.]]

Construction of [[wastewater treatment]] plants and reduction of groundwater overdrafting appear to be obvious solutions to the worldwide problem; however, a deeper look reveals more fundamental issues in play. Wastewater treatment is highly [[capital intensive]], restricting access to this technology in some regions; furthermore the rapid increase in population of many countries makes this a race that is difficult to win. As if those factors are not daunting enough, one must consider the enormous costs and skill sets involved to maintain wastewater treatment plants even if they are successfully developed.

Reducing groundwater overdrafting is usually politically unpopular, and can have major economic impacts on farmers. Moreover, this strategy necessarily reduces crop output, something the world can ill-afford given the current population.

At more realistic levels, developing countries can strive to achieve primary wastewater treatment or secure [[septic system]]s, and carefully analyse wastewater outfall design to minimize impacts to drinking water and to ecosystems. Developed countries can not only share technology better, including cost-effective wastewater and water treatment systems but also in [[hydrological transport model]]ing. At the individual level, people in developed countries can look inward and reduce over consumption, which further strains worldwide water consumption. Both developed and developing countries can increase protection of ecosystems, especially wetlands and riparian zones. There measures will not only conserve [[biota (ecology)|biota]], but also render more effective the natural [[water cycle]] flushing and transport that make water systems more healthy for humans.

A range of local, low-tech solutions are being pursued by a number of companies. These efforts center around the use of solar power to distill water at temperatures slightly beneath that at which water boils. By developing the capability to purify any available water source, local business models could be built around the new technologies, accelerating their uptake. For example, Bedouins from the town of [[Dahab]] in Egypt have installed Aqua Danial's Water Stellar, which uses a solar thermal collector measuring two square meters to distill from 40 to 60 liters per day from any local water source. This is five times more efficient than conventional stills and eliminates the need for polluting plastic PET bottles or transportation of water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, Barry (1 December 2012), http://www.barrymansfield.com/pdf/easyJet%20Traveller%20December%202012%20Egypt%20edition.pdf  ''easy Jet Traveler''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global experiences in managing water crisis==
{{Essay-like|date=September 2009|section}}

It is alleged that the likelihood of conflict rises if the rate of change within the basin exceeds the capacity of institution to absorb that change.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com" /&gt; Although water crisis is closely related to regional tensions, history showed that acute conflicts over water are far less than the record of cooperation.

The key lies in strong institutions and cooperation. The Indus River Commission and the Indus Water Treaty survived two wars between India and Pakistan despite their hostility, proving to be a successful mechanism in resolving conflicts by providing a framework for consultation inspection and exchange of data. The Mekong Committee has also functioned since 1957 and survived the Vietnam War. In contrast, regional instability results when there is an absence of institutions to co-operate in regional collaboration, like Egypt's plan for a high dam on the Nile. However, there is currently no global institution in place for the management and management of trans-boundary water sources, and international co-operation has happened through ad hoc collaborations between agencies, like the Mekong Committee which was formed due to an alliance between UNICEF and the US Bureau of Reclamation. Formation of strong international institutions seems to be a way forward – they fuel early intervention and management, preventing the costly dispute resolution process.

One common feature of almost all resolved disputes is that the negotiations had a "need-based" instead of a "right–based" paradigm. Irrigable lands, population, technicalities of projects define "needs". The success of a need-based paradigm is reflected in the only water agreement ever negotiated in the Jordan River Basin, which focuses in needs not on rights of riparians. In the Indian subcontinent, irrigation requirements of Bangladesh determine water allocations of the Ganges River. A need-based, regional approach focuses on satisfying individuals with their need of water, ensuring that minimum quantitative needs are being met. It removes the conflict that arises when countries view the treaty from a national interest point of view, move away from the zero-sum approach to a positive sum, integrative approach that equitably allocated the water and its benefits.

The Blue Peace framework developed by Strategic Foresight Group in partnership with the Governments of Switzerland and Sweden offers a unique policy structure which promotes sustainable management of water resources combined with cooperation for peace. By making the most of shared water resources through cooperation rather than mere allocation between countries, the chances for peace can be increased.&lt;ref&gt;''Turkish Review'', March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Peace approach has proven to be effective in cases like the Middle East&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/40595Blue+Peace_Middle+East.pdf|title=Strategic Foresight Group - Anticipating and Influencing Global Future|website=www.strategicforesight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deza.admin.ch/en/Home/Projects/Selected_projects/Water_management_and_peace_promotion_in_the_Middle_East eda.base.components.templates.base.accessKeys].

'''Wilderness''' or '''wildland''' is a [[natural environment]] on [[Earth]] that has not been significantly modified by [[human]] activity. It may also be defined as: "The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet—those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The term has traditionally referred to terrestrial environments, though growing attention is being placed on  marine wilderness. Recent [https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017187 maps of wilderness] suggest it covers roughly one quarter of Earth's terrestrial surface, but is being [http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)30993-9 rapidly degraded by human activity]. Even less wilderness remains in the ocean, with only 13.2% [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.06.010 free from intense human activity]. 

Some governments establish them by law or administrative acts, usually in land tracts that have not been modified by human action in great measure. The main feature of them is that human motorized activity is significantly restricted. These actions seek not only to preserve what already exists, but also to promote and advance a natural expression and development. [[Wilderness areas]] can be found in preserves, conservation preserves, National Forests, National Parks and even in urban areas along rivers, [[gulch]]es or otherwise undeveloped areas. These areas are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], [[biodiversity]], ecological studies, [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], solitude, and [[recreation]]. Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, [[moral]], and [[aesthetic]] reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;No Man's Garden by Daniel B. Botkin p155-157&lt;/ref&gt; They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and provide habitat for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

The word ''wilderness'' derives from the notion of "wildness"—in other words, that which is not controlled by humans. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being "wilderness." Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered "wild." This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which [[Nature|natural processes]] operate without human interference.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The [[WILD Foundation]] states that [[wilderness areas]] have two dimensions: they must be biologically intact and legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/wilderness-areas-are-biologically-intact/ Wilderness Areas are Biologically Intact]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/wilderness-as-a-protected-area-classification/ Wilderness as a Protected Area Classification]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, Ia ([[Strict Nature Reserves]]) and Ib ([[Wilderness Areas]]). Activities on the margins of specific wilderness areas, such as [[Wildfire|fire]] suppression and the interruption of [[Bird migration|animal migration]] also affect the interior of wildernesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildland-network.org.uk/wn_what_wildland.htm|title=WHAT IS WILDLAND? - a review|accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in wealthier, industrialized nations, it has a specific legal meaning as well: as land where development is prohibited by [[law]]. Many nations have designated wilderness, including the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. Many new parks are currently being planned and legally passed by various [[Parliaments]] and [[Legislatures]] at the urging of dedicated individuals around the globe who believe that "in the end, dedicated, inspired people empowered by effective legislation will ensure that the spirit and services of wilderness will thrive and permeate our society, preserving a world that we are proud to hand over to those who come after us."&lt;ref&gt;Vance G.

===Ancient times and Middle Ages===
Looked at through the lens of the [[visual arts]], nature and wildness have been important subjects in various epochs of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] occurred in the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618-907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art. Artists in the tradition of [[Shan shui]] (lit. ''mountain-water-picture''), learned to depict mountains and rivers "from the perspective of nature as a whole and on the basis of their understanding of the laws of nature… as if seen through the eyes of a bird." In the 13th century, Shih Erh Chi recommended avoiding painting "scenes lacking any places made inaccessible by nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asia-art.net/chinese_tech_brush.html Chinese brush painting] Asia-art.net Retrieved on: 20 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of [[human history]], the greater part of the Earth's terrain was wilderness, and human attention was concentrated in settled areas. The first known laws to protect parts of nature date back to the Babylonian Empire and Chinese Empire. [[Ashoka]], the Great [[Mauryan]] King, defined the first laws in the world to protect [[flora and fauna]] in [[Edicts of Ashoka]] around 3rd Century B.C. In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kings of England]] initiated one of the world’s first conscious efforts to protect natural areas. They were motivated by a desire to be able to [[Hunting|hunt]] wild animals in private hunting preserves rather than a desire to protect wilderness. Nevertheless, in order to have animals to hunt they would have to protect wildlife from subsistence hunting and the land from villagers gathering firewood.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Similar measures were introduced in other European countries.

===19th century to present===
The idea of wilderness having intrinsic value emerged in the [[Western culture|Western world]] in the 19th century. [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Prior to that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth|William Wordsworth’s]] poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Retrieved: 20 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-19th century, in Germany, "Scientific Conservation," as it was called, advocated "the efficient utilization of [[natural resources]] through the application of [[science]] and [[technology]]." Concepts of forest management based on the German approach were applied in other parts of the world, but with varying degrees of success.&lt;ref name=Wilderness&gt;Akamani, K. (nd). [http://www.abetterearth.org/article.php/1346.html "The Wilderness Idea: A Critical Review."] A Better Earth.org. Retrieved: 1 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the 19th century wilderness became viewed not as a place to fear but a place to enjoy and protect, hence came the [[conservation movement]] in the latter half of the 19th century. Rivers were rafted and mountains were climbed solely for the sake of recreation, not to determine their geographical context.

In 1861, following an intense lobbying by artists (painters), the French Waters and Forests Military Agency set an « artistic reserve » in Fontainebleau State Forest. With a total of 1 097 hectares, it is known to be the first World nature reserve.

Global conservation became an issue at the time of the dissolution of the [[British Empire]] in [[Africa]] in the late 1940s. The British established great [[Nature reserves|wildlife preserves]] there. As before, this interest in conservation had an economic motive: in this case, [[Big-game hunter|big game hunting]]. Nevertheless, this led to growing recognition in the 1950s and the early 1960s of the need to protect large spaces for wildlife conservation worldwide. The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF), founded in 1961, grew to be one of the largest conservation organizations in the world.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Early conservationists advocated the creation of a legal mechanism by which boundaries could be set on human activities in order to preserve natural and unique lands for the enjoyment and use of future generations. This profound shift in wilderness thought reached a pinnacle in the US with the passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] of 1964, which allowed for parts of [[U.S. National Forest]]s to be designated as "wilderness preserves". Similar acts, such as the 1975 [[Eastern Wilderness Act]], followed.

Nevertheless, initiatives for wilderness conservation continue to increase. There are a growing number of projects to [[Tropical rainforest conservation|protect tropical rainforests]] through conservation initiatives. There are also large-scale projects to conserve wilderness regions, such as Canada's [[Boreal Forest Conservation Framework]]. The Framework calls for conservation of 50 percent of the 6,000,000 square kilometres of boreal forest in Canada's north.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Boreal Initiative [http://www.borealcanada.ca/framework-e.php Boreal Forest Conservation Framework] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208012102/http://www.borealcanada.ca/framework-e.php |date=8 December 2007 }}. www.borealcanada.ca Retrieved on: 1 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the World Wildlife Fund, organizations such as the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], the [[WILD Foundation]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[Conservation International]], [[The Wilderness Society (United States)]] and many others are active in such conservation efforts.

The 21st century has seen another slight shift in wilderness thought and theory. It is now understood that simply drawing lines around a piece of land and declaring it a wilderness does not necessarily make it a wilderness. All [[landscape]]s are intricately connected and what happens outside a wilderness certainly affects what happens inside it. For example, [[air pollution]] from [[Los Angeles]] and the California Central Valley affects Kern Canyon and [[Sequoia National Park]]. The national park has miles of "wilderness" but the air is filled with pollution from the valley. This gives rise to the paradox of what a wilderness really is; a key issue in 21st century wilderness thought.

The creation of [[National Park]]s, beginning in the 19th century, preserved some especially attractive and notable areas, but the pursuits of [[commerce]], [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], and [[recreation]] combined with increases in [[human population]] have continued to result in human modification of relatively untouched areas. Such human activity often negatively impacts native flora and fauna. As such, to better protect critical habitats and preserve low-impact recreational opportunities, legal concepts of "wilderness" were established in many countries, beginning with the United States (see below).

The first National Park was [[Yellowstone]], which was signed into law by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant on 1 March 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Mangan, E. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/yehtml/yeabout.html Yellowstone, the First National Park] ''Library of Congress,'' Mapping the National Parks. Retrieved on: 2010-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of Dedication declared Yellowstone a land "hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Magic of Yellowstone|url=http://www.yellowstone-online.com/history/yhfour.html|work=Congressional Acts Pertaining to Yellowstone|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's second national park, the [[Royal National Park]], located just 32&amp;nbsp;km to the south of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], was established in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;New South Wales National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, ''[http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/parks.nsf/parkContent/N0030?OpenDocument&amp;ParkKey=N0030&amp;Type=xo "Parks &amp; Reserves: Royal National Park"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820034120/http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/parks.nsf/parkContent/N0030?OpenDocument&amp;ParkKey=N0030&amp;Type=Xo |date=20 August 2006 }}''. Accessed 6 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. concept of national parks soon caught on in [[Canada]], which created [[Banff National Park]] in 1885, at the same time as the transcontinental [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] was being built. The creation of this and other parks showed a growing appreciation of wild nature, but also an economic reality. The railways wanted to entice people to travel west. Parks such as Banff and Yellowstone gained favor as the railroads advertised travel to "the great wild spaces" of North America. When outdoorsman Teddy Roosevelt became president of the United States, he began to enlarge the U.S. National Parks system, and established the National Forest system.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

By the 1920s, travel across North America by train to experience the "wilderness" (often viewing it only through windows) had become very popular. This led to the commercialization of some of [[National Parks of Canada|Canada's National Parks]] with the building of great hotels such as the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] and [[Chateau Lake Louise]].

Despite their similar name, national parks in [[England and Wales]] are quite different from [[national park]]s in many other countries. Unlike most other countries, in England and Wales, designation as a national park may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and land within a national park remains largely in private ownership. Each park is operated by its own [[national park authority]].

==Conservation and preservation in 20th century United States==
By the later 19th century it had become clear that in many countries wild areas had either disappeared or were in danger of disappearing. This realization gave rise to the [[conservation movement]] in the [[United States]], partly through the efforts of writers and activists such as [[John Burroughs]], [[Aldo Leopold]], and [[John Muir]], and politicians such as [[U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]].
[[File:Cook Lake Bridger Wilderness.jpg|right|upright=1.25|thumb|Cook Lake in the Bridger Wilderness, [[Bridger-Teton National Forest]], [[Wyoming]], U.S.]]

The idea of protecting nature for nature's sake began to gain more recognition in the 1930s with American writers like [[Aldo Leopold]], calling for a "land ethic" and urging wilderness protection. It had become increasingly clear that wild spaces were disappearing rapidly and that decisive action was needed to save them. Wilderness preservation is central to [[deep ecology]]; a philosophy that believes in an inherent worth of all living beings, regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs.&lt;ref name=barry&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics|author=John Barry|author2=E. Gene Frankland |publisher=Routledge|date=2002|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTB4OMgsxIEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two different groups had emerged within the US environmental movement by the early 20th century: the conservationists and the preservationists. The initial consensus among conservationists was split into "utilitarian conservationists" later to be referred to as conservationists, and "aesthetic conservationists" or preservationists. The main representative for the former was [[Gifford Pinchot]], first Chief of the United States Forest Service, and they focused on the ''proper use of nature,'' whereas the preservationists sought the ''protection of nature from use.''&lt;ref name="Wilderness" /&gt; Put another way, conservation sought to regulate human use while preservation sought to eliminate human impact altogether. The management of US public lands during the years 1960s and 70s reflected these dual visions, with conservationists dominating the Forest Service, and preservationists the Park Service&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Raymond A.|title=Introduction to Forest Science|date=1982|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-06438--6|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal wilderness designations==

=== International ===
The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, Ia (Strict Nature Preserves) and [https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46541 Ib (Wilderness areas)]. For the global standard of wilderness (1b) protection, governance and management, read [https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46541 Wilderness Protected Areas: Management Guidelines for IUCN Category 1b Protected Areas].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46541|title=Wilderness protected areas {{!}} IUCN Library System|website=portals.iucn.org|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been recent calls for the [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12976/full World Heritage Convention to better protect wilderness] and to include the word wilderness in their selection criteria for Natural Heritage Sites

Forty-eight countries have wilderness areas established via legislative designation as IUCN protected area management Category 1b sites that do not overlap with any other IUCN designation. They are: Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Bermuda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Canada, Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Finland, French Guyana, Greenland, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Norway, Northern Mariana Islands, Portugal, Seychelles, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Tanzania, United States of America, and Zimbabwe. At publication, there are 2,992 marine and terrestrial wilderness areas registered with the IUCN as solely Category 1b sites.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://protectedplanet.net/|title=The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=IUCN and UNEP-WCMC|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-two other countries have wilderness areas. These wilderness areas are established via administrative designation or wilderness zones within protected areas. Whereas the above listing contains countries with wilderness exclusively designated as Category 1b sites, some of the below-listed countries contain protected areas with multiple management categories including Category 1b. They are: Argentina, Bhutan, Brazil, Chile, Honduras, Germany, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Switzerland, Uganda, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Venezuela, and Zambia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===France===
Since 1861, the French Waters and Forests Military Agency (Administration des Eaux et Forêts) put a strong protection on what was called the « artistic reserve » in Fontainebleau State Forest. With a total of 1 097 hectares, it is known to be the first World nature reserve.

Then in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;1995 &amp; 1998 National Forests Office internal instructions in application of the last paragraph of article L. 212-2 of the French Forest Act&lt;/ref&gt; Integral Biological Reserves (Réserves Biologiques Intégrales, RBI) are dedicated to man free ecosystem evolution, on the contrary of Managed Biological reserves (Réserves Biologiques Dirigées, RBD) where a specific management is applied to conserve vulnerable species or threatened habitats.

Integral Biological Reserves occurs in French State Forests or City Forests and are therefore managed by the [[National Forests Office (France)|National Forests Office]]. In such reserves, all harvests coupe are forbidden excepted exotic species elimination or track safety works to avoid fallen tree risk to visitors (already existing tracks in or on the edge of the reserve).

At the end of 2014,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onf.fr/onf/sommaire/developpement_durable/actions/20080707-150833-949463/@@index.html&lt;/ref&gt; there were 60 Integral Biological Reserves in French State Forests for a total area of 111 082 hectares and 10 in City Forests for a total of 2 835 hectares.

===Greece===

In Greece there are some parks called "ethniki drimoi" (εθνικοί δρυμοί, national forests) that are under protection of the Greek government. Such parks include: [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], [[Mount Parnassus|Parnassos]] and [[Parnitha]] National Parks.

===New Zealand===
There are seven wilderness areas in New Zealand as defined by the [[National Parks Act 1980 (New Zealand)|National Parks Act 1980]] and the [[Conservation Act 1987]] that fall well within the IUCN definition. Wilderness areas cannot have any human intervention and can only have indigenous species re-introduced into the area if it is compatible with conservation management strategies.

In [[New Zealand]] wilderness areas are remote blocks of land that have high natural character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilderness Areas |url=https://tramper.nz/places/wildernessareas |website=New Zealand Tramper |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Conservation Act 1987]] prevents any access by vehicles and livestock, the construction of tracks and buildings, and all indigenous natural resources are protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1987/0065/latest/DLM104684.html#DLM104684|title=Conservation Act 1987 Part 4, Section 20|author=New Zealand Government|date=1987|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally over 40,000 ha in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/Conservation/ProtectedAreas/5/en|title=Specially protected areas|last=Malloy|first=Les|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main article|National Wilderness Preservation System}}
[[File:Image-Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge New Jersey03.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge|'''The Great Swamp''' of New Jersey]], donated for federal protection by concerned residents, was designated as the '''first wilderness refuge in the United States''' - ''winter scene'' photographed in March, 2008]]

In the United States, a Wilderness Area is an area of federal land set aside by an [[United States Congress|act of Congress]]. Human activities in wilderness areas are restricted to scientific study and non-mechanized recreation; horses are permitted but mechanized vehicles and equipment, such as cars and bicycles, are not.

The United States was the first country to officially designate land as "wilderness" through the [[Wilderness Act]] of 1964. The Wilderness Act was—and is still—an important part of wilderness designation because it created the legal definition of wilderness and founded the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Wilderness Act defines wilderness as "an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammelled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilderness Act of 1964|url=http://wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&amp;sec=legisact|work=Wilderness.net|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilderness designation helps preserve the natural state of the land and protects flora and fauna by prohibiting development and providing for non-mechanized recreation only.

The first administratively protected wilderness area in the United States was the Gila National Forest. In 1922, [[Aldo Leopold]], then a ranking member of the U.S. Forest Service, proposed a new management strategy for the Gila National Forest. His proposal was adopted in 1924, and 750 thousand acres of the Gila National Forest became the [[Gila Wilderness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aldo Leopold|url=http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=feature0105|work=Prominent Figures in Wilderness History|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'[[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge|The Great Swamp in New Jersey]] was the first formally designated wilderness refuge in the United States. It was declared a wildlife refuge on 3 November 1960. In 1966 it was declared a [[National Natural Landmark]] and, in 1968, it was given wilderness status. Properties in the swamp had been acquired by a small group of residents of the area, who donated the assembled properties to the federal government as a park for perpetual protection. Today the refuge amounts to {{convert|7600|acre|km2}} that are within thirty miles of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

While wilderness designations were originally granted by an Act of Congress for Federal land that retained a "primeval character", meaning that it had not suffered from human habitation or development, the [[Eastern Wilderness Act]] of 1975 extended the protection of the NWPS to areas in the eastern States that were not initially considered for inclusion in the Wilderness Act. This act allowed lands that did not meet the constraints of size, roadlessness, or human impact to be designated as wilderness areas under the belief that they could be returned to a "primeval" state through preservation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncmountaintreasures.org/info/wilderness_act.html The Wilderness Act of 1964]".

Approximately {{convert|107,500,000|acre|km2}} are designated as wilderness in the United States. This accounts for 4.82% of the country's total land area; however, 54% of that amount is found in Alaska (recreation and development in Alaskan wilderness is often less restrictive), while only 2.58% of the lower continental United States is designated as wilderness. Following the [[Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009]] there are 756 separate wilderness designations in the United States ranging in size from Florida's Pelican Island at {{convert|5|acre|m2}} to Alaska's Wrangell-Saint Elias at {{convert|9,078,675|acre|km2}}.

===Western Australia===
In Western Australia,&lt;ref&gt;[[Department of Conservation and Land Management]] Policy Statement No 62, Identification and management of Wilderness and surrounding areas.&lt;/ref&gt; a Wilderness Area is an area that has a wilderness quality rating of 12 or greater and meets a minimum size threshold of 8,000 hectares in temperate areas or 20,000 hectares in arid and tropical areas. A wilderness area is gazetted under section 62(1)(a) of the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984 by the Minister on any land that is vested in the Conservation Commission of Western Australia.

==International Movement==
[[File:Monument Valley 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Monument Valley]] in [[Utah]], [[United States]].]]

At the forefront of the international wilderness movement has been The [[WILD Foundation]], its founder [[Ian Player]] and its network of sister and partner organizations around the globe. The pioneer [[World Wilderness Congress]] in 1977 introduced the wilderness concept as an issue of international importance, and began the process of defining the term in biological and social contexts. Today, this work is continued by many international groups who still look to the World Wilderness Congress as the international venue for wilderness and to The WILD Foundation network for wilderness tools and action. The [[WILD Foundation]] also publishes the standard references for wilderness professionals and others involved in the issues: ''Wilderness Management: Stewardship and Protection of Resources and Values'', the ''International Journal of Wilderness'', ''A Handbook on International Wilderness Law and Policy'' and ''Protecting Wild Nature on Native Lands'' are the backbone of information and management tools for international wilderness issues.

The [https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/wcpa/what-we-do/wilderness Wilderness Specialist Group] within the [[World Commission on Protected Areas]] (WTF/WCPA) of the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) plays a critical role in defining legal and management guidelines for wilderness at the international level and is also a clearing-house for information on wilderness issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/wcpa/what-we-do/wilderness|title=Wilderness|date=2016-02-08|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IUCN Protected Areas Classification System defines wilderness as "A large area of unmodified or slightly modified land, and/or sea retaining its natural character and influence, without permanent or significant habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural condition ([[strict nature reserve|Category 1b]])." The [[WILD Foundation]] founded the WTF/WCPA in 2002 and remains co-chair.

The most recent efforts to [https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017187 map wilderness] show that less than one quarter (~23%) of the world's wilderness area now remains, and that there have been [http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)30993-9 catastrophic declines in wilderness] extent over the last two decades.

The loss of wilderness could have serious implications for biodiversity conservation.

A previous study, ''Wilderness: Earth's Last Wild Places,'' carried out by [[Conservation International]], 46% of the world's land mass is wilderness. For purposes of this report, "wilderness" was defined as an area that "has 70% or more of its original vegetation intact, covers at least {{convert|10,000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} and must have fewer than five people per square kilometer."&lt;ref&gt;Conservation International (2002) [https://www.conservation.org/NewsRoom/pressreleases/Pages/120402-Two-Year-Study-Identifies-Earths-Most-Pristine-Regions.aspx Global Analysis Finds Nearly Half The Earth Is Still Wilderness].

Of course, there are large tracts of lands in [[National Parks]] and other protected areas that would also qualify as wilderness. However, many protected areas have some degree of human modification or activity, so a definitive estimate of true wilderness is difficult.

The [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] generated a ''human footprint'' using a number of indicators, the absence of which indicate wildness: human population density, human access via roads and rivers, human infrastructure for agriculture and settlements and the presence of industrial power (lights visible from space). The society estimates that 26% of the Earth's land mass falls into the category of "Last of the wild."

==Critique==
[[File:Cedar Mtn Wilderness.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Cedar Mountain Wilderness]] in northern [[Utah]], [[United States]].]]

The American concept of wilderness has been criticized by some nature writers. For example, [[William Cronon]] writes that what he calls a wilderness ethic or cult may "teach us to be dismissive or even contemptuous of such humble places and experiences", and that "wilderness tends to privilege some parts of nature at the expense of others", using as an example "the mighty canyon more inspiring than the humble marsh."&lt;ref name=Cronon&gt;[http://history.wisc.edu/cronon/Trouble_with_Wilderness_Main.html The Trouble with Wilderness] University of Wisconsin-Madison. Retrieved: 28 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This is most clearly visible with the fact that nearly all U.S. National Parks preserve spectacular canyons and mountains, and it was not until the 1940s that a swamp became a national park—[[the Everglades]]. In the mid-20th century national parks started to protect [[biodiversity]], not simply attractive scenery.

Cronon also believes the passion to save wilderness "poses a serious threat to responsible [[environmentalism]]" and writes that it allows people to "give ourselves permission to evade responsibility for the lives we actually lead....to the extent that we live in an urban-industrial civilization but at the same time pretend to ourselves that our real home is in the wilderness".&lt;ref name = "Cronon" /&gt;

[[Michael Pollan]] has argued that the wilderness ethic leads people to dismiss areas whose wildness is less than absolute. In his book ''Second Nature'', Pollan writes that "once a landscape is no longer 'virgin' it is typically written off as fallen, lost to nature, irredeemable."&lt;ref&gt;Pollan, Michael (2003). ''Second Nature: A Gardener's Education,'' p. 188. Grove Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-4011-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another challenge to the conventional notion of wilderness comes from Robert Winkler in his book, ''Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness''. "On walks in the unpeopled parts of the suburbs," Winkler writes, "I’ve witnessed the same wild creatures, struggles for survival, and natural beauty that we associate with true wilderness."&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Robert. (2003). ''Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness.'' National Geographic {{ISBN|978-0-7922-6168-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made, as in the [[Pennsylvania Scenic Rivers]] Act, to distinguish "wild" from various levels of human influence: in the Act, "wild rivers" are "not impounded", "usually not accessible except by trail", and their watersheds and shorelines are "essentially primitive".&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Scenic Rivers Act (P.L. 1277, Act No. 283 as amended by Act 110, May 7, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another source of criticism is that the criteria for wilderness designation is vague and open to interpretation. For example, the Wilderness Act states that wilderness must be roadless. The definition given for roadless is "the absences of roads which have been improved and maintained by mechanical means to insure relatively regular and continuous use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durrant |first=Jeffrey O. |title=Struggle over Utah's San Rafael Swell: Wilderness, National Conservation Areas, and National Monuments |date=2007 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |isbn=0-8165-2669-9 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been added sub-definitions that have, in essence, made this standard unclear and open to interpretation.

Coming from a different direction, some criticism from the [[Deep Ecology]] movement argues against conflating "wilderness" with "wilderness reservations", viewing the latter term as an oxymoron that, by allowing the law as a human construct to define nature, unavoidably voids the very freedom and independence of human control that defines wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Deep Ecology for the 21st Century |date=1995 |publisher=Shambhala |location=Boston |isbn=1-57062-049-0 |pages=345, 339–355 |author=Thomas Birch |authorlink=The Incarceration of Wildness: Wilderness Areas as Prisons|editor=George Sessions}}&lt;/ref&gt; True wilderness requires the ability of life to undergo [[speciation]] with as little interference from humanity as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deep Ecology for the 21st Century |date=1995 |publisher=Shambhala |location=Boston |isbn=1-57062-049-0 |pages=323, 323–330 |author=George Sessions |authorlink=Introduction: Wilderness, the Wild, and Conservation Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropologist]] and scholar on wilderness [[Layla Abdel-Rahim]] argues that it is necessary to understand the principles that govern the economies of mutual aid and diversification in wilderness from a non-anthropocentric perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Children’s Literature, Domestication, and Social Foundation: Narratives of Civilization and Wilderness |date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-66110-2 |author=[[Layla AbdelRahim]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indian Navy - World Environment Day - 2016 (1).jpg|thumb|World Environment Day in India]]
'''World Environment Day''' ('''WED''') is celebrated on the 5th of June every year, and is the [[United Nations|United Nation's]] principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the [[environmental protection|protection of our environment]]. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging [[environmental issue]]s from [[marine pollution]], human [[overpopulation]], and [[global warming]], to [[sustainable consumption]] and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.

==History==
World Environment Day [WED] was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/environmentday/background.shtml|title=World Environment Day - 5 June|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the first day of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]], resulting from discussions on the integration of human interactions and the environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme "Only One Earth". Even though WED celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.

== Annual themes and major initiatives and accomplishments ==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
For almost five decades, World Environment Day has been raising awareness, supporting action, and driving change. Here is a timeline of key accomplishments in WEDs’ history:

The host nation is India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldenvironmentday.global/|title=World Environment Day|website=worldenvironmentday.global|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By choosing this Theme, it is aimed that people may strive to change their everyday lives to reduce the heavy burden of [[plastic pollution]]. People should be free from the over-reliance on single-use or disposables, as they have severe environmental consequences.  We should liberate our natural places, our wildlife - and our own health from plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/world-environment-day-2018-live-updates-host-nation-india-focuses-on-beat-plastic-pollution-theme-1862462|title=World Environment Day 2018 LIVE: Host Nation India Focuses On 'Beat Plastic Pollution' Theme|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian government pledged to eliminate all single use of plastic in India by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-aims-to-partner-with-un-to-promote-use-of-solar-energy/articleshow/64476669.cms|title=India aims to partner with UN to promote use of solar energy|date=2018-06-06|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Heritage Logo global.svg|thumb|[[Logo]] of the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage Committee]]]]

A '''World Heritage site''' is a landmark or area which is selected by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] ([[UNESCO]]) as having cultural,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; historical, scientific or other form of significance, and is legally protected by international treaties. The sites are judged important to the collective interests of humanity.

To be selected, a World Heritage site must be an already classified landmark, unique in some respect as a geographically and historically identifiable place having special cultural or physical significance (such as an ancient ruin or  historical structure, building, city, complex, desert, forest, island, lake, monument, mountain, or [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12976/full wilderness area]). It may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity, and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Centre|first1=UNESCO World Heritage|title=The Criteria for Selection|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=1 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity, which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing, unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access, or threat from local administrative negligence. Sites are demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Heritage|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630023048/http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|archivedate=30 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lists of World Heritage Sites|The list]] is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO [[World Heritage Committee]], composed of 21 states parties which are elected by their General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|title=The World Heritage Committee|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Site|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109181158/http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|archivedate=9 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme catalogues, names, and conserves sites of outstanding [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage|natural]] importance to the common culture and heritage of [[World population|humanity]]. Under certain conditions, listed sites can obtain funds from the World Heritage Fund. The program began with the ''Convention Concerning the Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf Convention Concerning the Protection of World's Cultural and Natural Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704214349/http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf |date=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] on 16 November 1972. Since then, 193 state parties have ratified the convention, making it one of the most widely recognized international agreements and the world's most popular cultural program.

As of July 2018, a total of 1,092 World Heritage sites (845 cultural, 209 natural, and 38 mixed properties) exist across [[Table of World Heritage Sites by country|167 countries]]. [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|Italy]], with 54 sites, has the most of any country, followed by [[List of World Heritage Sites in China|China]] (53), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain|Spain]] (47), [[List of World Heritage Sites in France|France]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|Germany]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in India|India]] (37), and [[List of World Heritage Sites in Mexico|Mexico]] (35).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https:/whc.unesco.org/en/list|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the government of [[Egypt]] decided to build the new [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]], whose resulting future reservoir would eventually [[Flood|inundate]] a large stretch of the [[Nile]] valley containing cultural treasures of [[ancient Egypt]] and ancient [[Nubia]]. In 1959, the governments of Egypt and [[Sudan]] requested UNESCO to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, the Director-General of UNESCO launched an appeal to the member states for an International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429024818/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172 |date=29 April 2009 }} World Heritage Convention, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites, the recovery of thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number of important temples, the most famous of which are the temple complexes of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]] and [[Philae]]. The campaign, which ended in 1980, was considered a success. As tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples: the [[Temple of Dendur]] was moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[Temple of Debod]] was moved to the [[Parque del Oeste]] in Madrid, the [[Temple of Taffeh]] was moved to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227222650/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |date=27 February 2015 }}, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

The project cost $80&amp;nbsp;million, about $40&amp;nbsp;million of which was collected from 50 countries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The project's success led to other safeguarding campaigns: saving [[Venice]] and its [[Venetian Lagoon|lagoon]] in Italy, the ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Pakistan, and the [[Borobodur]] Temple Compounds in Indonesia. UNESCO then initiated, with the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], a draft convention to protect the common cultural heritage of humanity. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Convention and background===
The United States initiated the idea of cultural conservation with nature conservation. The [[White House]] conference in 1965 called for a "World Heritage Trust" to preserve "the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry". The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] developed similar proposals in 1968, and they were presented in 1972 to the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]]. Under the World Heritage Committee, signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic [[data reporting]] providing the World Heritage Committee with an overview of each participating nation's implementation of the World Heritage Convention and a "snapshot" of current conditions at World Heritage properties.

A single text was agreed on by all parties, and the "Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage" was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972.

The Convention came into force on 17 December 1975. As of May 2017, it has been ratified by 193 states parties,&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|title=States Parties – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 189 [[UN member states]] plus the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], [[Niue]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. Only four UN member states have not ratified the Convention: Liechtenstein, Nauru, Somalia and Tuvalu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage: Treaty status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719235637/http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E |date=19 July 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nominating process&lt;!--This section is linkedd from Citadel of Arbil--&gt;==

A country must first list its significant cultural and natural sites; the result is called the Tentative List. A country may not nominate sites that have not been first included on the Tentative List. Next, it can place sites selected from that list into a Nomination File.

The Nomination File is evaluated by the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union]]. These bodies then make their recommendations to the World Heritage Committee. The Committee meets once per year to determine whether or not to inscribe each nominated property on the World Heritage List and sometimes defers or refers the decision to request more information from the country which nominated the site. There are ten selection criteria – a site must meet at least one of them to be included on the list.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | title=The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention | publisher=UNESCO | accessdate=10 July 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714073431/http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | archivedate=14 July 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection criteria==
Up to 2004, there were six criteria for cultural heritage and four criteria for natural heritage. In 2005, this was modified so that there is now only one set of ten criteria. Nominated sites must be of "outstanding universal value" and meet at least one of the ten criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|title=Criteria for Selection|publisher=World Heritage|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612152223/http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria have been modified or/amended several times since their creation.

UNESCO designation as a World Heritage site provides ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence that such culturally sensitive sites are legally protected pursuant to the Law of War, under the [[Geneva Convention]], its articles, protocols and customs, together with other treaties including the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] and international law.

Thus, the Geneva Convention treaty promulgates:

"Article 53. PROTECTION OF CULTURAL OBJECTS AND OF PLACES OF WORSHIP. Without prejudice to the provisions of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954,' and of other relevant international instruments, it is prohibited:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=UN General Assembly |authorlink=United Nations General Assembly |date=1979 |origyear=8 June 1977 |title=UN Treaty No. 17512 |series=Treaty Series |url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |format=PDF |work='Volume 1125-1' UN |page=27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309204240/http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:(a) To commit any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples;
:(b) To use such objects in support of the military effort;
:(c) To make such objects the object of reprisals."

==Extensions and other modifications==
A country may request to extend or reduce the boundaries, modify the official name, or change the selection criteria of one of its already listed sites. Any proposal for a significant boundary change or modify the site's selection criteria must be submitted as if it were a new nomination, including first placing it on the Tentative List and then onto the Nomination File.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

A request for a minor boundary change, one that does not have a significantly impact on the extent of the property or affect its "outstanding universal value", is also evaluated by the advisory bodies before being sent to the Committee. Such proposals can be rejected by either the advisory bodies or the Committee if they judge it to be a significant change instead of a minor one.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Proposals to change the site's official name is sent directly to the Committee.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

==Endangered sites==
{{main|List of World Heritage in Danger|Former UNESCO World Heritage sites}}

A site may be added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] if there are conditions that threaten the characteristics for which the landmark or area was inscribed on the World Heritage List. Such problems may involve armed conflict and war, natural disasters, pollution, poaching, or uncontrolled urbanization or human development. This danger list is intended to increase international awareness of the threats and to encourage counteractive measures. Threats to a site can be either proven imminent threats or potential dangers that could have adverse effects on a site.&lt;ref name="UNESCO-WHinDanger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|title=List of World Heritage in Danger|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321040701/http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|archivedate=21 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of conservation for each site on the danger list is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Only two sites have ever been [[Former UNESCO World Heritage sites|delisted]]: the [[Arabian Oryx Sanctuary]] in Oman and the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] in Germany. The Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted in 2007, instead of first being put on the danger list, after the Omani government decided to reduce the protected area's size by 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|title=Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary: first site ever to be deleted from UNESCO's World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118001455/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|archivedate=18 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dresden Elbe Valley was first placed on the danger list in 2006 when the World Heritage Committee decided that plans to construct the [[Waldschlösschen Bridge]] would significantly alter the valley's landscape. In response, the Dresden City Council attempted to stop the bridge's construction, but after several court decisions allowed the building of the bridge to proceed, the valley was removed from the World Heritage List in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522|title=Dresden is deleted from UNESCO’s World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707003437/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522/|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first global assessment to quantitatively measure [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716310138 threats to Natural World Heritage sites] found that 63 percent of sites have been damaged by increasing [https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12558 human pressures] including encroaching roads, agriculture infrastructure and settlements over the last two decades. These activities endanger Natural World Heritage sites and could compromise their unique values. Of the Natural World Heritage sites that contain forest, 91 percent of those experienced some loss since the year 2000. Many Natural World Heritage sites are more threatened than previously thought and require immediate conservation action.

There are 1092 World Heritage sites located in 167 states. Of these, 845 are cultural, 209 are natural and 38 are mixed properties. The World Heritage Committee has divided the world into five geographic zones which it calls regions: Africa, Arab states, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

Russia and the [[Caucasus]] states are classified as European, while Mexico and the Caribbean are classified as belonging to the Latin America &amp; Caribbean zone, despite their location in North America. The UNESCO geographic zones also give greater emphasis on administrative, rather than geographic associations. Hence, [[Gough Island]], located in the South Atlantic, is part of the Europe &amp; North America region because the government of the United Kingdom nominated the site.

The table below includes a breakdown of the sites according to these zones and their classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|title=World Heritage List Statistics|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514002820/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027174218/http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|archivedate=27 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Despite the successes of World Heritage listing in promoting conservation, the UNESCO administered project has attracted criticism from some for perceived under-representation of heritage sites outside Europe, disputed decisions on site selection and adverse impact of mass tourism on sites unable to manage rapid growth in visitor numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barron|first1=Laignee|title='Unesco-cide': does world heritage status do cities more harm than good?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/30/unescocide-world-heritage-status-hurt-help-tourism|accessdate=3 September 2017|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vallely|first1=Paul|title=The Big Question: What is a World Heritage Site, and does the accolade make a difference?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|work=The Independent|date=7 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192333/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sizable [[Lobbying|lobbying industry]] has grown around the awards because World Heritage listing has the potential to significantly increase tourism revenue from sites selected. Site listing bids are often lengthy and costly, putting poorer countries at a disadvantage. Eritrea's efforts to promote [[Asmara]] are one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Modernist masterpieces in unlikely Asmara|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|work=The Economist|date=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715102559/https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|archivedate=15 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Australian government was reported to have successfully lobbied for [[Great Barrier Reef]] conservation efforts to be removed from a UNESCO report titled 'World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate'. The Australian government's actions were in response to their concern about the negative impact that an 'at risk' label could have on tourism revenue at a previously designated UNESCO World Heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slezak|first1=Michael|title=Australia scrubbed from UN climate change report after government intervention|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|work=The Guardian|date=26 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027130133/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hasham|first1=Nicole|title=Government spent at least $400,000 lobbying against Great Barrier Reef 'danger' listing|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228235450/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|archivedate=28 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of listed World Heritage locations such as [[George Town, Penang]], and [[Casco Viejo, Panama]], have struggled to strike the balance between the economic benefits of catering to greatly increased visitor numbers and preserving the original culture and local communities that drew the recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maurel|first1=Cholé|title=The unintended consequences of UNESCO world heritage listing|url=https://theconversation.com/the-unintended-consequences-of-unesco-world-heritage-listing-71047|accessdate=4 September 2017|publisher=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Map at Lake Klejtrup''' ({{lang-da|Verdenskortet ved Klejtrup Sø}}) is a miniature [[world map]] built of stones and grass in [[Klejtrup Sø]] near the village of [[Klejtrup]], [[Viborg Municipality]], [[Denmark]].

In 1943, Søren Poulsen, a local farmer, was working on the drainage of the surrounding meadows when he found a stone shaped like the [[Jutland]] peninsula.  This inspired him to create a small world of his own.&lt;ref name=amazing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amusingplanet.com/2015/11/the-world-map-at-lake-klejtrup.html |title=The World Map at Lake Klejtrup  |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |date=November 21, 2015 |format= |work=Amusing Planet }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter months, with the use of primitive tools, he placed big stones carefully on the ice.  When spring arrived, the stones could easily be tilted into place, and in this way the World Map took shape. Some of the stones used weighted more than 2 tonnes.&lt;ref name=ripley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ripleys.com/blog/world-map/ |title=Man Builds Entire World Map in His Back Yard |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |date=December 2, 2015 |format= |work=Ripley's Believe it or Not |publisher=Ripley Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Poulsen created the World Map between 1944 and 1969.  It measures 45 by 90 metres (49 by 98 yards), covering an area of over 4000 square meters (1 acre).&lt;ref name=amazing /&gt; &lt;ref name=bigthink&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/a-very-danish-map-of-the-world |title=A Very Danish Map of the World |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |last=Jacobs |first=Frank |work=Big Think |publisher=The Big Think Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; One 111-kilometre (69 mi) [[Degree (angle)|degree]] of [[latitude]] corresponds to 27 centimetres (11 [[inch|inches]]) on the map.&lt;ref name=amazing /&gt; &lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; On Poulsen's map, [[Antarctica]] is not present and the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is marked in two places, ensuring a better impression of the correct distances between the countries to avoid the difficulties of spreading out our planet's globular shape.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; Red poles mark the [[equator]], and each country is represented by miniature flags, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/02/priority-world-map-lake-klejtrup-danish-farmer-spent-last-25-years-life-built-version-world/ |title=The World Map at Lake Klejtrup: A Danish farmer spent the last 25 years of his life building his own miniature version of the world |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |publisher=The Vintage News }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=ripley /&gt; which are updated yearly.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; State borders in the [[United States of America]] are marked with yellow bricks; Poulsen lived 20 years in America.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt;

The map is the epicenter of a park, which has, among other attractions, a [[picnic]] area, a coffee shop and a playground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitviborg.com/ln-int/verdenskortet-ved-klejtrup-so-gdk601190 |title=Verdenskortet ved Klejtrup Sø  |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |work=Visit Viborg }}&lt;/ref&gt;
