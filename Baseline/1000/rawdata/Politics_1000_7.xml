      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3141">An '''action alert''' is a message that an organization sends to mobilize people, often members of the group and supporters of a specific point of view, calling on them to take action to influence public policy.&lt;ref name="one hour"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=nN3RMP-BcnkC ''The one-hour activist: the 15 most powerful actions you can take to fight for the issues and candidates you care about''] Christopher Kush, John Wiley and Sons, 2004; {{ISBN|0-7879-7300-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7879-7300-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhRh1LH8tOMC ''Cybercitizen: How to Use Your Computer to Fight for All the Issues You Care about''] Christopher Kush, Macmillan, 2000; {{ISBN|0-312-26305-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-26305-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, action alerts are in reference to a timely issue, where prompt action is needed in order to affect upcoming decisions.&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt;

==Description==
Action alerts are considered a cost-effective and efficient grassroots organizing tool and are employed widely by many advocacy organizations.&lt;ref name="one hour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt; A well-designed action alert can be a "powerful way to invite people to participate in the processes of a democracy."&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=v5H1-i6LHu0C ''The Nonprofit Manager's Resource Directory''], Ronald A.

Action alerts may, for instance, ask supporters to:
*Contact their legislator to highlight the issue or argue for/against proposed legislation; or
*Write a [[letter to the editor]] about a specific item in the news.
Action alerts commonly begin by explaining the public policy issue to the recipients, and then tell the reader how they can impact the decision. Action alerts go by many other names. [[Amnesty International]], for instance, refers to them as "Urgent actions".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403121614/http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |archivedate=2005-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary}}

'''''Archon''''' ({{lang-el|ἄρχων}}, ''árchon'', &lt;small&gt;plural:&lt;/small&gt; ἄρχοντες, ''árchontes'') is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word that means "ruler", frequently used as the title of a specific public office. It is the masculine present participle of the verb stem αρχ-, meaning "to rule", derived from the same root as ''[[monarch]]'' and ''[[hierarchy]]''.

==Ancient Greece==
In the early literary period of [[ancient Greece]] the chief [[magistrates]] of various Greek city states were called ''Archon''.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=444}} The term was also used throughout Greek history in a more general sense, ranging  from "club leader" to "master of the tables" at ''[[syssitia]]'' to "Roman governor".{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In Roman terms, ''archontes'' ruled by ''[[imperium]]'', whereas ''[[Basileus|basileis]]'' ("[[king]]s") had ''[[auctoritas]]''.

In [[Athens]] a system of three concurrent Archons evolved, the three office holders being known as the ''[[Archon Eponymos]]'', the ''[[Polemarch]]'', and the ''Archon [[Basileus]]''.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=444}} According to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', the power of the king first devolved to the archons, and these offices were filled from the aristocracy by elections every ten years. During this period the Archon Eponymos was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements. After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the Archon Eponymos. (Many ancient [[calendar]] systems did not number their years consecutively.) Although the process of the next transition is unclear, after 487 BC the archonships were assigned by lot to any citizen and the Polemarch's military duties were taken over by a new class of generals known as ''[[strategoi]]''. The Polemarch thereafter had only minor religious duties. The Archon Eponymos remained the titular head of state under [[democracy]], though of much reduced political importance. The Archons were assisted by "junior Archons", called ''Thesmothetes''. After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the [[Areopagus]], though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically at that time.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=445}}

Under the Athenian constitution, Archons were also in charge of organizing festivals by bringing together poets, playwrights, actors, and city-appointed [[choregos|choregai]] (wealthy citizen patrons). The Archon would begin this process months in advance of a festival by selecting a chorus of three playwrights based on descriptions of the projected plays.  Each playwright would be assigned a choregos, also selected by the Archon, from among the wealthy citizens who would pay all the expenses of costumes, masks, and training the chorus.  The Archon also assigned each playwright a principal actor (the ''protagonist''), as well as a second and third actor. The City Dionysia, an ancient dramatic festival held in March in which tragedy, comedy, and satyric drama originated, was under the direction of one of the principal magistrates, the ''archon eponymos''. The ''archon eponymos'' remained the titular head of state under [[democracy]], though of much reduced political importance.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=445}}

==Byzantine Empire==
[[Byzantine]] historians usually described foreign rulers as ''archontes''.&lt;ref&gt;Aksum: an African civilisation of late antiquity By Stuart C. Munro-Hay  Page 145 {{ISBN|0-7486-0209-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of the [[Bulgars]] themselves, along with their [[kanasubigi|own titles]], often bear the title ''archon placed by God'' in inscriptions in Greek.

Inside Byzantium, the term could be used to refer to any powerful noble or magnate, but in a technical sense, it was applied to a class of provincial governors. In the 8th and 9th centuries, these were the governors of some of the more peripheral provinces, inferior in status to the ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]ta'': [[Dalmatia]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]]. ''Archontes'' were also placed in charge of various naval bases and trade stations, as well as semi-autonomous [[Slavs|Slavic]]-inhabited areas (''[[sclaviniae]]'') under Byzantine sovereignty. In the 10th–12th centuries, ''archontes'' are also mentioned as the governors of specific cities. The area of an archon's jurisdiction was called an '''''archontia''''' ({{lang|grc|ἀρχοντία}}).&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{ODB | page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was also used for the holders of several financial posts, such as the head of the [[mint (facility)|mint]] ({{lang|grc|ἄρχων τῆς χαραγῆς}}), as well as directors of the imperial workshops, arsenals, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB | pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of '''''[[megas archon]]''''' ("grand archon") is also attested, as a translation of foreign titles such as "grand prince". In the mid-13th century, it was established as a special court rank, held by the highest-ranking official of the emperor's company. It existed throughout the [[Palaiologan period]], but did not have any specific functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Mark C. | last = Bartusis | title = The Late Byzantine Army: Arms and Society 1204-1453 | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-8122-1620-2 | page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople==
From time to time, [[laity]] of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] in communion with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] have been granted the title of ''Archon'' to honor their service to Church administration. In 1963, Archons were organized into a service society dedicated to [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]]. This ''Archon'' status is not part of the Church hierarchy and is purely honorary. See http://www.archons.org/ .

An Archon is an honoree by His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, for his outstanding service to the Church, and a well-known, distinguished, and well-respected leader of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] (at large).

It is the sworn oath of the Archon to defend and promote the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] faith and tradition. His main concern is to protect and promote the Holy Patriarchate and its mission. He is also concerned with [[human rights]] and the well-being and general welfare of the Church.

As it is a significant religious position, the faith and dedication of a candidate for the role are extensively reviewed during consideration; the candidate should have demonstrated commitment for the betterment of the Church, Parish-Diocese, Archdiocese and the community as a whole.

==Other uses==
"Archon" is also used in Modern Greek colloquially, as ''άρχοντας'' (''archontas)'' to someone that holds a form of status, or power &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slang.gr/lemma/9091-arxontas|title=Άρχοντας - SLANG.gr|author=|date=|website=www.slang.gr|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used within the [[Arabic|Arab]]-speaking [[Copt]]s in church parlance as a [[title]] for a leading member of the [[laity]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Various [[fraternities and sororities]] use the title of archon or variations on it.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Some [[Gnosticism|Gnostic sects]] used this term for [[Archon (Gnosticism)|demons]] associated with the planetspheres.

The '''BC Legislature Raids''' (also known as '''Railgate''' after [[-gate|Watergate]]) resulted from search warrants executed on the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings|Legislature of British Columbia]], [[Canada]], in 2003 and has become a collective term for the associated criminal proceedings and ensuant controversies. Hearings began in [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|BC Supreme Court]] in April 2007. The proceedings brought to light questions concerning the propriety of the sale of [[BC Rail]] to [[CN Rail]] and the conduct of various government officials and consultants as well as the role of various members of the government, including Premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] and his advisers. In October 2010, ministerial aides Dave Basi and Bob Virk pleaded guilty to breach of trust and receiving a benefit for leaking information about the BC Rail bidding process.

==Drug sting "Everywhichway" leads to government aides==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
According to the RCMP, the Raids arose from information uncovered during a drug sting.&lt;ref&gt;CanWest News Service, "Drug link alleged in Basi case," Times Colonist, May 08, 2007, retrieved from [http://www2.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=82eeca7a-4f77-49f4-ad9b-949c6e66795c&amp;k=99781 here on March 30 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neal Hall and Jim Beatty, "B.C.'s Hells Angels," Vancouver Sun, Page A01, September 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the RCMP were monitoring Dave Basi's conversations on his home, government, and cellular phones, as well as his e-mails. At that time the police were focused on breaking up a [[marijuana]] and [[cocaine]] smuggling ring between [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]] run by his cousin [[Jasmohan Singh Bains]].&lt;ref&gt;"Drug dealer linked to legislature raid imprisoned: RCMP oddly silent about key victory against cocaine ring", Ian Mulgrew, ''Vancouver Sun'', February 17, 2008, retrieved here [https://vancouversun.com/news/Drug+dealer+linked+legislature+raid+imprisoned/1297264/story.html on March 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the police investigation of Basi's activities investigators became interested in Basi's dealings as Ministerial Assistant to then Finance Minister [[Gary Farrell-Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Bailey, "Ex-minister wants spy tape released", ''The Province'', A10, February 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A second investigation was launched that had no connection to drug related activities but rather to the [[Influence peddling|sale of benefits]] in regard to the tendering process for the sale of BC Rail.&lt;!--this would be the sale of BC Rail stuff, I'd think, but this is typical of the muzzling of this article: what other kinds of activities?  Influence peddling and "sale of benefits" that's what...--&gt;

On December 28, 2003, a series of search warrants was executed at various locations throughout the [[Lower Mainland]] and in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]. There were four separate applications by the RCMP in 2004 to obtain warrants, and according to the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] these were executed at nine separate premises including the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings|Parliament Buildings]] in Victoria. As a result, allegations of bribery were made (including money and the offer of potential employment in return for confidential government information).

The sale of BC Rail involved a tax indemnity.  This was structured so that if CN would not have been refunded [[Canadian Dollar|$]]415 million from the Federal Government, then the Province would be required to return this amount to CN.  This had the effect of reducing the sale price of BC Rail from $1.05 billion to under $500 million, thereby in essence short-changing taxpayers more than $550 million.&lt;ref&gt;"A BC Rail time bomb is still ticking for B.C. taxpayers", ''Vancouver Sun'', April 21, 2009, retrieved here [http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=106ef17b-3f69-4946-8132-4ce69f85d065&amp;k=60220]&lt;/ref&gt; (This is in addition to $750 million cash payments and $250 million in direct tax credits, as noted in the section on Patrick Kinsella below.) The BC Rail tax indemnity was taken off the Public Accounts in January 2005, before the May 2005 election, when it was reclassified a contingent liability.

===BC Rail link===

On April 3, 2006, a Justice of the British Columbia Supreme Court ordered the further release of various documents used by police to obtain the search warrants served on individuals linked to the Raids.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/SC/06/20/2006BCSC2084.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Further charges were laid against two Victoria area developers.

===Agricultural Land Commission &lt;!--and Tsawassen Treaty--&gt;connection===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Basi has also been charged for accepting $50,000 in connection with &lt;!--attempting to negotiate with--&gt; the [[Agricultural Land Reserve|Agricultural Land Commission]]&lt;!-- on removal of land from the Agricultural Land Reserve to benefit a losing bidder in the process, OminTRAX--&gt;.

===Liberal "insiders"===

Several of the people cited by online commentators or certain reporters in the story surrounding the raid are politically active people who had come into contact with Basi. Examples include provincial ministers, staff or officials in the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] or the [[Paul Martin]] leadership campaign.

Search warrants were executed at several locations in addition to the BC Legislature.  The Vancouver home office of Erik Bornmann, the Vancouver home of Bruce Clark (brother of Christy Clark, CKNW 980 talk show host), and the offices of Pilothouse public affairs in Victoria in December 2003.  It has been reported that Erik Bornmann, Brian Kieran and Jamie Elmhirst will testify for the Crown.  The RCMP also attended Ms. Clark's home that she shared with her ex-husband Mark Marissen.&lt;ref&gt;''Vancouver Province'' newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCMP made it very clear that no elected officials were implicated in their investigation, and also provided a letter to Marissen (Paul Martin's BC Campaign Chair) confirming that he was also not implicated in any way and that they came to his house without a search warrant to seek his help because they thought he might be the "innocent recipient" of emails related to Virk's and Basi's resumes, because it was alleged that they were seeking job recommendations for federal political employment in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6611281e-d916-4335-a77d-6ca1a05d2a55&lt;/ref&gt; Basi was an active volunteer for the Paul Martin campaign in British Columbia, who recruited many members of the Indo-Canadian community to the Liberal Party to vote in the leadership process. This has led to rampant speculation and innuendo as government critics attempt to link Basi's activities to federal and provincial politicians and operatives, and spread "guilt by association". Part of this speculation is fuelled by comments made to the media at the time of the raids by the officer in charge, that organized crime and corruption were present in "the highest levels of the government".

===Charges laid===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
In December 2004 three men were charged in connection with this investigation and in 2006 two more men were charged.

Those charged include:
*David Basi
*Robert Virk
*Aneal Basi
*Tony Young
*James Duncan

===Legality of warrants===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Complications in the case included controversy as to whether the police may have misled a judge in the course of obtaining warrants for the investigation which involved eavesdropping on conversations between the [[Premier of British Columbia|Premier]] and the Finance Minister. Twice the warrants were rejected on grounds of privilege, with the third warrant issued without naming the premises, which were the Legislature Buildings.

==Developments in 2009==

===Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act===

The preliminary hearings into eventual criminal court proceedings were kept sealed from the public until opened up in the public's interest, and by requests from defence council, in the fall of 2008 by the presiding justice, [[Elizabeth Bennett (judge)|Elizabeth Bennett]], who struck down the court ban in the grounds of the importance of an open court in regard to the importance of the case to the public interest, contrary to the objections of the government-appointed Special Prosecutor. On February 25, 2009, Judge Bennett released 8000 pages of documents relating to the legislature raids to the New Democrat Official Opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Hume, "Provincial NDP obtain files related to sale of BC Rail", ''Globe and Mail'', February 25, 2009, retrieved from [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090225.wbasi26/BNStory/politics here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents produced attention immediately, first to what appeared to be [[British Columbia Liberal Party|B.C.

On March 6, 2009, after raising these two stories the B.C. New Democratic Party caucus released the documents to the public through their website.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford Killian, "NDP posts documents from BC Rail trial", The Tyee, Hook Blog, March 6, 2009, retrieved from [https://thetyee.ca/Blogs/TheHook/BC-Politics/2009/03/06/RailTrial/ here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090310002437/http://www.bcndpcaucus.ca/en/bcrailcorruption way back machine retrieval of the online archive of B.C. Rail Documents released to the New Democrat Caucus]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Kinsella connection===
Shortly after the B.C. New Democratic Caucus won access to the 8000 pages of B.C. rail documents, their researchers uncovered a link between long-time [[British Columbia Liberal Party|B.C. Liberal Party]] insider [[Patrick Kinsella]] &lt;ref&gt;Andrew MacLeod, "Pat Kinsella's Bumpy Career", The Tyee, June 16, 2008, retrieved from [https://thetyee.ca/News/2008/06/16/PatKinsella/ here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and B.C. Rail while looking through public documents available at the legislative library. The documents showed that between 2002 and 2004, B.C. Rail paid $297,000 to the group of companies owned by Kinsella.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn Palmer, "Stonewally to the fore as NDP pounds Kinsella connection", ''Vancouver Sun'', March 12, 2009, retrieved from [https://vancouversun.com/columnists/Stonewally+fore+pounds+Kinsella+connection/1380115/story.html here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovered documents were first aired in question period on Tuesday, March 10, 2009. When questioned by New Democratic Party justice critic, [[Leonard Krog]], about what Kinsella was paid by B.C. Rail to do, the Attorney General, [[Wally Oppal]], claimed that "the issue relating to B.C. Rail is before the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and we will not comment on the matter." &lt;ref&gt;Hansard, Tuesday, March 10, 2009, Afternoon, Vol. 39, No. 11, oral question period, ROLE OF PATRICK KINSELLA IN B.C. RAIL SALE, retrieved from [http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/38th5th/H90310p.htm here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsella's company, the Progressive Group, issued a statement claiming that Kinsella "was engaged by BC Rail to assist in understanding and interpreting the Core Review Process as to its potential impact on the Corporation", while on B.C. Rail's payroll.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Fowlie and Neal Hall, "Judge raises Kinsella lobbying in Basi-Virk case", ''Vancouver Sun'', March 13, 2009, retrieved from [https://vancouversun.com/news/Judge+raises+Kinsella+lobbying+Basi+Virk+case/1384615/story.html here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Questioned outside of the legislature Oppal said that he had no idea if Kinsella's activities were connected to the B.C. Rail trial.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Kines, "B.C. Liberals silent on payments to party official", ''Times Colonist'', March 12, 2009, retrieved from [http://www.timescolonist.com/Liberals+silent+payments+party+official/1380978/story.html here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
Soon after, a defence lawyer involved in the trial alleged that Kinsella was working for both CN Rail and BC Rail in the time before the $1-billion sale of BC Rail to CN was finalized.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Hall and Johnathan Fowlie, "Kinsella worked for both sides, lawyer says", ''Vancouver Sun'', March 27, retrieved from [http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=29986828-6c14-4b9e-a1f9-aecb43f1b87b here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsella wrote the B.C. Liberal Party election platform for the 2003 and 2005 elections.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Fowlie, "A quiet titan finds an uncomfortable limelight" , ''Vancouver SunMarch 16, 2009, retrieved from [https://vancouversun.com/news/quiet+titan+finds+uncomfortable+limelight/1394234/story.html here on April 2, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsella's involvement in the political corruption trial &lt;ref&gt;Mark Hume and Justine Hunter, "Campbell's ally in spotlight at corruption trial", ''Globe and Mail'', March 27, 2009, retrieved from [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090327.BCBASI27/TPStory/National here on April 2, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; has led observers to draw a link between the B.C. rail scandal &lt;ref&gt;Gary Mason, "Whiff of scandal envelops sale of BC Rail", ''Globe and Mail'', March 26, retrieved from [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090326.wbcmason26/BNStory/Front here on April 2, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Mason, ''Globe and Mail'', "Premier faces questions, and voters need answers, about sale of BC Rail", Page A10, March 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Mason, "As election looms, new revelations about BC Rail stir up waters", ''Globe and Mail'', March 28, 2009, retrieved from [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090328.wbcmason28/BNStory/politics/home here on April 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn Palmer, "Campbell's BC Rail deal just can't shake whiff of scandal", ''Vancouver Sun'', March 14, 2009, retrieved from [http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/columnists/story.html?id=e6153f49-fa40-4b39-81b1-774b47f32070 here on April 2, 2009] relevant quote "Campbell, Kinsella in BC Rail tryst".&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an email cited by defense lawyer Kevin McCullough, Kinsella may have interceded with Premier Gordon Campbell's chief of staff to keep the sale of B.C. rail to C.N. from "going off the tracks." &lt;ref&gt;Keith Fraser, "Liberal insider accused of double-dealing 'sham'", Page A12, ''The Province'', March 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsella is alleged to have been involved in entering the $505 million BC Rail tax indemnity (refund) on the books at 255 million.  

The sale of BC Rail included a $505 million BC Rail tax indemnity on top of $750 million cash and $250 million in direct tax credits.  Under the terms of the indemnity, if CN would not have been refunded the amount of the indemnity from the Federal Government, then the Province would be required to return this amount.  This reduced the sale price of BC Rail from $1.05 billion to roughly $500 million, thereby benefiting private shareholders of CN, albeit at the expense of the public at large. The BC Rail tax indemnity was taken off the Public Accounts in January 2005, before the May 2005 election, when it was reclassified a contingent liability.  

The BC Rail sale Annual Report was defective and did not cite the indemnity, and recorded these tax credits at zero [[book value]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://vancouversun.com/Rail+time+bomb+still+ticking+taxpayers/1517685/story.html "A BC Rail time bomb is still ticking for B.C. taxpayers: Campbell Liberals left us on the hook for half a billion", Vaughn Palmer, ''Vancouver Sun'', April 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments in 2010==

===The BC Rail corruption trial===
The BC Rail corruption trial (''Her Majesty the Queen v. Basi''), Virk Basi and commonly known as the Basi-Virk Trial, started on May 17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;courts.gov.bc.ca R. v Basi 2010 BCSC 1622 2010/10/18 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://theprovince.com/news/Finally+truth+behind+Rail/3036949/story.html story retrieved on July 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was originally scheduled by B.C. Supreme Court officials &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2010/06/07/bc-bc-rail-trial-basi-virk-extension.html story retrieved on July 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; to last around six weeks.

Canadian media have expressed frustration at the time it has taken to get this case to trial.&lt;ref&gt;https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/politics/story.html?id=3039961 story retrieved on July 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timescolonist.com/news/Rail+trial+delays/3255202/story.html story retrieved on July 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A publication ban by the presiding judge put most of the B.C. rail trial – from its beginning to July 6, 2010, when the court rose for the summer,&lt;ref&gt;https://vancouversun.com/news/September+judge+tells+jury+Basi+Virk+trial/3241894/story.html story retrieved on July 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; out of reach of the media and out of the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;https://thetyee.ca/Blogs/TheHook/BC-Politics/2010/03/08/RailBan/ story retrieved on July 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====The first witness: Chief of Staff Martyn Brown====

Premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]]'s chief of staff, [[Martyn Brown]], was the first witness to appear before the jury in the B.C. Rail trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.sympatico.cbc.ca/local/bc/top_aide_on_stand_as_bc_rail_trial_resumes/bbdcb16d{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} story retrieved on July 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====End of trial====

October 2010 – Defendants Dave Basi and Bob Virk agreed to change their plea to guilty on a reduced number of charges.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/british-columbia/bc-rail-trial-ends-after-deal-reached/article1762012/ ''Globe and Mail'' Update Published Monday, Oct. 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  For more info related to this, see [[Timeline_of_BC_Legislature_Raids#2010]]

==History==
=== 2014-2016: Private Beta ===
On June 4th, 2014, Brigade Beta became available to download on [[iOS]] or [[Google Play]], in its private [[beta]] version.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this beginning stage, the app asked users to agree or disagree on a position.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Brigade then split up its users into those who agreed on the issue and those who disagreed on the issue. Participants were also allowed to write their own opinions on positions and ask those in their respective group if they were "for" or "against" the opinion stated.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Sean Parker’s new political app Brigade has launched in private beta|author= Wright, Mic|access-date=2018-04-10|website=thenextweb.com|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/06/17/sean-parkers-new-political-app-brigade-has-launched-in-private-beta/?via=indexdotco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016-present: Open Beta  ===
==== Voter guide ====
A few weeks before the November 2016 elections, Brigade created a ballot [[guide]] for its users.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It ran these voter guides in [[San Francisco]] and [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], New Hampshire.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{citeweb|language=en-US|title=Brigade, The Political Engagement Platform Backed By Sean Parker, Launches A Voter Guide For Nov.

One could agree, disagree, or click unsure as their answer choices.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade tries to provide a simple solution to elections, but is it too simple?|author= Hockenson, Lauren|website=thenextweb.com|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/10/14/brigade-tries-to-provide-a-simple-solution-to-elections-but-is-it-too-simple/?via=indexdotco|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the questionnaire, the guide gave recommendations on who to vote for and which [[propositions]] to pass or not pass.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Furthermore, the app also determined these choices based on those a user socializes with on Brigade.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade launches first of its kind social ballot guide for U.S. voters|website=brigade.news|url=https://brigade.news/brigade-launches-first-of-its-kind-social-ballot-guide-for-u-s-voters-21a69c7f6a75|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigade users could then pledge their votes to the candidates and propositions listed on the ballot. With these pledges, the app could track which candidates had more pledged votes in real time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Users were further able to recruit pledges from other users for their favorite candidates or propositions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Voter verification==== 
Brigade implemented a voter [[Third-party verification|verification]] service as well.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=

===Background===
As technology has advanced, it was assumed that the average individual would have further access to voting, and therefore, voting numbers would increase. Instead, voter turnout at the elections remains low, with numbers at the presidential elections between 50% and 60% of the US population in the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter Turnout in Presidential Elections: 1828 - 2012|author= Peters, Gerhard and Woolley, John T.|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php|website=presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the midterm election of 2014, only 36.4% of people voted, the lowest percentage since 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter Turnout in Midterm Elections Hits 72-Year Low|author= Alter, Charlotte|url=http://time.com/3576090/midterm-elections-turnout-world-war-two/|website=Time|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that civic technology will incentivize and educate its users to vote. Brigade's voter ballot was an attempt as a [[Civic technology|civic technology platform]] to increase voter participation as well as educate its users about candidates and propositions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The tools we build in Silicon Valley represent the best hope for fixing our democracy|author=Mahan Matt|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/2/1/14476462/civic-tech-organize-march-change-citizen-engagement-democracy-brigade|website=recode.net|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
One mission of Brigade Media is to act as a [[foreground]] for its users to connect and organize so that they can voice their opinions on our nation's issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Media|url=https://parker.org/initiatives/brigade-media|website=parker.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another more general goal is to increase voter participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sean Parker forms Brigade Media to charge politics|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/06/11/sean-parker-brigade-politics/10326463/|website=usatoday.com|author=Guynn, Jessica|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
Brigade interacts with American [[voters]] by linking its users to the same held concerns.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade-Make Change Into Action|url=https://brigade.com|website=brigade.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinions of [[elected officials]] on those concerns will be provided and metrics about the [[candidate]] most similar in concerns and degree of concern will be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Seeks To Reboot Political Engagement In America With Civic Social Media|author= Howard, Alexander|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexander-howard/brigade-seeks-to-reboot-political-engagement_b_7607306.html|website=huffingtonpost|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data should be useful for both candidates and voters, in that voters can voice their grievances and candidates must respond accordingly.

==Funding==
In 2014, Brigade Media received about $9.5 million in [[seed money]] from [[Sean Parker]], [[Marc Benioff]], and [[Ron Conway]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing Brigade Beta, Sean Parker's civic-focused social network|url=https://mashable.com/2015/06/17/sean-parker-brigade-beta-civics-social/?via=indexdotco#lp4nVNPhzuqj|author=Mangalindan, JP|website=mashable.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Media Raises $9.3M From Sean Parker To Shake Up American Democracy|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/brigade-media-raises-9-3m-from-sean-parker-to-shake-up-american-democracy/|author=Wilhelm, Alex|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==

===Criticism===
[[Barbara Simons]], a [[computer scientist]] from [[IBM]], asserts that all current forms of digital voting devices are hackable, and that the best unhackable option is paper.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Computer Scientist Who Prefers Paper|access-date=2014-04-17|website=theatlantic.com|language=en-US|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/guardian-of-the-vote/544155/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, a Canadian study revealed that online voting platforms may not improve voter participation.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; The study found that those who did not already vote on paper ballots did not vote with digital devices.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Instead, non-paper voting forms are simply more convenient for those who would have already decided to vote.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Now the Time for Internet Voting?:BC’s Independent Panel on Internet Voting|access-date=2014-04-17|website=revparl.ca|language=en-US|author=Archer, Keith|url=http://www.revparl.ca/37/4/37n4e_14_Archer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this [[data]] brought to light, the Independent Panel On Internet Voting did not recommend internet voting to the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Election Task Force Report: 2017 Jun 28|access-date=2014-04-17|website=council.vancouver.ca|language=en-US|url=http://council.vancouver.ca/20170628/documents/pspc1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Brigade's [[Executive Chairman]], [[Sean Parker]], was the [[President (corporate title)|president]] of [[Facebook]] in mid-2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Students' Start-up Draws Attention and $13 Million|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/business/students-startup-draws-attention-and-13-million.html|author=Rosen, Ellen|website=NYTimes|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[Facebook]] sold information on over 50 million Facebook users to [[Cambridge Analytica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html|author=Rosenberg, Matthew, Confessore, Nicholas, and Cadwalldr, Carole |website=NYTimes|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Parker's previous relationship with Facebook could provide controversy in his work with Brigade Media and his other projects.

At the company's formation, Brigade Media also faced a [[racial]] controversy. When Brigade was only a few weeks old, the entire [[Leadership|leadership division]] of the [[start-up]] was white males.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The company addressed the issues by filling in 12 additional positions and noting that women were also present in the [[organization]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Results==

When the ballot guide was introduced, about 67% of its users were [[millennials]].&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; This is an accomplishment because millennial participation in the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 midterm elections]] had declined.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Results Are In on Sean Parker's Brigade App: Millennial Voters Used It|url=https://www.recode.net/2015/11/5/11620390/election-results-are-in-on-sean-parkers-brigade-app-millennial-voters|author=Chmielewski, Dawn|website=recode.net|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the ballot guide, the [[start-up]] had 100,000 pledged candidates and 400,000 friends of candidates also pledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Launches First of Its Kind Social Ballot Guide for U.S. Voters|url=https://brigade.news/brigade-launches-first-of-its-kind-social-ballot-guide-for-u-s-voters-21a69c7f6a75|website=brigade.news|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the vote pledges, 94.5% of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] pledged to vote for Republican nominee Trump, with 2.2% pledging with Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; However, on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] pledge side, only 55% pledged for Clinton while 40% of Democrats pledged for Trump.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

'''''Clinton v. City of New York''''', 524 U.S. 417 (1998), is a [[legal case]] in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the [[line-item veto]] as granted in the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996]] violated the [[Presentment Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] because it impermissibly gave the [[President of the United States]] the power to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of [[statute]]s that had been duly passed by the [[United States Congress]]. The decision of the Court, in a six-to-three majority, was delivered by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]].

==Background of the case==
The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 allowed the [[President of the United States|president]] to "cancel", that is to void or legally nullify, certain provisions of [[Appropriation (law)|appropriations]] bills, and disallowed the use of funds from canceled provisions for offsetting [[deficit spending]] in other areas.

===Political circumstances===
The 1994 federal [[midterm elections]] signaled a sea-change in [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] known as the [[Republican Revolution]], with the Republican Party taking control of both houses of the U.S. Congress from Democrats. Key to that revolution was the Republicans' [[Contract with America]], which included a list of actions they promised to take if they gained control of Congress. Among this list was the Line Item Veto Act itself, one of two provisions designed to ensure congressional fiscal conservatism. The Act was the only provision of the "Contract with America" that [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Initial litigation===
At its passage, the Act was politically controversial, with many Democrats breaking with Clinton to oppose it. Of the opposition, six members of Congress, including Republican [[Mark Hatfield]], sued to prevent use of the line-item veto. They were granted [[summary judgment]] by the U.S. District Court, but the Supreme Court held that the Congressmen lacked [[Standing (law)|standing]] because they could not show any particularized harm, and dismissed their suit in ''[[Raines v. Byrd]]'', 521 U.S. 811 (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

  |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-1671.ZS.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the next two months, Clinton began using the line-item veto, prompting several entities to file suit in a second attempt to have the Act declared [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].

In the second case, which was consolidated from two cases by the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]], the [[New York City|City of New York]] and several organizations related to [[health care]] alleged injury from President Clinton's cancellation of certain provisions of the [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]] that eliminated certain liabilities, and Snake River Potato Growers, Inc. alleged injury from the President's cancellation of certain provisions of the [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]] that gave [[tax]] benefits to aid farmer's [[cooperative]]s in purchasing potato processing facilities.

The District Court ruled for the plaintiffs, holding that the Line Item Veto Act was unconstitutional. Because the Act established an expedited appeal process for challenges, the case was directly appealed from the District Court to the Supreme Court.

==The Supreme Court's decision==
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2017}}
In a majority opinion written by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], the Court ruled that because the Act allowed the President to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of duly enacted [[statute]]s by using line-item cancellations, it violated the [[Presentment Clause]] of the Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution|U.S. Const. art. I]], § 7, cl. 2&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines a specific practice for enacting a statute. The Court construed the silence of the Constitution on the subject of such unilateral Presidential action as equivalent to "an express prohibition", agreeing with historical material that supported the conclusion that statutes may only be enacted "in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
  |litigants = INS v. Chadha
  |vol = 462
  |reporter = U.S.
  |opinion = 919
  |date = 1983
  |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a bill must be approved or rejected by the President in its entirety.

===Kennedy's concurrence===
Justice [[Anthony M. Kennedy]], in an [[concurring opinion|opinion concurring]] in the opinion and judgment of the Court, objected to the dissent's argument that the Act did not violate principles of the [[separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] and threaten individual [[liberty]], stating that the "undeniable effects" of the Act were to "enhance the President's power to reward one group and punish another, to help one set of taxpayers and hurt another, to favor one State and ignore another". Kennedy's concurrence implicitly viewed the statute as a violation of the [[nondelegation doctrine]].

===Breyer's dissent===
In a [[dissenting opinion]], Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] contended that the objective of the Act was constitutionally proper and was consistent with powers that the President has held in the past, stating that the Act "does not violate any specific textual constitutional command, nor does it violate any implicit Separation of Powers principle". He extensively refers to many different cases which support the delegation of power by [[United States Congress|the Congress]], and primarily suggests that the Act is an efficient means by which a constitutionally legitimate end may be achieved.

===Scalia's partial concurrence and partial dissent===
In an alternative opinion, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] objected to the Court's consideration of the case with respect to the Taxpayer Relief Act, finding no party in the case with [[standing (law)|standing]] to challenge it. However, he did find a party with standing to challenge the President's cancellation in the Balanced Budget Act, and concluded that it did not violate the Constitution, because the Congress has the power to delegate the discretionary authority to decline to spend appropriated sums of money, which he asserted was equivalent to cancellation.

==Critical response==

Michael B. Rappaport argued that the original meaning of the Constitution does not apply to certain parts of the [[nondelegation doctrine]], relying on his interpretation of the Executive Power Vesting Clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In Rappaport’s opinion, "the Court’s approach to cancellation authority has no basis in text, structure and purpose, or precedent".&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport at 290.&lt;/ref&gt;
J.Stephen Kennedy wrote that the majority of the Supreme Court was sufficiently concerned with the constitutional challenges to the line item veto presented to declare the act wholly unconstitutional, instead of relying on other traditional and less sweeping ways of correcting acts of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

First, it suggests that the Court seems unready or unwilling to alter the existing interpretation of the nondelegation doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Huefner at 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the Court has shown that it is willing to rely upon alternative rationales to achieve the same result "as would a more robust nondelegation doctrine rationale".&lt;ref name=Huefner /&gt; This approach is significant because in theory, such a rationale could endanger previously accepted delegations to the executive.&lt;ref name=Huefner /&gt;

Roy E. Brownell II criticized the Clinton administration for its exercise of the Line Item Veto Act, charging that it should have restricted its cancellation powers only to statutory provisions that remain in the realm of national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Brownell suggested that a [[test case]] brought forth on the grounds of national security would have likely acknowledged the existence of "[[National Security Rescission]]", "a narrow [[Statutory interpretation|statutory construction]] limiting the area of presidential cancellation power to within the field of national security. Such a result ... would have assured that the President maintained cancellation authority over a sixth of the federal budget."&lt;ref&gt;Brownell at 1280.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven G. Calabresi]] argued that although the Court had denied this, the instant decision was really a "[[Nondelegation doctrine]] case masquerading as a [[bicameralism]] and [[Presentment Clause|presentment case]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Subsequent developments==
Though the Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto Act in 1998, President [[George W. Bush]] asked Congress to enact legislation that would return the line item veto power to the Executive. First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31, 2006 [[State of the Union address]], President Bush sent a legislative proposal [[Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006]] to Congress on March 6, 2006, urging its prompt passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pubpress/2006/line_item_veto.pdf |title=Proposal for a Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 |access-date=2006-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060610203926/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pubpress/2006/line_item_veto.pdf |archive-date=2006-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Bill Frist]], Senator [[John McCain]], and Republican Whip Senator [[Mitch McConnell]] jointly introduced this proposal.

On that same day, [[Joshua Bolten]], the Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]], gave a press conference on the president's line-item veto proposal. Bolten explained that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out "wasteful" spending and to put such spending on hold. While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to rescind the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis, and could be passed by a [[majority|simple majority]]. Additionally, such proposals could not be [[filibuster]]ed.

When asked how this proposed legislation was different from the 1996 Line Item Veto Act that was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, in order for the President to successfully rescind previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.

Though the newer line-item veto proposal was much weaker than the 1996 version, it nevertheless failed to find strong support in Congress. Senator [[Robert C. Byrd]] of [[West Virginia]] called it "an offensive slap at Congress", asserting that the legislation would enable the president to intimidate individual members of Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents. He also complained that the line-item veto as proposed would take away Congress' constitutional "[[power of the purse]]" and give it to the [[executive branch]].

On June 8, 2006, [[Viet D. Dinh]], Professor of Law at [[Georgetown University Law Center]], and [[Nathan Sales]], John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center testified by written statement before the [[House Committee on the Budget]] on the constitutional issues in connection with the proposed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budget.house.gov/hearings/dinhstmnt060806.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628191259/http://www.budget.house.gov/hearings/dinhstmnt060806.htm |archivedate=2006-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution's [[Bicameralism]] and [[Presentment Clause]], and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court. They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations.

The proposed Act was approved by the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House Budget Committee]] on June 14, 2006 by a vote of 24–9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1986''' was the ninth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  It was held in [[London]], the [[United Kingdom]], between 3 August 1986 and 5 August 1986, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This was a special meeting held in between the biennial CHOGMs in order to consider the recommendations of the [[Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group]] regarding economic sanctions against South Africa due to its policies of apartheid. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to support mandatory sanctions resulted in an acrimonious meeting and almost led to a split in the Commonwealth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17215">[[Civic technology]] is defined as technology that enables engagement, participation or enhances the relationship between the people and government by enhancing citizen communications and public decision, improving government delivery of service, and infrastructure. Civic technology platforms specifically designed to improve citizen participation in governance. We distinguished civic tech from government technology. Government technology being technology that directly deals with government infrastructure.

== Platform types ==

We used the categorization on democratic innovations according to Dr. Graham Smith of the [[University of Southampton]], in his book "Beyond the Ballot":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/11541/|title=Beyond the ballot: 57 democratic innovations from around the world|last=Smith|first=Graham|date=2005|website=westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk|publisher=POWER Inquiry|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Electoral innovations - "aim to increase electoral turnout"
* Consultation innovations - "aim to inform decision-makers of citizens’ views" 
* Deliberative innovations - "aim to bring citizens together to deliberate on policy issues, the outcomes of which may influence decision-makers"
* Co-governance innovations - "aim to give citizens significant influence during the process of decision-making" 
* Direct democracy innovations - "aim to give citizens final decision-making power on key issues" 
* E-democracy innovations - "use information technology to engage citizens in the decision-making process"

{{Jeremy Corbyn sidebar}}
'''Corbynmania''' is enthusiastic support for [[Jeremy Corbyn]] – the veteran politician who was elected as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|leader of the Labour Party]] in 2015.

[[Jeremy Corbyn]] was encouraged to stand in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|leadership election]] which followed the resignation of [[Ed Miliband]] after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] failed to win the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|general election of 2015]].  Initially, he was viewed as a token candidate for the left wing of the party and was not expected to win because he had been a maverick during the period of [[Tony Blair]] 's [[New Labour]] and so had little experience of ministerial government. However, his [[authentic leadership|authentic]], informal style and radical policies appealed to many of the young new members who had joined after the membership fee had been reduced to £3.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  Hundreds of supporters turned out to hear him speak at the [[husting]]s across the nation and their enthusiastic reception and support for him was dubbed "Corbynmania" by the press.&lt;ref name=LPP/&gt;

A [[chant]] of "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" has now been adopted as an anthem or chorus by his supporters.  This is sung in the style of a [[football chant]] to the tune of a [[riff]] from "[[Seven Nation Army#.22Oh Jeremy Corbyn.22|Seven Nation Army]]" by [[The White Stripes]].&lt;ref name=G/&gt;  It attracted especial attention at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2017|Glastonbury Festival of 2017]], where Corbyn appeared and spoke to the crowds.&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1015">The '''Davignon report''', published on 27 October 1970, was a report on the future foreign policy of [[European Economic Community]] member nations. It was written by a council chaired by [[Étienne Davignon]] of the [[Belgian]] Foreign Office. The committee was appointed by the [[Council of the European Union|Council of the European Communities]] to make proposals on political cooperation between the member states. It recommended that member states should try to speak with a single voice on international problems, a proposal that was approved by all six member governments. It resulted first in [[European Political Cooperation]] and later in the [[European Union]]'s [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] in 1992.

The '''Dominion Party''' was a [[South Africa]]n political party establish in late October 1934 by dissatisfied members of the [[South African Party]] when that party fused with the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] to form the [[United Party (South Africa)|United National South African Party]], commonly referred to as the "United Party".

Its formation was mainly due to distrust of the motives of then-[[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] [[J.B.M. Hertzog]] and the new [[Afrikaner nationalist]] faction he brought into the now-united Party. The party was established principally to maintain South Africa's "British connection" (it campaigned to keep the [[Union Jack]] and [[God Save the Queen]] in 1938 and to enter the [[Second World War]] in 1939 on the side of Britain)&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, D.W. ''The Making of a Nation: A History of the Union of South Africa 1910-1961''. 1969. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly the [[Natal Province|Natal]]'s distinct British culture. The Party won 8 seats in the [[South African general election, 1938|1938 general election]] and lost one in [[South African general election, 1943|1943]]. It acquired no seats in [[South African general election, 1948|1948 election]], and disappeared from national politics.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger above. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion Party leader was Colonel [[Charles Stallard|C.F. Stallard]], who later served as Minister of Mines during the [[Second Jan Smuts government|second Ministry]] of [[Jan Smuts]].&lt;ref&gt;Kruger above. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The withdrawal of Hertzog and his supporters from the UP government in 1939 can be said to have made the party redundant, explaining its later decline.

The '''Douglas-Grumman Scandal''' was a bribery scandal that rocked Japan in February 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=Ezra F.|last2=Yuan|first2=Ming|last3=Tanaka|first3=Akihiko|title=The Golden Age of the U.S.-China-Japan Triangle, 1972–1989|date=2002|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|isbn=9780674009608|page=55|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=oupsPZG1S2IC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Douglas+Grumman+scandal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=miAb-6NBsC&amp;sig=t8z6LtedrNfgaH_EbnfzwsFRfJk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj35pbP2ZLWAhUGfFAKHY4wAPsQ6AEITjAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Douglas%20Grumman%20scandal&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, concerning the sale of American fighter jets.

== History ==
; 1968
: Japan's [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Ministry of Defense]] was considering various candidates for the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force|Air SDF]]'s new fighter jet, including the [[List of Lockheed F-104 Starfighter variants|Lockheed CL1010-2]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell-Douglas F-4]], [[Saab 37 Viggen]] and [[Dassault Mirage F1]]. However, in practice the CL-1010-2 was still under development, and the probability of using European jets was low due to the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|US-Japan security treaty]], so there were few real contenders other than the F-4.

; 1969 
: It was decided to use the F-4EJ, based on the F-4E (normally it would have been called the F-4J, in keeping with the F-104J and F-15J that had also been modified for Japan, but there was already an F-4J in the US Navy). The differences from the F-4E, due to pressure from the Japan Socialist Party, were the removal of key apparatus such as the nuclear bomb pre-flight controller (DCU-9/A), weapons release computer (ASQ-91), [[AGM-12 Bullpup|Bullpup]] air-to-ground missile controller (ARW-77) and aerial refuelling equipment.

; 1972
:At the US-Japan meetings in Hawaii, President [[Richard Nixon]] persuaded Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] to buy the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C]] and [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C]].

; 1978
:25 December – The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) accuses [[McDonnell-Douglas]] of paying Japanese government officials US$15,000 in 1975 as bribes to buy their aircraft.

; 1979
:4 January – The SEC accuses [[Grumman]] of paying various Japanese government officials ([[Nobusuke Kishi]], [[Takeo Fukuda]], [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]], [[Raizo Matsuno|Raizō Matsuno]] and others) bribes via [[Sojitz|Nisshō Iwai (now Sojitz]]) to buy their E-2C aircraft. [[Tokyo District Court]] also commences an investigation, requesting information from the SEC.
:30 January – The [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] Lockheed Investigation Special Committee is renamed the "Special Committee to Investigate Aircraft Imports", with a remit to investigate all allegations concerning aircraft sales.
:1 February – [[Mitsutaka Shimada]], the Nisshō Iwai executive in charge of the aircraft department, dies by falling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott-stokes|first1=Henry|title=Japanese Kills Himself in Plane Scandal Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/japanese-kills-himself-in-plane-scandal-case-japanese-takes-life-in.html|accessdate=7 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=2 February 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; from its head office building in [[Akasaka, Tokyo]], leaving various suicide notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=島田三敬|url=http://www004.upp.so-net.ne.jp/kuhiwo/dazai/shimada.html|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=14 January 2010|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114195842/http://www004.upp.so-net.ne.jp/kuhiwo/dazai/shimada.html|archivedate=14 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary at the time questions whether it was really suicide, on the basis it would be impossible to climb a high window after stabbing one's heart, and a book by journalist [[Kōichirō Yoshihara]] also alleges, with medical evidence, that it was in fact murder. The main 'suicide' note included the words "The company's life is eternal... we should serve it for eternity." The death of a key person causes the investigation to stall.
:14 February – The House of Representatives Budget Committee questions Nissho Iwai's Vice President [[Hachirō Kaifu]] (no relation to the later Prime Minister [[Toshiki Kaifu]]), President [[Mitsuo Ueda]], and former aircraft division manager [[Kunio Arimori]], live on TV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Shoko’ testimony goes live on TV|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/1999/12/14/national/shoko-testimony-goes-live-on-tv/#.WbFd6XCrL4E|accessdate=7 September 2017|work=The Japan Times Online|date=14 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Kaifu appeared unable to sign his statement as his hand was trembling too much&lt;ref name="Welfield"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welfield|first1=John|title=An Empire in Eclipse: Japan in the Post-war American Alliance System: A Study in the Interraction of Domestic Politics and Foreign Policy|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781780939957|pages=440-441|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=U6sVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA440&amp;lpg=PA440&amp;dq=arimori+kunio+%22Nissho+Iwai%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WzHHDctXF0&amp;sig=b6zaBojbxe83c8TuK7FgrzXhpUA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMkPbmnZPWAhWF1RQKHcAEBkkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=arimori%20kunio%20%22Nissho%20Iwai%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which he later claimed was due to [[Parkinson's disease]]. Kaifu repeatedly said "I cannot remember", rejecting the bribery allegations, but confirmed that he had talks with former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka at around the time of the 1972 US-Japan Hawaii meetings, and Matsuno at around the time of the change to Grumman's agent ([[Itochu|Itōchū Corporation]], known at the time as C. Itoh &amp; Co.). He refused to confirm he had hand-written the "Kaifu memo" which was one focus of the questions. Kaifu was also questioned about his relationship with [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] parliamentarian [[Rokusuke Tanaka]], and claimed in the National Assembly that he had had no contact.
:14 March – Nisshō Iwai's Air Department manager and deputy manager are arrested on suspicion of Foreign Exchange Act violations. These individuals had had no interactions with politicians, but are later found guilty of 'falsification and exercise of a private document'. The deputy manager claims that he was not involved, and was targeted by the prosecutors due to being Shimada's top manager in charge of military aircraft, while the counterfeit document had in fact been substantially created by his predecessor and the accounts department manager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivis.co.jp/saloon/4_Imamura/01_bibrio/Imamu-01-6.html IVIS HomePage 私の風土記]&lt;/ref&gt;
:19 March – Kaifu is questioned by the [[House of Councillors]] Budget Committee, and denies writing the "Kaifu memo". On 4 April he is accused of [[perjury]] on this point.
:22 March – Nisshō Iwai's former Vice President [[Kenjirō Yamamura]] and Executive Director [[Kiyoshi Inoue]] give evidence contradicting Kaifu at the Budget Committee. Yamamura testifies with regard to Kaifu's testimony at the House of Representatives Budget Committee that he was "confused".
:31 March – Due to the conflicting evidence from Kaifu and Yamamura, the House of Councilors Budget Committee summons Kaifu, former chairman [[Yoshio Tsuji]], and [[Yasuhiro Gō]], former economic adviser to McDonnell-Douglas. Kaifu amends key parts of his testimony on the 19th, but notably keeps his attitude that responsibility lay with the late Shimada.
:2 April – Kaifu is arrested on suspicion of Foreign Exchange Act violations. When the House of Councilors budget committee hear of his arrest that day, [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] Criminal Bureau Head (later [[Attorney General]]) [[Shigeki Itō]] comments that '''The purpose of the investigation is not only to find small evils but also not to overlook greater evils. If the crime is at the top, we must understand and identify it thoroughly.''' suggesting that the scandal might spread to the centre of the political world. Itō's words '''Do not overlook greater evils''' and (later, in his response to a special committee meeting of the upper house on 25 May) '''500&amp;nbsp;million yen for starters''' become buzzwords of the year.
:16 April – The Attorney General, in overall charge of the investigation, changes from [[Hisao Kamiya]] (retiring due to age) to [[Tatsusaburō Tsuji]]. In his final press conference, Kamiya says '''The prosecutors still have plenty of ability to investigate – I am leaving midway, but am happy to sense their strength of intention'''.
:24 April – Kaifu is rearrested on suspicion of perjury in the House of Representatives.
:26 April – The Diet opposition parties collectively demand that Kishi, Matsuno and others be questioned about their involvement. The LDP refuses, and the National Assembly is left in limbo.
:9 May – Itō suggests at the Legal Committee of the House of Representatives that the names "Fukuda" and "Matsuno" in the memo are unrelated to LDP representatives of the same names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/syugiin/087/0080/08705090080012a.html 87th House of Representatives Legal Committee No. 12], Proceedings of Wednesday, 9 May 1979&lt;/ref&gt;.

Only three Nisshō Iwai officials were ever charged.
:24 May – Matsuno is questioned by the House of Representatives Special Committee on Aircraft Import Investigations. Matsuno acknowledges that he received 500 million yen, but argued that the 500&amp;nbsp;million yen was a political donation from Nisshō Iwai&lt;ref name="Welfield"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welfield|first1=John|title=An Empire in Eclipse: Japan in the Post-war American Alliance System: A Study in the Interraction of Domestic Politics and Foreign Policy|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781780939957|pages=440-441|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=U6sVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA440&amp;lpg=PA440&amp;dq=arimori+kunio+%22Nissho+Iwai%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WzHHDctXF0&amp;sig=b6zaBojbxe83c8TuK7FgrzXhpUA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMkPbmnZPWAhWF1RQKHcAEBkkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=arimori%20kunio%20%22Nissho%20Iwai%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, rejecting the prosecution and opposition parties' claim that it was funds linked to the F-4E purchase.

:28 May – Matsuno is summoned as a witness by the upper house special committee on aircraft imports. After that, the opposition parties tried to submit a resolution on Matsuno's perjury, but this was rejected by the LDP and the Diet is again left in limbo. When the House of Councilors closes, all the bills under deliberation are dismissed, incomplete.
:11 July – Kaifu and [[Kazuo Hidaka]], former aircraft department manager at [[Sumitomo Corporation]], are questioned by the Special Committee on Aircraft Imports regarding the E-2C introduction. Being questioned after arrest and prosecution as with Kaifu in this case is quite rare. Kaifu states that Matsuno was paid 500 million yen as a reward for the F-4 purchase.

Neither plaintiffs nor defendants appeal, and the sentence is confirmed on 7 August.

'''EA WorldView''' is a website specializing in news coverage and analysis of [[Iran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reuters|accessdate=2018-10-11|title=Obama Win Opens Iran Negotiation Window|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/obama-win-iran_n_2089680.html|newspaper=HuffPost|date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syria]], the wider [[Middle East]],&lt;ref name="telegraph-tait"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-11|title=Hassan Rouhani's 'Twitter message to Jews' is at centre of Iran power struggle|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10289654/Hassan-Rouhanis-Twitter-message-to-Jews-is-at-centre-of-Iran-power-struggle.html|date=5 September 2013|issn=0307-1235|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russia]].

==History==
The site was created in 2008 by Scott Lucas, a lecturer of International Politics and [[American Studies]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], who maintains and edits the site. It was originally known as ''Enduring America'', where its archives can still be read.

During the [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests]], it [[liveblogging|liveblogged]] the demonstrations. EA later liveblogged the [[civil uprising phase of the Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=James|last1=Miller|accessdate=2018-10-11|title=Was Friday a Turning Point for Syria?|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-miller/was-friday-a-turning-poin_b_907497.html|date=25 July 2011|newspaper=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the Iranian protests and as the situation in Syria moved to a complex "dynamic stalemate", EA has since moved to providing a daily updated site monitoring mainstream and social media coverage of the region, though provided a live blog of the [[Iranian presidential election, 2013|2013 Iranian Presidential election]].

==Organisation==
Its partners include the University of Birmingham's Politic Science and International Studies department (which hosts its podcast Political WorldView) and [[University College Dublin]]'s Clinton Institute.

==Contributors and editorial team==
Scott Lucas is its editor.&lt;ref name="telegraph-tait"/&gt;

Contributors include [[Liam Kennedy]] of University College Dublin.

==Reception==
Journalist [[Richard Spencer (journalist)|Richard Spencer]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described the site as "a blog of admittedly variable quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spencer|first1=Richard|title=Ignore the conspiracy theories: Assad was behind the Syrian chemical weapons attack | url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/richardspencer/100250185/ignore-the-conspiracy-theories-assad-was-behind-the-syrian-chemical-weapons-attack/ |date= 11 December 2013 |accessdate=6 May 2015|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy==

Ethnopluralism has been proposed by some in the [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] as a means to facilitate nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jensrydgren.com/Sociology%20of%20the%20radical%20right.pdf|title=The Sociology of the Radical Right|last=Rydgren|first=Jens|date=2007|website=|work=Annual Review of Sociology|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing this policy would require [[ethnic cleansing]] to establish separate territories for different ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt;

Ethnopluralism emphasizes the separation of varying ethnic and cultural groups, in contrast to cultural [[Social integration|integration]] and intra-cultural diversity. It has been part of the ideological foundation of the [[European New Right]], which has used ethnopluralism to express its favoritism towards the cultural identity of individual groups, thus expressing its opposition to heterogeneity within states.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCulloch|first=Tom|date=2006-08-01|title=The Nouvelle Droite in the 1980s and 1990s: Ideology and Entryism, the Relationship with the Front National|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.fp.8200099|journal=French Politics|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=158–178|doi=10.1057/palgrave.fp.8200099|issn=1476-3419}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views of culture, ethnicity and race have become popular among several right-wing and [[far right|far-right]] groups in [[Europe]] since the 1970s, and has been covered in some [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[left-wing politics|left]] sources (i.e. ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'') also.&lt;ref name="Spektorowska Feb 2003" /&gt;

Ethnopluralists use the concept of cultural differentialism to assert a "right to difference" to propose [[regionalism (politics)|regional policies]] of ethnic and racial [[separatism]]. Among ethnopluralists there is no agreed upon definition of group membership, nor where these hypothetical borders would lie. Some ethnopluralists advocate limiting Europe to "true Europeans", while others propose much smaller divisions, similar to an ethnically-based [[communitarianism]]. While some ethnopluralists would allow European Muslims to remain in Europe, Jews and [[Romani people|Romani]] are typically rejected by ethnopluralists.&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt; French [[Nouvelle Droite]] philosopher [[Alain de Benoist]] claims that indigenous cultures in Europe are being threatened, and that [[pan-European nationalism]] based on ethnopluralism would stop this process.&lt;ref name="Spektorowska Feb 2003"/&gt; Benoist has proposed ethnic and social territories be as small as possible, such that Muslims would be allowed ghettos in Europe subordinate to [[sharia]].&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt;

According to [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Benjamin R. Teitelbaum]], the term "ethnopluralism" was first coined by German sociologist [[Henning Eichberg]] in an essay that was written in opposition to both Western and European [[eurocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;Teitelbaum, Benjamin (2013). "Come Hear Our Merry Song:" Shifts in the Sound of Contemporary Swedish Radical Nationalism. Ph.D. Dissertation, Brown University. pages 103-105&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Euro-Slavism''' ('''Euroslavism''') is a political concept that evolved from [[Pan-Slavism]]. It aims to solve problems of [[Slavic people]]s within the [[European Union]]. Euroslavists promote cooperation and unity among Slavic peoples, which can be achieved through [[European integration]].&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{Citation |last=Wagner|first=Lukas|title=The EU's Russian Roulette |year=2009 |publisher=University of Tampere|location=Tampere |url=https://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/81047/gradu03888.pdf?sequence=1 |accessdate=19 March 2017|pages = 74–78, 85–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morávek|first=Štefan|title=Patriotizmus a šovinizmus |year=2007 |publisher=Government Office of the Slovak Republic|location=Bratislava |url=http://www.akademickyrepozitar.sk/sk/repozitar/europska-idea-a-slovenska-politika-po-roku-2002.pdf |language=sk|accessdate=19 March 2017|page = 97|isbn=978-80-88707-99-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It shaped from a branch of a larger and older [[Pan-Slavism]] ideology. Euroslavism is considered to be a modern form of the [[Austro-Slavism]] and [[Neo-Slavism]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| contribution = Austro-Slavism  | year = 2002| title = Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture| editor1-last = Magcosi| editor1-first = Robert| editor2-last = Pop| editor2-first = Ivan| pages = 21| place = Toronto| publisher = University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-3566-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Mikulášek| first = Alexej|title=Ke koexistenci slovanských a židovských kultur|language=cs|url=http://www.obrys-kmen.cz/archivok/ucs/sss.html#5|accessdate=19 March 2017|year=2014|publisher=Union of Czech Writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Its origins came in the middle of the [[19th century]]. First proposed by Czech politician [[Karel Havlíček Borovský]] in 1846 as Austro-Slavism, it was refined into a provisional political program by Czech politician [[František Palacký]] and completed by the first President of Czechoslovakia [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] in his work ''New Europe: Slavic Viewpoint''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Masaryk|first=Tomáš G.|authorlink=Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|title=Nová Evropa: stanovisko slovanské |year=2016 |edition=5 |publisher=Ústav T.G.

==Characteristics==

Euroslavists promote cooperation among Slavs on equal terms in order to resist [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] tendencies from [[Western Europe]] and the dominant position of [[Germany]] within the EU. Typical is strong encouragement of [[democracy]] and democratic values. Their view is that every state has the right to decide whether to become a member of the [[European Union]]. They oppose the exclusion of Russia from the European [[Culture of Europe|cultural area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lukeš| first = Igor| title = Czechoslovakia between Stalin and Hitler| publisher = Oxford University Press| place = New York| year = 1996| isbn = 0-19-510266-5| page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the longer term they believe it possible to create a united Slavic community without Russian dominance.&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13874">In general, '''expansionism''' consists of policies of governments and states that involve territorial, military or economic expansion. While some have linked the term to promoting [[economic growth]] (in contrast to [[Steady-state economy|no growth]] or sustainable policies), more commonly expansionism refers to the doctrine of a state expanding its territorial base or economic influence. This occurs usually, though not necessarily, by means of military aggression. Compare [[empire-building]], [[colonialism]], and ''mensurable''.

[[Anarchism]], [[reunification]] or [[pan-nationalism]] are sometimes used to justify and legitimize expansionism, but only when the explicit goal is to reconquer territories that have been lost, or to take over ancestral lands. A simple territorial dispute, such as a border dispute, is not usually referred to as expansionism.

Countries with nuclear weapons are more likely to exhibit expansionist behavior; particularly, if the state is not a democracy, and even if such state's public ideology is non-interference. Depending on chosen strategy, expansionism manifests in brute force or any threat of it, or in economic measures (a debt trap through infrastructure "investments" via burdensome loans), active measures (such as espionage, sabotage, manipulation of critical infrastructure), or a combination thereof. With conflicts that involve war, mutual accusations of expansionism are inevitable between nuclear powers that have strategic overlap.

==Past examples==
{{expand section|more historical examples|date=November 2017}} 
The militarist and nationalistic reign of [[Czar Nicholas I]] (1825–1855) led to wars of conquest against [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Persia (1826–1828)]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Turkey (1828–1829)]]. Various rebel tribes in the [[Caucasus]] region were crushed. A [[November Uprising|Polish revolt]] in 1830 was ruthlessly crushed. Russian troops in 1848 crossed into [[Austria-Hungary]] to put down the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolt]]. [[Russification]] policies were implemented to weaken minority ethnic groups. Nicholas also built the [[Kremlin Palace]] and a new cathedral in Saint Petersburg. But [[Pan-slavism]] ambition led to further war with Turkey (the [[Sick man of Europe]]) in 1853 provoked Britain and France into [[Crimean War|invading Crimea]], and Nicholas died, supposedly of grief at his defeat. &lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], Crimea, Penguin, 2011, chapter one &lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Second Reich]] (1871–1918) underwent an industrial revolution under [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], who also reformed and expanded the army. Poles and Catholics were persecuted. Colonies were acquired in Africa and China. In 1890, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] dismissed Bismarck and resolved to build a world-class Navy, which led to an [[arms race]] with Britain and thence to World War One. &lt;ref&gt; [[Allan Mallinson]], '1914; Fight the Good Fight', Bantam Press, 2013, chapter two &lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933 the [[Third Reich]] under Hitler laid claim to the [[Rhineland]], the [[Sudetenland]], unification (''[[Anschluss]]'') with Austria in 1938, and the whole of the Czech lands the following year. After war broke out, Hitler and Stalin divided Poland between Germany and the USSR. In a ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' aimed at achieving ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for the German people, Germany invaded the USSR in 1941. &lt;ref&gt; [[Sebastian Haffner]], [[The Meaning of Hitler]], Phoenix, 2000, chapters 2,3 and 4 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colonialism]], a form of expansionism is the policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories, generally with the aim of developing or exploiting them to the benefit of the colonizing country.&lt;ref&gt;''Colonialism'', Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1989 ed.) p. 291.; ''Colonialisme'', Nouveau Petit Robert de la langue française (1993 ed.), p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of colonialism|European colonial period]] was the era from the 15th century to the mid-20th century when several European powers had established colonies in the [[Americas]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].

[[Expansionist nationalism]] is an aggressive and radical form of [[nationalism]] that incorporates autonomous, patriotic sentiments with a belief in expansionism. The term was coined during the late nineteenth century as European powers indulged in the '[[Scramble for Africa]]' in the name of national glory, but has been most associated with militarist governments during the 20th century including [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist_regime_.281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Japanese empire]], and the [[Balkans]] countries of [[Albanian nationalism|Albania]] ([[Greater Albania]]), [[Bulgarian nationalism|Bulgaria]] ([[Greater Bulgaria]]), [[Croatian nationalism|Croatia]] ([[Greater Croatia]]), [[Hungarian nationalism|Hungary]] ([[Hungarian irredentism|Greater Hungary]]), [[Romanian nationalism|Romania]] ([[Greater Romania]]) and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbia]] ([[Greater Serbia]]).

==21st century==
===China===
The People's Republic of China is expanding its operations and influence in the [[South China Sea]], claiming possession of disputed offshore islands in the search for oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Tisdall]], 'Vietnam's fury at China's expansionism can be traced to a troubled history', [[The Guardian]], 15/5/2004&lt;/ref&gt; A major instrument of influence is the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].

[[Israel]] has tried to expand its territory and power through the occupation of the [[Syria|Syrian]] Golan Heights,&lt;ref&gt;https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/&lt;/ref&gt; the killing of [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] civilians in the [[Gaza Strip]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/gaza-protest-latest-updates-180406092506561.html&lt;/ref&gt; warring with neighbouring [[Lebanon]] (2006) and openly considering future wars,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2006/08/17/nasrallah-wins-the-war&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/a-new-war-could-erupt-as-tensions-rise-between-israel-and-lebanon-2017-10&lt;/ref&gt; striking Syrian and Iranian forces that purport to defend the Syria against [[Daesh]] terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/news/437647-israel-strikes-syria-iran/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], the largest [[Shi'ite]] state, has extended its influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Arango]], 'Iran Dominates in Iraq after US 'handed the country over'', [[The New York Times]], 15/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[United States]] is seen to be using its power to expand its influence. Criticism is meted out for large-scale events (wars); for expressing support in favor of opposition groups, and for aiding the rebel groups' aspirations to remove governments. The war in [[Afghanistan]] was begun in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks; despite opposition by traditional allies such as [[France]], a war in [[Iraq]] was declared based on the inaccurate information of Iraq hosting weapons of mass destruction. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found, however a controversial [[Iraqi oil law|oil law]] was passed through American influence, largely privatising the valuable commodity of oil to foreign companies. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-afghanistan-announce-war-us-army-escalation-pakistan-a7905821.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2018/02/23/trump-administration-troops-can-stay-in-iraq-syria-indefinitely/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/opinion/13juhasz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the United States extends to: embargoing countries such as Cuba;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy-un/us-trade-embargo-has-cost-cuba-130-billion-un-says-idUSKBN1IA00T&lt;/ref&gt; building military bases around the world, especially in the [[Arab countries]] of the [[Persian Gulf]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americansecurityproject.org/national-security-strategy/u-s-bases-in-the-middle-east/&lt;/ref&gt; supporting opposition groups in [[Libya]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]] during the [[Arab Spring]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-usa-order/exclusive-obama-authorizes-secret-help-for-libya-rebels-idUSTRE72T6H220110330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/turkey-to-u-s-end-support-for-syrian-kurd-ypg-or-risk-confrontation-idUSKBN1FE297&lt;/ref&gt; implementing sanctions against the leaderships of countries [[Venezuela]], [[Russia]], and Iran;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html&lt;/ref&gt; deploying its navy in the [[South China Sea]], widely seen as a way to counter Chinese claims in the South China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2166910/us-navy-plans-major-show-strength-south-china-sea-warning&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit rhetoric of president [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and his political satellites has had a damaging effect on the United States itself. Examples of such are the overt rhetoric advocating the overthrow of democratically-elected governments deemed undemocratic by the United States, such as in [[Venezuela]], [[Iran]], and [[Syria]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/08/trump-nicolas-maduro-overthrow-venezuelan-meetings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-opposition/trump-lawyer-giuliani-says-irans-government-will-be-overthrown-idUSKCN1M3005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2016/12/08/officials-obama-prioritized-defeating-assad-above-defeating-jihadists.html&lt;/ref&gt; the influencing of the blockade of countries such as [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/timeline-gcc-egyptian-discord-qatar-170605063154230.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, the United States is also seen to be asserting its dominance economically. Faced by a rapidly-internationalising Renminbi and a growing eurozone, the United States is using the global dominance of the US dollar in worldwide trade to indiscriminately sanction [[NATO]] allies such as [[Turkey]], as well as rival countries such as [[Russia]], Venezuela and Iran;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html &lt;/ref&gt; using protectionist measures against traditional allies and fellow [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]-members, [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[European Union]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-tariffs-in-us-canada-china-eu-mexico-world-2018-7&lt;/ref&gt; and initiating a major trade war with economic rival [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45294162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideologies==

In the nineteenth century, theories of racial unity such as [[Pan-Germanism]], [[Pan-Slavism]], [[Pan-Turkism]] and the related [[Turanism]], evolved. In each case, the dominant nation (respectively, [[Prussia]], [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], ''Crimea'', Penguin, 2011, p.89 &lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially under [[Enver Pasha]],) used these theories to legitimise their expansionist policies.

==In popular culture==

[[George Orwell]]'s satirical novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'' is a fictional depiction, based on [[Stalin]]'s [[USSR]], of a new elite seizing power, establishing new rules and hierarchies, then expanding economically while compromising their ideals; while [[Robert Erskine Childers]] in ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' portrayed the threatening nature of the German [[Second Reich]]. [[Elspeth Huxley]]'s novel [[Red Strangers]] shows the effects on local culture of colonial expansion into sub-Saharan Africa.

In British research policy, the '''Haldane principle''' is the idea that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians. It is named after [[Richard Burdon Haldane]], who in 1904 and from 1909 to 1918 chaired committees and commissions which recommended this policy.

==Overview==
The 1904 committee recommended the creation of the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] which has evolved via the [[Universities Funding Council]] into the current higher education funding councils: [[Research Councils UK]], [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]], [[Scottish Funding Council]] and [[Higher Education Funding Council for Wales]].

In 1918 Haldane's committee produced the "Haldane Report".  The report suggested that research required by government departments could be separated into that required by specific departments and that which was more general.  It recommended that departments should oversee the specific research but the general research should be under the control of autonomous [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]], which would be free from political and administrative pressures that might discourage research in certain areas.  The principle of the autonomy of the research councils is now referred to as the Haldane Principle. The first research council to be created as a result of the Haldane Report was the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]].

The principle has remained enshrined in British Government policy, but has been criticised and altered over the years.  In 1939 [[J.D. Bernal]] argued that social good was more important than researchers' freedom in deciding the direction of research.  [[Solly Zuckerman]] criticised it in 1971 for its artificial separation of basic and applied science, and the consequent elevation of the status of the former.

A major revision to the application of the Haldane Principle in British research funding came in the early 1970s with the Rothschild Report of 1971, and its implementation which transferred about 25% of the then Research Council funds, and the decisions on the research to be funded with them, back to government departments, a move later undone by Margaret Thatcher's government.

There is currently a debate about the extent to which the principle is still applied in practice.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39078281 BBC 24 02 2017: Minister to enshrine protection for research independence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Higher Education and Research Act 2017]], which merged the research councils and the research part of the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] into [[UK Research and Innovation]], enacted the Haldane principle as section 103(3): ''The “Haldane principle” is the principle that decisions on individual research proposals are best taken following an evaluation of the quality and likely impact of the proposals (such as a peer review process).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/29/section/103/enacted  Higher Education and Research Act 2017], legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hierarchy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''hierarkhia'', "rule of a high priest", from ''[[ordinary (officer)|hierarkhes]]'', "president of sacred rites") is an arrangement of items (objects, names, values, categories, etc.) in which the items are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the same level as" one another.

A hierarchy can link entities either directly or indirectly, and either vertically or diagonally. The only direct links in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior or to one of one's subordinates, although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies. Indirect hierarchical links can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction, following a [[path (graph theory)|path]]. All parts of the hierarchy which are not linked vertically to one another nevertheless can be "horizontally" linked through a path by traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and then down again. This is akin to two [[co-worker]]s or [[colleague]]s; each reports to a common superior, but they have the same relative amount of authority. Organizational forms exist that are both alternative and complementary to hierarchy. [[Heterarchy]] is one such form.

==Nomenclature==
{{see also| Glossary of graph theory| Taxonomy (general)| Structure}}
Hierarchies have their own special vocabulary. These terms are easiest to understand when a hierarchy is diagrammed (see [[#Visualization|below]]).

In an organizational context, the following terms are often used related to hierarchies:&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Architecture"/&gt;
* '''[[Entity|Object]]''': one entity (e.g., a person, department or [[concept]] or element of arrangement or member of a set)
* '''[[System]]''': the entire set of objects that are being arranged hierarchically (e.g., an administration)
* '''[[Dimension]]''': another word for "system" from on-line analytical processing (e.g. cubes)
* '''[[Element (mathematics)|Member]]''': an (element or object) at any (level or rank) in a (class-system, taxonomy or dimension)
*'''Terms about Positioning'''
**'''[[Ranking|Rank]]''': the relative [[value (ethics)|value]], worth, [[complexity]], [[Power (philosophy)|power]], [[importance]], [[authority]], level etc. of an object
**'''[[wikt:level#Noun|Level]]''': a set of objects with the same rank OR importance
**'''[[Order of precedence|Ordering]]''': the arrangement of the (ranks or levels)
**'''Hierarchy''': the arrangement of a particular set of members into (ranks or levels). Multiple hierarchies are possible per (dimension taxonomy or Classification-system), in which selected levels of the dimension are omitted to flatten the structure
*'''Terms about Placement'''
**'''[[wikt:hierarch|Hierarch]]''', the apex of the hierarchy, consisting of one single orphan (object or member) in the top level of a dimension. The root of an inverted-tree structure
**'''[[wikt:member|Member]]''', a (member or node) in any level of a hierarchy in a dimension to which (superior and subordinate) members are attached 
**'''[[wikt:orphan|Orphan]]''', a member in any level of a dimension without a parent member. Often the apex of a disconnected branch. Orphans can be grafted back into the hierarchy by creating a relationship (interaction) with a parent in the immediately superior level
**'''[[wikt:leaf|Leaf]]''', a member in any level of a dimension without subordinates in the hierarchy
**'''[[wikt:neighbour|Neighbour]]''': a member adjacent to another member in the same (level or rank). Always a peer.
**'''[[Superior (hierarchy)|Superior]]''': a higher level or an object ranked at a higher level (A parent or an ancestor)
**'''[[wikt:subordinate|Subordinate]]''': a lower level or an object ranked at a lower level (A child or a descendent)
** '''[[Family of sets|Collection]]''': all of the objects at one level (i.e Peers)
** '''[[wikt:peer|Peer]]''': an object with the same rank (and therefore at the same level)
** '''[[Interpersonal relationship|Interaction]]''': the relationship between an object and its direct superior or subordinate (i.e. a superior/inferior pair)
*** a '''direct''' interaction occurs when one object is on a level exactly one higher or one lower than the other (i.e., on a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]], the two objects have a line between them)
** '''[[Distance (graph theory)|Distance]]''': the minimum number of connections between two objects, i.e., one less than the number of objects that need to be "crossed" to trace a [[path (graph theory)|path]] from one object to another
** '''[[wikt:Span|Span]]''': a [[qualitative data|qualitative]] description of the width of a level when diagrammed, i.e., the number of subordinates an object has
*'''Terms about Nature'''
** '''[[wikt:attribute|Attribute]]''': a heritable characteristic of (members and their subordinates) in a level (eg. ''hair-colour'')
** '''[[wikt:attribute-value|Attribute-value]]''': the specific value of a heritable characteristic (eg. ''Auburn'')

In a mathematical context (in [[graph theory]]), the [[Glossary of graph theory|general terminology]] used is different.

Most hierarchies use a more specific vocabulary pertaining to their subject, but the idea behind them is the same. For example, with [[data structure]]s, objects are known as [[node (computer science)|nodes]], superiors are called [[parent node|parents]] and subordinates are called [[child node|children]]. In a business setting, a superior is a [[supervisor|supervisor/boss]] and a peer is a [[colleague]].

===Degree of branching===
[[Degree (graph theory)|Degree]] of [[Bifurcation theory|branching]] refers to the number of direct [[#Terminology|subordinates]] or children an object has (in graph theory, equivalent to the number of other [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] connected to via outgoing arcs, in a directed graph) a node has. Hierarchies can be categorized based on the "maximum degree", the highest degree present in the system as a whole. Categorization in this way yields two broad classes: ''linear'' and ''branching''.

In a '''linear hierarchy'''&lt;!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold--&gt;, the maximum degree is 1.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt; In other words, all of the objects can be visualized in a line-up, and each object (excluding the top and bottom ones) has exactly one direct subordinate and one direct superior. Note that this is referring to the ''objects'' and not the ''levels''; every hierarchy has this property with respect to levels, but normally each level can have an infinite number of objects. An example of a linear hierarchy is the [[hierarchy of life]].

In a '''branching hierarchy'''&lt;!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold--&gt;, one or more objects has a degree of 2 or more (and therefore the minimum degree is 2 or higher).&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt; For many people, the word "hierarchy" automatically evokes an image of a branching hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt; Branching hierarchies are present within numerous systems, including [[organization]]s and [[classification scheme]]s. The broad category of branching hierarchies can be further subdivided based on the degree.

A '''flat hierarchy'''&lt;!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold--&gt; is a branching hierarchy in which the maximum degree approaches infinity, i.e., that has a wide span.&lt;ref name="Architecture"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=Herbert A.|title=The Architecture of Complexity|journal=[[Proc. Am. Philos. Soc.]]|volume=106|issue=6|date=12 December 1962|pages=467–482|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|issn=0003-049X|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |jstor=985254 |citeseerx=10.1.1.110.961}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, systems intuitively regarded as hierarchical have at most a moderate span. Therefore, a flat hierarchy is often not viewed as a hierarchy at all. For example, [[diamond]]s and [[graphite]] are flat hierarchies of numerous [[carbon]] atoms which can be further decomposed into subatomic particles.

An '''overlapping hierarchy'''&lt;!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold--&gt; is a branching hierarchy in which at least one object has two parent objects.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt; For example, a [[graduate student]] can have two [[research supervisor|co-supervisors]] to whom the student reports directly and equally, and who have the same level of authority within the [[university]] hierarchy (i.e., they have the same [[list of academic ranks|position]] or [[tenure]] status).

==History of the term==
Possibly the first use of the English word "hierarchy" cited by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was in 1880, when it was used in reference to the three orders of three angels as depicted by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (5th–6th centuries). Pseudo-Dionysius used the related [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word (ἱεραρχία ''hierarchia'') both in reference to the [[De Coelesti Hierarchia|celestial hierarchy]] and the [[ecclesiastical hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07322c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Hierarchy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek term ἱεραρχία means "rule of a high priest"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/hierarchy "hierarchy"]. [[Online Etymology Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; (from ἱεράρχης ''hierarches'', meaning "president of sacred rites, high-priest"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Di%28era%2Frxhs ἱεράρχης],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and that from ἱερεύς ''hiereus'', "priest"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Di%28ereu%2Fs ἱερεύς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and ἀρχή ''arche'', amongst others "first place or power, rule"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxh%2F ἀρχή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;), and Dionysius is credited with first use of it as an abstract noun. Since hierarchical churches, such as the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] (see [[Catholic Church hierarchy]]) and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, had tables of organization that were "hierarchical" in the modern sense of the word (traditionally with [[God in Christianity|God]] as the pinnacle or head of the hierarchy), the term came to refer to similar organizational methods in [[secular]] settings.

[[File:Maslow's hierarchy of needs.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's hierarchy of human needs]]. This is an example of a hierarchy visualized with a triangle diagram.]]
A hierarchy is typically depicted as a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], where the height of a level represents that level's status and width of a level represents the quantity of items at that level relative to the whole. For example, the few [[Board of Directors|Directors]] of a company could be at the [[apex (geometry)|apex]], and the [[Base (geometry)|base]] could be thousands of people who have no subordinates.

These pyramids are typically diagrammed with a [[tree structure|tree]] or [[triangle]] [[diagram]] (but note that not all triangle/pyramid diagrams are hierarchical, for example, the 1992 [[History of USDA nutrition guides#Food Guide Pyramid|USDA food guide pyramid]]), both of which serve to emphasize the size differences between the levels. An example of a triangle diagram appears to the right. An [[organizational chart]] is the diagram of a hierarchy within an [[organization]], and is depicted in tree form [[#Organizations|below]].

More recently, as computers have allowed the storage and navigation of ever larger data sets, various methods have been developed to represent hierarchies in a manner that makes more efficient use of the available space on a computer's screen. Examples include fractal maps, [[treemapping|TreeMaps]] and [[Radial tree|Radial Trees]].

==Visual hierarchy==
In the design field, mainly graphic design, successful layouts and formatting of the content on documents are heavily dependent on the rules of [[visual hierarchy]]. Visual hierarchy is also important for proper organization of files on computers.

An example of visually representing hierarchy is through the Nested clusters. The Nested clusters represents hierarchical relationships by using layers of information. The child element is within the parent element, such as in a [[Venn diagram]]. This structure of representing hierarchy is most effective in representing simple relationships. For example, when directing someone to open a file on a computer desktop, one may first direct them towards the main folder, then the subfolders within the main folder. They will keep opening files within the folders until the designated file is located.

For more complicated hierarchies, the stair structure represents hierarchical relationships through the use of visual stacking. Visually imagine the top of a downward staircase beginning at the left and descending on the right. The child elements are towards the bottom of the stairs and the parent elements are at the top. This structure is effective when representing more complicated hierarchies where steps are not placed in obvious sequences. Further steps are concealed unless all of the steps are revealed in sequence. In the computer desktop example, a file that is being sought after can only be found once another file is opened. The link for the desired file is within another document. All the steps must be completed until the final destination is reached.

==Informal representation==
In plain English, a hierarchy can be thought of as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] in which:&lt;ref name="Dawkins"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dawkins|title=Hierarchical organization: a candidate principle for ethology|conference=Growing points in ethology: based on a conference sponsored by St. John's College and King's College, Cambridge|editors=Bateson, Paul Patrick Gordon; Hinde, Robert A.|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-29086-4|pages=7–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# No element is superior to itself, and
# One element, the ''hierarch'', is superior to all of the other elements in the set.
The first requirement is also interpreted to mean that a hierarchy can have no [[Cycle (graph theory)|circular relationships]]; the association between two objects is always [[Transitive relation|transitive]].
The second requirement asserts that a hierarchy must have a leader or [[root node|root]] that is common to all of the objects.

==Mathematical representation==
{{Main|Hierarchy (mathematics)}}
Mathematically, in its most general form, a hierarchy is a [[partially ordered set]] or ''poset''.&lt;ref name="Lehmann"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Lehmann|first=Fritz|title=Big Posets of Participatings and Thematic Roles|pages=50–74|conference=Conceptual structures: knowledge representation as interlingua—4th International Conference on Conceptual Structures, ICCS '96, Sydney, Australia, August 19–22, 1996—proceedings
|isbn=3-540-61534-2|year=1996|publisher=Springer|editor-last=Eklund|editor-first=Peter G.|editor2-last=Ellis|editor2-first=Gerard|editor3-last=Mann|editor3-first=Graham|series=Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 115|location=Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[#Terminology|system]] in this case is the entire poset, which is constituted of elements. Within this system, each element shares a particular unambiguous property. Objects with the same property value are grouped together, and each of those resulting [[#Terminology|levels]] is referred to as a [[class (set theory)|class]].

"Hierarchy" is particularly used to refer to a poset in which the classes are organized in terms of increasing complexity. &lt;!--Mathematically, a hierarchy can be depicted as a [[combinatorial]] [[object]].--&gt;
Operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are often performed in a certain sequence or order. Usually, addition and subtraction are performed after multiplication and division has already been applied to a problem. The use of parenthesis is also a representation of hierarchy, for they show which operation is to be done prior to the following ones. For example:
(2 + 5) × (7 - 4).
In this problem, typically one would multiply 5 by 7 first, based on the rules of mathematical hierarchy. But when the parentheses are placed, one will know to do the operations within the parentheses first before continuing on with the problem. These rules are largely dominant in algebraic problems, ones that include several steps in order to solve. The use of hierarchy in mathematics is beneficial in order to quickly and efficiently solve a problem without having to go through the process of slowly dissecting the problem. Most of these rules are now known as the proper way into solving certain equations.

[[File:Russian-Matroshka no bg.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Matryoshka doll]]s, also known as ''nesting dolls'' or ''Russian dolls''. Each doll is encompassed inside another until the smallest one is reached. This is the concept of ''nesting''. When the concept is applied to [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the resulting ordering is a ''nested hierarchy''.]]
A nested hierarchy or ''inclusion hierarchy'' is a hierarchical ordering of [[nested set]]s.&lt;ref name="natsocsci-ch4"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hierarchy, Complexity, Society|last=Lane|first=David|pages=81–120|encyclopedia=Hierarchy in Natural and Social Sciences|editor=Pumain, Denise|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|location=New York, New York|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4020-4126-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nesting is exemplified in Russian [[matryoshka doll]]s. Each doll is encompassed by another doll, all the way to the outer doll. The outer doll holds all of the inner dolls, the next outer doll holds all the remaining inner dolls, and so on. Matryoshkas represent a nested hierarchy where each level contains only one object, i.e., there is only one of each size of doll; a generalized nested hierarchy allows for multiple objects within levels but with each object having only one parent at each level. The general concept is both demonstrated and mathematically formulated in the following example:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{square} \subset \text{quadrilateral} \subset \text{polygon} \subset \text{shape} \, &lt;/math&gt;

A square can always also be referred to as a quadrilateral, polygon or shape. In this way, it is a hierarchy. However, consider the set of polygons using this classification. A square can ''only'' be a quadrilateral; it can never be a [[triangle]], [[hexagon]], etc.

Nested hierarchies are the organizational schemes behind [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] and systematic classifications. For example, using the original [[Linnaean taxonomy]] (the version he laid out in the 10th edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]''), a human can be formulated as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis|last=Linnaei|first=Carl von|authorlink=Carl Linnaeus|year=1959|edition=10th|language=Latin|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/542#|location=[[Stockholm]]|publisher=Impensis Direct|isbn=0-665-53008-0|accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{H. sapiens} \subset \text{Homo} \subset \text{Primates} \subset \text{Mammalia} \subset \text{Animalia}&lt;/math&gt;

Taxonomies may change frequently (as seen in [[biological classification|biological taxonomy]]), but the underlying concept of nested hierarchies is always the same.

In many programming taxonomies and syntax models (as well as fractals in mathematics), nested hierarchies, including Russian dolls, are also used to illustrate the properties of [[self-similarity]] and [[recursion]]. Recursion itself is included as a subset of hierarchical programming, and recursive thinking can be synonymous with a form of hierarchical thinking and logic.&lt;ref name=Corballis&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Corballis |title=The Recursive Mind  |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0691145471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Containment hierarchy====
A containment hierarchy is a direct extrapolation of the [[#Nested hierarchy|nested hierarchy]] concept. All of the ordered sets are still nested, but every set must be "[[strict subset|strict]]"—no two sets can be identical. The shapes example above can be modified to demonstrate this:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{square} \subsetneq \text{quadrilateral} \subsetneq \text{polygon} \subsetneq \text{shape} \, &lt;/math&gt;

The notation &lt;math&gt; x \subsetneq y \, &lt;/math&gt; means ''x'' is a subset of ''y'' but is not equal to&amp;nbsp;''y''.

A general example of a containment hierarchy is demonstrated in [[inheritance (computer science)|class inheritance]] in [[object-oriented programming]].

Two types of containment hierarchies are the ''subsumptive'' containment hierarchy and the ''compositional'' containment hierarchy. A subsumptive hierarchy "[[wikt:subsume|subsumes]]" its children, and a compositional hierarchy is "[[wikt:composed|composed]]" of its children. A hierarchy can also be both subsumptive ''and'' compositional{{example needed|date=August 2018}}.&lt;ref name="AI industrial"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Industrial and Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems|last=Kopisch|first=Manfred|last2=Günther|first2=Andreas|doi=10.1007/BFb0024994|editor-last=Belli|editor-first=Fevzi|encyclopedia=Industrial and engineering applications of artificial intelligence and expert systems: 5th international conference, IEA/AIE-92, Paderborn, Germany, June 9–12, 1992 : proceedings|year=1992|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|pages=424–427|isbn=3-540-55601-X|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science Series|volume=602|issn=0302-9743|editor6-last=Radermacher|editor8-first=Franz-Josef|chapter=Configuration of a passenger aircraft cabin based on conceptual hierarchy, constraints and flexible control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Subsumptive containment hierarchy=====
A ''[[Category theory|subsumptive]]'' containment hierarchy is a classification of object classes from the general to the specific. Other names for this type of hierarchy are "taxonomic hierarchy" and "[[is-a|IS-A]] hierarchy".&lt;ref name="Lehmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wtxdoc/v8r2m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.dtx.md.doc/concepts/c_map_design_Compositional_Hierarchy.htm|title=Compositional hierarchy|work=WebSphere Transformation Extender Design Studio|accessdate=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sys model"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=An advanced modeling environment based on a hybrid AI-OR approach|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ds2eIQ6XZy0C&amp;pg=PA366|pages=366–75|last=Funke|first=Birger|last2=Sebastian|first2=Hans-Jürgen|title=Systems modelling and optimization: proceedings of the 18th IFIP TC7 conference|volume=396|series=Research notes in mathematics series|editor1-last=Polis|editor1-first=Michael P.|editor2-last=Dontchev|editor2-first=Asen L.|editor3-last=Kall|editor3-first=Peter|editor4-last=Lascieka|editor4-first=Irena|editor5-last=Olbrot|editor5-first=Andrzej W.|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8493-0607-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last term describes the relationship between each level—a lower-level object "is a" member of the higher class. The taxonomical structure outlined above is a subsumptive containment hierarchy. Using again the example of Linnaean taxonomy, it can be seen that an object that is part of the level ''Mammalia'' "is a" member of the level ''Animalia''; more specifically, a human "is a" primate, a primate "is a" mammal, and so on. A subsumptive hierarchy can also be defined abstractly as a hierarchy of "[[concept]]s".&lt;ref name="sys model"/&gt; For example, with the Linnaean hierarchy outlined above, an entity name like ''Animalia'' is a way to group all the species that fit the [[wikt:conceptualization|conceptualization]] of an animal.

=====Compositional containment hierarchy=====
A ''compositional'' containment hierarchy is an ordering of the parts that make up a system—the system is "composed" of these parts.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=David|title=Object Oriented Programming in C++|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2002|pages=110–185|isbn=0-8264-5428-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most engineered structures, whether natural or artificial, can be broken down in this manner.

The compositional hierarchy that every person encounters at every moment is the [[hierarchy of life]]. Every person can be reduced to [[organ system]]s, which are composed of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], which are composed of [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], which are composed of [[cells (biology)|cells]], which are composed of [[molecule]]s, which are composed of [[atom]]s. In fact, the last two levels apply to all [[matter]], at least at the [[macroscopic scale]]. Moreover, each of these levels inherit all the properties of their [[#Terminology|children]].

In this particular example, there are also ''[[emergent properties]]''—functions that are not seen at the lower level (e.g., [[cognition]] is not a property of [[neuron]]s but is of the [[Human brain|brain]])—and a scalar quality (molecules are bigger than atoms, cells are bigger than molecules, etc.). Both of these concepts commonly exist in compositional hierarchies, but they are not a required general property. These ''level hierarchies'' are characterized by bi-directional [[Causality|causation]].&lt;ref name="natsocsci-ch4"/&gt; ''Upward causation'' involves lower-level entities causing some property of a higher level entity; children entities may interact to yield parent entities, and parents are composed at least partly by their children. ''[[Downward causation]]'' refers to the effect that the incorporation of entity ''x'' into a higher-level entity can have on ''x'''s properties and interactions. Furthermore, the entities found at each level are ''[[autonomous]]''.

Almost every system of organization applied to the world is arranged hierarchically.&lt;ref name="electrodynamics"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hierarchical Methods: Hierarchy and hierarchical asymptotic methods in electrodynamics|last=Kulish|first=V.

Most [[organized religion]]s, regardless of their internal governance structures, operate as a hierarchy under [[God]]. Many [[Christian denomination]]s have an [[autocephalous]] [[ecclesiastical hierarchy]] of leadership. Families are viewed as a hierarchical structure in terms of [[cousinship]] (e.g., first cousin once removed, second cousin, etc.), [[ancestry]] (as depicted in a [[family tree]]) and [[inheritance]] ([[order of succession|succession]] and [[heir]]ship). All the requisites of a well-rounded life and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] can be organized using [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's hierarchy of human needs]]. [[Learning]] must often follow a hierarchical scheme—to learn [[differential equation]]s one must first learn [[calculus]]; to learn calculus one must first learn [[elementary algebra]]; and so on. Even [[nature]] itself has its own hierarchies, as numerous schemes such as [[Linnaean taxonomy]], the [[biological organisation|organization of life]], and [[biomass pyramid]]s attempt to document. Hierarchies are so infused into daily life that they are viewed as trivial.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="electrodynamics"/&gt;

While the above examples are often clearly depicted in a hierarchical form and are classic examples, hierarchies exist in numerous systems where this branching structure is not immediately apparent. For example, most [[postal code]] systems are hierarchical. Using the [[Postal codes in Canada|Canadian postal code system]] as an example, the top level's binding concept is the "[[forward sortation area|postal district]]", and consists of 18 objects (letters). The next level down is the "zone", where the objects are the digits 0–9. This is an example of an [[#Degree_of_branching|overlapping hierarchy]], because each of these 10 objects has 18 parents. The hierarchy continues downward to generate, in theory, 7,200,000 unique codes of the format ''A0A 0A0'' (the second and third letter position allow 20 objects each). Most [[library classification]] systems are also hierarchical. The [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]] is regarded as infinitely hierarchical because there is no finite bound on the number of digits can be used after the decimal point.&lt;ref name="Dewey"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tracking Nuclear Sources|date=May–June 2009|last=Walker|first=Randy|publisher=wellservicingmagazine.com|pages=28–30|url=http://wellservicingmagazine.com/sites/default/files/pdfmag/WSM_MAYJUN09.PDF|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} See also [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Wikipedia article]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Organizational chart.svg|thumb|200px|A simple [[hierarchical organization|organizational hierarchy]] depicted in the form of a [[tree structure|tree]]. Diagrams like this are called [[organizational chart]]s.]]

===Organizations===
{{Main|Organizational structure|Hierarchical organization}}

[[Organization]]s can be structured as a [[dominance hierarchy]]. In an organizational hierarchy, there is a single person or group with the most [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[authority]], and each subsequent level represents a lesser authority. Most organizations are structured in this manner, including [[Forms of government|governments]], [[Company|companies]], [[militia]] and [[organized religion]]s. The units or persons within an organization are depicted hierarchically in an [[organizational chart]].

In a [[reverse hierarchy]], the conceptual [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] of authority is turned upside-down, so that the apex is at the bottom and the base is at the top. This mode represents the idea that members of the higher rankings are responsible for the members of the lower rankings.

=== Life===
{{Main|Biological organisation#Fundamentals}}

Empirically,  we observe in nature a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems, they  exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by Thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organisation|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

===Computer graphic imaging===
{{Main|3D modeling}}
[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and [[computer animation]] [[computer program|programs]] mostly use hierarchies for models. On a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[3d modeling|model]] of a [[human]] for example, the [[chest]] is a [[parent]] of the upper left arm, which is a parent of the lower left arm, which is a parent of the [[hand]]. This is used in [[3D modeling|modeling]] and [[animation]] for almost everything built as a 3D [[Digital data|digital]] model.

===Linguistics===
Many grammatical theories, such as [[phrase-structure grammar]], involve hierarchy.

[[Direct–inverse language]]s such as [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[Mapudungun language|Mapudungun]] distinguish subject and object on [[verb]]s not by different subject and object markers, but via a hierarchy of persons.

In this system, the three (or four with [[Algonquian languages]]) persons are placed in a hierarchy of [[salience (language)|salience]]. To distinguish which is subject and which object, ''inverse markers'' are used if the object outranks the subject.

===Music===
The structure of a musical composition is often understood hierarchically (for example by [[Heinrich Schenker]] (1768–1835, see [[Schenkerian analysis]]), and in the (1985) [[Generative theory of tonal music|Generative Theory of Tonal Music]], by composer [[Fred Lerdahl]] and linguist Ray [[Jackendoff]]). The sum of all notes in a piece is understood to be an all-inclusive surface, which can be reduced to successively more sparse and more fundamental types of motion. The levels of structure that operate in Schenker's theory are the foreground, which is seen in all the details of the musical score; the middle ground, which is roughly a summary of an essential contrapuntal progression and voice-leading; and the background or [[Ursatz]], which is one of only a few basic "long-range counterpoint" structures that are shared in the gamut of tonal music literature.

The [[pitch (music)|pitches]] and [[Musical form|form]] of [[Tonality|tonal]] music are organized hierarchically, all pitches deriving their importance from their relationship to a [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] [[Key signature|key]], and secondary themes in other keys are brought back to the tonic in a recapitulation of the primary theme. [[Susan McClary]] connects this specifically in the [[sonata-allegro form]] to the feminist hierarchy of gender (see above) in her book ''Feminine Endings'', even pointing out that primary themes were often previously called "masculine" and secondary themes "feminine."

===Ethics, behavioral psychology, philosophies of identity===
[[File:Hierarchy Of Purposes.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Career-oriented purposes can be diagrammed using a hierarchy describing how less important actions support a larger goal.]]
In [[ethics]], various [[virtues]] are enumerated and sometimes organized hierarchically according to certain brands of [[virtue theory]].

In some of these random examples, there is an asymmetry of 'compositional' significance between levels of structure, so that small parts of the whole hierarchical array depend, for their meaning, on their membership in larger parts.There is a hierarchy of activities in human life: productive activity serves or is guided by the moral life; the moral life is guided by practical reason; practical reason (used in moral and political life) serves contemplative reason (whereby we contemplate God). Practical reason sets aside time and resources for contemplative reason.

In the work of diverse theorists such as [[William James]] (1842–1910), [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984) and [[Hayden White]], important critiques of hierarchical [[epistemology]] are advanced. James famously asserts in his work "Radical Empiricism" that clear distinctions of type and category are a constant but unwritten goal of scientific reasoning, so that when they are discovered, success is declared. But if aspects of the world are organized differently, involving inherent and intractable ambiguities, then scientific questions are often considered unresolved.

Hierarchy in ethics emerged in Western Europe, West Asia and North Africa around the 1600s. In this aspect, the term hierarchy refers to how distinguishable they are from real to unreal. [[Feminists]], [[Marxists]], [[anarchists]], [[communists]], [[critical theorists]] and others, all of whom have multiple interpretations, criticize the hierarchies commonly found within human society, especially in social relationships. Hierarchies are present in all parts of society: in businesses, schools, families, etc. These relationships are often viewed as necessary. Entities that stand in hierarchical arrangements are animals, humans, plants, etc. In some{{Which|date=July 2012}} cultures, God can also be an addition to this hierarchy. However, feminists, Marxists, critical theorists, and others analyze hierarchy in terms of the values and power that it arbitrarily assigns to one group over another. Hierarchical ethics offers a way of logical reasoning that is compatible with religious commitments. In some{{Which|date=July 2012}} cultures, there is hierarchy within humanity: The man in a family is above the woman, and children are after, and in social classes there might be a hierarchy as follows: king, civic officials, craftsmen, unskilled workers.

A '''hung parliament''' is a term used in legislatures under the [[Westminster system]] to describe a situation in which no particular [[political party]] or pre-existing [[coalition]] (also known as an alliance or bloc) has an [[absolute majority]] of [[legislator]]s (commonly known as members or seats) in a [[parliament]] or other [[legislature]]. This situation is also known, albeit less commonly, as a '''balanced parliament''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/05/minority-government-electoral-reform-editorial | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Balanced parliament: No need to rush | date=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/scotland/8630998.stm | work=BBC News | title=SNP puts case for hung parliament | date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a legislature under '''no overall control''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-48305720100507 | work=Reuters | title=Q+A - What happens if no party gets a majority in UK election? | date=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/04/hung-parliament-minority-coalition-government | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Hung up on 'no overall control' | first=Akash | last=Paun | date=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/05/labour-brown-campaign-cameron |title=Welcome to the era of no overall control |publisher=Newstatesman.com |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can result in a [[minority government]]. The term is not relevant in [[multi-party system]]s where it is rare for a single party to hold a majority.

In the Westminster System, in the circumstance of a hung parliament, no party or coalition has an automatic [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] to assume control of the [[executive branch|executive]] – a status usually known in parliamentary systems as "forming (a) government". However, an absolute majority may still be gained through the formation of a new [[coalition government]], or the addition of previously unaffiliated members to a pre-existing coalition. However, a [[minority government]] may instead result: that is, the party that has the most members is allowed to form government without an absolute majority, provided that it has the express, ongoing support of unaffiliated members, such as [[minor parties]] and/or [[independent (politician)|independent]] legislators.

==Overview==
A normal objective of [[parliamentary system]]s – especially those requiring [[responsible government]], such as the [[Westminster system]] – is the formation of a stable government (i.e. ideally one that lasts a full parliamentary term, until the next election would normally be due). This requires a government to be able to muster sufficient votes in parliament to pass  motions of [[confidence and supply]], especially [[Motion of no confidence|motions of no-confidence]] and [[budget bill]]s). If such motions fail, they normally result in the [[dissolution of parliament]] and a fresh election. In some parliamentary systems, however, a new government may be formed without recourse to an election – if, for example, a minor party holds the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]], it may publicly express for the opposition, thereby creating a new majority.

The term hung parliament is most often used of parliaments dominated by [[two-party system|two major parties or coalitions]]. [[General election]]s in such systems usually result in one party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government. In most parliamentary systems, a hung parliament is considered exceptional and is often seen by all parties and observers as undesirable. In other contexts, a hung parliament may be seen as ideal – for example, if opinions among the voting public are polarised regarding one or more issues, a hung parliament may lead to the emergence of a compromise or consensus.

If a legislature is [[bicameralism|bicameral]], the term "hung parliament" is usually used only with respect to the [[lower house]].

In a [[multi-party system]] with legislators elected by [[proportional representation]] or a similar systems, it is usually exceptionally rare and difficult for any party to have an absolute majority. Under such situations, hung parliaments are often taken for granted and coalition governments are normal. However, the term may be used to describe an election in which no established coalition wins an outright majority (such as the [[German federal election, 2005|German federal election of 2005]] or the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 Italian general election]]).

==History==
===Ireland===
Because Ireland uses PR-STV, it is rare for any one party to have a majority on its own.  
The last such occasion was 1977.  However, one or other coalitions are known to be possible before and during the election.  Therefore, a "hung Dáil" (Dáil Éireann being the lower and most dominant chamber of the Oireachtas/Parliament) in Ireland refers more to the inability of a coalition of parties who traditionally enter government together or would be expected to govern together, from doing so.

The President has no direct role in the formation of governments in the case of a hung parliament.  However he retains the power to convene a meeting of either or both the Dáil and Senate which could become important if there was a government trying to use parliamentary recess to prevent confidence votes and hold onto power.  The President may also refuse to dissolve Dáil Eireann and call an election if the Taoiseach loses a vote of confidence, instead giving the other parties a chance to see if they can put together a government without proceeding to another election.

In 2016, Fine Gael and Labour, who had been in government the previous five years, were unable, due to Labours collapse, to enter government again.  Fianna Fáil had enough seats to put together a rainbow government with the other centre-left, hard left parties and independents but negotiations broke down.  Fianna Fáil had also promised not to enter coalition with Sinn Féin due to the current leaderships Provisional IRA connections.

The press began to speculate about a Germany style "Grand Coalition" similar to the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats there.  Many members of FF considered FG too right wing to enter coalition with and threatened to leave the party this came to pass.  As talks continued on without a new government (the old government, constitutionally, which had just been voted out, remaining in power including ministers who had lost their seats) FF agreed to allow a government to form by abstention.  The parliamentary arithmetic fell in such a way that if FF TD's abstained on confidence and supply matters, a FG minority govt could, with the support of a group of independents, form a new government.  This was agreed in exchange for a number of policy concessions.  
Once the deal with FF was signed, Taoiseach Enda Kenny conducted talks with the independents and entered government for a second term.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:UK House of Commons 2017.svg||thumb|right|230px|The House of Commons following the 2017 general election. No party has a majority.]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], before World War I, a largely stable two-party system existed for generations; traditionally, only the [[Tories]] and [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], or from the mid-19th century the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties, managed to deliver Members of Parliament in significant numbers. Hung parliaments were thus rare, especially during the 19th century. The possibility of change arose when, in the aftermath of the [[Act of Union, 1800]], a number of Irish MPs took seats in the House, though initially [[History of Ireland 1801–1923#Home Rule movement (1870–1914)|these]] followed the traditional alignments. However, two Reform Acts ([[Reform Act 1867|in 1867]] and [[Representation of the People Act 1884|in 1884]]) significantly extended the franchise and redrew the constituencies, and coincided with [[Catholic Emancipation|a change in Irish politics]]. After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]], neither party had an overall majority.  The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] held the balance of power and made [[Irish Home Rule]] a condition of their support. However, the Liberal Party split on the issue of Irish Home Rule, leading to [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|another general election in 1886]], in which the Conservatives won the most seats and governed with the support of the fragment of Liberalism opposed to Home Rule, the [[Liberal Unionist Party]].

Both the [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|election of January 1910]], and that of [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] produced a hung parliament with an almost identical number of seats won by the governing Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. This was due both to the constitutional crisis and to the rise of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|elections of 1929]] resulted in the last hung parliament for many years; in the meantime, Labour had replaced the Liberals as one of the two dominating parties.

Since the elections of 1929, there have been three general elections that resulted in hung parliaments in the UK.  The first was the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|election in February 1974]], and the ensuing parliament lasted only until [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October]]. The second was the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|May 2010 election]], the result of which was a hung parliament with the Conservative party as the largest single party. The results for the 3 main parties were: Conservatives 306, Labour 258, Liberal Democrats 57.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicsraw.com/2010/05/07/uk-election-results-in-hung-parliament "General election 2010 results of a hung parliament"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510024408/http://politicsraw.com/2010/05/07/uk-election-results-in-hung-parliament/ |date=10 May 2010 }}, PoliticsRAW. May 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The third one resulted from the [[snap election]] held in [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|June 2017]] that had been called for by [[Theresa May]] in order to strengthen her majority heading into [[Brexit negotiations]] later in 2017. However, this election backfired on May and her [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], resulting in a hung parliament after the snap election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/live/election-2017-40171454|title=Election results 2017: UK wakes up to hung Parliament|date=2017-06-09|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the coalition resulting from the 2010 election led to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], which instituted fixed five-year Parliaments and transferred the power to call [[snap election|early election]]s from the Prime Minister to Parliament itself. This was the idea of the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]], then the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who said that this would stop the Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party, [[David Cameron]], from calling a snap election to end the hung parliament, as many other Conservatives had requested.

Hung parliaments can also arise when slim government majorities are eroded by [[by-election]] defeats and [[crossing the floor|defection]] of [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] to opposition parties, as well as resignations of MPs from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. This happened in December 1996 to the Conservative government of [[John Major]] (1990–97) and in mid-1978 to the Labour government of [[James Callaghan]] (1976–79); this latter period covers the era known as the [[Winter of Discontent]]. The minority government of Jim Callaghan came when Labour ended their 15-month [[Lib-Lab pact]] with the Liberals having lost their majority in early 1977.

According to researchers Andrew Blick and Stuart Wilks-Heeg, the phrase "hung parliament" did not enter into common usage in the UK until the mid-1970s. It was first used in the press by journalist [[Simon Hoggart]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democraticaudit.org/download/Hung_Parliament_final.pdf |title=Governing without majorities: Coming to terms with balanced Parliaments in UK politics |first=Andrew |last=Blick |author2=Stuart Wilks-Heeg |date=April 2010 |publisher=Democratic Audit |location=Liverpool |page=2 |accessdate=20 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713091025/http://www.democraticaudit.org/download/Hung_Parliament_final.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic treatments of hung parliaments include [[David Butler (academic)|David Butler]]'s ''Governing Without a Majority: Dilemmas for Hung Parliaments in Britain'' (Sheridan House, 1986) and [[Vernon Bogdanor]]'s 'Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution' (Cambridge University Press, 1983).

===Canada===
{{Further|Federal minority governments in Canada}}

Three recent Canadian Parliaments ([[38th Canadian Parliament|the 38th]], [[39th Canadian Parliament|the 39th]], and [[40th Canadian Parliament|the 40th]] Parliaments) were hung parliaments, although that term is not used in Canada.  Rather, the term "minority government" is used to describe the situation in which the party with the greatest number of seats in the House of Commons (but less than a majority) forms the Government.  The aftermath of all three of these elections was that the largest party ruled as a "[[minority government]]". Although minority governments have tended to be short-lived, the two successive minorities under Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] managed to hold on to power from February 2006 until a [[no confidence vote]] in March 2011 resulted in the dissolution of Parliament and elections held on [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2 May 2011]]. The subsequent election saw a majority parliament elected with Harper's [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] obtaining a 24-seat majority. The make-up of the 40th Canadian Parliament hung parliament resulted in the [[2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute]]. The Conservative Party had a plurality of seats, however, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] together held enough seats to have a larger plurality and reached an accord to form a minority [[coalition government]]. The [[Bloc Québécois]] agreed to provide support on confidence votes. On 4 December 2008, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] granted [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] a [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogation]] on the condition that parliament reconvene early in the new year; the date was set as 26 January 2009. The first session of the 40th parliament thus ended, delaying a vote of no-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html|title=GG agrees to suspend Parliament: Harper| publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=2008-12-04|accessdate=2008-12-04| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205134535/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html| archivedate=5 December 2008| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Australian House of Reps Sept 2010.svg||thumb|right|230px|The House of Representatives elected in 2010, with a 72-72 tie between the Labor Party and the Opposition Coalition.]]
Australian parliaments are modelled on the [[Westminster system]], with a hung parliament typically defined as a lack of a lower house parliamentary majority from either the [[Australian Labor Party]] or [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]].

Hung parliaments are rare at the federal level in Australia, as a virtual [[two-party system]], in which the [[Australian Labor Party]] competes against an alliance of the [[conservatism|conservative]] parties, has existed with only brief interruptions since the early 20th century. Prior to 1910, no party had a majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. As a result, there were frequent changes of government, several of which took place during parliamentary terms. Since 1910, when the two-party system was cemented, there have been two hung parliaments, the first in 1940, and the second in 2010. At the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]], incumbent Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] secured the support of the two [[crossbencher]]s and continued to govern, but in 1941 the independents switched their support to Labor, bringing [[John Curtin]] to power.

Declining support for the major parties in recent times is leading to more non-majoritarian outcomes at elections.&lt;ref name="pgia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Parliamentary Government in Australia |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |year=2014 |publisher=Anthem Press |isbn=178308121X |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=FmvUAgAAQBAJ |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], which resulted in an exact 72-72 seat tie between Labor and The Liberal-National Coalition, incumbent Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] secured the support of four out of six Independent and Green Party crossbenchers and continued to govern.

In [[Australian federal election, 2016|the most recent election]] a hung parliament was only narrowly averted with the Liberal-National Coalition winning 76 seats, the bare minimum required to form a majority government. The Liberal-National Coalition government lost its majority government status after a [[Wentworth by-election, 2018|by-election in 2018]].

Having hung Parliaments in both Australia and the United Kingdom at the same time, and also briefly including Canada as well, is unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth of Nations. 

Hung parliaments are rather more common at a state level. The [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] and the [[unicameral]] [[Parliament of the Australian Capital Territory]] are both elected by [[Hare-Clark]] proportional representation, thus, elections commonly return hung parliaments. In other states and territories, candidates contest single-member seats. With far fewer seats than federal parliament, hung parliaments are more likely to be elected. Recent examples include [[New South Wales state election, 1991|New South Wales in 1991]], Queensland in [[Queensland state election, 1998|1998]] and [[Queensland state election, 2015|2015]], [[Victorian state election, 1999|Victoria in 1999]], [[South Australian state election, 1997|South Australia in 1997]] and [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002]], [[Western Australian state election, 2008|Western Australia in 2008]], the [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2008|Australian Capital Territory in 2008]], and [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|Tasmania in 2010]].

===New Zealand===
Hung parliaments had a relatively uncommon place in New Zealand politics prior to the introduction of proportional representation in 1993. Only on five occasions since the beginnings of modern party politics in [[New Zealand general election, 1890|1890]] has a hung parliament occurred, in [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911]], [[New Zealand general election, 1922|1922]], [[New Zealand general election, 1928|1928]], [[New Zealand general election, 1931|1931]] &amp; [[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993]] respectively. The rarity between 1936 and 1996 was due to the regression into a two party system, alternating between the long dominating [[New Zealand Labour Party]] and [[New Zealand National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Bassett |first=Michael |title=Three Party Politics in New Zealand 1911–1931 |authorlink=Michael Bassett |year=1982 |publisher=Historical Publications |location= Auckland |isbn= 0-86870-006-1 |pages= 64–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] election in [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996]] no single party has gained an outright majority in parliament. Subsequent governments have all been formed as either coalitions or under confidence and supply agreements. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Consequences==
In countries used to decisive election outcomes, a hung parliament is often viewed as an unfavourable outcome, leading to relatively weak and unstable government. A period of uncertainty after the election is common, as major party leaders negotiate with independents and minor parties to establish a working majority.

An aspiring [[head of government]] may seek to build a [[coalition government]]; in [[Westminster system]]s, this typically involves agreement on a joint legislative programme and a number of [[minister (government)|ministerial]] posts going to the minor coalition partners, in return for a stable majority. Alternatively, a minority government may be formed, establishing [[confidence and supply]] agreements in return for policy concessions agreed in advance, or relying on case by case support.

===Australia===
In the [[Western Australian state election, 2008|Western Australian state election of 2008]] the [[Australian Labor Party]] won more seats than the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]] at 28 to 24. The [[National Party of Australia (WA)|National Party]] along with three independents had the seats needed to give either party a majority. To help the Liberal Party form government, the Nationals supported the party on the condition that the [[Royalties for Regions policy]] was implemented.

In the [[Victorian state election, 1999|1999 Victorian state election]], the Labor Party won 42 seats, while the incumbent Liberal National Coalition retained 43, with 3 seats falling to independents. The Labor Party formed a minority government with the 3 independents.

The [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|2010 Tasmanian state election]] resulted in a hung parliament.  After a period of negotiation, the incumbent Labor government led by [[David Bartlett]] was recommissioned, but containing the Leader of the Tasmanian Greens, [[Nick McKim]], as a minister, and the Greens' [[Cassy O'Connor]] as Cabinet Secretary.

In the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], neither Labor nor the Liberal coalition secured the majority of seats required to form a Government in their own right. In order to counter the potential instability of minority government involved groups may negotiate written agreements defining their terms of support.  Such measures were undertaken by the Gillard Government in 2010.&lt;ref name="gpia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Government Politics in Australia |last=Fenna |first=Alan |author2=Jane Robbins |author3=John Summers |year=2013 |publisher=Pearson Higher Education AU |isbn=1486001386 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tDDiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In [[India]] if an election results in a 'hung assembly' in one of the state [[Vidhan Sabha|Legislative Assemblies]] and no party is capable of gaining confidence then fresh elections are announced to be held as soon as possible. Until this occurs [[President's Rule]] (or in the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] 'Governor's Rule') is applied. In [[India]] there have been many situations of hung assemblies in the state legislatures.

===New Zealand===
The first such occasion was in [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911]] when the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] won fewer seats than the opposition [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]] despite tallying the most votes. A vote of no confidence was placed by Reform and the Liberals survived by just one vote. This prompted Prime Minister Sir [[Joseph Ward]] to resign, his replacement [[Thomas Mackenzie]] was later defeated in July 1912 in a vote with several MPs and Labour crossing the floor to vote with the opposition, the last time in New Zealand history a government has changed on a confidence vote. This broke 23 years of Liberal governance and [[William Massey]] formed a new Reform Party government. Massey governed through to his death in 1925, though in [[New Zealand general election, 1922|1922]] the Reform Party suffered major losses and Massey was forced negotiate with several Independent MPs to retain power.

In [[New Zealand general election, 1928|1928]], Reform were ousted from governance and Joseph Ward once again won back power. However, the Reform and United (Liberal) parties were tied on seats with Labour holding the balance of power. Labour chose to back Ward rather than let Reform leader [[Gordon Coates]] remain in office. In the next election in [[New Zealand general election, 1931|1931]], there was again a three-way deadlock. On this occasion the Reform and United parties became a coalition government out of mutual fear of Labour's ever-increasing appeal as the [[Great Depression]] worsened.

[[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993]] was the last time a hung parliament occurred in New Zealand. Governor-General Dame [[Catherine Tizard]] asked Sir [[David Beattie]] to form a committee, along with three retired appeal court judges, to decide whom to appoint as Prime Minister. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Governors: New Zealand's Governors and Governors-General|first=Gavin|last=McLean|publisher=Otago University Press|isbn=1-877372-25-0|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However National won an extra seat after special votes were counted, giving National 50 seats and Labour 45 seats (4 were won by third party candidates). Labour's Sir [[Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)|Peter Tapsell]] agreed to become [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives]]. As a result, National did not lose a vote in the house and maintained a dubious majority for three years.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 General Election]], no party gained an overall parliamentary majority. Labour won the most seats (301, which was 17 seats short of an overall majority) with the Conservatives on 297 seats, although the Conservatives had a larger share of the popular vote. As the incumbent [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Edward Heath]] remained in office, attempting to build a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]. When these negotiations were unsuccessful Heath resigned and Labour led by [[Harold Wilson]] took over in a minority government.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK General Election]], another hung parliament occurred with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] as the largest party, and discussions followed to help create a stable government. This resulted in agreement on a coalition government, which was also a [[majority government]], between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which won the most votes and seats in the election, and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK General Election]], a hung parliament occurred for the second time in seven years with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] again being the largest party. The Conservatives led by [[Theresa May]] formed a minority government, supported by a [[Conservative–DUP agreement|confidence-and-supply agreement]] with the [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Democratic Unionist Party]].

==Working majority==
There have been occasions when, although a parliament or assembly is technically hung, the party in power has a [[working majority]]. For example, in the United Kingdom, the tradition is that the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] and Deputy Speakers do not vote and [[Sinn Féin]] MPs never take their seats, so these members can be discounted from the opposition numbers.

===United Kingdom===
In 2005, this was the case in the 60-seat [[National Assembly for Wales]], where Labour lost their majority when [[Peter Law]] was expelled for standing against the official candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 Westminster election]] in the [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent constituency]]. When the Assembly was [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2003|first elected]] on 1 May 2003, [[Welsh Labour|Labour]] won 30 seats, [[Plaid Cymru]] won 12, the [[Welsh Conservative Party|Conservatives]] won 11, [[Welsh Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] won 6, and the [[John Marek Independent Party]] won a seat.

When [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]] (Plaid Cymru) was reelected as the presiding officer, this reduced the number of opposition AMs who could vote to 29, as the presiding officer votes only in the event of a tie and, even then, not on party political lines but according to [[Speaker Denison's rule]]. Thus, Labour had a working majority of one seat until Law ran in Blaenau Gwent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200504/1c6a58e1-0c76-46b6-8b0d-f3fd085839fc.htm Labour lose assembly majority as Law quits], ePolitix.com.

This is a list of political topics, including political science terms, political philosophies, political issues, etc.

'''[[Politics]]''' is the process by which groups of people make decisions. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within civil [[government]]s, politics is observed in all human group interactions, including [[corporation|corporate]], [[academia|academic]], and [[religion|religious]] institutions. Politics consists of "social relations involving authority or power"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.die.net/politics/ Definition of politics from die.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the regulation of a political unit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=303454 Politics (definition)@Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply [[policy]].&lt;ref name="freedict"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/politics Definition of politics from "The Free Dictionary"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Political science]]''' (also known as political studies) is the study of political behavior and examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]]. Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behavior, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.

'''Individualist anarchism''' refers to several traditions of thought within the [[anarchist]] movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems.&lt;ref name="ryner"&gt;"What do I mean by individualism? I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience". [http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism''] by Han Ryner {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927072655/http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm|date=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself. "Anarchism and the State" in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy, but it refers to a group of [[Individualism|individualistic]] philosophies that sometimes are in conflict. [[Benjamin Tucker]], a famous 19th century individualist anarchist, held that "if the individual has the right to govern himself, all external government is tyranny".&lt;ref name="Tucker state"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Benjamin R.

Among the early influences on individualist anarchism were [[William Godwin]],&lt;ref name=godwinsep&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=godwin |title=William Godwin |last=Philip  |first=Mark|date=2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josiah Warren]] ("[[sovereignty of the individual]]"), [[Max Stirner]] ([[Egoist anarchism|egoism]]),&lt;ref name=stirnersep&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=max-stirner |title=Max Stirner |last=Leopold |first=David|date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysander Spooner]] ("[[natural law]]"), [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] ([[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]), [[Henry David Thoreau]] ([[transcendentalism]]),&lt;ref name="thoreau"&gt;"Paralelamente, al otro lado del atlántico, en el diferente contexto de una nación a medio hacer, los Estados Unidos, otros filósofos elaboraron un pensamiento individualista similar, aunque con sus propias especificidades. Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923–1938)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Spencer]] ("[[law of equal liberty]]")&lt;ref name="Freeden, Michael pp. 313–314"&gt;Freeden, Michael. Ideologies and Political Theory: A Conceptual Approach. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-829414-X}}. pp. 313–314&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anselme Bellegarrigue]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]], ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Individualist anarchism of different kinds have a few things in common. These are the following:

1. The concentration on the [[individual]] and their will in preference to any construction such as [[morality]], [[ideology]], social custom, [[religion]], metaphysics, [[Invention|ideas]] or the will of others.&lt;ref name="individualism"&gt;"En la vida de todo único, todo vínculo, independientemente de la forma en que éste se presente, supone una cadena que condiciona, y por tanto elimina la condición de persona libre. Ello supone dos consecuencias; la libertad se mantendrá al margen de toda categoría moral. Este último concepto quedará al margen del vocabulario estirneriano, puesto que tanto ética como moral serán dos conceptos absolutos que, como tales, no pueden situarse por encima de la voluntad individual. La libertad se vive siempre al margen de cualquier condicionamiento material o espiritual, "más allá del bien y del mal" como enunciará Nietzsche en una de sus principales obras. Las creencias colectivas, los prejuicios compartidos, los convencionalismos sociales serán, pues, objeto de destrucción."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923–1938)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="individualism2"&gt;"Stirner himself, however, has no truck with "higher beings." Indeed, with the aim of concerning himself purely with his own interests, he attacks all "higher beings," regarding them as a variety of what he calls "spooks," or ideas to which individuals sacrifice themselves and by which they are dominated. First amongst these is the abstraction "Man", into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, "liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God... it sets me beneath Man." Indeed, he "who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook." [p. 176 and p. 79] Among the many "spooks" Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself. We will discuss Stirner's critique of capitalism before moving onto his vision of an egoist society and how it relates to social anarchism. [http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 "G.6 What are the ideas of Max Stirner"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123154932/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 |date=November 23, 2010 }} in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt;

2. The rejection of or reservations about the idea of [[revolution]], seeing it as a time of mass uprising which could bring about new hierarchies. Instead, they favor more [[evolutionary]] methods of bringing about anarchy through alternative experiences and experiments and education which could be brought about [[immediatism|today]].&lt;ref name="evolutionary"&gt;"The first is in regard to the means of action in the here and now (and so the manner in which anarchy will come about). Individualists generally prefer education and the creation of alternative institutions, such as mutual banks, unions, communes, etc. Such activity, they argue, will ensure that present society will gradually develop out of government into an anarchist one. They are primarily evolutionists, not revolutionists, and dislike social anarchists' use of direct action to create revolutionary situations."[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionA3#seca31 "A.3.1 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123103313/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionA3 |date=2010-11-23 }} in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evolution2"&gt;"Toda revolución, pues, hecha en nombre de principios abstractos como igualdad, fraternidad, libertad o humanidad, persigue el mismo fin; anular la voluntad y soberanía del individuo, para así poderlo dominar."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923–1938)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also because it is not seen as desirable for individuals to wait for revolution to start experiencing alternative experiences outside what is offered in the current social system.&lt;ref name="illegalists"&gt;"The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s&amp;nbsp;... and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War&amp;nbsp;... were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital. The illegalist comrades were tired of waiting for the revolution. The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("propaganda by the deed") and the anarchist burglars ("individual reappropriation") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary, invitations to revolt."[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm THE "ILLEGALISTS" by Doug Imrie] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908072801/http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm |date=September 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. The view that relationships with other persons or things can be in one's own interest only and can be as transitory and without compromises as desired since in individualist anarchism sacrifice is usually rejected. In this way, Max Stirner recommended [[Union of egoists|associations of egoists]].&lt;ref name="association"&gt;Finalmente, y este es un tema poco resuelto por el filósofo bávaro, resulta evidente que, a pesar de todo culto a la soberanía individual, es necesario y deseable que los individuos cooperen. Pero el peligro de la asociación conlleva la reproducción, an escala diferente, de una sociedad, y es evidente que en este contexto, los individuos deban renunciar a buena parte de su soberanía. Stirner propone "uniones de egoístas", formadas por individuos libres que pueden unirse episódicamente para colaborar, pero evitando la estabilidad o la permanencia."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923–1938)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="association2"&gt;"The unions Stirner desires would be based on free agreement, being spontaneous and voluntary associations drawn together out of the mutual interests of those involved, who would "care best for their welfare if they unite with others." [p.&amp;nbsp;309] The unions, unlike the state, exist to ensure what Stirner calls "intercourse," or "union" between individuals. To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples. [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;25] These illustrate the kinds of relationships that maximise an individual's self-enjoyment, pleasure, freedom, and individuality, as well as ensuring that those involved sacrifice nothing while belonging to them. Such associations are based on mutuality and a free and spontaneous co-operation between equals. As Stirner puts it, "intercourse is mutuality, it is the action, the commercium, of individuals." [p.&amp;nbsp;218] Its aim is "pleasure" and "self-enjoyment." Thus Stirner sought a broad egoism, one which appreciated others and their uniqueness, and so criticised the narrow egoism of people who forgot the wealth others are:
:"But that would be a man who does not know and cannot appreciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others, from the consideration shown to others. That would be a man bereft of innumerable pleasures, a wretched character&amp;nbsp;... would he not be a wretched egoist, rather than a genuine Egoist?&amp;nbsp;... The person who loves a human being is, by virtue of that love, a wealthier man that someone else who loves no one." [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p. 23]"[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secG6.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:43:10 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists?]&lt;/ref&gt; Individual experience and exploration therefore is emphasized.

The [[Egoist anarchism|egoist form of individualist anarchism]], derived from the [[philosophy of Max Stirner]], supports the individual doing exactly what he pleases—taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller |first=David |title=The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought |year=1987 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |page=11|isbn=0631227814}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Stirner, rights were ''[[Reification (fallacy)|spooks]]'' in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality"—he supported property by force of might rather than moral right.&lt;ref&gt;"What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as ''I'' entitle, that is, empower myself to take…" From ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', quoted in {{cite book|last=Ossar |first=Michael |year=1980 |title=Anarchism in the Dramas of Ernst Toller |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |page=27|isbn=0873953932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw "associations of egoists" drawn together by respect for each other's ruthlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=George Woodcock|last=Woodcock |first=George |year=2004 |title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements |publisher=Broadview Press |page=20|isbn=0140206221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, [[American individualist anarchism]] "stresses the isolation of the individual  –  his right to his own tools, his mind, his body, and to the products of his labor. To the artist who embraces this philosophy it is "[[aesthetic]]" anarchism, to the reformer, ethical anarchism, to the independent mechanic, economic anarchism. The former is concerned with philosophy, the latter with practical demonstration. The economic anarchist is concerned with constructing a society on the basis of anarchism. Economically he sees no harm whatever in the private possession of what the individual produces by his own labor, but only so much and no more. The aesthetic and ethical type found expression in the [[transcendentalism]], [[humanitarianism]], and [[romanticism]] of the first part of the nineteenth century, the economic type in the pioneer life of the West during the same period, but more favorably after the Civil War".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html ''NATIVE AMERICAN ANARCHISM A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism'' by Eunice Minette Schuster] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213201445/http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html |date=February 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that it has been suggested that in order to understand American individualist anarchism one must take into account "the social context of their ideas, namely the transformation of America from a pre-capitalist to a capitalist society [...] the non-capitalist nature of the early U.S. can be seen from the early dominance of self-employment (artisan and peasant production). At the beginning of the 19th century, around 80% of the working (non-slave) male population were self-employed. The great majority of Americans during this time were farmers working their own land, primarily for their own needs" and so "[i]ndividualist anarchism is clearly a form of [[artisan]]al [[socialism]] [...] while [[communist anarchism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]] are forms of industrial (or proletarian) socialism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionG1#secg14 "G.1.4 Why is the social context important in evaluating Individualist Anarchism?"] in ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary individualist anarchist [[Kevin Carson]] characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that "[u]nlike the rest of the [[socialist]] movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a [[classical liberal]] movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business".&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Carson.

In [[European individualist anarchism]], a different social context helped the rise of European individualist [[illegalism]] and as such "[t]he illegalists were proletarians who had nothing to sell but their labour power, and nothing to discard but their dignity; if they disdained waged-work, it was because of its compulsive nature. If they turned to illegality it was due to the fact that honest toil only benefited the employers and often entailed a complete loss of dignity, while any complaints resulted in the sack; to avoid starvation through lack of work it was necessary to beg or steal, and to avoid conscription into the army many of them had to go on the run".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;[https://archive.org/download/bonnot_gang/bonnotgangfull.pdf Richard Parry.

At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant." Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Bookchin reports that at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th "it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity – and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/socanlifean2 Murray Bookchin]. ''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important tendency within individualist anarchist currents emphasizes individual subjective exploration and defiance of social conventions. Individualist anarchist philosophy attracted "amongst artists, intellectuals and the well-read, urban middle classes in general".&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; As such, [[Murray Bookchin]] describes a lot of individualist anarchism as people who "expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siecle New York, Paris and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('free love') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing".&lt;ref name="bohemian individualism"&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/socanlifean2 "2. Individualist Anarchism and Reaction" in Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism – An Unbridgeable Chasm]&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, [[free love]]&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt; currents and other radical lifestyles such as [[naturism]]&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="naturismo"/&gt; had popularity among individualist anarchists.

For Catalan historian [[Xavier Diez]], individualist anarchism "under its [[iconoclastic]], antiintelectual, [[antitheist]] run, which goes against all sacralized ideas or values it entailed, a philosophy of life which could be considered a reaction against the sacred gods of capitalist society. Against the idea of [[Nationalism|nation]], it opposed its [[Anationalism|internationalism]]. Against the exaltation of authority embodied in the [[military]] institution, it opposed its [[antimilitarism]]. Against the concept of [[industrial civilization]], it opposed its [[naturist]] vision".{{sfn|Díez|2007}}

In regards to economic questions, there are diverse positions. There are adherents to [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] (Proudhon, [[Émile Armand]] and early [[Benjamin Tucker]]), [[Egoist anarchism|egoistic]] disrespect for "ghosts" such as private property and markets (Stirner, [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Lev Chernyi]] and later Tucker) and adherents to [[anarcho-communism]] ([[Albert Libertad]], [[illegalism]] and [[Renzo Novatore]]).&lt;ref&gt;"revolution is the fire of our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the libertarian aristocracy. To create new ethical values. To create new aesthetic values. To communalize material wealth. To individualize spiritual wealth."

''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issue of violence opinions have gone from a violentist point of view mainly exemplified by [[illegalism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]] to one that can be called [[anarcho-pacifist]]. In the particular case of Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]], he went from illegalist practice in his youth&lt;ref&gt;"Selon l'historien Vladimir Muñoz, son véritable nom aurait été Miguel Ramos Giménez et il aurait participé au début du 20è siècle aux groupes illégalistes."[http://militants-anarchistes.info/spip.php?article2199&amp;lang=fr "GIMÉNEZ IGUALADA, Miguel" at Diccionaire International des Militants Anarchistes]&lt;/ref&gt; towards a pacifist position later in his life.&lt;ref&gt;Igualada argued for an anarchism that was "pacifist, poetic, which creates goodness, harmony and beauty, which cultivates a healthy sense of living in peace, sign of power and fertility&amp;nbsp;... from there anyone which is un-harmonious (violent-warrior), everyone that will pretend, in any form, to dominate anyone of his similars, is not an anarchist, since the anarchist respects in such a way personal integrity, so that he could not make anyone a slave of his thoughts so as to turn him into an instrument of his, a man-tool."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== William Godwin ===
{{main|William Godwin}}
[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Godwin]], a radical [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[utilitarian]], was one of the first to espouse what became known as individualist anarchism]]
[[William Godwin]] can be considered an individualist anarchist&lt;ref name=woodcock20&gt;Woodcock, George. 2004. ''Anarchism: A History Of Libertarian Ideas And Movements''. Broadview Press. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and [[philosophical anarchist]] who was influenced by the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;"Anarchism", ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version)&lt;/ref&gt; and developed what many consider the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt; According to [[Peter Kropotkin]], Godwin "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work".&lt;ref name="EB1910"&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html "Anarchism"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. "Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence…" – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated.&lt;ref name=godwineb&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9037183 Godwin, William]". (2006). In Britannica Concise Encyclopaedia. Retrieved December 7, 2006, from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value, with some of us "of more worth and importance" than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Therefore, he does not believe in equal rights, but the person's life that should be favored that is most conducive to the general good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul |last=McLaughlin |title=Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, |year=2007 |page=119|isbn=0754661962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin opposed government because it infringes on the individual's right to "private judgement" to determine which actions most maximize utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual's judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, minus the utilitarianism, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul |last=McLaughlin |title=Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, |year=2007 |page=123|isbn=0754661962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin took individualism to the radical extent of opposing individuals performing together in orchestras, writing in ''[[Political Justice]]'' that "everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil".&lt;ref name=godwineb/&gt; The only apparent exception to this opposition to cooperation is the spontaneous association that may arise when a society is threatened by violent force. One reason he opposed cooperation is he believed it to interfere with an individual's ability to be benevolent for the greater good. Godwin opposes the idea of government, but wrote that a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present "necessary evil"&lt;ref name=pj&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J. Robinson |oclc=2340417 |origyear=1793}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt; He expressly opposed [[democracy]], fearing oppression of the individual by the majority, though he believed it to be preferable to [[dictatorship]].

[[File:PoliticalJustice3.png|thumb|Title page from the third edition of ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin]]
Godwin supported individual ownership of property, defining it as "the empire to which every man is entitled over the produce of his own industry".&lt;ref name=pj/&gt; However, he also advocated that individuals give to each other their surplus property on the occasion that others have a need for it, without involving trade (e.g. [[gift economy]]). Thus while people have the right to private property, they should give it away as enlightened [[altruists]]. This was to be based on [[utilitarian]] principles and he said: "Every man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated".&lt;ref name=pj/&gt; However, benevolence was not to be enforced, being a matter of free individual "private judgement". He did not advocate a [[common ownership|community of goods]] or assert collective ownership as is embraced in [[communism]], but his belief that individuals ought to share with those in need was influential on the later development of [[anarcho-communism]].

Godwin's political views were diverse and do not perfectly agree with any of the ideologies that claim his influence as writers of the ''[[Socialist Standard]]'', organ of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]], consider Godwin both an individualist and a communist;&lt;ref name="Godwin"&gt;"William Godwin, Shelly and Communism" by ALB, The Socialist Standard&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Rothbard]] did not regard Godwin as being in the individualist camp at all, referring to him as the "founder of [[communist anarchism]]";&lt;ref name="rothbard/burke"&gt;Rothbard, Murray. "[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard11.html Edmund Burke, Anarchist]."&lt;/ref&gt; and historian [[Albert Weisbord]] considers him an individualist anarchist without reservation.&lt;ref name="conquest8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisbord|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Weisbord|title=The Conquest of Power|accessdate=2008-08-05|year=1937|publisher=Covici-Friede|location=[[New York City|New York]]|oclc=1019295|chapter=Libertarianism|chapterurl=http://www.weisbord.org/conquest8.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers see a conflict between Godwin's advocacy of "private judgement" and utilitarianism as he says that ethics requires that individuals give their surplus property to each other resulting in an egalitarian society, but at the same time he insists that all things be left to individual choice.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt; As noted by Kropotkin, many of Godwin's views changed over time.

[[William Godwin]]'s influenced "the socialism of [[Robert Owen]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at New Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was [[Josiah Warren]] (1798–1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist. After New Harmony failed Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen's socialism had been predicated on Godwin's anarchism)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Peter_Sabatini__Libertarianism__Bogus_Anarchy.html Peter Sabatini.

[[File:Pierre Joseph Proudhon.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the first self-identified anarchist]]

''Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age''. [[Manchester University Press]]. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, Rob. "Political Economy from below : Communitarian Anarchism as a Neglected Discourse in Histories of Economic Thought". ''History of Economics Review'', No.31 Winter 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators do not identify Proudhon as an individualist anarchist due to his preference for association in large industries, rather than individual control.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'', Broadview Press, 2004, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he was influential among some of the American individualists—in the 1840s and 1850s, [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]]&lt;ref&gt;Dana, Charles A. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/dana.html Proudhon and his "Bank of the People"] (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William B. Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin R., "On Picket Duty", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881–1908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former "possession" and the latter "property". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.

Proudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce and that [[monopoly|monopolies]] on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market, but without profit, which he called [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by [[Joseph Dejacque]] in the inception of anarcho-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature". An individualist rather than anarcho-communist,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Americana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1995 79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faguet 1970 147"/&gt; Proudhon said that "communism [...] is the very denial of society in its foundation"&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''The Philosophy of Misery: The Evolution of Capitalism''. BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). {{ISBN|1-4264-0908-7}} p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; and famously declared that "[[property is theft]]!" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.

After Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists (who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon) and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.

==== Mutualism ====
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] which holds that when labour or its product is sold, in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility".&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert.&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10 &amp; 22.&lt;br /&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Meek &amp; Oppenheimer).&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments and rent as they believe these individuals are not labouring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital.&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraph 19.&lt;br /&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb &amp; Oppenheimer).&lt;/ref&gt; Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed: "I never meant to [...] forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all".&lt;ref&gt;''Solution of the Social Problem'', 1848–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Proudhonpropietat.JPG|thumb|left|200px|''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840) by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]
Insofar as they ensure the workers right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support [[Market (economics)|markets]] and [[private property]] in the product of labor. However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called "possession").&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. [http://www.panarchy.org/swartz/mutualism.6.html What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent]&lt;/ref&gt;  Proudhon's Mutualism supports [[Worker cooperative|labor-owned cooperative firms]] and associations&lt;ref&gt;Hymans, E., ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', pp. 190–91,&lt;br&gt;Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'', Broadview Press, 2004, pp. 110, 112&lt;/ref&gt; for "we need not hesitate, for we have no choice [...] it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers [...] because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two [...] castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society" and so "it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism".&lt;ref&gt;''General Idea of the Revolution'', Pluto Press, pp. 215–16, 277&lt;/ref&gt; As for capital goods (man-made, non-land, "[[means of production]]"), mutualist opinion differs on whether these should be commonly managed public assets or private property.

Following Proudhon, mutualists originally considered themselves to be libertarian socialists. However, "some mutualists have abandoned the labor theory of value, and prefer to avoid the term "socialist." But they still retain some cultural attitudes, for the most part, that set them off from the [[libertarian right]]".&lt;ref name="mutualist.org"&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/id32.html A Mutualist FAQ: A.4. Are Mutualists Socialists?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609075437/http://www.mutualist.org/id32.html|date=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists have distinguished themselves from [[state socialism]] and do not advocate social control over the means of production. Benjamin Tucker said of Proudhon that "though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, Proudhon aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few [...] by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost".&lt;ref name="Tucker state"/&gt;

=== Max Stirner ===
{{main|Max Stirner}}
[[File:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Max Stirner]] by [[Friedrich Engels]]]]
Johann Kaspar Schmidt (October 25, 1806 – June 26, 1856), better known as Max Stirner (the ''[[nom de plume]]'' he adopted from a schoolyard nickname he had acquired as a child because of his high brow, in [[German language|German]] 'Stirn'), was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]], who ranks as one of the literary fathers of [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], [[post-modernism]] and [[anarchism]], especially of individualist anarchism. Stirner's main work is ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', also known as ''The Ego and His Own'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' in German, which translates literally as ''The Only One [individual] and his Property''). This work was first published in 1844 in [[Leipzig]] and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations.

==== Egoism ====
{{main|Egoist anarchism|Philosophy of Max Stirner}}
{{see also|Ethical egoism|Moral nihilism}}
[[Max Stirner]]'s philosophy, sometimes called egoism, is a form of individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=David Goodway|last=Goodway |first=David |title=[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow]] |publisher=Liverpool University Press |year=2006 |page=99|isbn=1846310261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner was a [[Young Hegelians|Hegelian]] philosopher whose "name appears with familiar regularity in historically oriented surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref name=stirnersep/&gt; In 1844, his ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (''Der Einzige and sein Eigentum'' which may literally be translated as ''The Unique Individual and His Property'')&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; was published, which is considered to be "a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref name=stirnersep/&gt; Stirner does not recommend that the individual try to eliminate the state, but simply that they disregard the state when it conflicts with one's autonomous choices and go along with it when doing so is conducive to one's interests.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; He says that the egoist rejects pursuit of devotion to "a great idea, a good cause, a doctirine, a system, a lofty calling," saying that the egoist has no political calling, but rather "lives themselves out" without regard to "how well or ill humanity may fare thereby".&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas.

For Stirner, property simply comes about through might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property". He further says: "What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing" and that "I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!".&lt;ref&gt;Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; His concept of "egoistic property" not only a lack of moral restraint on how one obtains and uses ''things'', but includes other people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; His embrace of [[Egotism|egoism]] is in stark contrast to Godwin's [[altruism]]. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual.

This position on property is much different from the Native American, natural law, form of individualist anarchism, which defends the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labor&lt;ref&gt;Weir, David. Anarchy &amp; Culture. [[University of Massachusetts Press]]. 1997. p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; and trade. However, Benjamin Tucker rejected the natural rights philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism in 1886, with several others joining with him. This split the American individualists into fierce debate, "with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself."&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy.

[[File:Ein1844v2.png|thumb|200px|''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844) by Max Stirner]]
In Russia, individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] attracted a small following of bohemian artists and intellectuals such as [[Lev Chernyi]], as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence.&lt;ref name=levy&gt;Levy, Carl.

Though Stirner's philosophy is individualist, it has influenced some libertarian communists and anarcho-communists. "For Ourselves Council for Generalized Self-Management" discusses Stirner and speaks of a "communist egoism", which is said to be a "synthesis of individualism and collectivism" and says that "greed in its fullest sense is the only possible basis of communist society".&lt;ref&gt;For Ourselves, {{cite web|url=http://home.teleport.com/~rasputin/RTBGreedy-v1_2_5-en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228054533/http://home.teleport.com/~rasputin/RTBGreedy-v1_2_5-en.htm |archivedate=2008-12-28 |df= }} ''The Right to Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything'', 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of libertarian communism such as [[Situationist International|Situationism]] are influenced by Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Christopher Gray, ''Leaving the Twentieth Century'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-communist [[Emma Goldman]] was influenced by both Stirner and [[Peter Kropotkin]] and blended their philosophies together in her own as shown in books of hers such as ''Anarchism And Other Essays''.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman, ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Henry David Thoreau ====
{{main|Henry David Thoreau}}
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Henry David Thoreau]]]]
[[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings; and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on [[green anarchism]], but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later [[Anarcho-naturism|naturist]] currents,&lt;ref name="thoreau"/&gt; [[simple living]] as a rejection of a [[Economic materialism|materialist]] lifestyle&lt;ref name=thoreau/&gt; and [[self-sufficiency]] were Thoreau's goals and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]], this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.&lt;ref name="naturismo"/&gt;

The essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] (''Resistance to Civil Government'') was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such [[acquiescence]] to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with [[slavery]] and the [[Mexican–American War]]. The essay later influenced [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Martin Buber]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] through its advocacy of [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence RESISTING THE NATION STATE the pacifist and anarchist tradition by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the main precedent for [[anarcho-pacifism]].&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; The American version of individualist anarchism has a strong emphasis on the [[non-aggression principle]] and [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="Madison"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Madison, Charles A. |year=1945 |title=Anarchism in the United States |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=46–66 |doi=10.2307/2707055 |jstor=2707055 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individualist anarchists such as Thoreau&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ellwood.

== Developments and expansion ==
=== Free love, anarcha-feminism and LGBT issues ===
{{main|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Anarcha-feminism|Queer anarchism}}
[[File:Lucifer, The Light-Bearer.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'', an influential American free love journal]]
An important current within individualist anarchism is free love.&lt;ref name="freelove"&gt;[http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy]&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, and viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's [[self-ownership]]. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws, such as those governing marriage and use of birth control, discriminated against women.&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907) edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]]&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, "Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism," in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–50.&lt;/ref&gt; but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|The Word]]'' (1872–1890, 1892–1893).&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt; [[M. E. Lazarus]] was also an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt; [[John William Lloyd]], a collaborator of [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s periodical ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', published in 1931 a sex manual that he called ''The Karezza Method: Or Magnetation, the Art of Connubial Love''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuniting.info/karezza_method_lloyd "The Karezza Method"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Émile Armand]].&lt;ref name="armandfreelove"&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf E. Armand and "la camaraderie amoureuse". Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy]&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name="armandfreelove"/&gt; In France, there was also feminist activity inside individualist anarchism as promoted by [[Individualist feminism|individualist feminists]] Marie Küge, [[Anna Mahé]], [[Rirette Maitrejean]] and Sophia Zaïkovska.&lt;ref&gt;[http://endehors.org/news/individualisme-anarchiste-et-feminisme-a-la-belle-epoque "Individualisme anarchiste et féminisme à la « Belle Epoque »"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706170427/http://endehors.org/news/individualisme-anarchiste-et-feminisme-a-la-belle-epoque |date=July 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brazil]]ian individualist anarchist [[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] lectured on topics such as education, [[women's rights]], [[free love]] and [[antimilitarism]]. Her writings and essays garnered her attention not only in Brazil, but also in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="nodo50.org"&gt;http://www.nodo50.org/insurgentes/textos/mulher/09marialacerda.htm "Maria Lacerda de Moura – Uma Anarquista Individualista Brasileira" by&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote for the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine ''Al Margen'' alongside [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]].&lt;ref&gt;"Entre los redactores y colaboradores de Al Margen, que trasladará su redacción a Elda, en Alicante, encontraremos a Miguel Giménez Igualada, al escritor Gonzalo Vidal, u otros habituales de la prensa individualista como Costa Iscar, Mariano Gallardo o la periodista brasileña Maria Lacerda de Moura."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|Stirnerists]] [[Adolf Brand]] and [[John Henry Mackay]] were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]].

=== Freethought ===
{{main|Freethought}}
Freethought as a philosophical position and as activism was important in both North American and European individualist anarchism, but in the United States freethought was basically an [[Anti-Christianity|anti-Christian]], [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and for a time ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''.&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]] [https://mises.org/library/culture-individualist-anarchism-late-19th-century-america "The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America"]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''. The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself.&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles: "Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, is another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church [...] Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the french individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics".{{sfn|Díez|2007|p=143}} This tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'', "there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain [[atheist]] and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin's theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul".{{sfn|Díez|2007|p=152}}

This relationship between anarchism and naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in Spain,&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"&gt;[http://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html "Anarchism – Nudism, Naturism" by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid.

The Naturist athenaeum, 'Ecléctico', in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First ''Etica'' and then ''[[Iniciales]]'', which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the [[Spanish Civil War]]. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to 'Iniciales' He writes it under the odd pseudonym of 'silvestre del campo', (wild man in the country). "I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society".&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"/&gt; The relation between anarchism and naturism "gives way to the Naturist Federation, in July 1928, and to the lV Spanish Naturist Congress, in September 1929, both supported by the Libertarian Movement. However, in the short term, the Naturist and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life. The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner (real name of [[Han Ryner]]) than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI, ([[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]])".&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"/&gt;

=== Individualist anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche ===
{{see also|Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche#Individualist anarchism}}
The thought of German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been influential in individualist anarchism, specifically in thinkers such as France's [[Émile Armand]],&lt;ref&gt;"The life of Émile Armand (1872–1963) spanned the history of anarchism. He was influenced by Leo Tolstoy and Benjamin Tucker, and to a lesser extent by Whitman and Emerson. Later in life, Nietzsche and Stirner became important to his way of thinking."[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emile_Armand__The_Anarchism_of_Emile_Armand.html Introduction to ''The Anarchism of Émile Armand'' by [[Émile Armand]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;ref name="novatore-toward"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.html ''Toward the Creative Nothing''] by [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Colombian [[Biofilo Panclasta]].

==== American mutualism and individualist utopianism ====

For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, "[i]t is apparent [...] that [[Proudhon]]ian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of [[Josiah Warren]] and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]] [...] [[William B. Greene]] presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"&gt;[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html ''Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism'' by Eunice Minette Schuster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213201445/http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html|date=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Batchelder Greene]] (1819–1878) is best known for the works ''Mutual Banking''(1850), which proposed an interest-free banking system; and ''Transcendentalism'', a critique of the [[Transcendentalism|New England philosophical school]]. He saw mutualism as the synthesis of "liberty and order".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; His "associationism [...] is checked by individualism [...] "Mind your own business," "Judge not that ye be not judged." Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as well as over that which he himself produces. For this reason he demands "mutuality" in marriage – the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; and feminist and spiritualist tendencies".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__The_Lemonade_Ocean___Modern_Times.html Hakim Bey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary American anarchist [[Hakim Bey]] reports that "[[Stephen Pearl Andrews|Steven Pearl Andrews]] [...] was not a fourierist (see [[Charles Fourier]]), but he lived through the brief craze for [[Phalanstère|phalansteries]] in America &amp; adopted a lot of fourierist principles &amp; practices [...] a maker of worlds out of words. He syncretized [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionism]], [[Free love|Free Love]], spiritual universalism, [[Josiah Warren|(Josiah) Warren]], &amp; [[Charles Fourier|(Charles) Fourier]] into a grand utopian scheme he called the Universal Pantarchy [...] He was instrumental in founding several "intentional communities," including the "Brownstone Utopia" on 14th St. in New York, &amp; "[[Modern Times (intentional community)|Modern Times]]" in Brentwood, Long Island. The latter became as famous as the best-known [[Fourierism|fourierist]] communes (Brook Farm in Massachusetts &amp; the North American Phalanx in New Jersey) – in fact, Modern Times became downright notorious (for "[[Free love|Free Love]]") &amp; finally foundered under a wave of scandalous publicity. Andrews (&amp; [[Victoria Woodhull]]) were members of the infamous Section 12 of the [[1st International]], expelled by [[Marx]] for its anarchist, feminist, &amp; spiritualist tendencies".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;

==== Boston anarchists ====
[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Lysander Spooner]]]]
Another form of individualist anarchism was found in the United States as advocated by the so-called Boston anarchists.&lt;ref name=levy/&gt; By default, American individualists had no difficulty accepting the concepts that "one man employ another" or that "he direct him", in his labor but rather demanded that "all natural opportunities requisite to the production of wealth be accessible to all on equal terms and that monopolies arising from special privileges created by law be abolished".&lt;ref&gt;Madison, Charles A. "Anarchism in the United States." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol 6, No 1, January 1945, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

They believed [[state monopoly capitalism]] (defined as a state-sponsored monopoly)&lt;ref name=schwartzman&gt;Schwartzman, Jack. "Ingalls, Hanson, and Tucker: Nineteenth-Century American Anarchists." ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology'', Vol. 62, No. 5 (November 2003). p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; prevented labor from being fully rewarded. [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] summed up the philosophy by saying that the anarchist individualists "are firm in the idea that the system of employer and employed, buying and selling, banking, and all the other essential institutions of Commercialism, centred upon private property, are in themselves good, and are rendered vicious merely by the interference of the State".&lt;ref&gt;de Cleyre, Voltairine. Anarchism. Originally published in ''Free Society'', 13 October 1901.

Even among the 19th-century American individualists, there was not a monolithic doctrine as they disagreed amongst each other on various issues including [[intellectual property]] rights and [[Possession (law)|possession]] versus [[property]] in land.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander.

Volume VII, No 3. {{ISSN|0047-4517}}. pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; A major schism occurred later in the 19th century when Tucker and some others abandoned their traditional support of [[natural right]]s as espoused by [[Lysander Spooner]] and converted to an "egoism" modeled upon [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|Max Stirner's philosophy]].&lt;ref name=watner/&gt; [[Lysander Spooner]] besides his individualist anarchist activism was also an important anti-slavery activist and became a member of the [[First International]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. Anarchism: a history of anarchist ideas and movements (1962). p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Boston anarchists, including Benjamin Tucker, identified themselves as [[socialist]]s, which in the 19th century was often used in the sense of a commitment to improving conditions of the working class (i.e. "[[the labor problem]]").&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Frank H. 1994. ''The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty'' (1881–1908). Transaction Publishers. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston anarchists such as Tucker and his followers continue to be considered socialists due to their opposition to usury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG1#secg14 "G.1.4 Why is the social context important in evaluating Individualist Anarchism?" in ''An Anarchist FAQ'']{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315000327/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG1#secg14 |date=March 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They do so because as the modern economist Jim Stanford points out there are many different kinds of competitive markets such as market socialism and capitalism is only one type of a market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, Jim. Economics for Everyone: A Short Guide to the Economics of Capitalism. Ann Arbor: MI., Pluto Press. 2008. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two individualist anarchists who wrote in [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were also important labor organizers of the time. [[Joseph Labadie]] (April 18, 1850 – October 7, 1933) was an American labor organizer, individualist anarchist, social activist, printer, publisher, essayist and poet. In 1883, Labadie embraced a non-violent version of individualist anarchism. Without the oppression of the state, Labadie believed, humans would choose to harmonize with "the great natural laws [...] without robbing [their] fellows through interest, profit, rent and taxes". However, he supported community cooperation as he supported community control of water utilities, streets and railroads.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, James J. (1970).

Colorado Springs: Ralph Myles Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not support the militant anarchism of the [[Haymarket Riot|Haymarket anarchists]], he fought for the clemency of the accused because he did not believe they were the perpetrators. In 1888, Labadie organized the Michigan Federation of Labor, became its first president and forged an alliance with [[Samuel Gompers]]. A colleague of Labadie's at ''Liberty'', [[Dyer Lum]] was another important individualist anarchist [[labor activism|labor activist]] and poet of the era.&lt;ref name="shuster"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schuster |first=Eunice |title=Native American Anarchism |publisher=Breakout Productions |location=City |year=1999 |isbn=9781893626218 |page=168 (footnote 22) }}&lt;/ref&gt; A leading [[anarcho-syndicalist]] and a prominent [[left-wing]] [[intellectual]] of the 1880s,&lt;ref name="johnpoll"&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnpoll |first=Bernard |author2=Harvey Klehr |title=Biographical Dictionary of the American Left |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=1986 |isbn=9780313242007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he is remembered as the lover and mentor of early [[anarcha-feminist]] [[Voltairine de Cleyre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Cleyre|first1=Voltairine|title=Exquisite Rebel: The Essays of Voltairine de Cleyre: Anarchist, Feminist, Genius|date=February 10, 2005|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791460940|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lum was a prolific writer who wrote a number of key anarchist texts and contributed to publications including ''[[Mother Earth (journal)|Mother Earth]]'', ''Twentieth Century'', ''The Alarm'' (the journal of the [[International Working People's Association]]) and ''The Open Court'' among others. Lum's [[political philosophy]] was a fusion of individualist [[anarchist economics]]—"a radicalized form of ''laissez-faire'' economics" inspired by the [[Individualist anarchism#The "Boston Anarchists"|Boston anarchists]]—with radical labor organization similar to that of the Chicago anarchists of the time.&lt;ref name="carson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2005/04/may-day-thoughts-individualist.html |title=May Day Thoughts: Individualist Anarchism and the Labor Movement |last=Carson |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Carson |accessdate=2007-08-07 |work=Mutualist Blog: Free Market Anti-Capitalism }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] influenced Lum strongly in his individualist tendency.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; He developed a "[[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]]" theory of unions and as such was active within the [[Knights of Labor]] and later promoted [[Apolitical|anti-political]] strategies in the [[American Federation of Labor]].&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; Frustration with [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], [[spiritualism]] and labor reform caused Lum to embrace anarchism and radicalize workers.&lt;ref name="carson"/&gt; Convinced of the necessity of violence to enact social change he volunteered to fight in the [[American Civil War]], hoping thereby to bring about the end of [[slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary S.

==== American egoism ====
[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]
Some of the American individualist anarchists later in this era, such as Benjamin Tucker, abandoned natural rights positions and converted to [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoist anarchism]]. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said that there were only two rights, "the right of might" and "the right of contract". He also said after converting to Egoist individualism that "[i]n times past [...] it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off [...] Man's only right to land is his might over it".&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; In adopting Stirnerite egoism in 1886, Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''Liberty'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, ''Liberty'' championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1300&amp;layout=html#chapter_100896 Wendy Mcelroy. "Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism. They included ''I'' published by [[Clarence Lee Swartz]], edited by [[William Walstein Gordak]] and [[J. William Lloyd]] (all associates of ''Liberty''); and ''The Ego'' and ''The Egoist'', both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German ''Der Eigene'', edited by [[Adolf Brand]]; and ''The Eagle'' and ''The Serpent'', issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle "A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology".&lt;ref name="mcelroy-jury"&gt;McElroy, Wendy.

American anarchists who adhered to egoism include [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson]], [[Steven T. Byington]], [[Hutchins Hapgood]], [[James L. Walker]], [[Victor Yarros]] and Edward H. Fulton.&lt;ref name="mcelroy"/&gt; Robinson wrote an essay called "Egoism" in which he states that "[m]odern egoism, as propounded by Stirner and [[Nietzsche]], and expounded by [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]] and others, is all these; but it is more. It is the realization by the individual that they are an individual; that, as far as they are concerned, they are the only individual".&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/John_Beverley_Robinson__Egoism.html "Egoism"] by [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson]]&lt;/ref&gt; Walker published the work ''The Philosophy of Egoism'' in which he argued that egosim "implies a rethinking of the self-other relationship, nothing less than "a complete revolution in the relations of mankind" that avoids both the "archist" principle that legitimates domination and the "moralist" notion that elevates self-renunciation to a virtue. Walker describes himself as an "egoistic anarchist" who believed in both contract and cooperation as practical principles to guide everyday interactions".&lt;ref&gt;John F. Welsh. ''Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism: A New Interpretation.'' Lexington Books. 2010. p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; For Walker, "what really defines egoism is not mere self-interest, pleasure, or greed; it is the sovereignty of the individual, the full expression of the subjectivity of the individual ego".&lt;ref&gt;John F. Welsh. ''Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism: A New Interpretation.'' Lexington Books. 2010. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Individualist anarchism#Italy|Italian anti-organizationalist individualist anarchism]] was brought to the United States&lt;ref&gt;"it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity – and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy."

''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; by Italian born individualists such as [[Giuseppe Ciancabilla]] and others who advocated for violent [[propaganda by the deed]] there. Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] reports the incident in which the important Italian [[social anarchist]] [[Errico Malatesta]] became involved "in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant".&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George.

==== Anarcho-capitalism ====
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
19th century individualist anarchists espoused the [[labor theory of value]]. Many{{weasel inline|date=August 2018}} believe that the modern movement of anarcho-capitalism is the result of simply removing the labor theory of value from ideas of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists: "Their successors today, such as Murray Rothbard, having abandoned the labor theory of value, describe themselves as [[anarcho-capitalists]]".&lt;ref name="outhwaite"&gt;Outhwaite, William. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, Anarchism entry, [[Blackwell Publishing]], 2003, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; As economic theory changed, the popularity of the labor theory of [[classical economics]] was superseded by the [[subjective theory of value]] of [[neo-classical economics]]. [[Murray Rothbard]], a student of [[Ludwig von Mises]], combined Mises' [[Austrian School]] of economics with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, {{ISBN|0-631-17944-5}}, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s, Rothbard wrote an article under a pseudonym, saying that "we are not anarchists [...] but not archists either [...] Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist", concerned with differentiating himself from communist and socialistic economic views of other anarchists (including the individualist anarchists of the 19th century).&lt;ref name="Are Libertarians 'Anarchists'"&gt;Rothbard, Murray. [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard167.html Are Libertarians 'Anarchists'?]. ''LewRockwell.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an [[anti-capitalist]] movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.&lt;ref&gt;"The philosophy of "anarcho-capitalism" dreamed up by the "libertarian" [[New Right]], has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper."[[Albert Meltzer|Meltzer, Albert]].

It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their [[right libertarianism]] and the [[left libertarianism]] of the anarchist tradition." ''[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow: Left-Libertarian Thought and British Writers from William Morris to Colin Ward]]'' by David Goodway. Liverpool University Press. Liverpool. 2006. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Within Libertarianism, Rothbard represents a minority perspective that actually argues for the total elimination of the state. However Rothbard's claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing these services from capitalist venders...so what remains is shrill anti-statism conjoined to a vacuous freedom in hackneyed defense of capitalism. In sum, the "anarchy" of Libertarianism reduces to a liberal fraud.[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-sabatini-libertarianism-bogus-anarchy "Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy" by Peter Sabatini] in issue #41 (Fall/Winter 1994–95) of ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Agorism =====
{{main|Agorism}}
Agorism was developed from anarcho-capitalism in the late 20th century by [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]]. The goal of agorists is a society in which all "[[Voluntaryism|relations between people are voluntary exchanges]] – a [[free market]]".&lt;ref name="newlibman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Konkin III |first=Samuel Edward |authorlink=Samuel Edward Konkin III |title=New Libertarian Manifesto |publisher=KoPubCo |url = http://invisiblemolotov.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/new_libertarian_manifesto.pdf |format=PDF|year=2006 |isbn=0977764923 |origyear=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agorists are [[market anarchism|market anarchists]]. Most agorists consider that property rights are [[natural right]]s deriving from the primary right of self-ownership. Because of this, they are not opposed in principle to collectively held property if individual owners of the property consent to collective ownership by contract or other voluntary mutual agreement.

==== Post-left anarchy and insurrectionary anarchism ====
{{main|Lifestyle anarchism|Post-left anarchy|Insurrectionary anarchism}}
[[Murray Bookchin]] has identified [[post-left anarchy]] as a form of individualist anarchism in ''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]]'' where he identifies "a shift among Euro-American anarchists away from social anarchism and toward individualist or lifestyle anarchism. Indeed, lifestyle anarchism today is finding its principal expression in spray-can graffiti, post-modernist [[nihilism]], antirationalism, neo-[[Anarcho-primitivism|primitivism]], anti-technologism, neo-[[Situationist International|Situationist]] 'cultural terrorism', mysticism, and a 'practice' of staging [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] 'personal insurrections'".&lt;ref&gt;''Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm'' by [[Murray Bookchin]]&lt;/ref&gt; Post-left anarchist [[Bob Black]] in his long critique of Bookchin's philosophy called ''Anarchy After Leftism'' said about post-left anarchy that "[i]t is, unlike Bookchinism, "individualistic" in the sense that if the freedom and happiness of the individual – i.e., each and every really existing person, every Tom, Dick and Murray – is not the measure of the good society, what is?".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bob_Black__Anarchy_after_Leftism.html#toc13 ''Anarchy after Leftism''] by [[Bob Black]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong relationship does exist between post-left anarchism and the work of individualist anarchist [[Max Stirner]]. [[Jason McQuinn]] says that "when I (and other anti-ideological anarchists) criticize ideology, it is always from a specifically critical, anarchist perspective rooted in both the skeptical, individualist-anarchist philosophy of Max Stirner.&lt;ref name="Cuchuflito"&gt;"What is Ideology?" by [[Jason McQuinn]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Black]] and Feral Faun/Wolfi Landstreicher also strongly adhere to stirnerist [[egoist anarchism]]. Bob Black has humorously suggested the idea of "marxist stirnerism".&lt;ref name="groucho marx"&gt;[http://sniggle.net/Manifesti/groucho.php "Theses on Groucho Marxism" by [[Bob Black]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hakim Bey]] has said: "From Stirner's "[[Union of egoists|Union of Self-Owning Ones]]" we proceed to [[Nietzsche]]'s circle of "Free Spirits" and thence to [[Charles Fourier]]'s "Passional Series", doubling and redoubling ourselves even as the Other multiplies itself in the eros of the group".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.left-bank.org/bey/default3.htm ''Immediatism'' by Hakim Bey. AK Press. 1994. p. 4] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205152300/http://www.left-bank.org/bey/default3.htm |date=December 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bey also wrote: "The Mackay Society, of which Mark &amp; I are active members, is devoted to the anarchism of Max Stirner, [[Benjamin Tucker|Benj. Tucker]] &amp; [[John Henry Mackay]] [...] The Mackay Society, incidentally, represents a little-known current of individualist thought which never cut its ties with revolutionary labor. [[Dyer Lum]], [[Ezra Heywood|Ezra]] &amp; Angela Haywood represent this school of thought; [[Jo Labadie]], who wrote for Tucker's ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', made himself a link between the American "plumb-line" anarchists, the "philosophical" individualists, &amp; the syndicalist or communist branch of the movement; his influence reached the Mackay Society through his son, Laurance. Like the Italian Stirnerites (who influenced us through our late friend [[Enrico Arrigoni]]) we support all anti-authoritarian currents, despite their apparent contradictions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__An_esoteric_interpretation_of_the_I.W.W._preamble.html Hakim Bey. "An esoteric interpretation of the I.W.W. preamble"]&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as posterior individualist anarchists, [[Jason McQuinn]] for some time used the pseudonym [[Lev Chernyi]] in honor of the Russian individualist anarchist of the same name while Feral Faun has quoted Italian individualist anarchist [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;ref name="wolfinovatore2"&gt;[http://www.anti-politics.net/feral-faun/whither-now.html Anti-politics.net], "Whither now? Some thoughts on creating anarchy" by Feral Faun&lt;/ref&gt; and has translated both Novatore&lt;ref name="wolfinovatore"&gt;[http://www.omnipresence.mahost.org/creativenothing.htm Towards the creative nothing and other writings by Renzo Novatore] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820035443/http://www.omnipresence.mahost.org/creativenothing.htm |date=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the young Italian individualist anarchist [[Bruno Filippi]]&lt;ref name="rebel's dark"/&gt;

Egoism has had a strong influence on [[insurrectionary anarchism]], as can be seen in the work of Wolfi Landstreicher. Feral Faun wrote in 1995: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the game of insurgence – a lived guerilla war game – it is strategically necessary to use identities and roles. Unfortunately, the context of social relationships gives these roles and identities the power to define the individual who attempts to use them. So I, Feral Faun, became [...] an anarchist [...] a writer [...] a Stirner-influenced, post-[[Situationist International|situationist]], anti-civilization theorist [...] if not in my own eyes, at least in the eyes of most people who've read my writings.&lt;ref name="feral faun"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Feral_Faun__Essays.html#toc10 "The Last Word" by Feral Faun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== European individualist anarchism ===
{{main|Individualist anarchism in Europe}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Émile Armand]]]]
European individualist anarchism proceeded from the roots laid by [[William Godwin]],&lt;ref name=woodcock20/&gt; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Max Stirner]]. Proudhon was an early pioneer of [[anarchism]] as well as of the important individualist anarchist current of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Americana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1995 79"/&gt; Stirner became a central figure of individualist anarchism through the publication of his seminal work ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' which is considered to be "a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref name=stirnersep/&gt; Another early figure was [[Anselme Bellegarrigue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://praxeology.net/MN-AB.htm Biography of Anselme Bellegarrigue by Max Nettlau.]&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism expanded and diversified through Europe, incorporating influences from [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|North American individualist anarchism]].

European individualist anarchists include [[Albert Libertad]], Bellegarrigue, [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Émile Armand]], [[Lev Chernyi]], [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Han Ryner]], [[Adolf Brand]], [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]], [[Renzo Novatore]] and currently [[Michel Onfray]].&lt;ref name="regards.fr"&gt;Onfray says in an interview "L'individualisme anarchiste part de cette logique. Il célèbre les individualités&amp;nbsp;... Dans cette période de libéralisme comme horizon indépassable, je persiste donc à plaider pour l'individu."[http://www.regards.fr/culture/interview-des-lecteurs-michel Interview des lecteurs : Michel Onfray Par Marion Rousset| 1er avril 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404134143/http://www.regards.fr/culture/interview-des-lecteurs-michel |date=2012-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Important currents within it include [[free love]],&lt;ref name="spain"&gt;
[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923–1938)" by Xavier Diez] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarcho-naturism]]&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; and [[illegalism]].&lt;ref name="inanrcillegal"&gt;
"Parallel to the social, [[collectivist]] anarchist current there was an individualist one whose partisans emphasized their individual freedom and advised other individuals to do the same. Individualist anarchist activity spanned the full spectrum of alternatives to [[authoritarian]] society, subverting it by undermining its way of life facet by facet." Thus [[theft]], [[counterfeiting]], swindling and [[robbery]] became a way of life for hundreds of individualists, as it was already for countless thousands of [[proletarian]]s. The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s ([[Auguste Vaillant]], Ravachol, [[Émile Henry (anarchist)|Émile Henry]], [[Sante Caserio]]) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War ([[Clément Duval]], Pini, [[Marius Jacob]], the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
{{main|Individualist anarchism in France}}
[[File:Han Ryner.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Han Ryner]]]]
From the legacy of Proudhon and Stirner there emerged a strong tradition of [[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchism]]. An early important individualist anarchist was [[Anselme Bellegarrigue]]. He participated in the [[French Revolution of 1848]], was author and editor of ''Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre and Au fait ! Au fait ! Interprétation de l'idée démocratique'' and wrote the important early [[Anarchist Manifesto]] in 1850. Catalan historian of individualist anarchism Xavier Diez reports that during his travels in the United States "he at least contacted [[Henry David Thoreau|(Henry David) Thoreau]] and, probably [[Josiah Warren|(Josiah) Warren]]".{{sfn|Díez|2007|p=60}} ''Autonomie Individuelle'' was an individualist anarchist publication that ran from 1887 to 1888. It was edited by Jean-Baptiste Louiche, Charles Schæffer and Georges Deherme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-presse-anarchiste.net/spip.php?rubrique258 Autonomie Individuelle (1887–1888)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, this tradition continued with such intellectuals as [[Albert Libertad]], [[André Lorulot]], [[Émile Armand]], [[Victor Serge]], [[Zo d'Axa]] and [[Rirette Maitrejean]], who in 1905 developed theory in the main individualist anarchist journal in France, ''[[L'Anarchie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"On the fringe of the movement, and particularly in the individualist faction which became relatively strong after 1900 and began to publish its own sectarian paper, – 315 – L'Anarchie ( 1905–14), there were groups and individuals who lived largely by crime. Among them were some of the most original as well as some of the most tragic figures in anarchist history." Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962''&lt;/ref&gt; Outside this journal, [[Han Ryner]] wrote ''Petit Manuel individualiste'' (1903). In 1891, Zo d'Axa created the journal [[L'En-Dehors]].

[[File:Zo d'Axa portrait.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Zo d'Axa]]]]

Anarcho-naturism was promoted by [[Henri Zisly]], [[Emile Gravelle]] &lt;ref name="naturismo2"/&gt; and Georges Butaud. Butaud was an individualist "partisan of the ''[[Intentional community|milieux libres]]'', publisher of "Flambeau" ("an enemy of authority") in 1901 in Vienna" and most of his energies were devoted to creating anarchist colonies (communautés expérimentales) in which he participated in several.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/0226.htm "1926 – France: Georges Butaud (1868–1926) dies, in Ermont."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense, "the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of [F]rench individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist [[naturism]], the strong defence of bith control methods, the idea of "[[Union of egoists|unions of egoists]]" with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within others".&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"&gt;[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "La insumisión voluntaria.

==== Illegalism ====
{{main|Illegalism}}
[[File:Band a bonnot desenho.jpg|thumb|180px|Caricature of the [[Bonnot gang]]]]
Illegalism&lt;ref name="The Illegalists"/&gt; is an anarchist philosophy that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland during the early 1900s as an outgrowth of Stirner's individualist anarchism.&lt;ref name="inanrcillegal"/&gt; Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions, recognizing only the reality of "might" rather than "right"; and for the most part, illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires, not for some greater ideal,&lt;ref name="Parry, Richard 1987. p. 15"/&gt; although some committed crimes as a form of [[propaganda of the deed]].&lt;ref name="The Illegalists"/&gt; The illegalists embraced [[direct action]] and [[propaganda of the deed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm The Illegalists] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908072801/http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm |date=September 8, 2015 }} – by Doug Imrie. Recollectionbooks.com (1954-08-28). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by theorist Max Stirner's [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] as well as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (his view that "[[Property is theft!]]"), [[Clément Duval]] and [[Marius Jacob]] proposed the theory of la ''reprise individuelle'' ([[individual reclamation]]) which justified robbery on the rich and personal direct action against exploiters and the system.&lt;ref name="Parry, Richard 1987. p. 15"/&gt;

Illegalism first rose to prominence among a generation of Europeans inspired by the unrest of the 1890s, during which [[Ravachol]], [[Émile Henry (anarchist)|Émile Henry]], [[Auguste Vaillant]] and [[Sante Geronimo Caserio]] committed daring crimes in the name of anarchism&lt;ref name="illegalanticap"&gt;"Pre-WWI France was the setting for the only documented anarchist revolutionary movement to embrace all illegal activity as revolutionary practice. Pick-pocketing, theft from the workplace, robbery, confidence scams, desertion from the armed forces, you name it, illegalist activity was praised as a justifiable and necessary aspect of class struggle."[http://www.defenestrator.org/roblosricos/writings/illegalism.htm "Illegalism" by Rob los Ricos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120083916/http://www.defenestrator.org/roblosricos/writings/illegalism.htm |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in what is known as propaganda of the deed. France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

==== Italy ====
[[File:Novatore.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Renzo Novatore]]]]
In Italy, individualist anarchism had a strong tendency towards illegalism and violent propaganda by the deed similar to French individualist anarchism, but perhaps more extreme&lt;ref name="italyindiv"&gt;[https://archive.is/20110929141610/http://ita.anarchopedia.org/anarco-individualismolink "anarco-individualismo" in italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"At this point, encouraged by the disillusionment that followed the breakdown of the general strike, the terrorist individualists who had always – despite Malatesta's influence – survived as a small minority among Italian anarchists, intervened frightfully and tragically." [[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; and which emphazised criticism of organization be it anarchist or of other type.&lt;ref&gt;"in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant." [[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, we can consider notorious magnicides carried out or attempted by individualists [[Giovanni Passannante]], [[Sante Caserio]], [[Michele Angiolillo]], [[Luigi Luccheni]] and [[Gaetano Bresci]] who murdered King [[Umberto I]]. Caserio lived in France and coexisted within French illegalism and later assassinated French President [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]]. The theoretical seeds of current [[insurrectionary anarchism]] were already laid out at the end of 19th century Italy in a combination of individualist anarchism criticism of permanent groups and organization with a socialist class struggle worldview.&lt;ref name="indinss"&gt;"Essa trova soprattutto in America del Nord un notevole seguito per opera del Galleani che esprime una sintesi fra l'istanza puramente individualista di stampo anglosassone e americano (ben espressa negli scritti di Tucker) e quella profondamente socialista del movimento anarchico di lingua italiana. Questa commistione di elementi individualisti e comunisti – che caratterizza bene la corrente antiorganizzatrice – rappresenta lo sforzo di quanti avvertirono in modo estremamente sensibile l'invadente burocratismo che pervadeva il movimento operaio e socialista."[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/anarchismo_insurrezionale "anarchismo insurrezionale" in italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; During the rise of fascism, this thought also motivated [[Gino Lucetti]], Michele Schirru and Angelo Sbardellotto in attempting the assassination of [[Benito Mussolini]].

During the early 20th century, the intellectual work of individualist anarchist [[Renzo Novatore]] came to importance and he was influenced by [[Max Stirner]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Georges Palante]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]]. He collaborated in numerous anarchist journals and participated in [[futurism]] [[avant-garde]] currents. In his thought, he adhered to Stirnerist disrespect for private property, only recognizing property of one's own spirit.&lt;ref name="novatore-anarchopedia"&gt;"Novatore non era contrario all'abolizione della proprietà privata, poiché riteneva che l'unica proprietà inviolabile fosse solo quella spirituale ed etica. Il suo pensiero è esplicitato in "Verso il nulla creatore":
:Bisogna che tutto ciò che si chiama "proprietà materiale", "proprietà privata", "proprietà esteriore" diventi per gli individui ciò che è il sole, la luce, il cielo, il mare, le stelle. E ciò avverrà!Avverrà perché noi – gli iconoclasti – la violenteremo! Solo la ricchezza etica espirituale è invulnerabile. È vera proprietà dell'individuo. Il resto no! Il resto è vulnerabile! E tutto ciò che è vulnerabile sarà vulnerato."[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Renzo_Novatore "Renzo Novatore" in italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Novatore collaborated in the individualist anarchist journal ''Iconoclasta!'' alongside the young [[Stirner]]ist [[Illegalism|illegalist]] [[Bruno Filippi]].&lt;ref name="rebel's dark"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bruno_Filippi__The_rebel_s_dark_laughter__the_writings_of_Bruno_Filippi.html ''The rebel's dark laughter: the writings of Bruno Filippi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The individualist philosopher and poet [[Renzo Novatore]] belonged to the leftist section of the avant-garde movement of futurism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novatore.it/Una_biografia.html Novatore: una biografia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722043805/http://www.novatore.it/Una_biografia.html |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside other individualist anarcho-futurists such as [[Dante Carnesecchi]], [[Leda Rafanelli]], [[Auro d'Arcola]] and Giovanni Governato. There was also Pietro Bruzzi who published the journal ''L'Individualista'' in the 1920s alongside Ugo Fedeli and Francesco Ghezzi, but who fell to fascist forces later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/gallery/galleryindex.htm#Indivi-dualista "L'Indivi-dualista"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819002818/http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/gallery/galleryindex.htm#Indivi-dualista |date=August 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ita.anarchopedia.org"&gt;[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Pietro_Bruzzi "Pietro Bruzzi" at italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Bruzzi also collaborated with the Italian American individualist anarchist publication ''Eresia'' of [[New York City]]&lt;ref name="ita.anarchopedia.org"/&gt; edited by [[Enrico Arrigoni]].

In 1945 in Italy during the Founding Congress of the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]], there was a group of individualist anarchists led by Cesare Zaccaria&lt;ref&gt;[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Storia_del_movimento_libertario_in_Italia "Storia del movimento libertario in Italia" in anarchopedia in Italian]&lt;/ref&gt; who was an important anarchist of the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/73n6nh Cesare Zaccaria (19 August 1897 – October 1961)
Pier Carlo Masini and Paul Sharkey&lt;/ref&gt; Later during the IX Congress of the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]] in [[Carrara]] in 1965, a group decided to split off from this organization and created the ''Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica''. In the 1970s, it was mostly composed of "veteran individualist anarchists with an of [[anarcho-pacifism|pacifism]] orientation, [[anarcho-naturism|naturism]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Los anarco-individualistas, G.I.A.&amp;nbsp;...

Esta pequeña federación de grupos, hoy nutrida sobre todo de veteranos anarco-individualistas de orientación pacifista, naturista, etcétera defiende la autonomía personal y rechaza a rajatabla toda forma de intervención en los procesos del sistema, como sería por ejemplo el sindicalismo.

In the famous Italian [[insurrectionary anarchist]] essay written by an anonymous writer, "At Daggers Drawn with the Existent, its Defenders and its False Critics", there reads: "The workers who, during a wildcat strike, carried a banner saying, 'We are not asking for anything' understood that the defeat is in the claim itself ('the claim against the enemy is eternal'). There is no alternative but to take everything.

==== Spain ====
While Spain was influenced by American individualist anarchism, it was more closely related to the French currents. Around the start of the 20th century, individualism in Spain gathered force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, [[Ricardo Mella]], [[Federico Urales]], [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]], Mariano Gallardo and J. Elizalde who translated French and American individualists.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt; Important in this respect were also magazines such as ''La Idea Libre'', ''[[La revista blanca]]'', ''Etica'', ''[[Iniciales]]'', ''Al margen'', ''Estudios'' and ''Nosotros''. The most influential thinkers there were [[Max Stirner]], [[Émile Armand]] and [[Han Ryner]]. Just as in France, the spread of [[Esperanto]] and [[anationalism]] had importance just as [[naturism]] and [[free love]] currents.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt; Later, Armand and Ryner themselves started writing in the Spanish individualist press. Armand's concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in motivating [[polyamory]] as realization of the individual.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt;

Catalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of [[anarcho-communist]] groups and by members of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as [[Federico Urales]] and [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] who were members of the CNT and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Iberian Anarchist Federation]] (IAF).&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España: 1923–1938.'' {{ISBN|978-84-96044-87-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Giménez Igualada]] wrote the lengthy theory book called ''Anarchism'' espousing his individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/guest8dcd3f/anarquismo-miguel-gimenez-igualada ''Anarquismo'' por [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]]&lt;/ref&gt; Between October 1937 and February 1938, he was editor of the individualist anarchist magazine ''Nosotros''&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; in which many works of Armand and Ryner appeared. He also participated in the publishing of another individualist anarchist maganize ''Al Margen: Publicación quincenal individualista''.&lt;ref name="spain2"&gt;"Entre los redactores y colaboradores de Al Margen, que trasladará su redacción a Elda, en Alicante, encontraremos a Miguel Giménez Igualada&amp;nbsp;..."

He published and wrote the preface&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; to the fourth edition in Spanish of ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' from 1900. He proposed the creation of a "[[Union of egoists]]" to be a federation of individualist anarchists in Spain, but it did not succeed.&lt;ref name="spain3"&gt;"A partir de la década de los treinta, su pensamiento empieza a derivar hacia el individualismo, y como profundo estirneriano tratará de impulsar una federación de individualistas"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "La insumisión voluntaira: El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda reppública(1923–1938) por Xavier Diez] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, he published an extensive treatise on Stirner, dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Émile Armand.&lt;ref name="kclibertaria.comyr.com"&gt;[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l147.pdf "Stirner" por Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he traveled and lived in Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico.{{sfn|Díez|2007}}

[[Federico Urales]] was an important individualist anarchist who edited ''[[La Revista Blanca]]''. The individualist anarchism of Urales was influenced by [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. He saw science and reason as a defense against blind servitude to authority. He was critical of influential individualist thinkers such as Nietzsche and Stirner for promoting an asocial egoist individualism and instead promoted an individualism with solidarity seen as a way to guarantee social equality and harmony. He was highly critical of [[anarcho-syndicalism]], which he viewed as plagued by excessive bureaucracy; and he thought that it tended towards reformism. Instead, he favored small groups based on ideological alignment. He supported and participated in the establishment of the IAF in 1927.{{sfn|Díez|2007}}

In 1956, [[Miguel Giménez Igualada]]—on exile escaping from [[Francisco Franco|Franco's dictatorship]]—published an extensive treatise on Stirner which he dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Émile Armand.&lt;ref name="kclibertaria.comyr.com"/&gt; On the subject of individualist anarchist theory, he publisheds ''Anarchism'' in 1968 during his exile in Mexico from Franco's dictatorship in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/filosofia/igualada/caratula.html ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; He was present in the First Congress of the Mexican Anarchist Federation in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/filosofia/igualada/indice.html Miguel Gimenez Igualada.

==== Germany ====
[[File:John Henry Mackay.gif|thumb|140px|[[John Henry Mackay]]]]
In Germany, the Scottish-German [[John Henry McKay]] became the most important propagandist for individualist anarchist ideas. He fused Stirnerist egoism with the positions of Benjamin Tucker and actually translated Tucker into German. Two semi-fictional writings of his own, ''[[Die Anarchisten]]'' and ''[[Der Freiheitsucher]]'', contributed to individualist theory through an updating of egoist themes within a consideration of the anarchist movement. English translations of these works arrived in the United Kingdom and in individualist American circles led by Tucker.&lt;ref name="mckay"&gt;[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/tariley.html "New England Anarchism in Germany" by Thomas A. Riley] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/660zyRMXN?url=http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/tariley.html|date=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKay is also known as an important European early activist for [[gay]] rights.

Using the [[pseudonym]] Sagitta, Mackay wrote a series of works for [[pederasty|pederastic]] [[emancipation]], titled ''Die Buecher der namenlosen Liebe'' (''Books of the Nameless Love''). This series was conceived in 1905 and completed in 1913 and included the ''Fenny Skaller'', a story of a pederast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.pacbell.net/hubertk/Strauss.pdf thamyris 02&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002023257/http://home.pacbell.net/hubertk/Strauss.pdf|date=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the same pseudonym, he also published fiction, such as ''Holland'' (1924) and a pederastic novel of the [[Berlin]] boy-bars, ''Der Puppenjunge'' (''The Hustler'') (1926).

[[File:Der Eigene - 1896.jpg|thumb|left|140px|''[[Der Eigene]]'', Stirnerist pioneer gay activist publication]]
[[Adolf Brand]] (1874–1945) was a German [[writer]], [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|Stirnerist]] [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and pioneering [[campaigner]] for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. In 1896, Brand published a German homosexual periodical, ''[[Der Eigene]]''. This was the first ongoing homosexual publication in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] had begun a journal called ''Prometheus'' in 1870, but only one issue was published. (Kennedy, Hubert, ''Karl Heinrich Ulrichs: First Theorist of Homosexuality'', In: 'Science and Homosexualities', ed. Vernon Rosario pp. 26–45). New York: Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was taken from writings of egoist philosopher [[Max Stirner]] (who had greatly influenced the young Brand) and refers to Stirner's concept of "[[self-ownership]]" of the individual. ''Der Eigene'' concentrated on cultural and scholarly material and may have had an average of around 1,500 subscribers per issue during its lifetime, although the exact numbers are uncertain. Contributors included [[Erich Mühsam]], [[Kurt Hiller]], [[John Henry Mackay]] (under the pseudonym Sagitta) and artists [[Wilhelm von Gloeden]], [[Fidus]] and [[Sascha Schneider]]. Brand contributed many poems and articles himself. [[Benjamin Tucker]] followed this journal from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German ''[[Der Eigene]]'', edited by [[Adolf Brand]]" http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=796&amp;Itemid=259 "Benjamin Tucker and Liberty: A Bibliographical Essay" by Wendy McElroy&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Der Einzige]]'' was a German individualist anarchist magazine. It appeared in 1919 as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseudonym for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseudonym for [[Salomo Friedlaender]]). Its title was adopted from the book ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' (''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'') by [[Max Stirner]]. Another influence was the thought of German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Parvulescu.

In the hybrid of [[post-structuralism]] and anarchism called [[post-anarchism]], [[Saul Newman]] has written a lot on Stirner and his similarities to post-structuralism. He writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Max Stirner's impact on contemporary political theory is often neglected. However in Stirner's political thinking there can be found a surprising convergence with poststructuralist theory, particularly with regard to the function of power. [[Andrew Koch]], for instance, sees Stirner as a thinker who transcends the Hegelian tradition he is usually placed in, arguing that his work is a precursor poststructuralist ideas about the foundations of knowledge and truth.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Saul_Newman__War_on_the_State__Stirner_and_Deleuze_s_Anarchism.html "War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze's Anarchism"] by [[Saul Newman]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Russia ====
Individualist anarchism was one of the three categories of [[anarchism in Russia]], along with the more prominent [[anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].&lt;ref name=avruss&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Paul Avrich |last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = [[The Russian Anarchists]] | publisher = [[AK Press]] | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1904859488 |page=56 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ranks of the Russian individualist anarchists were predominantly drawn from the [[intelligentsia]] and the [[working class]].&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt; For anarchist historian [[Paul Avrich]], "[t]he two leading exponents of individualist anarchism, both based in [[Moscow]], were [[Alexei Borovoi|Aleksei Alekseevich Borovoi]] and [[Lev Chernyi]] (Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov). From Nietzsche, they inherited the desire for a complete overturn of all values accepted by bourgeois society political, moral, and cultural. Furthermore, strongly influenced by Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker, the German and American theorists of individualist anarchism, they demanded the total liberation of the human personality from the fetters of organized society".&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt;

Some Russian individualists anarchists "found the ultimate expression of their [[social alienation]] in violence and crime, others attached themselves to avant-garde literary and artistic circles, but the majority remained [[Philosophical anarchism|"philosophical" anarchists]] who conducted animated parlor discussions and elaborated their individualist theories in ponderous journals and books".&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt;

Lev Chernyi was an important individualist anarchist involved in resistance against the rise to power of the [[Bolshevik Party]] as he adhered mainly to Stirner and the ideas of Tucker. In 1907, he published a book entitled ''Associational Anarchism'', in which he advocated the "free association of independent individuals".&lt;ref name="chernyi"&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libertarians.html "Prominent Anarchists and Left-Libertarians"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028163000/http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libertarians.html |date=2010-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return from Siberia in 1917, he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers as a lecturer. Chernyi was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, which was formed in March 1917.&lt;ref name="chernyi"/&gt; He was an advocate "for the seizure of private homes",&lt;ref name="chernyi"/&gt; which was an activity seen by the anarchists after the October Revolution as direct expropriation on the bourgoise. He died after being accused of participation in an episode in which this group bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party. Although most likely not being really involved in the bombing, he might have died of torture.&lt;ref name="chernyi"/&gt;

Chernyi advocated a [[Nietzschean]] [[Transvaluation of values|overthrow of the values]] of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary [[Mir (social)|communes]] of anarcho-communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] as a threat to the freedom of the individual.&lt;ref name=Avrich180&gt;{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aa&gt;{{cite book |last=Chernyi |first=Lev |title=Novoe Napravlenie v Anarkhizme: Asosiatsionnii Anarkhism |origyear=1907 |edition=Moscow; 2nd |year=1923 |publisher=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars including Avrich and Allan Antliff have interpreted this vision of society to have been greatly influenced by the individualist anarchists Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker.&lt;ref name=sub&gt;{{cite journal |last=Antliff |first=Allan |year=2007 |title=Anarchy, Power, and Poststructuralism |journal=SubStance |volume=36 |issue=113 |pages=56–66 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/substance/v036/36.2antliff.pdf |accessdate=2008-03-10 |doi=10.1353/sub.2007.0026 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the book's publication, Chernyi was imprisoned in Siberia under the Russian [[Czar]]ist regime for his revolutionary activities.&lt;ref name=match&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips |first=Terry |date=Fall 1984 |journal=[[The Match!]] |url=http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/ChernyiLev.htm |issue=79 |accessdate=2008-03-10 |title=Lev Chernyi |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211173334/http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/ChernyiLev.htm |archivedate=2008-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin American individualist anarchism ===
Argentine anarchist historian [[Angel Cappelletti]] reports that in Argentina "[a]mong the workers that came from Europe in the 2 first decades of the century, there was curiously some stirnerian individualists influenced by the philosophy of [[Nietzsche]], that saw syndicalism as a potential enemy of anarchist ideology. They established [...] [[affinity groups]] that in 1912 came to, according to [[Max Nettlau]], to the number of 20. In 1911 there appeared, in [[Colón, Buenos Aires|Colón]], the periodical ''El Único'', that defined itself as 'Publicación individualista'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | language = Spanish | url = https://books.google.com/?id=WUGgis_VWtEC&amp;pg=PR157&amp;lpg=PR157&amp;q=anarquismo%20nietzsche | title = El Anarquismo en América Latina | first1 = Carlos M | last1 = Rama | first2 = Ángel J | last2 = Cappellett | page = CLVII | isbn = 9789802761173 | year = 1990 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vicente Rojas Lizcano, whose pseudonym was [[Biofilo Panclasta|Biófilo Panclasta]], was a Colombian individualist anarchist writer and activist. In 1904, he began using the name Biofilo Panclasta. ''Biofilo'' in Spanish stands for "lover of life" and ''Panclasta'' for "enemy of all".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Panclasta  | first = Biófilo | year = 1928 | title = Comprimidos psicológicos de los revolucionarios criollos | journal = Periódico Claridad | place = Bogotá | language = Spanish | pages = 52–56 | ref = harv }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He visited more than fifty countries propagandizing for anarchism which in his case was highly influenced by the thought of Stirner and Nietszche. Among his written works there are ''Siete años enterrado vivo en una de las mazmorras de Gomezuela: Horripilante relato de un resucitado''(1932) and ''Mis prisiones, mis destierros y mi vida'' (1929) which talk about his many adventures while living his life as an adventurer, activist and [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]] as well as his thought and the many times he was imprisoned in different countries.

[[File:Mlacerda.png|thumb|150px|[[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] individualist [[anarcha-feminist]]]]
[[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] was a Brazilian [[teacher]], [[journalist]], [[anarcha-feminist]] and [[individualist anarchist]]. Her ideas regarding education were largely influenced by [[Francisco Ferrer]]. She later moved to [[São Paulo]] and became involved in journalism for the anarchist and labor press. There she also lectured on topics including education, [[women's rights]], [[free love]] and [[antimilitarism]]. Her writings and essays garnered her attention not only in Brazil, but also in Argentina and Uruguay. In February 1923, she launched ''Renascença'', a periodical linked with the [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[progressivism|progressive]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] circles of the period. Her thought was mainly influenced by individualist anarchists such as [[Han Ryner]] and [[Émile Armand]].&lt;ref name="nodo50.org"/&gt; She maintained contact with Spanish individualist anarchist circles.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt;

{{see also|Criticisms of anarchism}}
[[File:George bernard shaw.jpg|thumb|125px|[[George Bernard Shaw]] expressed doubts about the [[distribution of wealth]] under individualist anarchism]]
Philosopher [[Murray Bookchin]] criticized individualist anarchism for its opposition to [[democracy]] and its embrace of "[[Lifestyle anarchism|lifestylism]]" at the expense of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bookchin |first=Murray |title=[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism]] |publisher=[[AK Press]] |location=Stirling |year=1995 |isbn=9781873176832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bookchin claimed that individualist anarchism supports only [[negative liberty]] and rejects the idea of [[positive liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. "Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism". ''Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993–1998''. [[AK Press]], 1999, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Albert Meltzer]] proposed that individualist anarchism differs radically from revolutionary anarchism and that it "is sometimes too readily conceded 'that this is, after all, anarchism'". He claimed that [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s acceptance of the use of a private police force (including to break up violent strikes to protect the "employer's 'freedom'") is contradictory to the definition of anarchism as "no government".&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Meltzer|Meltzer, Albert]]. ''Anarchism: Arguments For and Against''. AK Press, 2000. pp. 114–15&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[George Bernard Shaw]] initially had flirtations with individualist anarchism before coming to the conclusion that it was "the negation of socialism, and is, in fact, unsocialism carried as near to its logical conclusion as any sane man dare carry it". Shaw's argument was that even if wealth was initially distributed equally, the degree of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' advocated by Tucker would result in the distribution of wealth becoming unequal because it would permit private appropriation and accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Gareth. ''Socialism and Superior Brain: The Political Thought of George Bernard Shaw''. Routledge (UK). 1993. p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; According to academic Carlotta Anderson, American individualist anarchists accept that free competition results in unequal wealth distribution, but they "do not see that as an injustice".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Carlotta R. ''All-American Anarchist: Joseph A. Labadie and the Labor Movement'', Wayne State University Press, 1998, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker explained: "If I go through life free and rich, I shall not cry because my neighbor, equally free, is richer. Liberty will ultimately make all men rich; it will not make all men equally rich. Authority may (and may not) make all men equally rich in purse; it certainly will make them equally poor in all that makes life best worth living".&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin. ''Economic Rent''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;'''α'''&lt;/sup&gt;{{note label|A|α|none}} The term "individualist anarchism" is often used as a classificatory term, but in very different ways. Some sources, such as ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'', use the classification "[[social anarchism]]/individualist anarchism". Some see individualist anarchism as distinctly non-socialist and use the classification "socialist anarchism/individualist anarchism" accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ostergaard|Ostergaard, Geoffrey]].

The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egotism|egoism]] as most associated with [[Max Stirner]]. The third type is "found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe|Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution".

: ''This article is about the history of ethnic Jews and political radicalism. For the antisemitic canard, see [[Jewish Bolshevism]].''

The historical contribution of Jews to the political Left has been well documented. Both as individual theorists and activists of the stature of [[Karl Marx]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Léon Blum]] and [[Emma Goldman]], and as organised mass labour movements in, for example, revolutionary Russia and early-mid twentieth century Warsaw, Amsterdam, Paris, Toronto, New York and London, Jews have been conspicuous for their socialist and communist affiliations.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Historical analysis of the dynamics of this Jewish/Left alliance, however, has been far less conclusive. Considerable dissonance exists, for example, concerning the factors which attracted Jews to the Left, the extent to which leading Jewish Left activists were originally motivated by or subsequently influenced by explicitly Jewish concerns, and the degree to which one can reasonably speak of a specific or unique Jewish contribution to the international Left. In addition, discussion of these factors has often been inhibited by concerns regarding the use of the alleged Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy by the Nazis and other anti-Semitic groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==History==

According to Paul Johnson, Jewish society in the last 1,500 years has been designed to produce and support intellectuals who largely focused their talents on rabbinical studies.  Johnson asserts that "quite suddenly, around the year 1800, this ancient and highly efficient social machine for the production of intellectuals began to shift its output. Instead of pouring all its products into the closed circuit of rabbinical studies, . . . it unleashed a significant and ever-growing proportion of them into secular life. This was an event of shattering importance in world history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Jews |first=Paul |last=Johnson |year=1988 |pages=340–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Revolution|French Revolution of 1789]] promised equality, freedom, and an end to discrimination for all including the Jews. The subsequent political emancipation of the Jews in most of Western and Central Europe provoked an anti-modern and specifically anti-Jewish backlash from traditional conservative groupings. In response, Jews allied themselves with the modern liberalist forces, and played an important role in the 1848 European revolutions which sought to entrench the gains of liberalism. However, the ensuing failure of liberalism to protect Jewish rights led many Jews to seek new allies within the growing working-class movement. The international character of the socialist movement seemingly offered Jews protection from old religious and national hatreds. Thus in contrast to most other national groups, Jews had a double reason to join the proletarian revolution. They were discriminated against both on class grounds and on racial grounds.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Not surprisingly, many Jews made a rational decision to join a movement which promised to defend and extend the equal rights granted by the French Revolution. The prominence of Jews in the Left can, therefore, be attributed to reasons of self-interest as much as to any idealistic motivation. Equally, the subsequent decline of Jewish involvement in the Left can be attributed to relatively objective factors such as the creation of the State of Israel which transformed Jewish dependence from international to national forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==20th century==
Many young Jews rejected the Orthodoxy of their parents and turned to the great Jewish secular movements of [[Zionism]], [[socialism]], and [[Bundism]] [a Jewish labor movement founded in Eastern Europe in the 19th century]. They viewed their parents' faith in the eventual coming of the Messiah as a dangerous passivity in the face of imminent danger to the Jewish people. They took their fate into their own hands and created new forms of secular Jewish messianic activity. Their concern for changing the world by rejecting their religious background shows how deeply they were immersed in the Jewish search for redemption.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Jewish Bolshevism===
A persistent theme among critics of Jews—particularly those on the pre-World War II right—has been that the [[Bolshevik]] revolution was a Jewish revolution and that the Soviet Union was dominated by Jews. This theme appears in a wide range of writings, from Henry Ford's [[The International Jew|International Jew]], to published statements by a long list of British, French, and American political figures in the 1920s (Sir [[Winston Churchill]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], and [[David Lloyd George]]), and, in its most extreme form, by [[Adolf Hitler]], who wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Now begins the last great revolution. By wresting political power for himself, the Jew casts off the few remaining shreds of disguise he still wears. The democratic plebeian Jew turns into the blood Jew and the tyrant of peoples. In a few years he will try to exterminate the national pillars of intelligence and, by robbing the peoples of their natural spiritual leadership, will make them ripe for the slavish lot of a permanent subjugation. The most terrible example of this is Russia."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''justification of the state''' refers to the source of legitimate authority for the [[State (polity)|state]] or [[government]]. Typically, such a justification explains why the state should exist, and to some degree scopes the '''role of government''' - what a legitimate state should or should not be able to do.

There is no single, universally accepted justification of the state. In fact, [[anarchism|anarchists]] believe that there is no justification for the state at all, and that human societies would be better off without it. However, most political [[ideology|ideologies]] have their own justifications, and thus their own vision of what constitutes a legitimate state. Indeed, a person's opinions regarding the role of government often determine the rest of their political ideology. Thus, discrepancy of opinion in a wide array of political matters is often directly traceable back to a discrepancy of opinion in the justification for the state.

The [[constitution]]s of various countries codify views as to the purposes, powers, and forms of their governments, but they tend to do so in rather vague terms, which particular laws, courts, and actions of politicians subsequently flesh out. In general, various countries have translated vague talk about the purposes of their governments into particular state laws, bureaucracies, enforcement actions, etc.

The following are just a few examples.

== Transcendent sovereignty ==
In feudal [[Europe]] the most widespread justification of the state was the emerging idea of the [[divine right of kings]], which stated that monarchs draw their power from [[God]], and that the state should only be an apparatus that puts the monarch's will into practice. The legitimacy of the state's lands derived from the lands being the personal possession of the monarch. The divine-right theory, combined with [[primogeniture]], became a theory of [[hereditary monarchy]] in the [[nation state]]s of the [[early modern]] period.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was not a state in that{{which?|date=November 2017}} sense, and was not a true [[theocracy]], but rather a federal entity.

The political ideas current in [[China]] at that time involved the idea of the [[mandate of heaven]]. It resembled the theory of divine right in that it placed the ruler in a divine position, as the link between Heaven and Earth, but it differed from the divine right of kings in that it did not assume a permanent connection between a [[dynasty]] and the state. Inherent in the concept was that a ruler held the mandate of heaven only as long as he provided good government. If he did not, heaven would withdraw its mandate and whoever restored order would hold the new mandate. This is true theocracy;{{cn|date=November 2017}} the power and wisdom to govern is granted by a higher power, not by human political schemes, and can be equally removed by [[tian | heaven]]. This has similarities to the idea presented in the Judeo-Christian [[Bible]] from the time when Israel requests "a king like the nations" ({{bibleverse| 1 Samuel | 8:5 | KJV}}) through to Christ himself telling his contemporary [[leader]]s that they only had power because God gave it to them.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The classic Biblical example comes in the story of King [[Nebuchadnezzar II | Nebuchadnezzar]], who according to the [[Daniel 4 | Book of Daniel]] ruled the Babylonian empire because God ordained his power, but who later ate grass like a ox for seven years because he deified himself{{cn|date=November 2017}} instead of acknowledging God. Nebuchadnezzar is restored when he again acknowledges God as the true sovereign.

== Self-aggrandizement ==
In [[Renaissance Italy]], contemporary theoreticians saw the primary purpose of the less-overtly monarchical Italian city-states as civic glory.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== The social contract ==
In the period of the eighteenth century, usually called [[the Enlightenment]], a new justification of the European state developed. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's [[social contract theory]] states that governments draw their power from the governed, its 'sovereign' people (usually a certain ethnic group, and the state's limits are legitimated theoretically as that people's lands, although that is often not, rarely exactly, the case), that no person should have absolute power, and that a ''legitimate'' state is one which meets the needs and wishes of its citizens. These include security, peace, economic development and the resolution of conflict. Also, the social contract requires that an individual gives up some of his natural rights in order to maintain social order via the rule of law. Eventually, the divine right of kings fell out of favor and this idea ascended; it formed the basis for modern [[democracy]].

==Public goods==
This is an example of the theoretical thinking shifting the emphasis from faith and theoretical principles such as sovereignty to the socio-economic logic, as Karl Marx did.
Thus modern political theorists typically legitimize the state with two major ideas: redistribution and the provision of public goods. In ''The Limits of Government'', philosopher [[David Schmidtz]] takes on the second of these ideas.
While a market system may allow self-interested to create and allocate many goods optimally, there exists a class of "collective" - or "public goods" that are not produced adequately in a market system. These collective goods are goods that all individuals want but for whose production it is often not individually rational for people voluntarily to do their part to secure a collectively rational outcome. The state can step in and force us all to contribute toward the production of these goods, and we can all thereby be made better off. There are actually many different opinions when it comes to this topic.

==Political ideologies==
It is on those questions that one can find the differences between [[conservatism]], [[socialism]], [[liberalism]], [[libertarianism]], [[fascism]], especially the latter, and other political ideologies. There are also two ideologies - [[anarchism]] and [[communism]] - which argue that the existence of the state is ultimately unjustified and harmful. For this reason, the kind of society they aim to establish would be stateless.

Anarchism claims that the community of those fighting to create a new society must themselves constitute a [[stateless society]]. Communism wishes to immediately or eventually replace the communities, unities and divisions that things such as work, money, exchange, borders, nations, governments, police, religion, and race create with the universal community possible when these things are replaced.&lt;ref&gt;http://prole.info/wcpw.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State socialism]] states that the degree to which a state is working class is the degree to which it fights government, class, work, and rule. The degree to which it wins such a fight is held to be the degree to which it is communist instead of capitalist, socialist, or the state. [[Anarcho-capitalism]] argues that taxes are theft, that government and the business community complicit in governance is [[organized crime]] and is equivalent to the criminal underworld, and that defense of life and property is just another industry, which must be privatized. [[Anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-collectivism]] says that taxes, being theft, are just property, which is also theft, and that the state is inherently capitalist and will never result in a transition to communism, and says that those fighting against capitalism and the state to produce a communist society must themselves already form such a community. However, the majority of viewpoints agree that the existence of ''some'' kind of government is morally justified. What they disagree about is the proper role and the proper form of that government.

There are several ways to conceive of the differences between these different political views. For example, one might ask ''in what areas'' should the government have jurisdiction, to ''what extent'' it may intervene in those areas, or even what constitutes ''intervention'' in the first place.  Some institutions can be said to exist only because the government provides the framework for their existence; for instance, [[Marxism|Marxists]] argue that the institution of [[property|private property]] only exists due to government.  The intervention debate can be framed in terms of [[big government]] versus [[small government]].

A fringe position also considers the return of the province to [[Germany]] from the [[Russian Federation]], or its independence from both.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-093-65, Flüchtlinge auf Schiff.jpg|thumbnail|[[Refugees from Königsberg]] fleeing to western Germany before the advancing Red Army in 1945]]
Kaliningrad, or [[Königsberg]], had been a part of a German state (the [[Teutonic Order]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Imperial Germany|unified Germany]]) for several centuries before the [[Second World War]], and the city was historically a rich German cultural center, being the home of – among others – the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]. 

The annexation of the Königsberg area of [[East Prussia]] to Russia became a stated war aim of the Soviet Union at [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943.&lt;ref name="waller"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waller|first1=Michael|last2=Coppieters|first2=Bruno|last3=Malashenko|first3=Alekseĭ Vsevolodovich|title=Conflicting Loyalties and the State in Post-Soviet Russia and Eurasia|date=1998|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780714648828|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_S9xfdODDUC&amp;pg=PA80|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503193910/https://books.google.com/books?id=J_S9xfdODDUC&amp;pg=PA80|archivedate=2018-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, at the end of [[World War II]], the city was captured by the [[Soviet Union]]. As agreed by the Allies at the [[Potsdam Conference]], northern Prussia, including Königsberg, was annexed by the USSR, which attached it to the [[Russian SFSR]]. In 1946, the city's name was changed to [[Kaliningrad]].

In October 1945, only about 5,000 Soviet civilians lived in the territory.&lt;ref name="malinkin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malinkin|first1=Mary Elizabeth|title=Building a Soviet City: the Transformation of Königsberg|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/building-soviet-city-the-transformation-konigsberg|website=Wilson Center|accessdate=2 May 2018|date=8 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707061350/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/building-soviet-city-the-transformation-konigsberg|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between October 1947 and October 1948, about 100,000 [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944-50)|Germans were forcibly moved]] to Germany.&lt;ref name="bergerj10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Stefan|title=How to be Russian with a Difference? Kaliningrad and its German Past|journal=Geopolitics|date=13 May 2010|volume=15|issue=2|pages=345–366|doi=10.1080/14650040903486967}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 400,000 Soviet civilians arrived by 1948.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt; Some moved voluntarily, but as the number of willing settlers proved insufficient, [[collective farms]] were given quotas of how many people they had to send to Kaliningrad.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt; Often they sent the least socially desirable individuals, such as alcoholics and the uneducated.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] suggested that the [[Lithuanian SSR]] should annex Kaliningrad Oblast. The offer was refused by the [[Lithuanian Communist Party]] leader [[Antanas Sniečkus]], who did not wish to alter the ethnic composition of his republic.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=39}} In the late Soviet era, rumors spread that the Oblast might be converted into a homeland for [[Soviet Germans]].&lt;ref name="diener10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diener|first1=Alexander C.|last2=Hagen|first2=Joshua|title=Borderlines and Borderlands: Political Oddities at the Edge of the Nation-State|date=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9780742568440|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pci-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaliningrad Oblast remained part of the Soviet Union until [[USSR dissolution|its dissolution]] in 1991, and since then has been an [[exclave]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]]. After the Soviet collapse, some descendants of the expellees and refugees traveled to the city to examine their roots.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; According to the 2010 Russian Census, 7,349 ethnic Germans live in the Oblast, making up 0.8% of the population.&lt;ref name="2010Census"&gt;{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the status of Kaliningrad and the rights of expellees was a mainstream political issue until the 1960s, when the shifting political discourse increasingly associated similar views with right-wing revisionism.&lt;ref name="bergerj10"/&gt;

According to a ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' article published in 2010, in 1990 the West German government received a message from the Soviet general Geli Batenin, offering to return Kaliningrad.&lt;ref name="ballast"/&gt; The offer was never seriously considered by the Bonn government, who saw [[German reunification|reunification]] with the East as its priority.&lt;ref name="ballast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiegrefe|first1=Klaus|title=ZEITGESCHICHTE: Historischer Ballast|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-70569479.html|accessdate=30 April 2018|work=Der Spiegel|date=22 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014130823/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-70569479.html|archivedate=14 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the EU was alleged to be in talks with Russia to arrange an [[EU association|association]] agreement with the Kaliningrad Oblast, at a time when Russia could not repay £22 billion debt owed to Berlin, which may have given Germany some influence over the territory.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1318819/Germany-in-secret-talks-with-Russia-to-take-back-Konigsberg.html "Germany in secret talks with Russia to take back Konigsberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206041607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1318819/Germany-in-secret-talks-with-Russia-to-take-back-Konigsberg.html |date=2018-02-06 }}." ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. January 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of "buying back" Kaliningrad or other "secret deals" were repudiated by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kaliningrad-koenigsberg-fuer-eine-hand-voll-euro-a-113527.html|last=Wagner|first=Rudolf|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]]|language=de|date=22 January 2001|accessdate=2018-03-21|title=Königsberg für eine Hand voll Euro?|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511010948/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kaliningrad-koenigsberg-fuer-eine-hand-voll-euro-a-113527.html|archivedate=11 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another rumor about a debt-related deal, published by the Russian weekly ''Nash Continent'', alleged that Putin and [[Edmund Stoiber]] had agreed on the gradual return of Kaliningrad in return for waiving the country's $50 billion debt to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karabeshkin|first1=Leonid|last2=Wellmann|first2=Christian|title=The Russian Domestic Debate on Kaliningrad: Integrity, Identity and Economy|date=2004|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=9783825879525|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=15wH3N8gjE8C&amp;pg=PA20|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501085510/https://books.google.com/books?id=15wH3N8gjE8C&amp;pg=PA20|archivedate=2018-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for irredentism==
[[Inesis Feldmanis]], head of the Faculty of History and Philosophy at the [[University of Latvia]], has been quoted saying that the [[Soviet Union]]'s annexation of Kaliningrad is "an error in history".&lt;ref name="moscow"/&gt;

The [[Freistaat Preußen]] Movement, one of the most active offshoots of the [[Reichsbürger]] movement, considers the Russian (and German) government as illegitimate and see themselves as the rightful rulers of the region.&lt;ref name="rhz"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reichsbürger: Wie eine „Ministerpräsidentin“ aus der Eifel die Bundesrepublik bekämpft und einen Weltkrieg riskieren will|url=https://www.rhein-zeitung.de/region_artikel,-reichsbuerger-wie-eine-ministerpraesidentin-aus-der-eifel-die-bundesrepublik-bekaempft-und-einen-weltkr-_arid,1610906.html|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=Rhein-Zeitung|date=16 February 2017|language=de|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325191444/https://www.rhein-zeitung.de/region_artikel,-reichsbuerger-wie-eine-ministerpraesidentin-aus-der-eifel-die-bundesrepublik-bekaempft-und-einen-weltkr-_arid,1610906.html|archivedate=25 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the movement is split into two competing factions, one based in [[Königsfeld, Rhineland-Palatinate]] and the other in Bonn.&lt;ref name="rhz"/&gt;

===In Lithuania===
{{seealso|Lithuania Minor}}
Some political groups in [[Lithuania]] claim the parts of Kaliningrad Oblast between the [[Pregolya River|Pregel]] and [[Nemunas river|Nemunas]] Rivers, but they have little influence.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=82}} [[Linas Balsys (politician)|Linas Balsys]], a deputy in the Lithuanian parliament, has argued that the status of the exclave should be discussed at international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts comment on Lithuanian MP’s claims regarding Russia's Kaliningrad|url=http://tass.com/politics/927891|accessdate=30 April 2018|work=TASS|date=30 January 2017|language=ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317113724/http://tass.com/politics/927891|archivedate=17 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the former Lithuanian president [[Vytautas Landsbergis]] called for the separation and '[[decolonization]]' of Kaliningrad from Russia.&lt;ref name="kempton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kempton|first1=Daniel R.|last2=Clark|first2=Terry D.|title=Unity Or Separation: Center-periphery Relations in the Former Soviet Union|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275973063|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vro_ongFiCkC&amp;pg=PA145|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501095203/https://books.google.com/books?id=vro_ongFiCkC&amp;pg=PA145|archivedate=2018-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1997, the Lithuanian parliament speaker [[Romualdas Ozolas]] expressed his view that Kaliningrad should become an independent republic.&lt;ref name="vitunic"/&gt;

'''Kinder der Landstrasse''' (literally: Children of the Country Road) was a project of the Swiss foundation [[Pro Juventute]], active from  1926 to 1973. The focus of the project was the assimilation of the itinerant [[Yeniche people#Switzerland|Yenish people]] in [[Switzerland]] by forcibly removing children from their parents, placing them in orphanages or foster homes. A  total of  about 590 children were affected by the program.&lt;ref name="uek-schlussbericht"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uek.ch/de/schlussbericht/Publikationen/Zusammenfassungenpdf/23d.pdf|title=Roma, Sinti und Jenische.

Beitrag zur Forschung (Veröffentlichungen der UEK, Band 23)|publisher=UEK, Swiss Government|author1=Thomas Huonker |author2=Regula Ludi |language=German|date=2001|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le Temps'' (Geneva), December 12, 2007, "Le passé enfin écrit des enfants enlevés en Suisse", an historical study spanning the years from 1926 to 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1926, [[Pro Juventute]] started – supported by the federal authorities and official institutions – 
systematically taking children away from Yenish families living in Switzerland and placing them in foster homes, psychiatric hospitals and even prisons. This so-called "re-education" had the goal of establishing Yenish families, and particularly the next generation, in a 'sedentary' lifestyle. After 47 years of those unremitting activities, the affected people obtained in 1973, with the support of the media, an end to these practices.&lt;ref name="hds-Jenische"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D8247.php|title=Jenische|publisher=HDS|author=Hansjörg Roth|language=German|date=2008-03-08|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As the legal basis of the forced separation of families and children served the Swiss Civil Code (''Zivilgesetzbuch'') of 1912, by – at misfeasance behavior of parents, permanent risk or, more generally, neglect – the guardianship authorities were empowered, parents to take away the custody of their children. Although the Civil Code mentioned a supervision over the work of the authorities, it was widely ignored. Although the welfare authorities possessed the right parents to escape custody, such as the supervision in the mass application of the laws of the article, was nowhere determined. Crucial and sufficient was the 'legal fact', that the children were members of a traveling (Yenish) family, and thus a sufficient reason, to take away the children from their parents.&lt;ref name="Thomas Huonker"&gt;Thomas Huonker: ''Ein dunkler Fleck. In: Merken was läuft. Rassismus im Visier''. [[Pestalozzianum]], Zürich 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-03755-105-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As a professionally-welfare justification generic psychiatric reports, which let the "Fund" the full control over his wards. The 'general scientific basis' for the attitude of those responsible functioneers was primarily the conviction of the harmfulness of family socialization "categorized as asocial families, as families who were traveling with origin per se". These fascist assumption informed at the same time in "hereditary biological notions of inferior 'genetic asocial material', whether sedentary or not, that will "damage the valuable heritage of the settled majority population, if its disclosure would not prevent."&lt;ref name="Thomas Huonker"/&gt;
 
Therefore, the "charity" was anxious to detain children, both not sedentary and sedentary families, propelled implement of origin or in foreign families. Not a real driving lifestyle of the parents was the decisive criterion of a child removal, but "belonging to a collective wearer as socially damaging properties classified fringe group of tinker, basketters, scissor sharpener, beggars, "or worse". In some cases, children have been taken away from their mothers immediately after birth. The children were housed usually in homes, in some cases also in foreign families, in psychiatric hospitals and in prisons or assigned as [[Child labour in Switzerland|forced child laborers]] to farming families. Contacts between children and parents were systematically prevented. Sometimes even the term of "charity ward" was changed to remain undetectable for their relatives. Child abuse was legitimized as education for work. In the 1930/40s the child removals peaked, resulting in more than 200 Yenish children under the control of "charity".&lt;ref name="UEK-Roma-Sinti-Jenische"/&gt;

Among the protagonists of such population sanitary and racial hygiene concepts, namely psychiatrist Josef Jörgerstraße ([[canton of Graubünden]] with his psychiatric-[[eugenic]] writings on the fictitious "Family Zero" or the German eugenicists and self-proclaimed "Gypsy expert" Robert Ritter. Federal Heinrich Haberlin, Board of Trustees President Pro Juventute, described the Yenish people in a brochure published in 1927 as "a dark spot in our culture on his order so proud Swiss countryside", which it applies to eliminate. The "charity" needed and found the support of dispensaries, teachers, pastors and non-profit organizations. The legislation opened maneuver, which were often but extensively used in different ways. The limits were exceeded to open illegality.&lt;ref name="Thomas Huonker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UEK-Roma-Sinti-Jenische"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thata.ch/beiheftromasintijenische.htm#_ftnref136|title=Roma, Sinti und Jenische.

The scandal got in the even international focus before 1972, as the [[Beobachter]] newspaper's journalists investigated, after the newspaper got hints by affected Yenish people, and as the first media, Hans Caprez published on 15 April 1972 in the article ''Kinder der Landstrasse'' the facts and the background involving in all about 590 children of the [[Yenish people]] minority in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="beobachter-2007-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beobachter.ch/dossiers/dossier-fremdplatziert/artikel/kinder-der-landstrasse_der-kinderklau/|title="Kinder der Landstrasse": Der Kinderklau|publisher=[[Beobachter]] 1/2007|author1=Dominique Strebel |author2=Christoph Schilling |language=German|date=2007-01-03|accessdate=2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy and aftermath ==
In the aftermath of the project, it was intensively discussed and condemned in Switzerland, as well as in several books and movies.&lt;ref name="woz200923"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.woz.ch/0923/fahrende/zwischen-landstrasse-und-aktendeckeln|title=Fahrende: Zwischen "Landstrasse" und Aktendeckeln|publisher=[[WOZ Die Wochenzeitung]] 23/2009|author=Dominik Gross|language=German|date=2009-06-04|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public pressure prompted ''Pro Juventute'' then after, to dissolve the "Fund" in spring 1973: Remaining guardianships were abolished ''or transferred to other persons''. The Swiss authorities that had had co-initiated the "Fund" 37 years ago, was forced by the public disgust to pay financial compensation from 2000 to 7000 Swiss francs per victim. A prosecution of those responsible for the project, in particular of the two main actors Alfred Siegfried (1890-1972) and Clara Reust (1916-2000), as well as the person responsible in the guardianship authorities who did not fulfill their supervisory role, was never done.&lt;ref name="hds-kinderarbeit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D13909.php|title=Kinderarbeit|publisher=HDS|author=Thomas Guss|language=German|date=2009-10-13|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, for the first time, Yenish people were recognized as an independent ethnic group in the Canton of Bern, and since the 1980s, self-help organizations try to provide redress and rehabilitation of the slandered victims that even by pseudo-scientific programs were mistreated.&lt;ref name="hds-Jenische"/&gt;

The [[Genocide Convention|UN Genocide Convention]], signed on 9 December 1948, qualifies forcibly transferring of children of a "national, ethnic, racial or religious group to another group" in the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, as a [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="UN-1948convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voelkermordkonvention.de/|title=UNO-Konvention über die Verhütung und Bestrafung des Völkermords|publisher=[[United Nations]]|language=German|date=1948|accessdate=2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by the Swiss criminal law in general in ''Art. 264'' (''Strafgesetzbuch'') as ".... marked by their nationality, race, religion or ethnicity group".&lt;ref name="stgb"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19370083/index.html#a264 |title= Art. 264 |publisher= Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft |work= Schweizerisches Strafgesetzbuch |language=German |date= |accessdate= 2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most relevant fact, whether the Yenish people are one of the groups the convention respectively Swiss law are attributable, is affirmed by parts of the recent scientific work,&lt;ref name="bar-Sablonier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bar.admin.ch/dokumentation/00445/01624/01630/01724/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDeH92e2ym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A-- |title=Das Hilfswerk für die Kinder der Landstrasse.

Government redress was promised after years of public reparation, a proper rehabilitation and an apology by the Federal Council (''Bundesrat''), however not so far, and there only "emergency" payments were made at a ridiculously low level of each several thousand Swiss Francs to the meanwhile old-aged surviving victims of ''Kinder der Landstrasse''.

The foundation ''Naschet Jenische'' (literally: arise, Yenish!) was established in 1986, focussing on the refurbishment and 'reparations' of the injustice perpetrated against the Yenish (''Fahrende'') people in Switzerland, in particular by the program ''Kinder der Landstrasse''. In 1988 a fund commission, which regulated the inspection for the affected Yenish people, was established and completed their work in 1992.&lt;ref name="bar-Sablonier"/&gt; The inspection of the files of Pro Juventute is governed since then directly by the [[Swiss Federal Archives]] (''Bundesarchiv''). The affected Yenish people received in all 11 million Swiss Francs, but not more than 20,000 Swiss Francs each. The advice and support of people and families affected by ''Kinder der Landstrasse'' is still the main focus of the activities of the foundation. The foundation advises Yenish people in personal, family and social problems, in particular in contacts with the Swiss authorities, and assists in the inspection of personal files. The foundation also supports the search and the reuninicfaction of families. Yenish people are assisted with applications for financial assistance to public and private institutions. Advice can be also invoked in the case of difficulties with insurance and taxes. The consultancy activity is financed by ''Pro Juventute''. Another important part of the foundation's activities are the public relations; Naschet Jenische informs about the history and the current situation in Switzerland and arbitrates contacts.&lt;ref name="Naschet-Jenische"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stiftung-fahrende.ch/geschichte-gegenwart/de/organisationen/naschet-jenische|title=Naschet Jenische|publisher=stiftung-fahrende.ch|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Swiss national ''[[Wiedergutmachungsinitiative]]'' (reparation initiative) was tangentially related, althogh it primarily concerned 
the fates of the so-called ''[[Verdingkinder]]'' (literally: forced child laborers), another 'integration project' related to 'misplaced persons' which were placed as cheap labour at Swiss farms, among them also Yenish juveniles affected by "Kinder der Landstrasse", but not their families.&lt;ref name="wiedergutmachung-forderungen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiedergutmachung.ch/home/|title=Wiedergutmachungsinitiative|publisher=wiedergutmachung.ch|language=German|date=2014|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Laissez-faire''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɛ|s|eɪ|ˈ|f|ɛər}}; {{IPA-fr|lɛsefɛʁ|lang|Fr-Laissez-faire.oga}}; from {{Lang-fr|laissez faire|lit=let do}}) is an [[economic system]] in which transactions between private parties are free from [[government]] intervention such as [[regulation]], [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privileges]], [[tariff]]s and [[Subsidy|subsidies]]. The phrase ''laissez-faire'' is part of a larger [[French language|French]] phrase and translates to "let (it/them) do", but in this context usually means "let go".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/laissez-faire.html Laissez-faire], Business Dict&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and usage ==
The term ''laissez faire'' likely originated in a meeting that took place around 1681 between powerful French [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Controller-General of Finances]] [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and a group of French [[businessmen]] headed by M. Le Gendre. When the eager [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] minister asked how the French state could be of service to the merchants and help promote their commerce, Le Gendre replied simply "''laissez-nous faire''" ("leave it to us" or "let us do [it]", the French verb not having to take an object).&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AJournal_oeconomique_-_janvier_1751.djvu Journal Oeconomique] 1751, Article by the French minister of finance.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anecdote on the Colbert–Le Gendre meeting appeared in a 1751 article in the ''Journal économique'', written by French minister and champion of [[free trade]] [[René Louis de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson|René de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson]]—also the first known appearance of the term in print.&lt;ref&gt;M. d'Argenson, "Lettre au sujet de la dissertation sur le commerce du marquis de Belloni', Avril 1751, ''Journal Oeconomique'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=k4ABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA111#v=onepage p. 111]. See A. Oncken, ''Die Maxime Laissez faire et laissez passer, ihr Ursprung, ihr Werden'', 1866&lt;/ref&gt; Argenson himself had used the phrase earlier (1736) in his own diaries in a famous outburst: {{quote|''Laissez faire, telle devrait être la devise de toute puissance publique, depuis que le monde est civilisé&amp;nbsp;... Détestable principe que celui de ne vouloir grandir que par l'abaissement de nos voisins&amp;nbsp;! Il n'y a que la méchanceté et la malignité du cœur de satisfaites dans ce principe, et l’intérêt y est opposé. Laissez faire, morbleu&amp;nbsp;! Laissez faire !!''&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in J. M.

[[Vincent de Gournay]], a French [[Physiocracy|Physiocrat]] and intendant of commerce in the 1750s, popularized the term ''laissez faire'' as he allegedly adopted it from [[François Quesnay]]'s writings on China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Baghdiantz McCabe|first= Ina|title= Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|year= 2008|publisher= Berg Publishers|isbn= 978-1-84520-374-0|pages= 271–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quesnay coined the phrases ''laissez-faire'' and ''laissez-passer,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Encyclopædia Britannica|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/487095/Francois-Quesnay|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''laissez-faire'' being a translation of the Chinese term 無為 [[wu wei]].&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book|last= Clarke|first= J.J.|title= Oriental Enlightenment: The Encounter Between Asian and Western Thought|year= 1997|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0415133760|page= 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gournay ardently supported the removal of restrictions on trade and the deregulation of industry in France. Delighted with the Colbert-Le Gendre anecdote,&lt;ref&gt;According to J. [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]]'s "Eloge de Vincent de Gournay," '' Mercure'', August, 1759 (repr. in ''Oeuvres of Turgot'', vol. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5KQALAckPr8C&amp;pg=PA288#v=onepage p. 288].&lt;/ref&gt; he forged it into a larger maxim all his own: "''Laissez faire et laissez passer''" ("Let do and let pass"). His motto has also been identified as the longer "''Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!''" ("Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!"). Although Gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas, he had immense personal influence on his contemporaries, notably his fellow Physiocrats, who credit both the ''laissez-faire'' slogan and the doctrine to Gournay.&lt;ref&gt;Gournay was credited with the phrase by [[Jacques Turgot]] ("Eloge a Gournay", ''Mercure'' 1759), the [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Marquis de Mirabeau]] (''Philosophie rurale'' 1763 and ''Ephémérides du Citoyen'', 1767.), the [[Comte d'Albon]] (,"Éloge Historique de M. Quesnay", ''Nouvelles Ephémérides Économiques'', May, 1775, pp. 136–37. ) and [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours|DuPont de Nemours]] (Introduction to ''Oeuvres de Jacques Turgot'', 1808–11, Vol. I, pp. 257, 259 (Daire ed.)) among others&lt;/ref&gt;

Before d'Argenson or Gournay, [[Pierre Le Pesant, sieur de Boisguilbert|P. S. de Boisguilbert]] had enunciated the phrase "''on laisse faire la nature''" ("let nature run its course").&lt;ref&gt;"Tant, encore une fois, qu'on laisse faire la nature, on ne doit rien craindre de pareil", P.S. de Boisguilbert, 1707, ''Dissertation de la nature des richesses, de l'argent et des tributs''.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Argenson himself during his life was better known for the similar, but less-celebrated motto "''Pas trop gouverner''" ("Govern not too much").&lt;ref&gt;DuPont de Nemours, ''op cit'', p. 258. Oncken (''op.cit'') and Keynes (''op.cit''.) also credit the Marquis d'Argenson with the phrase "''Pour gouverner mieux, il faudrait gouverner moins''" ("To govern best, one needs to govern less"), possibly the source of the famous "That government is best which governs least" motto popular in American circles, attributed variously to [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Henry Thoreau]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gournay's use of the ''laissez-faire'' phrase (as popularized by the Physiocrats) gave it its cachet.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Physiocrats proclaimed ''laissez-faire'' in eighteenth-century France, placing it at the very core of their economic principles and famous economists, beginning with [[Adam Smith]], developed the idea.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"&gt;Fine, Sidney. ''Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State''. United States: The University of Michigan Press, 1964. Print&lt;/ref&gt; "It is with the physiocrats and the classical political economy that the term "''laissez faire''" is ordinarily associated".&lt;ref&gt;Macgregor, ''Economic Thought and Policy'' (London, 1949), pp. 54–67&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State'' states: &lt;blockquote&gt;The physiocrats, reacting against the excessive mercantilist regulations of the France of their day, expressed a belief in a "natural order" or liberty under which individuals in following their selfish interests contributed to the general good. Since, in their view, this natural order functioned successfully without the aid of government, they advised the state to restrict itself to upholding the rights of private property and individual liberty, to removing all artificial barriers to trade, and to abolishing all useless laws.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In England, a number of "free trade" and "non-interference" slogans{{which|date=December 2016}} had been coined{{By whom|date=December 2016}} as early as the 17th century,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} but the French phrase ''laissez-faire'' gained currency in English-speaking countries with the spread of Physiocratic literature in the late 18th century. [[George Whatley]]'s 1774 ''Principles of Trade'' (co-authored with [[Benjamin Franklin]]) re-told the Colbert-LeGendre anecdote—this may mark the first appearance of the phrase in an English-language publication.&lt;ref&gt;Whatley's ''Principles of Trade'' are reprinted in ''Works of Benjamin Franklin, Vol.2'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=C2QUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA401#v=onepage p. 401]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Spencer]] was opposed to a slightly different application of ''laissez faire''—to "that miserable ''laissez-faire''" that leads to men’s ruin: &lt;blockquote&gt;Along with that miserable laissez-faire which calmly looks on while men ruin themselves in trying to enforce by law their equitable claims, there goes activity in supplying them, at other men's cost, with gratis novel-reading!&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Part IV of Ethics'' (1892). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Spencer's case, the right of private ownership was being assailed and it was that miserable spirit of ''laissez-faire'' in halls of legislation that exhausted men in the effort of protecting their right. So in effect, Spencer decried ''laissez-faire'' socialism.

''Laissez-faire'', a product of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], was "conceived as the way to unleash human potential through the restoration of a natural system, a system unhindered by the restrictions of government".&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"&gt;Gaspard, Toufick. ''A Political Economy of Lebanon 1948–2002: The Limits of Laissez-faire''. Boston: Brill, 2004. {{ISBN|978-9004132597}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Adam Smith{{When|date=December 2016}} viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that system. Smith saw ''laissez-faire'' as a moral program and the market its instrument to ensure men the rights of [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; By extension, [[free market]]s become a reflection of the natural system of liberty.&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; For Smith, ''laissez-faire'' was "a program for the abolition of laws constraining the market, a program for the restoration of order and for the activation of potential growth".&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt;

However, Smith&lt;ref name=asoae /&gt; and the notable [[Classical economics|classical economists]], such as [[Thomas Malthus]] and [[David Ricardo]], did not use the phrase. [[Jeremy Bentham]] used the term, but it was probably{{original research inline|date=December 2016}} [[James Mill]]'s reference to the ''laissez-faire'' maxim (together with "''pas trop gouverner''") in an 1824 entry for the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' that really brought the term into wider English usage. With the advent of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] (founded 1838), the term received much of its English meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Abbott P.

Smith first used the metaphor of an "[[invisible hand]]" in his book ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759) to describe the unintentional effects of economic self-organization from economic self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Andres Marroquin, ''Invisible Hand: The Wealth of Adam Smith'', The Minerva Group, Inc., 2002, {{ISBN|1-4102-0288-7}}, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea lying behind the "invisible hand", though not the metaphor itself, belongs to [[Bernard Mandeville|Bernard de Mandeville]] and his ''[[Fable of the Bees]]'' (1705). In [[political economy]], that idea and the doctrine of ''laissez-faire'' have long been{{By whom|date=December 2016}} closely related.&lt;ref&gt;John Eatwell, ''The Invisible Hand'', W.W. Norton&amp;Company, 1989, pp. Preface x1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have characterized the invisible-hand metaphor as one for ''laissez-faire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.google.com/books?id=zAIar8Ee80QC&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=laissez%20faire%20invisible%20hand |title= The mathematical century: the 30 greatest problems of the last 100 years (2006) Piergiorgio Odifreddi, Arturo Sangalli, Freeman J Dyson, p. 122 |publisher= Google.com |accessdate= 2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Smith never actually used the term himself.&lt;ref name=asoae&gt;

In ''Third Millennium Capitalism'' (2000), Wyatt M. Rogers, Jr. notes a trend whereby recently "conservative politicians and economists have chosen the term '[[free-market capitalism]]' in lieu of ''laissez-faire''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Wyatt M.|chapter=1: Economic Forces in Modern Capitalism|title=Third Millennium Capitalism: Convergence of Economic, Energy, and Environmental Forces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7adF9D3OJ0EC|series=ABC-Clio ebook|location=Westport, Connecticut|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|publication-date=2000|page=38|isbn=9781567203608|accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==
As a system of thought, ''laissez-faire'' rests on the following axioms:&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt;
# The individual is the basic unit in society.
# The individual has a natural right to freedom.
# The physical order of nature is a harmonious and self-regulating system.
# Corporations are creatures of the State and therefore the citizenry must watch them closely due to their propensity to disrupt the Smithian [[spontaneous order]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'', "The exclusive privileges of corporations, statutes of apprenticeship, and all those laws which restrain, in particular employments, the competition to a smaller number than might otherwise go into them, have the same tendency, though in a less degree. They are a sort of enlarged monopolies, and may frequently, for ages together, and in whole classes of employments, keep up the market price of particular commodities above the natural price, and maintain both the wages of the labour and the profits of the stock employed about them somewhat above their natural rate." p. 52, http://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/s/SmithA_WealthNations_p.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These axioms constitute the basic elements of ''laissez-faire'' thought. Another basic and often-disregarded{{by whom|date=September 2018}} principle holds that markets should be [[Competition (economics)|competitive]], a rule that the early advocates of ''laissez-faire'' always emphasized.&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; With the aims of maximizing freedom and of allowing markets to self-regulate, early advocates of ''laissez-faire'' proposed a ''impôt unique'', a [[land value tax|tax on land rent]] to replace all taxes that they saw as damaging welfare by penalizing [[production (economics)|production]].&lt;ref&gt;

==History of ''laissez-faire'' debate==

===Europe===
In Europe, the ''laissez-faire'' movement was first widely promoted by the [[Physiocracy|Physiocrats]], a movement that originated with [[Vincent de Gournay]], a successful merchant. Gournay adopted the concept, which is the translation of Chinese philosophy [[wu wei]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Gerlach]], [http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/daten/2005/gerlach_christian_wu-wei.pdf Wu-Wei in Europe. A Study of Eurasian Economic Thought], London School of Economics – March 2005 p. 3" the diffusion of wu-wei, co-evolved with the inner-European ''laissez-faire'' principle, the Libaniusian model." p. 8 "Thus, wu-wei has to be recognized as a ''laissez-faire'' instrument of Chinese political economy "p. 10 "Practising wu-wei erzhi. Consequently, it is this variant of the ''laissez-faire'' maxim in which the basis of Physiocracy's ‘moral philosophy’ is to be located. Priddat's work made clear that the wu-wei of the complete économie has to be considered central to Physiocracy; "p. 11 "that wu-wei translates into French as laissez-faire"&lt;/ref&gt; from [[François Quesnay]]'s writings on China.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; Gournay held that the government should allow the [[natural law|laws of nature]] to govern economic activity, with the state only intervening to protect life, liberty and property. His ideas were taken up by [[François Quesnay]] and [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]], Baron de l'Aulne. Quesnay had the ear of the King of France, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and in 1754 persuaded him to give ''laissez-faire'' a try. On September 17, the King abolished all tolls and restraints on the sale and transport of grain and for more than a decade the experiment was a success, but then in 1768 there was a poor harvest, and the cost of bread rose so high that there was widespread starvation while merchants exported grain in order to obtain the best profit. In 1770, the edict allowing [[free trade]] was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;Will &amp; Ariel Durant, ''Rousseau and the Revolution'', pp. 71–77, Simon and Schuster, 1967, {{ISBN|067163058X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of ''laissez-faire'' became an integral part of [[Classical liberalism|nineteenth-century European liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt; Just as liberals supported [[freedom of thought]] in the intellectual sphere, so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of [[free trade]] and [[free competition]] in the sphere of economics. The state was to be merely a [[Night-watchman state|passive policeman]], protecting [[private property]] and administering justice, but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens. Businessmen and particularly British industrialists were quick to associate these principles with their own economic interests.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt; Many of the ideas of the physiocrats spread throughout Europe and were adopted to a greater or lesser extent in [[Sweden]], [[Tuscany]], [[Spain]] and after 1776 in the newly created [[United States]]. [[Adam Smith]], author of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', met Quesnay and acknowledged his influence.&lt;ref&gt;Will &amp; Ariel Durant, ''Rousseau and the Revolution'', p. 76, Simon and Schuster, 1967, {{ISBN|067163058X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the newspaper ''[[The Economist]]'' was founded in 1843 and became an influential voice for ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scott Gordon|title=The London Economist and the High Tide of Laissez Faire|year=1955|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=63|issue=6|pages=461–88|doi=10.1086/257722}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Laissez-faire'' advocates opposed food aid for famines occurring within the [[British Empire]]. In 1847, referring to the famine then underway in [[Ireland]], founder of ''The Economist'' [[James Wilson (businessman)|James Wilson]] wrote: "It is no man's business to provide for another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Cormac Ó Gráda]]|title=The Great Irish Famine|year=1995|chapter=section: ''Ideology and relief'' in Chpt. 2|isbn=9780521557870|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The Economist'' campaigned against the [[Corn Laws]] that protected landlords in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland in 1845 led to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high were repealed.&lt;ref&gt;George Miller. ''On Fairness and Efficiency''. The Policy Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-1-86134-221-8}} p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; However, repeal of the Corn Laws came too late to stop Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy. ''A Death-Dealing Famine:The Great Hunger in Ireland''. Pluto Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-1074-9}}. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

A group calling itself the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester Liberals]], to which [[Richard Cobden]] and Richard Wright belonged, were staunch defenders of free trade and their work was carried on, after the death of Richard Cobden in 1866, by ''The Cobden Club''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Clubs in the Late Nineteenth Century |url=http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/economics/history/paper28/28taddeiweb1.pdf |format=PDF|author=Antonia Taddei|year=1999|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, a [[Cobden-Chevalier Treaty|trade treaty]] was signed between Britain and France, after which several of these treaties were signed among other European countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The breakdown of the ''laissez-faire'' practised by the British Empire was partly led by British companies eager for state support of their positions abroad, in particular British oil companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Jones |first= G.

===United States===
Frank Bourgin's study of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] and subsequent decades argues that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]].&lt;ref name=bourgin&gt;{{Cite book|first=Frank|last=Bourgin|title=The Great Challenge: The Myth of Laissez-Faire in the Early Republic|isbn=0-06-097296-3|year=1989|publisher=George Braziller Inc.|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this was the economic and financial chaos the nation suffered under the [[Articles of Confederation]]. The goal was to ensure that dearly-won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially dependent on the powers and princes of Europe. The creation of a strong central government able to promote science, invention, industry and commerce was seen as an essential means of promoting the general welfare and making the economy of the United States strong enough for them to determine their own destiny. One later result of this intent was the adoption of Richard Farrington's new plan (worked out with his co-worker John Jefferson) to incorporate new changes during the [[New Deal]]. Others, including Jefferson, view Bourgin's study, written in the 1940s and not published until 1989, as an over-interpretation of the evidence, intended originally to defend the New Deal and later to counter [[Ronald Reagan]]'s economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourgin |first=Frank |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/frank-bourgin/the-great-challenge-the-myth-of-laissez-faire-i/ |title=THE GREAT CHALLENGE: The Myth of Laissez-Faire in the Early Republic by Frank Bourgin &amp;#124; Kirkus |publisher=Kirkusreviews.com |date=1989-06-01 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism]] in the United States in the 19th century had distinctive characteristics and that "at the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean "no government intervention" at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers".

Notable examples of government intervention in the period prior to the Civil War include the establishment of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|Patent Office]] in 1802; the establishment of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures in 1830; the creation of the [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]] in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor navigation; the various [[United States Army|Army]] expeditions to the west, beginning with [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]]'s [[Corps of Discovery]] in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s, almost always under the direction of an officer from the Army [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]] and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers that followed; the assignment of Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of the early railroads and canals; and the establishment of the [[First Bank of the United States]] and [[Second Bank of the United States]] as well as various protectionist measures (e.g. the [[Tariff of Abominations|tariff of 1828]]). Several of these proposals met with serious opposition and required a great deal of horse-trading to be enacted into law. For instance, the First National Bank would not have reached the desk of President [[George Washington]] in the absence of an agreement that was reached between [[Alexander Hamilton]] and several Southern members of Congress to locate the capitol in the [[District of Columbia]]. In contrast to Hamilton and the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] was [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]'s opposing political party, the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]].

Most of the early opponents of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism in the United States subscribed to the [[American School (economics)|American School]]. This school of thought was inspired by the ideas of Hamilton, who proposed the creation of a [[First Bank of the United States|government-sponsored bank]] and increased tariffs to favor Northern industrial interests. Following Hamilton's death, the more abiding [[Protectionism|protectionist]] influence in the antebellum period came from [[Henry Clay]] and his ''[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]''.

In the early 19th century, "it is quite clear that the ''laissez-faire'' label is an inappropriate one" to apply to the relationship between the United States government and industry.&lt;ref name="Prince Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prince|first1=Carl E.|last2=Taylor|first2=Seth|year=1982|title=Daniel Webster, the Boston Associates, and the U.S. Government's Role in the Industrializing Process, 1815–1830|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|volume=2|issue=3|pages=283–99|jstor=3122975|doi=10.2307/3122975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century, the United States followed the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] tradition of [[economic nationalism]], which included increased state control, regulation and [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] development of [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=guelzo&gt;{{cite book|first=Allen C.|last=Guelzo|title=Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President|isbn=0-8028-3872-3|year=1999|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=99466893|publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public works]] such as the provision and regulation [[transportation]] such as railroads took effect. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] provided the development of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]].&lt;ref name="guelzo"/&gt; In order to help pay for its war effort in the [[American Civil War]], the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] imposed its first personal [[income tax]] on August 5, 1861 as part of the [[Revenue Act of 1861]] (3% of all incomes over US $800; rescinded in 1872).

Following the Civil War, the movement towards a [[mixed economy]] accelerated. Protectionism increased with the [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890 and the [[Dingley Tariff]] of 1897. [[Government regulation]] of the economy expanded with the enactment of the [[Interstate Commerce Act of 1887]] and the [[Sherman Anti-trust Act]].

The [[Progressive Era]] saw the enactment of more controls on the economy as evidenced by the [[Woodrow Wilson]] administration's [[The New Freedom|New Freedom]] program.

Following [[World War I]] and the [[Great Depression]], the United States turned to a mixed economy which combined [[free enterprise]] with a [[Progressive tax|progressive income tax]] and in which from time to time the government stepped in to support and protect American industry from competition from overseas. For example, in the 1980s the government sought to protect the automobile industry by "voluntary" export restrictions from [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert W.

Nivola wrote in 1986:{{quote|By and large, the comparative strength of the dollar against major foreign currencies has reflected high U.S. interest rates driven by huge federal budget deficits. Hence, the source of much of the current deterioration of trade is not the general state of the economy, but rather the government's mix of fiscal and monetary policies – that is, the problematic juxtaposition of bold tax reductions, relatively tight monetary targets, generous military outlays, and only modest cuts in major entitlement programs. Put simply, the roots of the trade problem and of the resurgent protectionism it has fomented are fundamentally political as well as economic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pietro S.

A more recent advocate of total ''laissez-faire'' has been [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] [[Ayn Rand]], who described it as "the abolition of any and all forms of government intervention in production and trade, the separation of State and Economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of Church and State".&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal,'' Ch. 7, New American Library, Signet, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the "Iron Law of Regulation", which states that all government economic regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=J.

==Raw capitalism==
A closely related conception is that of raw/pure capitalism or unrestrained capitalism that refers to capitalism free of social [[regulation]]s,&lt;ref name="capfree"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolan|first1=Peter|title=Capitalism and Freedom: The Contradictory Character of Globalisation|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9781843312826|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQdQDJzOkBMC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with low, minimal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orchard|first1=Lionel|last2=Stretton|first2=Hugh|title=Public Goods, Public Enterprise, Public Choice: Theoretical Foundations of the Contemporary Attack on Government|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349235056|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwW_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or no government and operating almost entirely on the [[profit motive]]. Other than ''laissez-faire'' economics and [[anarcho-capitalism]] it is not associated with a school of thought and typically has a bad connotation which hints towards a perceived need for restraint due to social needs and securities that can not be adequately responded to by companies with just a motive for making profit.

[[Robert Kuttner]] states that "for over a century, popular struggles in the [[democracies]] have used the [[nation-state]] to temper raw capitalism. The power of voters has offset the power of capital. But as national barriers have come down in the name of freer commerce, so has the capacity of governments to manage capitalism in a broad public interest. So the real issue is not 'trade' but democratic governance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuttner|first1=Robert|title=Globalization and Its Critics|url=|publisher=The American Prospect|accessdate=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main issues of raw capitalism are said to lie in its disregard for quality, [[durability]], [[sustainability]], respect for the [[Environmental protection|environment]] and human beings as well as a lack of [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerckhove|first1=Gilbert Van|title=Toxic Capitalism: The Orgy of Consumerism and Waste: Are We the Last Generation on Earth?|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781477219065|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POefWmtaZcgC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this more critical angle, companies might (naturally) aim to "maximise profits" at the expense of workers' and broader social interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Müntefering's criticism of raw capitalism strikes a chord|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6af06832-bdda-11d9-87aa-00000e2511c8.html|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=9 February 2017}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
{{Further|Criticism of capitalism}}
Over the years, a number of economists have offered critiques of ''laissez-faire'' economics.

[[Adam Smith]] acknowledges deep moral ambiguities towards the system of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"&gt;Spencer J. Pack. Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy. Great Britain: Edward Elgar, 2010. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Smith had severe misgivings concerning some aspects of each of the major character-types produced by modern capitalist society: the landlords, the workers and the capitalists.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt; Smith claimed "[t]he landlords' role in the economic process is passive. Their ability to reap a revenue solely from ownership of land tends to make them indolent and inept, and so they tend to be unable to even look after their own economic interests"&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt; and that "[t]he increase in population should increase the demand for food, which should increase rents, which should be economically beneficial to the landlords". According to Smith, the landlords should thus be in favour of policies which contribute to the growth in the wealth of nations. Unfortunately, they often are not in favour of these pro-growth policies because of their own indolent-induced ignorance and intellectual flabbiness.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt;

The British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] condemned ''laissez-faire'' economic policy on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Dostaler, Gilles, ''Keynes and His Battles'' (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2007), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The End of Laissez-faire'' (1926), one of the most famous of his critiques, Keynes argues that the doctrines of ''laissez-faire'' are dependent to some extent on improper deductive reasoning and Keynes says the question of whether a market solution or state intervention is better must be determined on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;Dostaler 2007, p. 91; Barnett, Vincent, ''John Maynard Keynes'' (Routledge, 2013), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austrian School|Austrian economist]] [[Friedrich Hayek]] stated that a freely competitive, ''laissez-faire'' banking industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and pro-cyclical. He stated that the need for [[central banking]] control was inescapable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Lawrence H.|title=Why Didn't Hayek Favor Laissez Faire in Banking?|journal=History of Political Economy|year=1999|volume=31|issue=4|url=http://cameroneconomics.com/white-hayek-hope.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2013|doi=10.1215/00182702-31-4-753|pages=753–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Indian National Congress sidebar}} 
Since [[India]] gained [[Indian independence movement|independence]] in 1947, the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) has seen a steady number of splits and breakaway factions. Some of the breakaway organisations have thrived as [[Independent (politician)|independent]] parties, some have become [[wikt:Defunct|defunct]], while others have merged with the parent party or other [[List of political parties in India|political parties]].

'''Minority''' ({{lang-fr|minorité}}) is a philosophical concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their books ''Kafka: Towards a Minor Literature'' (1975), ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980), and elsewhere. In these texts, they criticize the concept of "[[majority]]".  For Deleuze and Guattari, "[[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]]-minor(itarian)" is primarily an [[ethic]]al action, one of the becomings one is [[affect (philosophy)|affected]] by when avoiding "becoming-fascist". They argued further that the concept of a "[[people]]", when invoked by subordinate groups or those aligned with them, always refers to a minority, whatever its numerical power might be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Concept of Minority for the Study of Culture| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Rimi | last2= Khan | journal=Continuum: Journal for Media and Cultural Studies  | volume= 31 | issue= 1 | pages= 3–4 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31725889/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Deleuze and Guattari the "minor" and "becoming-minority" does not refer to minority groups as described in ordinary language.  Minority groups are defined by identities and are thus '''molar configurations'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; belonging to the majoritarian State machine. (Molar configurations are composed of infinite lines of particles, i.e. lines of becoming.)&lt;ref&gt;Charles Stivale, ''Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts'' (Routledge, 2014), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Deleuze and Guattari's central example here is [[Franz Kafka]]. Kafka finds himself at home among neither the [[Prague]] Jews nor the dominant German and Austria-Hungarian power structure.  For him a "people is missing" and his literature sets out to summon that people.  Nonetheless, there is a connection between what are ordinarily referred to as "minorities" and Deleuze and Guattari's conception of the minor and becoming-minor.  If becoming-minor often occurs in the context of what are ordinarily called [[minority group]]s, then this is because, Deleuze and Guattari argue, becoming-minor is catalyzed by existence in cramped social spaces.  The key point not to be missed is that becoming-minor is not related to molar identities, nor is it a politics that seeks representation or recognition of such identities (though Deleuze and Guattari stress that these are worthwhile political ambitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Concept of Minority for the Study of Culture| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Rimi | last2= Khan | journal=Continuum: Journal for Media and Cultural Studies  | volume= 31 | issue= 1 | pages= 1–12 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31725889/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The example of [[patriarchy]] provides an illustration of how the concept of "minority" is used: while there may be more women than men numerically, in Deleuze and Guattari's terms, which are sensitive to relations of power, men still constitute the majority whereas women form a minority. Thus the concept of "becoming-minor" converges with that of "becoming-woman" (as they say, "everyone has to 'become-woman', even women..."), "becoming-animal", "becoming-molecular", "becoming-imperceptible" and ultimately, "becoming-revolutionary". Each type of affective becoming marks a new phase of a larger process that Deleuze and Guattari call [[deterritorialization]].

{{voting}}
"'''None of the above'''", or '''NOTA''' for short, also known as "'''against all'''" or a "'''scratch'''" vote, is a [[ballot]] option in some [[jurisdiction]]s or [[organization]]s, designed to allow the voter to indicate disapproval of the candidates in a [[voting system]]. It is based on the principle that [[consent]] requires the ability to withhold consent in an election, just as they can by voting "No" on [[referendum|ballot questions]].

Entities that include "None of the Above" on ballots as standard procedure include [[India]] ("None of the above"), [[Greece]] (λευκό, white), the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]] ([[None of These Candidates]]), [[Ukraine]] (''Проти всіх'','' "against all"''), [[Spain]] (''voto en blanco'', "white vote"), and [[Colombia]] (''voto en blanco''). [[Russia]] had such an option on its ballots (''Против всех,'' "against all") until it was abolished in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/12773 |title=Russians Divided Over Electoral Reforms: Angus Reid Global Monitor |publisher=Angus-reid.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906002157/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/12773|archivedate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bangladesh]] introduced this option (''না ভোট''&lt;!---This needs an English translation---&gt;) in 2008.&lt;ref name=bd&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangladesh amends election law incorporating 'no' vote option|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-07-14/rest-of-world/27918086_1_general-elections-votes-amendment|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=Jul 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan introduced this option on ballot papers for the [[Pakistani general election, 2013|2013 Pakistan elections]], but the [[Election Commission of Pakistan]] later rejected it.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/530557/none-of-the-above-vote-to-be-added-to-ballots-ecp/ |title='None of the above' vote to be added to ballots: ECP - The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Bulgarian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], [[Bulgaria]] introduced a 'none of the above' option, which received 5.59% of the vote in the first round and 4.47% in the run-off.

When "None of the Above" is listed on a ballot, there is the possibility of NOTA receiving a [[majority]] or [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the vote, and so "winning" the election. In such a case, a variety of formal procedures may be invoked, including having the office remain vacant, having the office filled by appointment, re-opening [[nomination]]s or holding another election (in a body operating under [[parliamentary procedure]]), or it may have no effect whatsoever, as in India and the US state of Nevada, where the next highest total wins regardless.

==Soviet Union==
In the 1990 elections that led to the [[break-up of the Soviet Union]], the Soviet version of "none of above" led to new elections with new candidates in 200 races of the 1,500-seat [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies]].&lt;ref name=JFund /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arunachaltimes.in/wordpress/2013/10/09/nota-voting/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923174514/http://www.arunachaltimes.in/wordpress/2013/10/09/nota-voting/ |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 incumbents representing the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] were defeated in the run-off, leading to [[Boris Yeltsin]] to later say the "none of the above" option "helped convince the people they had real power even in a rigged election, and [it] played a role in building true democracy."&lt;ref name=JFund /&gt;

==Spain==

===Blank ballot===
Due to the Spanish voting regulations (''[[:es:Legislación electoral española|legislación electoral española]]''), {{es icon}} the blank ballot is recognized as 'none of the above' (''voto en blanco'') but has very little chance to influence the distribution of seats within a democratic election. It is mostly considered as a statistical indicator of candidatures' disapproval. The blank ballots only increase the amount of valid votes, raising the threshold of votes (3% and 5% depending on the election) which every political party has to overcome to be fully considered. The parties over the threshold get their seats according to the [[D'Hondt method]].

"Blank Seats" ran for the Congress and Senate elections of 20 November 2011. Its programme is to leave empty the corresponding assigned seats by not taking full possession of their duties as congressperson, senator, etc. According to law, the seat remains assigned to the elected candidate until the possession act takes place, the elected candidate explicitly refuses or new elections are called. In this way, the political party and its candidates stay free from obligations and are not entitled to receive any money from the public funding scheme for politics.

By voting such option at the local elections in May 2011, the citizens of the villages of Gironella (Barcelona) and Foixà (Girona) were able to reduce the number of politicians in their councils by one and two respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-escons-blanc-dejara-tres-concejalias-vacias-catalunya-20110608174059.html |title=Escons en Blanc dejará tres concejalías vacías en Catalunya |language=es |website=Europapress.es |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Empar Moliner |url=http://www.ara.cat/especials/eleccions22m/Escons-Blanc-aconsegueix-consistoris-catalans_0_486551938.html |title=Escons en Blanc aconsegueix que tres cadires quedin buides als consistoris catalans |website=Ara.cat |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, citizenship supported Blank Seats at different municipalities, including Barcelona, with 15,582 votes (averaging 1.71% of valid votes).

The [[Ciudadanos En Blanco]] (Citizens for Blank Votes) party aims to give blank ballots the meaning of representing empty seats if the votes indicate so as for any other party, disbanding the party when such law would be approved.

==United States==
The origins of the ballot option "None of the Above" in the United States can be traced to when the State of Nevada adopted "[[None of These Candidates]]" as a ballot option in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/none-of-the-above-ballot_n_3576469.html|title='None Of The Above' Ballot Option In Nevada Upheld By Federal Appeals Court|date=2015-11-25|access-date=2016-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125044018/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/none-of-the-above-ballot_n_3576469.html |archivedate=25 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1998 in California, citizen proponents of Proposition 23, titled the "None of the Above Act", qualified a new State ballot initiative through circulated petitions submitted to the Secretary of State,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=None of the Above Act|url=http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1945&amp;context=ca_ballot_inits|website=University of California, Hastings|publisher=UC Hastings|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the measure was defeated in the March 2000 general election 64% to 36%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 23 election results|url=https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_23,_the_%22None_of_the_Above%22_Act_(2000)|website=BallotPedia|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Were it to be passed by the voters, it was meant to require this new ballot option for all state and federal elective offices, exempting only local judicial races; in determining official election results, the "none of the above" voter tally would be discarded in favor of the candidate with the greatest number of votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/initiatives-by-title-and-summary-year.pdf |format=PDF |title=INITIATIVES BY TITLE AND SUMMARY YEAR |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2016-05-07 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907193230/http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/initiatives-by-title-and-summary-year.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No similar options were known to have been permitted, much less approved, on any other state levels, least of all the federal level, as of the middle of August 2016.

The [[Election Commission of India]] told the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] in 2009 that it wished to offer the voter a "none of the above" option on ballots, which the government had generally opposed.&lt;ref name=ibn&gt;{{cite web |last=Bagriya |first=Ashok |title=EC suggests 'none of the above' option on the ballot |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/indiaelections/2009/04/2009418114915169787.html |publisher=IBN Live |date= 29 January 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]], a [[non-governmental organisation]], filed a [[public-interest litigation (India)|public-interest litigation]] statement in support of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sorabjee|first=Soli J.|title=Right of negative voting|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/right-of-negative-voting/429335/|accessdate=27 September 2013|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indonesia==
[[File:Tangerang Sample Ballot 2018.jpg|A sample ballot for the uncontested 2018 mayoral elections in [[Tangerang]].|thumb]]
The Indonesian Law 10 of 2016 regulates local elections, and includes provisions for elections in which there is only one candidate. In such cases, the candidate contests the election against a NOTA option (commonly referred to as ''kotak kosong''/empty box), and is declared the winner if they manage to secure a majority of the valid votes. Otherwise, the election will be postponed to the next occurrence; the government of Indonesia appoints an acting office holder until the new election, in which the losing candidate is eligible to stand again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UU Nomor 10 Tahun 2016|url=http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/public/content/jdih/UU_Nomor_10_Tahun_2016.pdf|publisher=Constitutional Court of Indonesia|accessdate=4 May 2018|page=26|language=id|quote=KPU Provinsi atau KPU Kabupaten/Kota menetapkan pasangan calon terpilih pada Pemilihan 1 (satu) pasangan calon sebagaimana dimaksud dalam Pasal 54C, jika mendapatkan suara lebih dari 50% (lima puluh persen) dari suara sah.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
UK electoral counting procedures require that all votes be counted and announced, including 'rejected' votes. 'Rejected votes' are classified into four categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Electoral Commission guide on 'Dealing with doubtful ballot papers'|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/87699/UKPE-doubtfuls-booklet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; protest votes are recorded with others rejected as 'voter's intention uncertain'.

===NOTA UK===
NOTA UK is a voluntary organisation set up in 2010 to campaign for a formal None Of The Above (NOTA) option to be added to ballot papers for all future UK elections. It has made numerous written evidence submissions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/political-and-constitutional-reform-committee/consultation-on-a-new-magna-carta/written/15588.html |title=Written evidence submitted by NOTA UK (AMC 49) |website=Data.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the parliamentary Political &amp; Constitutional Reform Committee (PCRC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/political-and-constitutional-reform-committee/inquiries/ |title=Political and Constitutional Reform Committee - Inquiries - UK Parliament |website=Parliament.uk |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the case for NOTA 'with teeth' i.e.: formalised consequences for the election result in the event of a NOTA 'win' (as opposed to 'faux' NOTA, whereby the next placed candidate takes office anyway as happens in India and elsewhere). As a result of these representations, the PCRC explicitly recommended in its final report on 'voter engagement', published February 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nota-uk.org/2015/02/05/the-nota-campaign-gets-a-massive-boost-from-parliamentary-select-committee |title=NOTA campaign gets massive boost from parliamentary select committee! &amp;#124; None of the Above UK |website=Nota-uk.org |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the next UK government should hold a public consultation before May 2016 solely on inclusion of NOTA on UK ballot papers. This in turn has led to increased support for and awareness of NOTA UK's campaign and its founder, recording artist and music producer [[Jamie Stanley]] (aka: Mailman), being asked to give a number of media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdiG9tCq-BU |title=None of the above campaign is 'essential to the concept of democracy' - Jamie Stanley |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-02-16 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; No public consultation materialised as the incoming Conservative government scrapped the PCRC, effectively disregarding all of its recommendations.

Since 2015, in part thanks to NOTA UK's lobbying, it has been a Green Party of England and Wales policy to get a form of NOTA (RON - Re-Open Nominations) on UK ballot papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nota-uk.org/2015/11/24/getting-nota-ron-on-all-uk-ballot-papers-now-official-green-party-policy/|title=Getting NOTA on UK ballot papers now official Green Party policy!|author=|date=24 November 2015|website=NOTA-UK.org|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to the 2017 UK general election, NOTA UK wrote to the Green party suggesting that they should reword the policy so that, instead of RON, it refers specifically to the more self-explanatory NOTA, and that they should also place the policy centre stage in their next manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nota-uk.org/2017/04/29/open-letter-to-the-green-party-re-ge-2017/|title=Open Letter to the Green Party re: GE 2017|author=|date=29 April 2017|website=NOTA-UK.org|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Above and Beyond Party''' was founded in 2015 and fielded eight candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], none of whom were elected.

[[No Candidate Deserves My Vote!]] was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on 23 November 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=167&amp;frmType=partydetail |work=Electoral Commission |title=No Candidate Deserves My Vote! |access-date=9 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416164111/http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=167&amp;frmType=partydetail |archivedate=16 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The No Candidate Deserves My Vote party's single objective is to introduce a bill to Parliament to have a "none of the above" option added to every local and general election ballot paper of the future. They feel this will allow the UK electorate to exercise their democratic right to vote to say that none of the parties currently represents them, which will encourage their democratic responsibility to turn out to vote. If a candidate wins an election it is the intention to stay as a [[Member of Parliament]] until the change in the law is enacted. Only then will the candidate step down and the party be disbanded.

It is the intention of the party that, if a NOTA gains the majority vote, it should cause an automatic [[by-election]], the idea being that the majority will have given a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in the candidates. If the same candidates stand under the same policies, then the electorate simply votes NOTA until the candidates change their policies to something that the electorate can vote for.

In 2010, Stephen Phillips of [[Stevenage]] ran for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|UK general election]] on behalf of No Candidate Deserves My Vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steveofstevenage.org.uk ]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323011710/http://www.steveofstevenage.org.uk/ |date=23 March 2010 }} Steve of Stevenage&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips received 327 votes, or 0.7% of the vote, placing 7th out of 9 candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/election2010/results/constituency/e43.stm |title=Election 2010 &amp;#124; Constituency &amp;#124; Stevenage |publisher=BBC News |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NOTA party===
The NOTA Party, in recent years also known as Notavote, was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on 2 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=867&amp;frmType=partydetail |work=Electoral Commission |title=NOTA |accessdate=2009-07-08 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the intention of the NOTA party to field candidates in every UK parliamentary constituency. The respective NOTA candidates would not have continued in office had they received the most votes, this was merely a mechanism to simulate the recording of a formal NOTA vote. The party was registered as 'NOTA' and not 'None of the Above' as the latter is a prohibited expression regarding registration as a party name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/147/made |title=Registration of Political Parties (Prohibited Words and Expressions) (Amendment) Order 2005 |website=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent attempt to re-register the NOTA party in 2014 was blocked by the Electoral Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notauk.org/2014/11/08/nota-banned-as-party-name-by-electoral-commission/ |title='NOTA' banned as party name by Electoral Commission &amp;#124; None of the Above UK |website=Notauk.org |date=2014-11-08 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the acronym 'NOTA' is as good as the phrase 'None of the Above', the logic being that it would confuse voters into thinking it is possible to cast a formal vote for 'None of the Above' when they would in fact just be voting for another party, albeit one standing on a single issue NOTA platform.

===Zero, None Of the Above===
None Of The Above Zero was a candidate at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] in [[Filton and Bradley Stoke (UK Parliament constituency)|Filton and Bradley Stoke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Others===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|British parliamentary elections of 2010]], a former boxer changed his name by [[deed poll]] from [[Terry Marsh (boxer)|Terry Marsh]] to "None Of The Above X", in order to run as a parliamentary candidate under that name in the constituency of [[South Basildon and East Thurrock (UK Parliament constituency)|South Basildon and East Thurrock]]. Claiming that he will not take the seat if he wins, he told BBC Essex: "I don't take it for one moment that it would be a vote for me. [..] I'm doing what I think the Electoral Commission should be doing and what should be on every ballot paper in any electoral process." BBC News reported that, while the Registration of Political Parties (Prohibited Words and Expressions) (Amendment) Order 2005 stipulates that no political party can be registered in the UK under the name "None of the Above", there is no legislation against a person changing their name by deed poll and appearing on the ballot paper as "None Of the Above".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/essex/8639348.stm Basildon boxer to fight election as 'None Of The Above'], BBC News, (27 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In the event he polled 0.3% of the vote, the lowest of any candidate standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/e08.stm |work=BBC News |title=BBC NEWS – Election 2010 – Basildon South &amp; Thurrock East}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another individual changed his name by deed poll to ''None Of The Above'' in order to stand as a candidate in [[Chingford and Woodford Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford and Woodford Green]] in 2010. With the surname ''Above'', he was listed first on the ballot paper in alphabetical order, with all the other candidates listed below.
* The [[South Wales]] Anarchists group has run a campaign urging people to "Vote Nobody" since 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southwalesanarchists.org/ |title=South Wales Anarchists |publisher=South Wales Anarchists |date=2009-05-08 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups worldwide have promoted similar slogans.
* The Landless Peasant Party, which advocates the ownership of land by those who live on it and the replacement of income tax by a flat land tax,&lt;ref name="Landlesspeasants.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://landlesspeasants.org/?p=158 |title=Election Manifesto 2010 / Landless Peasant Party |publisher=Landlesspeasants.org |date=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712004008/http://landlesspeasants.org/?p=158 |archivedate=12 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose leader Derek Jackson gained publicity for standing against then- Prime Minister Gordon Brown in his home constituency in the 2010 elections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/election/825018-the-man-with-his-fist-up-behind-gordon-brown-becomes-a-facebook-hit |title=General Election 2010: Derek Jackson, the man with his fist up behind Gordon Brown, becomes a Facebook hit |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=2010-05-07 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; include a pledge to add a "None of the above" option to the ballot in all UK elections.&lt;ref name="Landlesspeasants.org"/&gt;

==Canada==
No electoral jurisdiction in Canada formally lists "none of the above" as a ballot option. However, in some provincial elections it is effectively possible to vote for "none of the above", by attending the polling station and formally "declining to vote".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arpacanada.ca/index.php/issuesresearch/canadian-politics/111-voting-for-none-of-the-above |title=Voting for none of the above |publisher=Arpacanada.ca |date=2007-11-08 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These declined votes are actually counted and become part of the electoral record.

A businessman in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]], [[British Columbia]] ran in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]] in the district of [[Prince George—Bulkley Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/HFER/hfer.asp?Language=E&amp;Search=Gres&amp;genElection=36&amp;ridProvince=2&amp;submit1=Search |title=History of Federal Ridings since 1867 |website=Parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the name Zznoneoff, Thea Bove (Thea Bove Zznoneoff); ballots listing candidates alphabetically by surname, he appeared at the bottom. He came sixth of seven candidates with 0.977 percent of votes cast.

A resident of [[Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], formerly known as Sheldon Bergson, has legally changed his name to "Above Znoneofthe",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vote-none-of-the-above-byelection-1.3426783 "Voters can pick 'none of the above' thanks to this Whitby-Oshawa byelection candidate"]. [[CBC News]] Toronto, January 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and has registered under that name as a candidate in several provincial and federal [[by-election]]s, most recently the [[By-elections to the 42nd Canadian Parliament#Markham.E2.80.94Thornhill|Markham—Thornhill]] by-election of March 3, 2017. His name order was chosen so that his name would always appear at the bottom of the ballot as "Znoneofthe, Above", although this only works federally as provincial election ballots do not list the candidates in surname order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/meet-above-znoneofthe-the-fringe-candidate-who-keeps-running-in-ontario-by-elections "Meet Above Znoneofthe, the fringe candidate who keeps running in Ontario by-elections"]. ''[[National Post]]'', November 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ontario, the [[None of the Above Party of Ontario]] is a registered political party, although its stated mandate is for its candidates to serve in the legislature as [[independent (politics)|independent]] representatives who reflect the views and interests of their constituents, rather than simply as a "reject all of the candidates" placeholder.

==Norway==
The Norwegian election regulation makes it mandatory to present voters with blank ballots in addition to all of the approved parties and election lists. In the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2013|parliamentary election of 2013]], 12874 votes, which is 0.45% of the total votes given, were blank.

==None of the Above candidates and parties in other countries==
* In [[Serbia]], None of the above (Ниједан од понуђених одговора, НОПО) is a parliamentary political party, legally formed in 2010, which was mostly popularized on [[Facebook]] and less on other social networking websites. In [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2012]] they received 22,905 votes, and thus won one seat in the [[National Assembly of Serbia]].
* Geoff Richardson changed his full name to "Of The Above None" and stood as an independent for the seat of [[Division of Gilmore|Gilmore]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 Australian federal election]]. His name appeared as NONE, Of the Above on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noneoftheabove.com.au/about.htm |title=About |publisher=None Of The Above |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218052948/http://noneoftheabove.com.au/about.htm |archivedate=18 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010]], a candidate Vasiliy Humeniuk changed his name to [[Vasily Protyvsih]] (Vasily Against-all). "Against all candidates" is the name of the "none of the above" vote used in Russia and Ukraine.&lt;ref name=Pres&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/24082/ CEC registers two more candidates for Ukraine's president] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109000658/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/24082/ |date=9 November 2009 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (November 6, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/53257/ Three candidates united by disgust with authorities], [[Kyiv Post]] (November 19, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2000, [[Michael Moore]] advocated a [[write-in candidate]] '''Ficus (the plant) for Congress''' as a unified vote for ''none of the above'' in congressional seats where the incumbent was running unopposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news2000/0426-09.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119080414/http://www.commondreams.org/news2000/0426-09.htm |archivedate=19 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* David Gatchell of [[Tennessee]] ran for [[Tennessee gubernatorial election, 2002|governor in 2002]] and for [[Tennessee United States Senate election, 2006|Senate in 2006]] as a protest, officially changing his middle name from Leroy to None of the Above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060720/NEWS0206/607200385]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he got 3,738 votes (0.2 percent).
* For the [[Pakistani general election, 2013|2013 Pakistani general election]], the [[Election Commission of Pakistan]] unilaterally decided that a 'none of the above' box would be available as a voting option on ballot papers.&lt;ref name="tribune" /&gt; However, they subsequently decided against it owing to the short amount of time remaining till the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/531463/ecp-decides-against-introducing-none-of-the-above-vote/ |title=ECP decides against introducing 'none of the above' vote - The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was suggested to the Election Commission by Abid Hassan Manto, a constitutional expert and a senior lawyer of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Effective legislation proposed to ensure transparency in general elections|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/498106/effective-legislation-proposed-to-ensure-transparency-in-general-elections/|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=Express Tribune|date=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elections in South Ossetia]] have an "against all" option.

==Procedures that function like "none of the above"==
Most ballots do not have a formal "none of the above" option, but do have procedures that work in a similar way.

=== Argentina ===

In Argentina casting an envelope without a ballot in a [[ballot box]] counts as a blank vote.

===Poland===
In [[Polish legislative election, 1989|1989 legislative election in Poland]] voters were able to vote against the only candidate running, often from the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party]] by crossing out the candidate's name on the ballot.&lt;ref name=JFund&gt;{{cite news|last=Fund|first=John|title='None of the Above' Should Be on the Ballot|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/316376/none-above-should-be-ballot-john-fund|accessdate=12 September 2012|newspaper=National Review|date=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, voters defeated the sitting prime minister and dozens of leading Communists because they failed to get the required majority.&lt;ref name=JFund /&gt;

===Re-open Nominations (RON)===
Many students' unions in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Hoscik |url=http://www.mayorwatch.co.uk/caroline-pidgeon-named-as-sole-liberal-democrat-mayoral-hopeful/ |title=Caroline Pidgeon named as sole Liberal Democrat mayoral hopeful — MayorWatch |publisher=Mayorwatch.co.uk |date=2015-08-19 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; use a similar ballot option called 're-open nominations' (RON)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mvcwestsussex.org.uk/glossary.html#RON |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921194115/http://www.mvcwestsussex.org.uk/glossary.html#RON |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-21 |title=Make Votes Count In West Sussex |publisher=Mvcwestsussex.org.uk |date=2006-03-20 |accessdate=2010-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[instant-runoff voting|IRV]] and [[single transferable vote]] (STV) elections. These include the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[University College Dublin Students' Union|UCD Student's Union]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The difference is that RON is a vote against all candidates in FPTP ([[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]]) and all subsequent candidates in an IRV or STV election.


RON is not strictly a '''none of the above''' candidate in transferable vote elections, as when RON is eliminated during the count its votes are transferred to other candidates if those preferences exist.

===Illegal ballots in ''Robert's Rules of Order''===
The American ''[[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised (RONR)]]'' describes various forms of illegal ballots, which are ballots which do not count for any candidate. Blanks are treated as "scrap paper", and are of no effect, but "unintelligible ballots or ballots cast for an unidentifiable candidate or a fictional character are treated as illegal votes. All illegal votes cast by legal voters… are taken into account in determining the number of votes cast for purposes of computing the majority." RONR always requires a majority for election; thus, casting an illegal ballot or one for a hopeless candidate, whether on the ballot or as a write-in, is equivalent to voting No for all other candidates. "The principle is that a choice has no mandate from the voting body unless approval is expressed by more than half of those entitled to vote and registering any evidence of having some opinion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl |title= RONR|edition= 11th|year= 2011|pages= 415-416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.robertsrules.com/interp_list.html#2006_5 |title= RONR Official Interpretations: 2006-5: Ballot Elections: Voting "No" or "None of the Above" |date= |access-date= |website= The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site |publisher= The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
* In the film ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]],'' the protagonist Brewster (played by [[Richard Pryor]]) is required, under certain conditions, to spend 30 million dollars in 30 days. He joins the race for Mayor of [[New York City]] and throws most of his money at a protest campaign urging a vote for None of the Above. The two major candidates sue Brewster for his confrontational rhetoric, leading to a massive settlement which of course furthers their competitor's goal. Brewster is forced to end his campaign when he learns that he is leading in the polls as a write-in candidate and has to publicly announce that he if he won the mayoralty he wants to decline it but is surprised his "None of the Above" campaign became so popular. Neither candidate wins the election, and a new election with different candidates must be held.
* In the sixth-season episode of ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers|Captain Planet]]'' called "Dirty Politics" three of the Eco-Villains are running for president and kidnap the fourth candidate, who is the most popular. Despite this over seventy percent vote None of the Above resulting in the need for a new election.
* [[L. Neil Smith]]'s novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' has an [[alternate history]] in which the [[United States]] becomes a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] state after a successful [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and the overthrowing and execution of [[George Washington]] by firing squad for treason in 1794, where None of the Above (which is always an option on the ballot){{page needed|date=November 2016}} has received the most votes for President of the [[North American Confederacy]] on two occasions. The first time was in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], defeating Lucy Kropotkin and would serve until 1972 as the NAC's 24th President. The second time was in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and again in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] and being elected "President for Life" in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]], serving as the 28th President.
* [[Wavy Gravy]] has run a "[[Nobody for President]]" campaign during several different election years in the United States.

{{distinguish|pacifism}}
'''Pacificism''' is the general term for [[ethical]] opposition to [[violence]] or [[war]], except in cases where force is deemed absolutely necessary to advance the cause of [[peace]].

It falls between [[pacifism]], which usually states that killing, violence or war is unconditionally wrong in all cases, and [[defensivism]], which accepts all ''defensive'' wars and acts of deterrence as morally just.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.westernherald.com/media/storage/paper881/news/2002/10/10/Opinion/Pacifism.Cannot.Hold.Up.Under.Scrutiny-2127363.shtml Western Herald - Pacifism cannot hold up under scrutiny] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629055802/http://media.www.westernherald.com/media/storage/paper881/news/2002/10/10/Opinion/Pacifism.Cannot.Hold.Up.Under.Scrutiny-2127363.shtml |date=2008-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacificism states that war can only ever be considered as a firm "last resort", condemning both [[aggression]] and [[militarism]]. In the 1940s, the two terms were not conceptually distinguished and pacificism was considered merely as an archaic spelling, although less 'barbarous' than the more common and shorter form.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite magazine

The distinct theory was first put forward by [[A. J. P. Taylor]] in ''The Trouble-Makers'' (1957)&lt;ref&gt;‘By ‘pacificism’ I mean the advocacy of a peaceful policy; by ‘pacifism’ (a word invented only in the twentieth century) the doctrine of non-resistance. The latter is the negation of policy, not an alternative, and therefore irrelevant to my theme. Hence my disregard for the Peace Societies.’  AJP Taylor, ''The Trouble-Makers'', London: H Hamilton, 1957, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently defined by Martin Ceadel in his 1987 book, ''Thinking About Peace and War''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/pacifism.htm#SH2c Pacifism - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/peaceed/pe_debate.html Pledge Peace Union - Debating Peace and War]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also discussed in detail in [[Richard Norman]]'s book: ''Ethics, Killing and War''.

The largest national peace association in history, the British [[League of Nations Union]], was pacificist rather than pacifist in orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Birn, ''The League of Nations Union'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the majority of peace activists have been pacificists rather than strict pacifists.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ceadel, ''Semi Detached Idealists: The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854-1945'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pacifism''' is opposition to [[war]], [[militarism]], or [[violence]]. The word ''pacifism'' was coined by the French peace campaigner [[Émile Arnaud]] (1864–1921) and adopted by other peace activists at the tenth Universal Peace Congress in [[Glasgow]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;''The Abolition of War: the Peace Movement in Britain, 1914–1919'' by [[Keith Robbins]]. University of Wales Press, 1976. {{ISBN|978-0-7083-0622-2}} (p.10).&lt;/ref&gt; A related term is ''[[ahimsa]]'' (to do no harm), which is a core philosophy in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. While modern connotations are recent, having been explicated since the 19th century, ancient references abound.

In modern times, interest was revived by [[Leo Tolstoy]] in his late works, particularly in ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]''. [[Mohandas Gandhi]] (1869–1948) propounded the practice of steadfast [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent opposition]] which he called "[[satyagraha]]", instrumental in its role in the [[Indian Independence Movement]]. Its effectiveness served as inspiration to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], [[James Bevel]],&lt;ref&gt;James L. Bevel, The Strategist of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement" by Randy Kryn, a paper in [[David Garrow]]'s 1989 book ''We Shall Overcome, Volume II'', Carlson Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]&lt;ref name="aavw.org"&gt;"Searching for the Enemy of Man", in Nhat Nanh, Ho Huu Tuong, Tam Ich, Bui Giang, Pham Cong Thien. ''Dialogue''. Saigon: La Boi, 1965. P.&amp;nbsp;11–20., archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website, [http://www.aavw.org/protest/king_journey_abstract09.html King's Journey: 1964 - April 4, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt; and many others in the [[civil rights movement]].

== Definition ==
Pacifism covers a spectrum of views, including the belief that international disputes can and should be peacefully resolved, calls for the abolition of the institutions of the military and war, opposition to any organization of society through governmental force ([[anarcho-pacifism|anarchist or libertarian pacifism]]), rejection of the use of physical violence to obtain political, economic or social goals,  the obliteration of force, and opposition to violence under any circumstance, even defence of self and others. Historians of pacifism [[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]] and Thomas Paul Socknat define pacifism "in the sense generally accepted in English-speaking areas" as "an unconditional rejection of all forms of warfare".&lt;ref&gt;''Challenge to Mars: Essays on Pacifism from 1918 to 1945''. Edited by Brock and Socknat University of Toronto Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8020-4371-2}} (p. ix)&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Jenny Teichman]] defines the main form of pacifism as "anti-warism", the rejection of all forms of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism and the Just War: A Study in Applied Philosophy'' by Jenny Teichman. Basil Blackwell, 1986
{{ISBN|0-631-15056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teichman's beliefs have been summarized by [[Brian Orend]] as "...&amp;nbsp;A pacifist rejects war and believes there are no moral grounds which can justify resorting to war. War, for the pacifist, is always wrong." In a sense the philosophy is based on the idea that the ends do not justify the means.&lt;ref&gt;''War and International Justice: a Kantian perspective'' by Brian Orend. Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-88920-337-7}} p.&amp;nbsp;145–6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral considerations ===

[[File:Pacifista Arresto.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti-war activist arrested in [[San Francisco]] during the March 2003 protests against the war in [[Iraq]]]]
Pacifism may be based on [[morality|moral]] principles (a [[deontological]] view) or [[pragmatism]] (a [[consequentialist]] view). Principled pacifism holds that at some point along the spectrum from war to interpersonal physical violence, such violence becomes morally wrong. Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and interpersonal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found. Pacifists generally reject theories of [[Just War]].

=== Nonviolence ===
Some pacifists follow principles of [[nonviolence]], believing that nonviolent action is morally superior and/or most effective. Some however, support physical violence for emergency defence of self or others. Others support [[property damage|destruction of property]] in such emergencies or for conducting symbolic acts of resistance like pouring red paint to represent blood on the outside of military recruiting offices or entering air force bases and hammering on military aircraft.

Not all [[nonviolent resistance]] (sometimes also called [[civil resistance]]) is based on a fundamental rejection of all violence in all circumstances. Many leaders and participants in such movements, while recognizing the importance of using non-violent methods in particular circumstances, have not been absolute pacifists. Sometimes, as with the civil rights movement's march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, they have called for armed protection. The interconnections between civil resistance and factors of force are numerous and complex.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]. Includes chapters by specialists on the various movements.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute pacifism===

An absolute pacifist is generally described by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] as one who believes that human life is so valuable, that a human should never be killed and war should never be conducted, even in self-defense. The principle is described as difficult to abide by consistently, due to violence not being available as a tool to aid a person who is being harmed or killed. It is further claimed that such a pacifist could logically argue that violence leads to more undesirable results than non-violence.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|authorlink1=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815030756/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/war/against/pacifism_1.shtml|title=Ethics - War: Pacifism|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/war/against/pacifism_1.shtml|website=BBC|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police actions and national liberation==
Although all pacifists are opposed to war between [[nation states]], there have been occasions where pacifists have supported military conflict in the case of [[civil war]] or [[revolution]].&lt;ref name="ffw"&gt;"When the American Civil War broke out&amp;nbsp;... both the American Peace Society and many former nonresistants argued that the conflict was not properly war but rather police action on a grand scale" Brock, Peter, ''Freedom from War: Nonsectarian Pacifism, 1814–1914'' University of Toronto Press, 1991 {{ISBN|0-8020-5883-3}}, (p. 176)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, during the [[American Civil War]], both the [[American Peace Society]] and some former members of the [[Non-Resistance Society]] supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]'s military campaign, arguing they were carrying out a "[[police action]]" against the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], whose act of [[Secession]] they regarded as criminal.&lt;ref name="ffw" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Valarie H., ''The Advocates of Peace in Antebellum America''. Mercer University Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-726-2}} (p.158).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], French pacifist [[René Gérin]] (1892–1957) urged support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].&lt;ref name="tpod"&gt;Ingram, Norman. ''The Politics of Dissent : Pacifism in France, 1919–1939''. University of Edinburgh, 1988.  (p. 219)&lt;/ref&gt; Gérin argued that the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish Nationalists]] were "comparable to an individual enemy" and the Republic's war effort was equivalent to the action of a domestic police force suppressing crime.&lt;ref name="tpod"/&gt;

In the 1960s, some pacifists associated with the [[New Left]] supported [[wars of national liberation]] and supported groups such as the [[Viet Cong]] and the Algerian [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]], arguing peaceful attempts to liberate such nations were no longer viable, and war was thus the only option.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century'', by Peter Brock and [[Nigel Young]]. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}}  (p.296)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early traditions of pacifism==
[[File:Apotheosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Vasily Vereshchagin|Vereshchagin]]'s painting ''[[The Apotheosis of War]]'' (1871) came to be admired as one of the earliest artistic expressions of pacifism]]
Advocacy of pacifism can be found far back in history and literature.

===China===
During the [[Warring States period]], the pacifist [[Mohist]] School opposed aggressive war between the feudal states. They took this belief into action by using their famed defensive strategies to defend smaller states from invasion from larger states, hoping to dissuade feudal lords from costly warfare. The [[Seven Military Classics]] of ancient China view warfare negatively, and as a last resort. For example, the ''[[Three Strategies of Huang Shigong]]'' says: "As for the military, it is not an auspicious instrument; it is the way of heaven to despise it", and the ''[[Wei Liaozi]]'' writes: "As for the military, it is an inauspicious instrument; as for conflict and contention, it runs counter to virtue".&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Realism: Strategic Culture and Grand Strategy in Chinese History|first=Alastair I|last=Johnston|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1998|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taoist scripture "''Classic of Great Peace'' (''[[Taiping Jing|Taiping jing]]'')" foretells "the coming Age of Great Peace (''taiping'')."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/daoism.htm#H10 ''Daoist Philosophy'' -- 10. "Celestial Masters Daoism"]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Taiping Jing'' advocates "a world full of peace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaogu.com.cn/upload/200811191348384181.doc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228200813/http://www.kaogu.com.cn/upload/200811191348384181.doc|date=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lemba===
The [[Lemba people|Lemba]] religion of southern French Congo, along with its symbolic herb, is named for pacifism : "''lemba, lemba''" (peace, peace), describes the action of the plant ''lemba-lemba'' (''Brillantaisia patula T. Anders'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Lemba, 1650–1930 | first = John M. | last = Janzen | publisher = Garland Publishing, Inc. | location = New York | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-8240-9306-2 | page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in Cabinda, "''Lemba'' is the spirit of peace, as its name indicates."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Lemba, 1650–1930 | first = John M. | last = Janzen | publisher = Garland Publishing, Inc. | location = New York | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-8240-9306-2 | pages = 303 (8)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moriori===
[[File:Chatham Island Tree Carving.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Moriori tree carving found in the Chatham Islands.]]
The [[Moriori people|Moriori]], of the [[Chatham Islands]], practiced pacifism by order of their ancestor [[Nunuku-whenua]]. This enabled the Moriori to preserve what limited resources they had in their harsh climate, avoiding waste through warfare. In turn, this led to their almost complete annihilation in 1835 by invading [[Ngāti Mutunga]] and [[Ngāti Tama]] [[Māori people|Māori]] from the [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] region of the [[North Island]] of New Zealand. The invading Māori killed, enslaved and [[cannibalism|cannibalised]] the Moriori. A Moriori survivor recalled : "[The Maori] commenced to kill us like sheep&amp;nbsp;... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed - men, women and children indiscriminately."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | title = [[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]] | publisher = W.W. Norton | year = 1997 | location = New York | page = 53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
In [[Ancient Greece]], pacifism seems not to have existed except as a broad moral guideline against violence between individuals. No philosophical program of rejecting violence between states, or rejecting all forms of violence, seems to have existed. Aristophanes, in his play [[Lysistrata]], creates the scenario of an [[Athens|Athenian]] woman's anti-war sex strike during the [[Peloponnesian War]] of 431–404 BC, and the play has gained an international reputation for its anti-war message. Nevertheless, it is both fictional and comical, and though it offers a pragmatic opposition to the destructiveness of war, its message seems to stem from frustration with the existing conflict (then in its twentieth year) rather than from a philosophical position against violence or war. Equally fictional is the nonviolent protest of [[Hegetorides]] of [[Thasos]]. [[Euripides]] also expressed strong anti-war ideas in his work, especially ''[[The Trojan Women]]''.&lt;ref name="fsn"&gt;"Peace, War and Philosophy" by F. S. Northedge, in [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]], ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Volume 6, Collier Macmillan, 1967 (pgs&amp;nbsp;63–67).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
Several Roman writers rejected the militarism of Roman society and gave voice to anti-war sentiments,&lt;ref name="fsn" /&gt;
including [[Propertius]], [[Tibullus]] and [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;''Restless Youth in Ancient Rome'', Emiel Eyben, Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|0-203-16848-8}},  p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Seneca the Younger]] criticised warfare in his book ''[[Naturales quaestiones]]'' (circa 65 AD).&lt;ref&gt;''Panorama of the Classical World'' by Nigel Spivey and Michael Squire. Getty Publications, 2011, {{ISBN|1-60606-056-2}} (p.200).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maximilian of Tebessa]] was a Christian conscientious objector. He was killed for refusing to be conscripted.&lt;ref&gt;''The Riddle of Saint Maximilian of Tebessa'' by Peter Brock. University of Toronto Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{See also|Christian pacifism}}
Throughout history many have understood [[Jesus]] of Nazareth to have been a pacifist,&lt;ref name="weidhorn"&gt;{{Cite journal|  first =Manfred |last = Weidhorn | title = Pacifism Lost | journal = International Journal of Humanities and Peace | year = 2004 | volume = 20|issue = 1|pages = 13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on his [[Sermon on the Mount]]. In the sermon Jesus stated that one should "not resist an evildoer" and promoted his [[turn the other cheek]] philosophy. "If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well&amp;nbsp;... Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Matthew+5 oremus Bible Browser : Matthew 5&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Luke+6 oremus Bible Browser : Luke 6&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aqa"&gt;{{Cite book| title = GCSE Religious Studies for AQA Christianity: Christianity: Behaviour, Attitudes &amp; Lifestyles | first = Joanne | last = Cleave |author2=Geddes, Gordon D. |author3=Griffiths, Jane | publisher = Heinemann Educational Publisher | location = Oxford | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-435-30714-2 | page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The New Testament story is of Jesus, besides preaching these words, surrendering himself freely to an enemy intent on having him killed and proscribing his followers from defending him.

There are those, however, who deny that Jesus was a pacifist&lt;ref name="weidhorn" /&gt; and state that Jesus never said not to fight,&lt;ref name="aqa" /&gt; citing examples from the New Testament. One such instance portrays an angry Jesus driving dishonest market [[Cleansing of the Temple|traders from the temple]].&lt;ref name="aqa" /&gt;  A frequently quoted passage is Luke 22:36: "He said to them, 'But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must [[Sell your cloak and buy a sword|sell his cloak and buy one]].'" Pacifists have typically explained that verse as Jesus fulfilling prophecy, since in the next verse, Jesus continues to say: "It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." Others have interpreted the non-pacifist statements in the New Testament to be related to [[self-defense]] or to be metaphorical and state that on no occasion did Jesus shed blood or urge others to shed blood.&lt;ref name="weidhorn" /&gt;

==Modern history==
[[File:Edward Hicks - Penn's Treaty.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Penn's Treaty with the Indians|Penn's Treaty]] with the Indians. This treaty was never violated.]]
Beginning in the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] gave rise to a variety of new Christian sects, including the [[Peace churches|historic peace churches]]. Foremost among them were the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], and [[Church of the Brethren]]. The humanist writer [[Desiderius Erasmus]] was one of the most outspoken pacifists of the [[Renaissance]], arguing strongly against warfare in his essays ''[[The Praise of Folly]]'' (1509) and ''The Complaint of Peace'' (1517).&lt;ref name="fsn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Erasmus, Desiderius" by Garrett L. McAinsh, in ''The World Encyclopedia of Peace''.Edited by [[Linus Pauling]], [[Ervin László]], and [[Jong Youl Yoo]]. Oxford : Pergamon, 1986. {{ISBN|0-08-032685-4}}, (Volume 1, p.293).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quakers were prominent advocates of pacifism, who as early as 1660 had repudiated violence in all forms and adhered to a strictly pacifist interpretation of [[Christianity]]. They stated their beliefs in a declaration to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "We utterly deny all outward wars and strife, and fightings with outward weapons, for any end, or under any pretense whatever; this is our testimony to the whole world.  The Spirit of Christ&amp;nbsp;... which leads us into all truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdoms of this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quaker Traditions of Pacifism and Nonviolence|url=http://events.stanford.edu/events/352/35227/|author=Eric Roberts|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout the many 18th century wars in which Britain participated, the Quakers maintained a principled commitment [[Conscientious objector|not to serve in the army and militia]] or even to pay the alternative £10 fine.

The English Quaker [[William Penn]], who founded the [[Province of Pennsylvania]], employed an anti-militarist public policy. Unlike residents of many of the colonies, Quakers chose to trade peacefully with the Indians, including for land. The colonial province was, for the 75 years from 1681 to 1756, essentially unarmed and experienced little or no warfare in that period.

From the 16th to the 18th centuries, a number of thinkers devised plans for an international organisation that would promote peace, and reduce or even eliminate the occurrence of war. These included the French politician [[Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully|Duc de Sully]], the philosophers [[Émeric Crucé]] and the [[Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre|Abbe de Saint-Pierre]], and the English Quakers William Penn and [[John Bellers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Power and the Pursuit of Peace: Theory and Practice in the History of Relations between States'', by [[Francis Harry Hinsley]], Cambridge University Press, 1967, {{ISBN|0-521-09448-8}}, (pp.&amp;nbsp;13–45).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Thinking About Peace in History" by [[Charles Chatfield]], in ''The Pacifist Impulse in Historical Perspective : Essays in Honour of Peter Brock'', edited by [[Harvey L. Dyck]]. Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8020-0777-5}} (p.&amp;nbsp;36–51).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacifist ideals emerged from two strands of thought that coalesced at the end of the 18th century. One, rooted in the secular [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], promoted peace as the rational antidote to the world's ills, while the other was a part of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical religious revival]] that had played an important part in the campaign for the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. Representatives of the former included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], in ''Extrait du Projet de Paix Perpetuelle de Monsieur l'Abbe Saint-Pierre'' (1756),&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley, pp.&amp;nbsp;46–61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''Thoughts on Perpetual Peace'',&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–80.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jeremy Bentham]] who proposed the formation of a peace association in 1789. Representative of the latter, was [[William Wilberforce]] who thought that strict limits should be imposed on British involvement in the [[French Revolutionary War]] based on Christian ideals of peace and brotherhood. Bohemian [[Bernard Bolzano]] (1781–1848) taught about the social waste of militarism and the needlessness of war. He urged a total reform of the educational, social, and economic systems that would direct the nation's interests toward peace rather than toward armed conflict between nations.

===Peace movements===
During the period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], although no formal peace movement was established until the end of hostilities, a significant peace movement animated by universalist ideals did emerge, due to the perception of Britain fighting in a [[reactionary]] role and the increasingly visible impact of the war on the welfare of the nation in the form of higher taxation levels and high casualty rates. Sixteen peace petitions to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] were signed by members of the public, anti-war and anti-[[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] demonstrations convened and peace literature was widely published and disseminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lx4xr3PsdI8C&amp;dq=freemason+hall+1843+london+peace&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Origins of War Prevention: The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1730–1854|author=Ceadel, Martin|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press,|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Richard, Vanity Fair, 1880-09-04.jpg|thumb|"Peace". Caricature of [[Henry Richard]], a prominent advocate of pacifism in the mid-19th century]]
The first peace movements appeared in 1815–16. In the United States the first such movement was the [[New York Peace Society]], founded in 1815 by the theologian [[David Low Dodge]], and the [[Massachusetts Peace Society]]. It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]], describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on [[Christianity|Christian]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism to 1914 : an overview'' by Peter Brock. Toronto, Thistle Printing, 1994. (pp.&amp;nbsp;38–9).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peace Society|London Peace Society]] (also known as the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace) was formed in 1816 to promote permanent and universal peace by the [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[William Allen (philanthropist)|William Allen]]. In the 1840s, British women formed "Olive Leaf Circles", groups of around 15 to 20 women, to discuss and promote pacifist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Long Road to Greenham : Feminism and Anti-Militarism in Britain since 1820'', by [[Jill Liddington]]. London, Virago, 1989 {{ISBN|0-86068-688-4}} (pp.&amp;nbsp;14–5).&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace movement began to grow in influence by the mid-nineteenth century. The London Peace Society, under the initiative of American consul to [[Birmingham]] [[Elihu Burritt]] and the reverend [[Henry Richard]], convened the first [[International Peace Congress]] in London in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Peace.html?id=JCgvvXUzu-oC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas|author=Cortright, David|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The congress decided on two aims: the ideal of peaceable arbitration in the affairs of nations and the creation of an international institution to achieve that. [[Henry Richard|Richard]] became the secretary of the Peace Society in 1850 on a full-time basis, a position which he would keep for the next 40 years, earning himself a reputation as the 'Apostle of Peace'. He helped secure one of the earliest victories for the peace movement by securing a commitment from the [[Great Power]]s in the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] at the end of the [[Crimean War]], in favour of arbitration. On the European continent, wracked by [[1848 Revolution|social upheaval]], the first peace congress was held in [[Brussels]] in 1848 followed by [[Paris]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gustave Moynier and the peace societies|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnaw.htm|publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]|author=André Durand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After experiencing a recession in support due to the resurgence of militarism during the [[American Civil War]] and [[Crimean War]], the movement began to spread across Europe and began to infiltrate the new [[working class]] [[socialism|socialist]] movements. In 1870, [[Randal Cremer]] formed the [[International Arbitration League|Workman's Peace Association]] in London. Cremer, alongside the French economist [[Frédéric Passy]] was also the founding father of the first international organisation for the arbitration of conflicts in 1889, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]. The [[National Peace Council]] was founded in after the 17th [[Universal Peace Congress]] in London (July August 1908).

An important thinker who contributed to pacifist ideology was Russian writer [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In one of his latter works, ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', Tolstoy provides a detailed history, account and defense of pacifism. Tolstoy's work inspired a [[Tolstoyan movement|movement named after him]] advocating pacifism to arise in Russia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;''Tolstoy's Pacifism'', by [[Colm McKeogh]], Cambria Press, 2009, {{ISBN|1-60497-634-9}}, (pp.&amp;nbsp;105–107).&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a major early influence on [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] (1869–1948), and the two engaged in regular correspondence while Gandhi was active in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century'', by [[Peter Brock]] and [[Nigel Young]]. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}} (p.73)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertha von Suttner]], the first woman to be a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, became a leading figure in the peace movement with the publication of her novel, ''Die Waffen nieder!'' ("Lay Down Your Arms!") in 1889 and founded an Austrian pacifist organization in 1891.

===Non-violent resistance===
[[File:WeFightCartoon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|"Leading Citizens want War and declare War; Citizens Who are Led fight the War" 1910 cartoon]]
In New Zealand, during the latter half of the 19th century British colonists used many tactics to confiscate land from the indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]], including warfare. In the 1870s and 1880s, [[Parihaka]], then reputed to be the largest Māori village in New Zealand, became the centre of a major campaign of non-violent resistance to European occupation of confiscated land in the area. One Māori leader, [[Te Whiti-o-Rongomai]], inspired warriors to stand up for their rights without using weapons, which had led to defeat in the past. In 1881 he convinced 2000 Maori to welcome battle-hardened British soldiers into their village and even offered food and drink. He allowed himself and his people to be arrested without resistance for opposing land confiscation. He is remembered as a great leader because the "passive resistance" his practice prevented British massacres and even protected far more land than violent resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/conflict/pacifistofparihaka.htm Winder, Virginia, "Conflict and Protest  - Pacifist of Parihaka - Te Whiti o Rongomai"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705092832/http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/conflict/pacifistofparihaka.htm |date=July 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] was a major political and spiritual leader of India, instrumental in the [[Indian independence movement]]. The Nobel prize winning great poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], who was also an Indian, gave him the honorific  "[[Mahatma]]", usually translated "Great Soul." He was the pioneer of a brand of nonviolence (or ''[[ahimsa]]'') which he called ''[[satyagraha]]''—translated literally as "truth force". This was the resistance of tyranny through civil disobedience that was not only nonviolent but also sought to change the heart of the opponent. He contrasted this with ''duragraha'', "resistant force," which sought only to change behaviour with stubborn protest.

During his 30 years of work (1917–1947) for the independence of his country from the [[British Raj]], Gandhi led dozens of nonviolent campaigns, spent over seven years in prison, and [[hunger strike|fasted nearly to the death]] on several occasions to obtain British compliance with a demand or to stop inter-communal violence.  His efforts helped lead India to independence in 1947, and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom worldwide.

===World War I===
[[File:The Deserter.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|''The Deserter'' (1916) by [[Boardman Robinson]]]]
Peace movements became active in the Western world after 1900, often focusing on Treaties that would settle disputes through arbitration, and efforts to support the Hague conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Hollander,  ''Elusive Dove: The Search for Peace During World War I'' (2014), ch 1 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RZHLAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=4jcnQMsOb9&amp;sig=c9hArkuNZq6iMvmVh8uTPdEeYsk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sudden outbreak of the [[First World War]] in July 1914 dismayed the peace movement. Socialist parties in every industrial nation had committed themselves to antiwar policies, but when the war came, all of them, except in Russia and the United States, supported their own government. There were highly publicized dissidents, some of whom went to jail for opposing the draft laws, like [[Eugene Debs]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Harry W. Laidler, Harry W. ''Socialism in thought and action'' (1920) covers wartime roles in many countries [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DKINAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=harry+laidler+socialism&amp;ots=r5TR5vSoqn&amp;sig=izQuyzD-HCFuo_FNvpyEt78HMPo#v=onepage&amp;q=harry%20laidler%20socialism&amp;f=false online].&lt;/ref&gt;  In Britain, the prominent activist [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]] went to prison for refusing military service, citing his convictions as an "International Socialist and a Christian"&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Adam, ''To end all wars : a story of loyalty and rebellion, 1914–1918'', p. 277, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011, {{ISBN|0-618-75828-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[socialism|socialist]] groups and movements were [[antimilitarist]], arguing that war by its nature was a type of governmental coercion of the [[working class]] for the benefit of [[capitalism|capitalist]] elites. The French socialist pacifist leader [[Jean Jaurès]] was assassinated by a nationalist fanatic on July 31, 1914.  The national parties in the [[Second International]] increasingly supported their respective nations in war and the International was dissolved in 1916.
 
[[File:Peace-Marcher.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|A World War I-era female peace protester]]
In 1915 the [[League of Nations Society]] was formed by British [[liberalism|liberal]] leaders to promote a strong international organisation that could enforce the peaceful resolution of conflict. Later that year the [[League to Enforce Peace]] was established in America to promote similar goals. [[Hamilton Holt]] published an editorial in his New York City weekly magazine the ''Independent'' called "The Way to Disarm: A Practical Proposal" on September 28, 1914. It called for an international organization to agree upon the arbitration of disputes and to guarantee the territorial integrity of its members by maintaining military forces sufficient to defeat those of any non-member. The ensuing debate among prominent internationalists modified Holt's plan to align it more closely with proposals offered in Great Britain by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Viscount James Bryce]], a former ambassador from the U.K. to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, 56-7&lt;/ref&gt; These and other initiatives were pivotal in the change in attitudes that gave birth to the [[League of Nations]] after the war.

Some of the many groups that protested against the war, as well as the traditional peace churches, were the [[Woman's Peace Party]] (which was organized in 1915 and led by noted reformer [[Jane Addams]]), the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) (also organized in 1915),&lt;ref&gt;

===Between the two World Wars===
[[File:Красноармейцы-пацифисты.png|thumb|The soldiers of the red Army in Russia, who on religious grounds refused to shoot at the target (evangelicals or Baptists). Between 1918 and 1929]]
The immense loss of life during the war, for what became regarded as futile reasons, caused a sea-change in public attitudes to militarism. Organisations formed in this period included the [[War Resisters' International]]&lt;ref&gt;''Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915–1963'' by Scott H. Bennett. New York, Syracuse University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8156-3028-X}}, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], the [[No More War Movement]] and the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU). The [[League of Nations]] also convened several disarmament conferences in the inter-war period such as the [[Geneva Naval Conference|Geneva Conference]].

Pacifism and revulsion with war were very popular sentiments in 1920s Britain. A stream of novels and poems on the theme of the futility of war and the slaughter of the youth by old fools were published, including, [[Death of a Hero]] by [[Richard Aldington]], [[Erich Remarque]]'s translated [[All Quiet on the Western Front]] and [[Beverley Nichols]]'s expose ''Cry Havoc''. A debate at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1933 on the motion 'one must fight for King and country' captured the changed mood when the motion was resoundingly defeated. [[Hugh Richard Lawrie Sheppard|Dick Sheppard]] established the [[Peace Pledge Union]] in 1934 totally renouncing war and aggression. The idea of collective security was also popular; instead of outright pacifism the public generally exhibited a determination to stand up to aggression, but preferably with the use of economic sanctions and multilateral negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Hom-c5.html|title=Pacifism|publisher=[[University of Wellington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the Peace Pledge Union later joined the Bruderhof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; during its period of residence in the Cotswolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, English, Jews and Germans lived side by side despite local persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Peace-Experiment-Bruderhof-Community/dp/1532639988|title=A Christian Peace Experiment: The Bruderhof Community in Britain, 1933–1942|last=Randall|first=Ian M.|last2=Wright|first2=Nigel G.|date=2018-03-14|publisher=Cascade Books|isbn=9781532639982|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prats-de-Mollo Children's Home.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Refugees from the Spanish Civil War at the [[War Resisters' International]] children's refuge in the French Pyrenees]]
The British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had a strong pacifist wing in the early 1930s and between 1931 and 1935 was led by [[George Lansbury]], a Christian pacifist who later chaired the No More War Movement and was president of the PPU. The 1933 annual conference resolved unanimously to "pledge itself to take no part in war". "Labour's official position, however, although based on the aspiration towards a world socialist commonwealth and the outlawing of war, did not imply a renunciation of force under all circumstances, but rather support for the ill-defined concept of 'collective security' under the League of Nations. At the same time, on the party's left, [[Stafford Cripps]]'s small but vocal [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]] opposed the official policy, on the non-pacifist ground that the League of Nations was 'nothing but the tool of the satiated imperialist powers'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.exeter.ac.uk/exeter/bitstream/10036/26952/3/Rearmament.pdf Richard Toye, ''The Labour Party and the Economics of Rearmament, 1935–1939''] {{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lansbury was eventually persuaded to resign as Labour leader by the non-pacifist wing of the party and was replaced by [[Clement Attlee]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhiannon Vickers, ''Labour and the World'',  Manchester University Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7190-6745-6}} {{ISBN|978-0-7190-6745-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the threat from [[Nazi Germany]] increased in the 1930s, the Labour Party abandoned its pacifist position and supported re-armament, largely due to the efforts of [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[Hugh Dalton]] who by 1937 had also persuaded the party to oppose [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s policy of [[appeasement]].&lt;ref&gt;A.J.Davies, ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', Abacus, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[League of Nations]] attempted to play its role of ensuring world peace in the 1920s and 30s, although with the increasingly revisionist and aggressive behaviour of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Imperial Japan]], it ultimately failed to maintain such a world order. [[Economic sanctions]] were used against states that committed aggression, such as Italy when it [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Abyssinia]], but there was no will on the part of the principal League powers, Britain and France, to subordinate their interests to a multilateral process or to disarm at all themselves.

The [[Spanish Civil War]] proved a major test for international pacifism, and the work of pacifist organisations (such as [[War Resisters' International]] and the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]) and individuals (such as [[José Brocca]] and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón|Amparo Poch]]) in that arena has until recently{{when|date=May 2011}} been ignored or forgotten by historians, overshadowed by the memory of the [[International Brigades]] and other militaristic interventions. Shortly after the war ended, [[Simone Weil]], despite having volunteered for service on the republican side, went on to publish ''[[The Iliad or the Poem of Force]]'', a work that has been described as a pacifist manifesto.&lt;ref name="NYB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=4551 |title=War and the Iliad |publisher=The New York Review of books |accessdate=29 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501053342/http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=4551 |archivedate=May 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the threat of fascism, some pacifist thinkers, such as [[Richard B. Gregg]], devised plans for a campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]] in the event of a fascist invasion or takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Lynd, Staughton. ''Nonviolence in America: a documentary history'', Bobbs-Merrill, 1966, (pps.&amp;nbsp;271–296).&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Berkeley, California. University of California Student Peace Strike. About half of the students assembled at the... - NARA - 532103.tif|thumb|upright=0.9|A peace strike rally at [[University of California]], Berkeley, April 1940]]
With the start of [[World War II]], pacifist and anti-war sentiment declined in nations affected by war. Even the communist-controlled [[American Peace Mobilization]] reversed its anti-war activism once Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. After the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], mainstream [[isolationist]] groups like the [[America First Committee]], declined, but many smaller religious and socialist groups continued their opposition to war. [[Bertrand Russell]] argued that the necessity of defeating [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] was a unique circumstance where war was not the worst of the possible evils; he called his position ''relative pacifism''. Shortly before the outbreak of war, British writers such as [[E. M. Forster]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[David Garnett]] and [[Storm Jameson]] all rejected their earlier pacifism and endorsed military action against Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Patterson, "Pacifists and Conscientious Objectors", in Adam Piette and Mark Rawlinson, ''The Edinburgh Companion to Twentieth-Century British and American War Literature'', Edinburgh University Press 2012. {{ISBN|0-7486-3874-1}}  (p. 311).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[Albert Einstein]] wrote: "I loathe all armies and any kind of violence; yet I'm firmly convinced that at present these hateful weapons offer the only effective protection."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on [http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/infodocs/people/pp-einstein2.html Albert Einstein] at Peace Pledge Union, and but also discussed in detail in articles in Einstein, Albert (1954), ''Ideas and Opinions'', New York: Random House, {{ISBN|0-517-00393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British pacifists [[Reginald Sorensen, Baron Sorensen|Reginald Sorensen]] and [[Cecil John Cadoux|C. J. Cadoux]], while bitterly disappointed by the outbreak of war, nevertheless urged their fellow pacifists "not to obstruct the war effort".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ceadel, ''Pacifism in Britain, 1914–1945 : The Defining Of A Faith''. Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1980. {{ISBN|0-19-821882-6}} (pp.&amp;nbsp;298–99).&lt;/ref&gt;

The French pacifists [[André and Magda Trocmé]] helped conceal hundreds of Jews fleeing the Nazis in the village of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]].&lt;ref name="pph"&gt;''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed: The Story of Le Chambon and How Goodness Happened There'' Philip P.

Pacifists in the [[Third Reich]] were dealt with harshly; German pacifist [[Carl von Ossietzky]],&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Olaf Kullmann]], a Norwegian pacifist active during the Nazi occupation,&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Socknat, pp.&amp;nbsp;402–3.&lt;/ref&gt; were both imprisoned in concentration camps and died as a result of their mistreatment there. Austrian farmer [[Franz Jägerstätter]] was executed in 1943 for refusing to serve in the [[Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[In Solitary Witness: The Life and Death of Franz Jägerstätter]]'' by [[Gordon Zahn]].Springfield, Illinois: Templegate Publishers. {{ISBN|0-87243-141-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the war, it was discovered that "[[The Black Book]]" or ''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.'' list of Britons to be arrested in the event of a Nazi invasion of the UK included three active pacifists; [[Vera Brittain]], [[Sybil Thorndike]] and [[Aldous Huxley]] (who had left the country).&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard R.

There were [[conscientious objectors]] and war [[tax resisters]] in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  The United States government allowed sincere objectors to serve in noncombatant military roles. However, those [[draft dodgers|draft resisters]] who refused any cooperation with the war effort often spent much of each war in federal prisons. During World War II, pacifist leaders like [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Ammon Hennacy]] of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] urged young Americans not to enlist in military service.

===Later twentieth century===
[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police at an [[Opposition to Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War protest]], 1967]]
[[Martin Luther King Jr]] (1929–68), a [[Baptist]] [[Minister of religion|minister]], led the [[civil rights movement]], which successfully used Gandhian [[nonviolent resistance]] to repeal laws enforcing racial segregation and work for integration of schools, businesses and government. In 1957, his wife [[Coretta Scott King]], [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Benjamin Spock]], and others formed the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (now [[Peace Action]]) to resist the [[nuclear arms race]]. In 1958 British activists formed the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] with Bertrand Russell as its president.

In 1960, [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] came to the US to study [[comparative religion]] at [[Princeton University]] and subsequently was appointed lecturer in Buddhism at [[Columbia University]]. Thich Nhat Hanh had written a letter to Martin Luther King in 1965 entitled "Searching for the Enemy of Man" and during his 1966 stay in the US met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="aavw.org"/&gt; King gave his famous speech at the [[Riverside Church]] in New York City in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aavw.org/special_features/speeches_speech_king01.html Beyond Vietnam]", 4 April 1967, speech made by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Riverside Church, NYC, archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website&lt;/ref&gt; his first to publicly question the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.

Other examples from this period include the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] led by [[Cory Aquino]], and the 1989 [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square Protests]] which included the broadly publicized "[[Tank Man]]" incident.

On December 1, 1948, President [[José Figueres Ferrer]] of [[Costa Rica]] abolished the [[military of Costa Rica|Costa Rican military]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2019.htm Costa Rica]". U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the abolition of the military was introduced in Article 12 of the Costa Rican constitution.

{{see also|Religion and peacebuilding}}

===Ahmadiyya===
{{Further|Ahmadiyya view on Jihad}}
According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of Islam, pacifism is a strong current, and jihad is one's personal inner struggle and should not be used violently for political motives. Violence is the last option only to be used to protect religion and one's own life in extreme situations of persecution. [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, said that in contrary to the current views, Islam ''does not allow the use of sword in religion, except in the case of defensive wars, wars waged to punish a tyrant, or those meant to uphold freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Jihad-Brochure.pdf|title=Jihad the True Islamic Concept|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadiyya claims its objective to be the peaceful propagation of [[Islam]] with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the pen. Ahmadis point out that as per prophecy, who they believe was the promised messiah, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, rendered the concept of violent jihad unnecessary in modern times. They believe that the answer of hate should be given by love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000064.html|title=Jihad of the Pen|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] abolished [[religious war|holy war]] and emphasized its abolition as a central teaching of his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://bahai-library.com/wilmette_lawh_ridvan_notes | last = Troxel | first = Duane |author2=Cole, Juan |author3=Lambden, Stephen | title = Tablet of Ridván: Wilmette Institute faculty notes | date =17 October 2003 | accessdate = 13 September 2006 | publisher = bahai-library.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bahá'í Faith does not have an absolute pacifistic position. For example, Bahá'ís are advised to do social service instead of active army service, but when this is not possible because of obligations in certain countries, the [[Bahá'í laws|Bahá'í law]] of ''loyalty to one's government'' is preferred and the individual should perform the army service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&amp;chapter=1 | title = Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Bahá'í Faith | accessdate = 13 September 2006 | first = Peter | last = Mazal | date = 21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ud1"&gt;{{Cite book| url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/UD/ud-136.html | first = Shoghi | last = Effendi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi|title = Unfolding Destiny|pages = 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, noted that in the Bahá'í view, absolute pacifists are anti-social and exalt the individual over society which could lead to anarchy; instead he noted that the Bahá'í conception of social life follows a moderate view where the individual is not suppressed or exalted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-144.html#gr1 | title = Directives from the Guardian | last = Effendi | first = Shoghi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | pages = 53–54 | publisher = Baha'i Publishing Trust | location = India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the level of society, Bahá'u'lláh promotes the principle of [[collective security]], which does not abolish the use of force, but prescribes "a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Shoghi
 |last=Effendi |authorlink= Shoghi Effendi |year= 1938 |title= The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn= 0-87743-231-7 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-52.html#gr1 | pages = 191–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of collective security from the Bahá'í teachings states that if a government violates a fundamental norm of international law or provision of a future world constitution which Bahá'ís believe will be established by all nations, then the other governments should step in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first = Danesh |last = Sarooshi | year = 1994 | title = Search for a Just Society, Review | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | url = http://bahai-library.com/saroosh_huddleston_just_society | accessdate = 13 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism and violence|Engaged Buddhism|Religion and peacebuilding#Buddhism and peacebuilding}}

Buddhism is generally seen as among the least violent religious traditions,&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Warfare by Michael Jerryson and Mark Juergensmeyer / Oxford University Press 2010, p.3 {{ISBN|978-0-19-539484-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ahimsa]] (do no harm), is a primary virtue in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Baroni2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Josephine Baroni|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smNM4ElP3XgC&amp;pg=PA3|date=January 2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-2240-6|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aung San Suu Kyi]] is a Buddhist [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] pro-democracy activist and leader of the [[National League for Democracy]] in [[Myanmar]] (Burma), who became State Counsellor (similar to prime minister) of Myanmar in April 2016. A devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], Suu Kyi won the [[Rafto Prize]] and the [[Sakharov Prize|Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought]] in 1990 and in 1991 was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a repressive [[military dictatorship]]. One of her best known speeches is the "Freedom From Fear" speech, which begins, "It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1991/kyi-bio.html |title=Aung San Suu Kyi — Biography |publisher=Nobel Foundation |accessdate=4 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian pacifism}}
[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|alt=|thumb|right|''[[Blessed are the peacemakers|Blessed are the Peacemakers]]'' (1917) by [[George Bellows]]]]

====Peace churches====
[[Peace churches]] are Christian denominations explicitly advocating pacifism.  The term "historic peace churches" refers specifically to three church traditions: the [[Church of the Brethren]], the [[Mennonites]] (and some other [[Anabaptists]], such as [[Amish]] [[Hutterites]], and the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bruderhof_Communities|title=Bruderhof Communities - GAMEO|website=gameo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[Quakers]] (Religious Society of Friends). The historic peace churches have, from their origins as far back as the 16th century, always taken the position that [[Jesus]] was himself a pacifist who explicitly taught and practiced pacifism, and that his followers must do likewise. Pacifist churches vary on whether physical force can ever be justified in [[self-defense]] or protecting others, as many adhere strictly to [[nonresistance]] when confronted by violence.  But all agree that violence on behalf of a country or a government is prohibited for Christians.

====Pentecostal churches====
Jay Beaman's thesis&lt;ref name='beaman'&gt;Beaman, J: Pentecostal Pacifism: The Origin, Development, and Rejection of Pacific Belief among the Pentecostals, Center for Mennonite Brethren Studies, Hillsboro, Kansas, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; states that 13 of 21, or 62% of American Pentecostal groups formed by 1917 show evidence of being pacifist sometime in their history. Furthermore, Jay Beaman has shown in his thesis&lt;ref name='beaman'/&gt; that there has been a shift away from pacifism in the American Pentecostal churches to more a style of military support and chaplaincy. The major organisation for Pentecostal Christians who believe in pacifism is the PCPF, the [[Pentecostal Charismatic Peace Fellowship]].

The [[United Pentecostal Church]], the largest Apostolic/[[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness]] denomination, takes an official stand of conscientious objection: its Articles of Faith read, "We are constrained to declare against participating in combatant service in war, armed insurrection&amp;nbsp;... aiding or abetting in or the actual destruction of human life. We believe that we can be consistent in serving our Government in certain noncombatant capacities, but not in the bearing of arms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritualabuse.org/aof.html The Articles of Faith 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Christian denominations====
[[File:Constantines-Sword.png|thumb|left|The shadow of the cross symbolizes the connection between religion and war in ''[[Constantine's Sword|Constantine's Sword (film)]]'']]
The [[Peace Pledge Union]] was a pacifist organisation from which the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship (APF) later emerged within the Anglican Church. The APF succeeded in gaining ratification of the pacifist position at two successive [[Lambeth Conferences]], but many Anglicans would not regard themselves as pacifists. South African Bishop [[Desmond Tutu]] is the most prominent Anglican pacifist. [[Rowan Williams]] led an almost united Anglican Church in Britain in opposition to the 2003 [[Iraq War]].  In Australia [[Peter Carnley]] similarly led a front of bishops opposed to the [[Government of Australia]]'s involvement in the invasion of Iraq.

The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] is concerned with both social justice and pacifist issues, and voiced consistent opposition to the [[Spanish Civil War]] and World War II. Many of its early members were imprisoned for their opposition to [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicworker.org/ Catholic Worker Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Roman Catholic Church, the [[Pax Christi]] organisation is the premiere pacifist lobby group. It holds positions similar to APF, and the two organisations are known to work together on ecumenical projects. Within Roman Catholicism there has been a discernible move towards a more pacifist position through the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Popes [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] and [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] were all vocal in their opposition to specific wars. By taking the name [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], some suspected that [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] would continue the strong emphasis upon nonviolent conflict resolution of his predecessor. However, the Roman Catholic Church officially maintains the legitimacy of Just War, which is rejected by some pacifists.

In the twentieth century there was a notable trend among prominent Roman Catholics towards pacifism.  Individuals such as [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Henri Nouwen]] stand out among them. The monk and mystic [[Thomas Merton]] was noted for his commitment to pacifism during the [[Vietnam War]] era.  Murdered [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] Bishop [[Óscar Romero]] was notable for using non-violent resistance tactics and wrote meditative sermons focusing on the power of prayer and peace. [[School of the Americas Watch]] was founded by Maryknoll Fr. Roy Bourgeois in 1990 and uses strictly pacifist principles to protest the training of Latin American military officers by United States Army officers at the School of the Americas in the state of Georgia.

The [[Greek Orthodox Church]] also tends towards pacifism, though it has accepted defensive warfare through most of its history. However, more recently{{when|date=May 2011}} it took a strong stance towards the war in Lebanon and its large community there refused to take up arms during its civil wars. It also supports dialogue with Islam.  In 1998 the Third Pre-conciliar Pan-Orthodox Conference drew up a text on "the contribution of the Orthodox Church to the achievement of peace" emphasizing respect for the human person and the inseparability of peace from justice. The text states in part: "Orthodoxy condemns war in general, for she regards it as a consequence of the evil and sin in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incommunion.org/articles/for-the-peace-from-above/the-orthodox-church-and-peace Clément, Olivier, "The Orthodox Church and Peace Some Reflections"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902132037/http://incommunion.org/articles/for-the-peace-from-above/the-orthodox-church-and-peace |date=2009-09-02 }} on the Orthodox Peace Fellowship website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] has stated in the [[Baptist Faith and Message]], "It is the duty of Christians to seek peace with all men on principles of [[righteousness]]. In accordance with the spirit and teachings of Christ they should do all in their power to put an end to war."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp#xvi SBC, " Baptist Faith and Message 2000"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Methodist Church]] explicitly supports conscientious objection by its members "as an ethically valid position" while simultaneously allowing for differences of opinion and belief for those who do not object to military service.&lt;ref&gt;Article V, section 2 of [http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=4&amp;mid=989 The United Methodist Church and Peace]&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Rastafari Movement]]'s Mansion [[Mansions of Rastafari#Niyabinghi|Nyabinghi]] are specifically noted for having a large population of Pacifist members, though not all of them are.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Ahimsa}}

Non violence, or [[ahimsa]], is a central part of Hinduism and is one of the fundamental [[Yamas]] - self restraints needed to live a proper life. The concept of ahimsa grew gradually within Hinduism, one of the signs being the discouragement of ritual animal sacrifice. Most Hindus today have a vegetarian diet. There are debates on how far the principle of ahimsa applies and if there is such a thing as a "just war".

===Jainism===
[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Non-violence, Compassion for all life, human and non-human]], is central to [[Jainism]]. Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment. Killing any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is considered unimaginably terrible. It is a religion that requires monks, from all its sects and traditions, to be [[vegetarian]]. Some Indian regions, such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination are also vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, Kurt, Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence, Mohtilal Banarsidass, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
The attitude of Jews toward pacifism, as with most other aspects of religion, is heavily influenced by the Holocaust which was a program of Nazi Germany to murder every man, woman and child who was Jewish as well as people of other religions who had a Jewish grandparent.  As a result, some six million people were exterminated by various means because the Nazis considered them Jews and therefore unworthy of life.  In hindsight, there were opportunities for a number of years to defeat Nazi Germany before it could build a military force strong enough to capture and kill most of the Jews of Europe.&lt;ref name="May, Earnest R. 2000"&gt;May, Earnest R., ''Strange Victory: Hitler's Conquest of France'' (Hill and Wang ed. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Forces which deterred the democracies from acting to stop Hitler early on and at a much, much lower cost in human life were pacifism, appeasement, and isolationism.&lt;ref name="May, Earnest R. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Lynne, ''Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939–1941''(Random House 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  People who offered no resistance to the Nazis enabled them to carry out their oppression and aggression, costing tens of millions of lives in World War II. Had pacifism gained more support, the Allies might have lost the war and virtually all Jews would have been killed.
 
The Jewish Peace Fellowship is a New-York based [[nonprofit]], [[Jewish denominations|nondenominational]] organization set up to provide a [[Judaism|Jewish]] voice in the [[peace movement]]. The organization was founded in 1941 in order to support Jewish [[conscientious objectors]] who sought exemption from combatant military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpeacefellowship.org/index.php?p=about Jewish Peace Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt; It is affiliated to the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifor.org/members.htm IFOR Members] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423022546/http://www.ifor.org/members.htm |date=April 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The small [[Neturei Karta]] group of anti-Zionist, ultra-orthodox Jews, supposedly take a pacifist line, saying that "Jews are not allowed to dominate, kill, harm or demean another people and are not allowed to have anything to do with the Zionist enterprise, their political meddling and their wars.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkusa.org/aboutus/index.cfm What is the Neturei Karta?]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Neturei Karta group do support groups such as [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]] that are violent towards Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/anti-zionist-ultra-orthodox-jews-celebrate-sabbath-in-gaza-1.265558 Anti-Zionist ultra-Orthodox Jews celebrate Sabbath in Gaza]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Bible is full of examples when Jews were told to go and war against enemy lands or within the Israelite community as well as instances where God, as destroyer and protector, goes to war for non-participant Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Niditch, Susan, ''War in the Hebrew Bible'' (Oxford University Press ed. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Holocaust Remembrance Day (called Yom Hashoah in Hebrew) is a day a remembrance for many Jews as they honor those who fought to end the Hitler government which starved, shot, gassed and burned over six million Jews to death.  It is observed on the day corresponding to the 27th day of the month of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Remembrance Day Calendar, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, ushmm.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raëlism===
Non-violence is an important doctrine within [[Raëlism]]. The founder of this religion Rael has said "''The one holding the weapon is as responsible as the one giving the orders''". Other Rael statements include "''even if the Elohim asked them to kill someone they should refuse''".&lt;ref&gt;Aliens adored: Raël's UFO religion - Page 62, Susan J. Palmer - 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and political movements==
[[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|thumb|[[Erich Maria Remarque|Remarque]]'s anti-war novel ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' was banned and burned by war-glorifying Nazis]]
While many governments have tolerated pacifist views and even accommodated pacifists' refusal to fight in wars, others at times have outlawed pacifist and anti-war activity. In 1918, The United States Congress passed the [[Sedition Act of 1918]]. During the periods between World Wars I and World War II, pacifist literature and public advocacy was banned in [[Italy]] under [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Germany]] after the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]],&lt;ref name="bz"&gt;Benjamin Ziemann, "Pacifism"
in ''World Fascism:An Encyclopedia'', edited by Cyprian P. Blamires. ABC-CLIO Ltd, 2006.  {{ISBN|1-57607-940-6}} (p.&amp;nbsp;495–6)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Francoist Spain|Spain]] under [[Francisco Franco]],&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, pp.&amp;nbsp;96–7, 311.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref name="nsleu"&gt;''Notes sur l'anarchisme en U.R.S.S : De 1921 à nos jours''.Les Cahiers du Vent du Chemin. Paris,1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In these nations, pacifism was denounced as cowardice; indeed, Mussolini referred to pacifist writings as the "propaganda of cowardice".&lt;ref name="bz" /&gt;

Today, the United States requires that all young men register for selective service but does not allow them to be classified as conscientious objectors unless they are drafted in some future reinstatement of the draft, allowing them to be discharged or transferred to noncombatant status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objector.org/advice/conscientious_objector-6.html#pgfId-183 "Conscientious Objection Today, Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some European governments like [[Swiss Civilian Service|Switzerland]], [[Greece]], [[Norway]] and [[Germany]] offer [[civilian service]]. However, even during periods of peace, many pacifists still refuse to register for or report for military duty, risking criminal charges.

Anti-war and "pacifist" political parties seeking to win elections may moderate their demands, calling for [[de-escalation]] or major [[arms reduction]] rather than the outright [[disarmament]] which is advocated by many pacifists. [[Green parties]] list "[[non-violence]]" and "[[decentralization]]" towards anarchist co-operatives or minimalist village government as two of their ten key values. However, in power, Greens often compromise. The German Greens in the cabinet of Social Democrat [[Gerhard Schröder]] supported an intervention by German troops in [[Afghanistan]] in 2001 if that they hosted the peace conference in Berlin. However, during the 2002 election Greens forced Schröder to swear that no German troops would invade Iraq.

The controversial [[democratic peace theory]] holds that [[liberal democracies]] have never (or rarely) made war on one another and that lesser conflicts and internal violence are rare between and within democracies. It also argues that the growth in the number of democratic states will, in the not so distant future, end warfare.
[[File:Марш за мир и свободу (15).jpg|thumb|[[March of Peace]], which took place in Moscow in March 2014]]

Some pacifists and [[multilateralism|multilateralists]] are in favor of international criminal law as means to prevent and control international aggression. The [[International Criminal Court]] has jurisdiction over war crimes, but the crime of aggression has yet to be clearly defined in international law.

The [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] enforces a mild pacifist character on the Italian Republic, as Article 11 states that "Italy repudiates war as an instrument offending the liberty of the peoples and as a means for settling international disputes&amp;nbsp;..." Similarly, Articles 24, 25 and 26 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]] (1949), Alinea 15 of the French Constitution (1946), Article 20 of the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish Constitution]] (1953), [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]] (1947) and several other mostly European constitutions correspond to the United Nations Charter by rejecting the institution of war in favour of [[collective security]] and peaceful cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/peace/unitednationsreform2007/liste24list_en.html "Constitutional clauses providing for limitations of national sovereignty to achieve cooperation, peace and disarmament"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720025109/http://www.ne.jp/asahi/peace/unitednationsreform2007/liste24list_en.html |date=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacifism and abstention from political activity===
However, some pacifists, such as the [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[autarchist]] [[Robert LeFevre]], consider the state a form of warfare. In addition, for doctrinal reason that a manmade government is inferior to divine governance and law, many pacifist-identified religions/religious sects also refrain from political activity altogether, including the [[Anabaptists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mandaeans]]. This means that such groups refuse to participate in government office or serve under an oath to a government.

===Anarcho-pacifism===
{{Main|Anarcho-pacifism}}
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Henry David Thoreau]], early proponent of [[anarcho-pacifism]]]]Anarcho-pacifism (also pacifist anarchism or anarchist pacifism) is a form of [[anarchism]] which completely rejects the use of violence in any form for any purpose. The main precedent was [[Henry David Thoreau]] who through his work [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] influenced the advocacy of both Leo Tolstoy and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] for [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence The pacifist and anarchist tradition by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt; As a global movement, Anarchist pacifism emerged shortly before [[World War II]] in the Netherlands, Great Britain and the United States and was a strong presence in the subsequent campaigns for [[nuclear disarmament]].

Violence has always been controversial in anarchism. While many anarchists during the 19th century embraced [[propaganda of the deed]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and other anarcho-pacifists directly opposed violence as a means for change. He argued that anarchism must by nature be nonviolent since it is, by definition, opposition to coercion and force and since the state is inherently violent, meaningful pacifism must likewise be anarchistic. His philosophy was cited as a major inspiration by [[Mohandas Gandhi]], an [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] leader and pacifist who self-identified as an anarchist. [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]] was also instrumental in establishing the pacifist trend within the anarchist movement.&lt;ref name=woodcock&gt;{{Cite book|last=Woodcock |first=George |title=Anarchism: a History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements |publisher=Broadview Press |location=Peterborough |year=2004 |isbn=1-55111-629-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France anti-militarism appeared strongly in individualist anarchist circles as [[Émile Armand]] founded "Ligue Antimilitariste" in 1902 with [[Albert Libertad]] and George Mathias Paraf-Javal.

===Opposition to military taxation===
Many pacifists who would be conscientious objectors to military service are also [[tax resistance|opposed to paying taxes]] to fund the military. In the United States, [[The National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund]] works to pass a national law to allow conscientious objectors to redirect their tax money to be used only for non-military purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacetaxfund.org/aboutus/mission.htm Mission of National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165301/http://www.peacetaxfund.org/aboutus/mission.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
One common argument against pacifism is the possibility of using violence to prevent further acts of violence (and reduce the "net-sum" of violence). This argument hinges on [[consequentialism]]: an otherwise morally objectionable action can be justified if it results in a positive outcome. For example, either violent rebellion, or foreign nations sending in troops to end a dictator's violent oppression may save millions of lives, even if many thousands died in the war. Those pacifists who base their beliefs on [[deontology|deontological]] grounds would oppose such violent action. Others would oppose organized military responses but support individual and small group self-defense against specific attacks if initiated by the dictator's forces. Pacifists may argue that military action could be justified should it subsequently advance the general cause of peace.

Still more pacifists would argue that a nonviolent reaction may not save lives immediately but would in the long run. The acceptance of violence for any reason makes it easier to use in other situations. Learning and committing to pacifism helps to send a message that violence is, in fact, not the most effective way. It can also help people to think more creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without more violence.

In light of the common criticism of pacifism as not offering a clear alternative policy, one approach to finding "more effective ways" has been the attempt to develop the idea of "defence by [[civil resistance]]", also called "[[social defence]]". This idea, which is not necessarily dependent on acceptance of pacifist beliefs, is based on relying on [[nonviolent resistance]] against possible threats, whether external (such as invasion) or internal (such as [[coup d'état]]).
[[File:Ghetto Vilinus.gif|thumb|Jewish armed resistance against the Nazis during World War II]]

There have been some works on this topic, including by [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]]&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts, ed. ''The Strategy of Civilian Defence: Non-violent Resistance to Aggression'', Faber, London, 1967.

Japanese, Italian and Nazi aggression that precipitated [[World War II]] often is cited {{By whom|date=June 2010}}as an argument against pacifism. If these forces had not been challenged and defeated militarily, the argument goes, many more people would have died under their oppressive rule. [[Adolf Hitler]] told the British Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] in 1937 that the British should "shoot Gandhi, and if this doesn't suffice to reduce them to submission, shoot a dozen leading members of the Congress, and if that doesn't suffice shoot 200, and so on, as you make it clear that you mean business."&lt;ref&gt;Ghose, Sankar (1992). ''Jawaharlal Nehru, A Biography'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=MUeyUhVGIDMC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p.138]. Allied Publishers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] noted in his [[Second Book]]: "...&amp;nbsp;Later, the attempt to adapt the living space to increased population turned into unmotivated wars of conquest, which in their very lack of motivation contained the germ of the subsequent reaction. Pacifism is the answer to it. Pacifism has existed in the world ever since there have been wars whose meaning no longer lay in the conquest of territory for a Folk's sustenance. Since then it has been war's eternal companion. It will again disappear as soon as war ceases to be an instrument of booty hungry or power hungry individuals or nations, and as soon as it again becomes the ultimate weapon with which a Folk fights for its daily bread."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Adolf Hitler#The Second book (1928)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermann Göring]] described, during an interview at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], how denouncing and outlawing pacifism was an important part of the Nazis' seizure of power: "The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Hermann Göring#Nuremberg Diary (1947)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators on the most nonviolent forms of pacifism, including [[Jan Narveson]], argue that such pacifism is a self-contradictory doctrine. Narveson claims that everyone has rights and corresponding responsibilities not to violate others' rights. Since pacifists give up their ability to protect themselves from violation of their right not to be harmed, then other people thus have no corresponding responsibility, thus creating a paradox of rights. Narveson said that "the prevention of infractions of that right is precisely what one has a right to when one has a right at all". Narveson then discusses how rational persuasion is a good but often inadequate method of discouraging an aggressor. He considers that everyone has the right to use any means necessary to prevent deprivation of their civil liberties and force could be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Narveson, January 1965. "Pacifism: A Philosophical Analysis." ''Ethics'', LXXV: 4, pp&amp;nbsp;259–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paternalism''' is action limiting a person's or group's liberty or autonomy which is intended to promote their own good.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Gerald, "Paternalism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2010 Edition)'', Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism can also imply that the behavior is against or regardless of the will of a person, or also that the behavior expresses an attitude of superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Shiffrin, Seana. 2000. "Paternalism, Unconscionability Doctrine, and Accommodation". ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'' 29(3): 205–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism, paternalistic and paternalist have all been used as a [[pejorative]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

The word paternalism is from the Latin ''pater'' "father" via the adjective ''paternus'' "fatherly", which in Medieval Latin became ''paternalis''. Some, such as [[John Stuart Mill]], think paternalism to be appropriate towards children: "It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood."&lt;ref name=Mill1859&gt;Mill, J.S. [1859]/(1991) "On Liberty", published in Gray, John (ed), ''John Stuart Mill: On Liberty and Other Essays'', Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism towards adults is sometimes thought of as treating them as if they were children.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Joel. 1986. ''Harm to Self''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Soft and hard===
Soft Paternalism is the view that paternalism is justified only if an action to be committed is involuntary. [[John Stuart Mill]] gives the example of a person about to walk across a damaged bridge. We can't tell the person the bridge is damaged as he doesn't speak your language. According to Soft paternalism we would be justified in forcing him to not cross the bridge so we could find out whether he knows about the damage. If he knows and wants to jump off the bridge and commit suicide then we should allow him to. Hard paternalists say that at least sometimes we are entitled to prevent him from crossing the bridge and committing suicide.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paternalism/#Intr |title=Paternalism |author=Gerald Dworkin |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pure and impure===
Pure paternalism is paternalism where the person(s) having their liberty or autonomy taken away are those being protected. Impure paternalism occurs when the class of people whose liberty or autonomy is violated by some measure is wider than the group of persons thereby protected.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

===Moral and welfare===
Moral paternalism is where paternalism is justified to promote the moral well being of a person(s) even if their welfare wouldn't improve. For example, it would be argued that someone should be prevented from prostitution even if they make a decent living off it and their health is protected. A moral paternalist would argue that it is ethical considering prostitution is morally corrupting.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

== Criteria for effective paternalism ==
[[Thomas Pogge]] argues that there are a number of criteria for paternalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=World poverty and human rights|date=2008|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-4143-0|edition=2nd|url=http://thomaspogge.com/paternalism/|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The concept should work within human flourishing. Generally accepted items such as nutrition, clothing, shelter, certain basic freedoms may be acceptable by a range of religious and social backgrounds. 
*The criteria should be minimally intrusive.
*The requirements of the criteria should not be understood as exhaustive; leaving societies the ability to modify the criteria based on their own needs.
*The supplementary considerations introduced by such more ambitious criteria of justice must not be allowed to outweigh the modest considerations.{{elucidate|date=March 2015}}

==Opponents==
{{See also|Social engineering (political science)|Nanny state}}
In his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', [[John Locke]] argues (against [[Robert Filmer]]) that political and paternal power cannot be identified.

[[John Stuart Mill]] opposes state paternalism on the grounds that individuals know their own good better than the state does, that the moral equality of persons demands respect for others' liberty, and that paternalism disrupts the development of an independent character. In ''On Liberty'' he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right.&lt;ref name=Mill1859/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary opponents of paternalism often appeal to the ideal of personal [[autonomy]].

==In society==

In the southern [[United States]] before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], paternalism was a concept used to justify the legitimacy of [[slavery]]. Women would present themselves as mothers for the slaves, or protectors that provided benefits the slaves would not get on their own. Plantation mistresses would attempt to civilize their workers by providing food, shelter, and affection. These women would justify that the conditions for freed blacks were poorer than those who were under the mistresses' protection. Paternalism was used as an argument against the emancipation of slavery due to these mistresses providing better living conditions than the enslaved's counterpart in the factory-based north.&lt;ref&gt;Erin R. Mulligan, “Paternalism and the Southern Hierarchy: How Slaves Defined Antebellum Southern Women,” Armstrong Undergraduate ''Journal of History'' 2, no. 2, August 2012 [https://www.armstrong.edu/history-journal/history-journal-paternalism-and-the-southern-hierarchy-how-slavery-defined]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this conclusion, often the whites would manage basic rights of the enslaved such as child rearing and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eiu.edu/historia/Cole.pdf|title=The Excuse of Paternalism in the Antebellum South: Ideology or Practice?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paternalism was also used against [[Women's Suffrage]], with opponents of women's suffrage saying that granting women the right to vote would make their lives harder and separate them from their families.

'''Philosophy of history''' is the philosophical study of [[history]] and the past. The term was coined by [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Voltaire]], ''La philosophie de l'histoire'', Changuion, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In [[contemporary philosophy]] a distinction is made between critical philosophy of history (also known as analytic) and speculative philosophy of history. The names of these types are derived from [[C. D. Broad]]'s distinction between [[critical philosophy]] and [[speculative philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. W. H. Walsh, ''Introduction to the Philosophy of History'' (1951) ch. 1 p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Gruner, "The concept of speculative philosophy of history," ''Metaphilosophy'' '''3'''(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

The former studies the past itself whereas the latter is the equivalent of what the [[philosophy of science]] is for nature.&lt;ref&gt;The Continuing Relevance of Speculative Philosophy of History, Journal of the Philosophy of History&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy of History, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there is some overlap between the two aspects, they can usually be distinguished; modern professional historians tend to be skeptical about speculative philosophy of history.

Sometimes critical philosophy of history is included under [[historiography]]. Philosophy of history should not be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas in their historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/stefan-collini/what-intellectual-history|title=What is Intellectual History?|work=historytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-modern history==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) maintained the superiority of poetry over history because poetry speaks of what ''must'' or ''should'' be [[truth|true]] rather than merely what ''is'' true.

[[Herodotus]], a fifth-century BCE contemporary of [[Socrates]], broke from the [[Homer|Homeric tradition]] of passing [[narrative]] from generation to generation in his work "Investigations" (Ancient Greek: Ἱστορίαι; Istoríai), also known as [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']]. Herodotus, regarded by some{{who|date=June 2016}} as the first systematic historian, and, later, [[Plutarch]] (46–120 CE) freely invented [[discourse|speeches]] for their historical figures and chose their historical subjects with an eye toward [[moral]]ly improving the reader. History was supposed to teach good examples for one to follow. The assumption that history "should teach good examples" influenced how writers produced history. Events of the past are just as likely to show bad examples that one should not follow, but classical historians would either not record such examples or would re-interpret them to support their assumption of history's purpose.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

From the Classical period to the [[Renaissance]], historians alternated between focusing on subjects designed to improve mankind and on a devotion to fact. History was composed mainly of [[hagiography|hagiographies]] of [[sovereignty|monarchs]] or of [[epic poetry]] describing [[hero]]ic gestures (such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''—about the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (778) during [[Charlemagne]]'s first campaign to conquer the [[Iberian peninsula]]).

In the fourteenth century, [[Ibn Khaldun]], who is considered one of the fathers of the philosophy of history, discussed his philosophy of history and society in detail in his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377). His work represents a culmination of earlier works by [[Social theory#Sociology in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic sociologists]] in the spheres of [[Islamic ethics]], [[political science]], and [[Historiography of early Islam|historiography]], such as those of [[al-Farabi]] (c. 872 – c. 950), [[Ibn Miskawayh]], al-Dawani, and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] (1201–1274).&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data". He introduced a [[scientific method]] to the philosophy of history (which Dawood considers something "totally new to his age") and he often referred to it as his "new science",&lt;ref&gt;

which is now associated with [[historiography]]. His [[historical method]] also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]], and [[systematic bias]] in history.&lt;ref name=Mowlana/&gt;

By the eighteenth century historians had turned toward a more [[positivist]] approach—focusing on [[fact]] as much as possible, but still with an eye on telling histories that could instruct and improve. Starting with [[Fustel de Coulanges]] (1830–1889) and [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903), historical studies began to move towards a more modern scientific{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} form. In the [[Victorian era]], historiographers debated less whether history was intended to improve the [[Reading (process)|reader]], and more on what causes turned history and how one could understand historical change.

==Cyclical and linear history==
{{further information|Social cycle theory}}

Narrative history tends to follow an assumption of linear progression: "this happened, and then that happened; that happened because this happened first".

Many ancient cultures held [[Religion and mythology|mythical]] concepts of history and of [[time]] that were not [[linear]]. Such societies saw history as cyclical, with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. [[Plato]] taught the concept of the [[Great Year]], and other Greeks spoke of [[aeon]]s (eons). Similar examples include the ancient doctrine of [[eternal return]], which existed in [[Ancient Egypt]], in the [[Indian religions]], among the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Pythagoreans]]' and in the [[Stoics]]' conceptions. In his ''[[Works and Days]]'', [[Hesiod]] described five [[Ages of Man]]: the [[Golden Age]], the [[Silver Age]], the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age]], which began with the [[Dorian invasion]]. Some scholars{{which?|date=July 2018}} identify just four ages, corresponding to the four metals, with the Heroic age as a description of the Bronze Age. A four-age count would match the [[Vedic time keeping|Vedic]] or Hindu ages known as the [[Kali Yuga|Kali]], [[Dwapara Yuga|Dwapara]], [[Treta Yuga|Treta]] and [[Satya Yuga|Satya]] [[yuga]]s. According to [[Jainism]], this world has no beginning or end but goes through cycles of upturns (utsarpini) and downturns (avasarpini) constantly. Many Greeks believed that just as mankind went through four [[stages of character]] during each rise and fall of history so did [[government]]. They considered [[democracy]] and [[monarchy]] as the healthy régimes of the higher ages; and [[oligarchy]] and [[tyranny]] as corrupted régimes common to the lower ages.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}}

In the East, [[Social cycle theory|cyclical theories of history]] developed in China (as a theory of [[dynastic cycle]]) and in the Islamic world in the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406).

The story of [[the Fall of Man]] from the [[Garden of Eden]], as recounted and elaborated in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], preserves traces of a moral cycle; this would give the basis for [[theodicy|theodicies]] which attempt to reconcile the existence of evil in the world with the existence of a God, providing a global explanation of history with belief in a coming [[Messianic Age]]. Some theodicies claimed that history had a progressive direction leading to an [[eschatological]] end, such as the [[Apocalypse]], organized by a superior power. [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430), [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274) and [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] (in his ''Discourse On [[Universal History]]'' of 1679) formulated such theodicies, but [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (1646-1716), who coined the term ''Théodicée'', developed the most famous philosophical theodicy. Leibniz based his explanation on the [[principle of sufficient reason]], which states that anything that happens, does happen for a specific reason. Thus, while man might see certain events as evil (such as wars, epidemics and natural disasters), such a judgement in fact only reflected human perception; if one adopted [[God's view]], "evil" events in fact only took place in the larger [[divine plan]]. In this way theodicies explained the necessity of evil as a relative element that forms part of a larger plan of history. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason was not, however, a gesture of [[fatalism]]. Confronted with the antique [[problem of future contingents]], Leibniz invented the theory of "[[compossible worlds]]", distinguishing two types of necessity, to cope with the problem of [[determinism]].

During the [[Renaissance]], cyclical conceptions of history would become common, with proponents illustrating decay and rebirth by pointing to the [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' (1513–1517) provide an example. The notion of [[Empire]] contained in itself ascendance and [[decadence]],{{cn|date=July 2018}} as in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) (which the Roman Catholic Church placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'').

[[Social cycle theory|Cyclical conceptions]] continued in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the works of authors such as [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936), [[Nikolay Danilevsky]] (1822–1885), and [[Paul Kennedy]] (1945– ), who conceived the human past as a series of repetitive rises and falls. Spengler, like [[Herbert Butterfield| Butterfield]], when writing in reaction to the carnage of the [[First World War]] of 1914–1918, believed that a civilization enters upon an era of [[Caesarism]]&lt;ref&gt;
Compare [https://books.google.com/books?id=XDWcLHxfthMC Oswald Spengler and History as Destiny], page 93: "[...] the closing years of the First World War, when Spengler was completing his work, had witnessed the passing of the feudal rule of landed aristocracy in Germany and its merging into budding forms of parliamentary plutocracy - soon to be followed by the rise of 'mobocracy' and then Caesarism."
&lt;/ref&gt;
after its soul dies.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}} Spengler thought that the soul of the West was dead and that Caesarism was about to begin.

The development of mathematical models of long-term secular sociodemographic cycles revived interest in cyclical theories of history (see, for example, ''Historical Dynamics'' (2003) by [[Peter Turchin]], or ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics''&lt;ref&gt;

==Sustainable history==
''"Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man"'' is a philosophy of history proposed by [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]], where history is defined as ''a durable progressive trajectory in which the quality of life on this planet or all other planets is premised on the guarantee of human dignity for all at all times under all circumstances.''&lt;ref&gt;Nayef R.F. Al-Rodhan, Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph (Berlin: [http://www.lit-verlag.de/isbn/3-643-80005-3 LIT], 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory views history as a linear progression propelled by [[good governance]], which is, in turn, to be achieved through balancing the emotional, amoral, and egoistic elements of [[human nature]] with the human dignity needs of reason, security, [[human rights]], accountability, transparency, justice, opportunity, innovation, and inclusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-A-Philosophy-of-History-and-Civilisational-Triumph GCSP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314154010/http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-A-Philosophy-of-History-and-Civilisational-Triumph |date=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Human dignity'' lies at the heart of this theory and is paramount for ensuring the sustainable history of humankind. Among other things, [[human dignity]] means having a positive sense of self and instilling individuals with respect for the communities to which they belong. Thus, reconciling humans' predisposition for emotionally self-interested behavior with the imperatives of human dignity appears as the one of the most important challenges to global policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/events/event_060710_1130.htm Geneva Press Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003094748/http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/events/event_060710_1130.htm |date=2011-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At national level, they have to protect their citizens against violence and provide them with access to food, housing, clothes, health care, and education. Basic welfare provision and security are fundamental to ensuring human dignity. Environment and ecological considerations need to be addressed as well. Finally, cultural diversity, inclusiveness and participation at all levels, of all communities are key imperatives of human dignity.

In this respect, the sustainable history philosophy challenges existing concepts of [[civilisations]], such as [[Samuel Huntington (political scientist)|Samuel Huntington's]] ''[[Clash of Civilisations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookpleasures.com/websitepublisher/articles/2610/1/-Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-Reviewed-By-Norm-Goldman-of-Bookpleasurescom/Page1.html|title=Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man Reviewed By Norm Goldman of Bookpleasures.com|work=bookpleasures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it argues that human civilisation should not be thought of as consisting of numerous separate and competing civilisations, but rather it should be thought of collectively as only one human civilisation. Within this civilisation are many geo-cultural domains that comprise'' [[sub-cultures]]. ''[[Nayef Al-Rodhan]]'' ''envisions human civilisation as an ocean into which the different geo-cultural domains flow like rivers,'' "The Ocean Model of one Human Civilization". ''At points where geo-cultural domains first enter the ocean of human civilisation, there is likely to be a concentration or dominance of that culture. However, over time, all the rivers of geo-cultural domains become one. There is fluidity at the ocean's centre and cultures have the opportunity to borrow between them. Under such historical conditions the most advanced forms of human enterprise can thrive and lead us to a'' 'civilisational triumph'. ''Nevertheless, there are cases where geographical proximity of various cultures can also lead to friction and conflict.

[[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] concludes that within an increasingly globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, human dignity cannot be ensured globally and in a sustainable way through sole national means. A genuine global effort is required to meet the minimum criteria of human dignity globally. Areas such as conflict prevention, socio-economic justice, gender equality, protection of human rights, environmental protection require a holistic approach and a common action.

==The Enlightenment's ideal of progress==
{{further information|Age of Enlightenment |Social progress}}

During the ''Aufklärung'', or Enlightenment, history began to be seen as both linear and irreversible. [[Condorcet]]'s interpretations of the various "stages of humanity" or [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]] were one of the most important formulations of such conceptions of history, which trusted [[social progress]]. As in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762) treatise on education (or the "art of training men"), the ''Aufklärung'' conceived the human species as perfectible: [[human nature]] could be infinitely developed through a well-thought [[pedagogy]]. In ''[[What is Enlightenment?]]'' (1784), [[Immanuel Kant]] defined the ''Aufklärung'' as the capacity to think by oneself, without referring to an exterior authority, be it a prince or tradition:

{{quotation|Enlightenment is when a person leaves behind a state of immaturity and dependence (''Unmündigkeit'') for which they themselves were responsible. Immaturity and dependence are the inability to use one's own [[intellect]] without the direction of another. One is responsible for this immaturity and dependence, if its cause is not a lack of intelligence or education, but a lack of determination and courage to think without the direction of another. ''[[wikt:Sapere aude|Sapere aude]]! Dare to know!'' is therefore the slogan of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].}}

In a paradoxical way, Kant supported in the same time [[enlightened despotism]] as a way of leading humanity towards its [[autonomy]]. He had conceived the process of history in his short treaty ''[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]]'' (1784). On one hand, enlightened despotism was to lead nations toward their liberation, and progress was thus inscribed in the scheme of history; on the other hand, liberation could only be acquired by a singular gesture, ''Sapere Aude''! Thus, autonomy ultimately relied on the individual's "determination and courage to think without the direction of another."

After Kant, [[G. W. F. Hegel]] developed a complex theodicy in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), which based its conception of history on [[dialectics]]: the negative (wars, etc.) was conceived by Hegel as the motor of history. Hegel argued that history is a constant process of dialectic clash, with each [[thesis]] encountering an opposing idea or event [[antithesis]]. The clash of both was "superated" in the [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]], a conjunction that conserved the contradiction between thesis and its antithesis while [[Aufheben|sublating]] it. As [[Marx]] famously explained afterwards, concretely that meant that if [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s monarchic rule in France was seen as the thesis, the [[French Revolution]] could be seen as its antithesis. However, both were sublated in [[Napoleon]], who reconciled the revolution with the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''; he conserved the change. Hegel thought that [[reason]] accomplished itself, through this dialectical scheme, in History. Through [[Manual labour|labour]], man transformed nature so he could recognize himself in it; he made it his "home." Thus, reason spiritualized nature. Roads, fields, fences, and all the modern infrastructure in which we live is the result of this spiritualization of nature. Hegel thus explained social progress as the result of the labour of reason in history. However, this dialectical reading of history involved, of course, contradiction, so history was also conceived of as constantly conflicting: Hegel theorized this in his famous [[Slave-master dialectic|dialectic of the lord and the bondsman]].

According to Hegel,
{{quotation|One more word about giving instruction as to what the world ought to be. Philosophy in any case always comes on the scene too late to give it... When philosophy paints its gray in gray, then has a shape of life grown old. By philosophy's gray in gray it cannot be rejuvenated but only understood. The [[owl of Minerva]] spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.|&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, [[Philosophy of Right]] (1820), "Preface"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, philosophy was to explain ''Geschichte'' (history) afterward. Philosophy is always late, it is only an interpretation of what is rational in the real—and, according to Hegel, only what is recognized as rational is real. This idealist understanding of philosophy as interpretation was famously challenged by [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Theses on Feuerbach|11th thesis on Feuerbach]]'' (1845): "''Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.''"

===Social evolutionism===
{{further information|Sociocultural evolution}} &lt;!-- the time sphere --&gt;
Inspired by the Enlightenment's ideal of progress, social evolutionism became a popular conception in the nineteenth century. [[Auguste Comte]]'s (1798–1857) [[positivism|positivist]] conception of history, which he divided into the theological stage, the metaphysical stage and the positivist stage, brought upon by modern science, was one of the most influential doctrines of progress. The [[Whig interpretation of history]], as it was later called, associated with scholars of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] eras in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], such as [[Henry Maine]] or [[Thomas Macaulay]], gives an example of such influence, by looking at human history as progress from savagery and ignorance toward peace, prosperity, and science. Maine described the direction of progress as "from status to contract," from a world in which a child's whole life is pre-determined by the circumstances of his birth, toward one of mobility and choice.

The publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 introduced [[human evolution]]. However, it was quickly transposed from its original biological field to the social field, in "[[social Darwinism]]" theories. [[Herbert Spencer]], who coined the term "[[survival of the fittest]]", or [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in ''[[Ancient Society]]'' (1877) developed evolutionist theories independent from Darwin's works, which would be later interpreted as social Darwinism. These nineteenth-century [[unilineal evolution]] theories claimed that societies start out in a ''primitive'' state and gradually become more [[civilisation|civilised]] over time, and equated the culture and technology of Western civilisation with progress.

[[Ernst Haeckel]] formulated his [[recapitulation theory]] in 1867, which stated that "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]": the evolution of each individual reproduces the species' evolution, such as in the development of [[embryos]]. Hence, a child goes through all the steps from primitive society to modern society. This was later discredited.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Haeckel did not support Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]] introduced in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859), rather believing in a [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]].

Progress was not necessarily, however, positive. [[Arthur Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–55) was a [[decadence|decadent]] description of the evolution of the "[[Aryan race]]" which was disappearing through [[miscegenation]]. Gobineau's works had a large popularity in the so-called [[scientific racism]] theories that developed during the [[New Imperialism]] period.

After the [[World War I|first world war]], and even before [[Herbert Butterfield]] (1900–1979) harshly criticized it, the Whig interpretation had gone out of style. The bloodletting of that conflict had indicted the whole notion of linear progress. [[Paul Valéry]] famously said: "We civilizations now know ourselves mortal."

However, the notion itself didn't completely disappear. ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) by [[Francis Fukuyama]] proposed a similar notion of progress, positing that the worldwide adoption of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] as the single accredited political system and even modality of human consciousness would represent the "[[End of History]]". Fukuyama's work stems from an [[Alexandre Kojève|Kojevian]] reading of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807).

Unlike [[Maurice Godelier]] who interprets history as a process of transformation, [[Tim Ingold]] suggests that history is a movement of [[autopoiesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, T. On the Distinction between Evolution and History. Social Evolution &amp; History,. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2002. Pp. 5-24. P. 9, [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/130380/ socionauki.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key component to making sense of all of this is to simply recognize that all these issues in social evolution merely serve to support the suggestion that how one considers the nature of history will impact the interpretation and conclusions drawn about history. The critical under-explored question is less about history as content and more about history as process.

In 2011 [[Steven Pinker]] wrote a history of violence and humanity from an evolutionary perspective in which he shows that violence has declined statistically over time.&lt;ref&gt;" The better angels of our nature, a history of violence and humanity ", by [[Steven Pinker]], published 2012 by Penguin books {{ISBN|978-0-141-03464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The validity of the "great man theory" in historical studies===
{{further|Hero#The hero in historical studies|Great man theory}}

After Hegel, who insisted on the role of "[[Great man theory|great men]]" in history, with his famous statement about [[Napoleon]], "I saw the Spirit on his horse", [[Thomas Carlyle]] argued that history was the biography of a few central individuals, ''[[hero]]es'', such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick the Great]], writing that "The history of the world is but the biography of great men." His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men, of geniuses good and evil, sought to organize change in the advent of greatness. Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position have been rare in the late twentieth century. Most philosophers of history contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one he used for his portraits. A.C. Danto, for example, wrote of the importance of the individual in history, but extended his definition to include ''social individuals,'' defined as "individuals we may provisionally characterize as containing individual human beings amongst their parts. Examples of social individuals might be social classes [...], national groups [...], religious organizations [...], large-scale events [...], large-scale social movements [...], etc." (Danto, "The Historical Individual", 266, in ''Philosophical Analysis and History,'' edited by Williman H. Dray, Rainbow-Bridge Book Co., 1966). The Great Man approach to history was most popular with professional historians in the nineteenth century; a popular work of this school is the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' (1911), which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history. For example, to read about (what is known today as) the "[[Migrations Period]]," consult the biography of [[Attila the Hun]].

After [[Marx]]'s [[historical materialism|conception of a materialist history]] based on the [[class struggle]], which raised attention for the first time to the importance of social factors such as economics in the unfolding of history, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote "You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him."

The [[Annales School]], founded by [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Marc Bloch]], were a major landmark on the shift from a history centered on [[subject (philosophy)|individual subjects]] to studies concentrating in [[geography]], economics, [[demography]], and other social forces. [[Fernand Braudel]]'s studies on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as "hero" of history, [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]]'s history of [[climate]], etc., were inspired by this School.

==Is history predetermined?==
There is disagreement about the extent to which history is ultimately deterministic (see [[historical determinism]]). Some argue that geography (see [[geographic determinism]]), economic systems (see [[economic determinism]]), or culture (see [[cultural determinism]]) prescribe "the iron laws of history" that decide what is to happen. Others see history as a long line of acts and accidents, big and small, each playing out its consequences until that process gets interrupted by the next.

It should be noted that even determinists do not rule that, from time to time, certain cataclysmic events occur to change course of history. Their main point is, however, that such events are rare and that even apparently large shocks like wars and revolutions often have no more than temporary effects on the evolution of the society.

[[Karl Marx]] is, perhaps, the most famous of the exponents of economic determinism. For him social institutions like political system, religion and culture were merely by-products of the basic economic system (see [[Base and superstructure]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://economics.mit.edu/files/9658 Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo. Under the Thumb of History? Political institutions and the Scope for Action]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even he did not see history as completely deterministic. His essay ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'' contains the most famous formulation of Marx's view of the role of the individual in history: ''Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under given circumstances directly encountered and inherited from the past.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marx2mao.com/M&amp;E/EBLB52.html|title=The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte|work=marx2mao.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Does history have a teleological sense?==
{{further|Social progress|Progress (history)}}

[[Theodicy]] claimed that history had a progressive direction leading to an [[eschatological]] end, given by a superior power. However, this transcendent teleological sense can be thought as [[Immanence|immanent]] to human history itself. Hegel probably represents the epitome of teleological philosophy of history. Hegel's teleology was taken up by [[Francis Fukuyama]] in his ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (see ''Social evolutionism'' above). Thinkers such as [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]], or [[Deleuze]] deny any teleological sense to history, claiming that it is best characterized by discontinuities, ruptures, and various time-scales, which the [[Annales School]] had demonstrated.

Schools of thought influenced by Hegel also see history as progressive, but they saw, and see, progress as the outcome of a [[dialectic]] in which factors working in opposite directions are over time reconciled (see above). History was best seen as directed by a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', and traces of the Zeitgeist could be seen by looking backward. Hegel believed that history was moving man toward "[[civilization]]", and some also claim he thought that the [[Prussia]]n state incarnated the "[[End of History]]". In his ''Lessons on the History of Philosophy'', he explains that each epochal philosophy is in a way the whole of philosophy; it is not a subdivision of the Whole but this Whole itself apprehended in a specific modality.

===Historical accounts of writing history===
{{further information|Historiography}}
A classic example of history being written by the victors—or more precisely, by the survivors&lt;ref name="wah"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Writing African History|author=Philips, John Edward|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2006|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;—would be the scarcity of unbiased information that has survived to the present about the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]]. Roman historians left tales of cruelty and [[human sacrifice]] practiced by their longtime enemies; however no Carthaginian was left alive to give their side of the story.

Similarly, we only have the [[History of Christianity|Christian]] side of how Christianity came to be the dominant religion of Europe. However, we know very little about other European religions, such as [[Paganism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} We have the European version of the [[European colonisation of the Americas|conquest of the Americas]], with an interpretation of the native version of events only emerging to popular consciousness since the early 1980s. We have [[Herodotus]]'s Greek history of the [[Persian Wars]], but the Persian recall of the events is little known in Western Culture.

In many respects, the head of state may be guilty of cruelties or even simply a different way of doing things. In some societies, however, to speak of or write critically of rulers can amount to conviction of treason and death. As such, in many ways, what is left as the "official record" of events is oft influenced by one's desire to avoid exile or execution.

However, "losers" in certain time periods often have more of an impetus than the "winners" to write histories that comfort themselves and [[self-justification|justify]] their own behavior.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt; Examples include the historiography of the [[American Civil War]], where it can be argued that the losers (Southerners) have written more history books on the subject than the winners and, until recently, dominated the national perception of history. Confederate generals such as [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]] and [[Thomas J. Jackson|Jackson]] are generally held in higher esteem than their Union counterparts. Popular films such as ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', and ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' have told the story from the Southern viewpoint. Also, despite "losing" the [[Vietnam War]], the United States produces more scholarship on the war than any other country, including Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Triumph Revisited: Historians Battle for the Vietnam War|author=Wiest, Andrew A.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2010|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular history abounds with condemnations of the cruelty of [[African slave trade]]rs and [[Colonization of Africa|colonists]], despite the "winning" status of those people in their heyday.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt;

As is true of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|pre-Columbian populations of America]], the historical record of America being [[European colonization of the Americas|"discovered" by Europeans]] is now sometimes presented as a history of invasion, exploitation and dominance of a people who had been there before the Europeans. This reinterpretation of the historical record is called [[historical revisionism]], which can take the form of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]], which is the denial of [[genocide]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. The revision of previously accepted historical accounts is a constant process in which "today's winners are tomorrow's losers", and the rise and fall of present institutions and movements influence the way historians see the past.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt; In the same sense, the teaching, in [[Education in France|French secondary schools]], of the [[Algerian War of Independence#Historiography of the war and of colonialism|Algerian War of Independence and of colonialism]], has been criticized by several historians, and is the subject of frequent debates. Thus, in contradiction with the February 23, 2005 [[French law on colonialism|law on colonialism]], voted by the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] conservative party, historian Benjamin Stora notes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As Algerians do not appear in their "indigenous" conditions and their sub-citizens status, as the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|history of nationalist movement]] is never evoqued, as none of the great figures of the resistance — [[Messali Hadj]], [[Ferhat Abbas]] — emerge nor retain attention, in one word, as no one explains to students what has been colonisation, we make them unable to understand why the decolonisation took place.&lt;ref name="DiploApril"&gt;[http://mondediplo.com/2001/04/04algeriatorture Colonialism through the school books - The hidden history of the Algerian war], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', April 2001 {{en icon}}/{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hero]] --&gt;

The historico-political [[discourse]] analyzed by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''Society Must Be Defended'' (1975–76) considered [[truth]] as the fragile product of a historical struggle, first conceptualized under the name of "[[race struggle]]"—however, the meaning of "race" was different from today's biological notion, being closer to the sense of "nation" (distinct from [[nation-states]]; its signification is here closer to "people"). [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], for example, was an exponent of nobility rights. He claimed that the French nobility were the racial descendants of the Franks who invaded France (while the Third Estate was descended from the conquered Gauls), and had right to power by virtue of right of conquest. He used this approach to formulate a historical thesis of the course of French political history—a critique of both the monarchy and the Third Estate. Foucault regarded him as the founder of the historico-political discourse as political weapon.

In Great Britain, this historico-political discourse was used by the bourgeoisie, the people and the aristocracy as a means of struggle against the monarchy—cf. [[Edward Coke]] or [[John Lilburne]]. In France, [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], [[Nicolas Fréret]], and then [[Sieyès]], [[Augustin Thierry]], and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]] reappropriated this form of discourse. Finally, at the end of the nineteenth century, this discourse was incorporated by racialist biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "race" and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a "[[state racism]]" (Nazism). According to Foucault, [[Marxist]]s also seized this discourse and took it in a different direction, transforming the [[essentialist]] notion of "race" into the historical notion of "[[class struggle]]", defined by socially structured position: capitalist or proletarian. This displacement of discourse constitutes one of the bases of Foucault's thought: discourse is not tied to the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], rather the "subject" is a construction of discourse. Moreover, discourse is not the simple [[ideological]] and mirror reflexion of an economical [[infrastructure]], but is a product and the battlefield of multiples forces—which may not be reduced to the simple dualist [[contradiction]] of two energies.

Foucault shows that what specifies this discourse from the juridical and philosophical discourse is its conception of truth: truth is no longer absolute, it is the product of "race struggle". History itself, which was traditionally the sovereign's science, the [[legend]] of his glorious feats and monument building,he(the sovereign) built monuments,fought in wars and claims victory on behalf of himself which ultimately became the discourse of the people (modern population), a political stake. The subject is not any more a neutral [[arbitrator]], judge, or [[legislator]], as in [[Solon]]'s or Kant's conceptions. Therefore, what became the "[[historical subject]]" must search in history's furor, under the "juridical code's dried blood", the multiple [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]] from which a fragile [[rationality]] temporarily finally emerged. This may be, perhaps, compared to the [[sophist]] discourse in Ancient Greece. Foucault warns that it has nothing to do with [[Machiavelli]]'s or [[Hobbes]]'s discourse on war, for to this popular discourse, the [[sovereignty|Sovereign]] is nothing more than "an illusion, an instrument, or, at the best, an enemy. It is {the historico-political discourse} a discourse that beheads the king, anyway that dispenses itself from the sovereign and that denounces it".

===History and education===

{{Further information|Education|Pedagogy|Philosophy of education}}
Since [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', civic education and instruction has had a central role in politics and the constitution of a common identity. History has thus sometimes become the target of [[propaganda]], for example in [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionist]] attempts. Plato's insistence on the importance of education was relayed by Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'' (1762), a necessary counterpart of ''The [[Social Contract]]'' (also 1762). [[Public education]] has been seen by republican regimes and the Enlightenment as a prerequisite of the masses' progressive emancipation, as conceived by Kant in ''[[What is Enlightenment?|Was Ist Aufklärung?]]'' (What Is Enlightenment?, 1784).

The creation of modern education systems, instrumental in the construction of [[nation-states]], also passed by the elaboration of a common, national history. [[History textbooks]] are one of the many ways through which this common history was transmitted. ''[[Le Tour de France par deux enfants]]'', for example, was the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]'s classic textbook for elementary school: it described the story of two French children who, following the German annexation of the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region in 1870, go on a ''tour de France'' during which they become aware of France's diversity and the existence of the various ''[[patois]]''.

In most societies, schools and curricula are controlled by governments. As such, there is always an opportunity for governments to impose. Granted, often governments in free societies serve to protect freedoms, check [[hate speech]], and breaches of constitutional rights; but the power itself to impose is available to use the education system to influence thought of malleable minds, positively or negatively, towards truth or towards a version of truth. A recent example of the fragility of government involvement with history textbooks was the [[Japanese history textbook controversies]].

===Narrative and history===
A current popular conception considers the value of narrative in the writing and experience of history. Important thinkers in this area include [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Louis Mink]], [[W.B. Gallie]], and [[Hayden White]]. Some have doubted this approach because it draws fictional and historical narrative closer together, and there remains a perceived "fundamental bifurcation between historical and fictional narrative" (Ricœur, vol. 1, 52). In spite of this, most modern historians, such as [[Barbara Tuchman]] or [[David McCullough]], consider narrative writing important to their approaches. The theory of narrated history (or historicized narrative) holds that the structure of lived experience, and such experience narrated in both fictional and non-fictional works (literature and historiography) have in common the figuration of "temporal experience." In this way, narrative has a generously encompassing ability to "'grasp together' and integrate ... into one whole and complete story" the "composite representations" of historical experience (Ricœur x, 173). Louis Mink writes that, "the significance of past occurrences is understandable only as they are locatable in the ensemble of interrelationships that can be grasped only in the construction of narrative form" (148). Marxist theorist [[Fredric Jameson]] also analyzes historical understanding this way, and writes that "history is inaccessible to us except in textual form ... it can be approached only by way of prior (re)textualization" (82).

===History and causality===

{{see also|Causality}}

Narrative and causal approaches to history have often been contrasted or, even, opposed to one another, yet they can also be viewed as complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 127-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that "explanations in history and elsewhere" describe "not simply an event—something that happens—but a change".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about "larger changes", in Danto's words: to decide "what are the elements which persist through a change" is "rather simple" when treating an individual's "shift in attitude", but "it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 86-116.&lt;/ref&gt; John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following Marc Bloch) and between "routine" and "distinctive links" in causal relationships: "in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders."&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, J. L. (2002) ''The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also pointed to the difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes. For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four "general concepts of causation" used in history: the "metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause"; "the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events"; "the functional/teleological/consequential concept", which is "goal-directed, so that goals are causes"; and the "realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, C. (1993) ''Structures of History'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History as propaganda: Is history always written by the victors?===
In his "Society must be Defended", [[Michel Foucault]] posited that the victors of a social struggle use their political dominance to suppress a defeated adversary's version of historical events in favor of their own [[propaganda]], which may go so far as [[historical revisionism (political)|historical revisionism]]. (See ''Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse'' above.) Nations adopting such an approach would likely fashion a "universal" theory of history, a [[manifest destiny]] in the US, to support their aims, with a teleological and deterministic philosophy of history used to justify the inevitableness and rightness of their victories.

[[Wolfgang Schivelbusch]]'s ''Culture of Defeat'' took a completely different view—according to him, defeat is a major driver for the defeated to reinvent himself, while the victor—confirmed in his attitudes and methods, dissatisfied by the high losses and paltry gains made, may be less creative and fall back. The concept evokes Hegel's [[Master–slave dialectic]]s—the master is dependent of the work of the slave, the slave has to take his master's and his own interests into account, gets more knowledge and more insight as the master; and in realising that the world around him was created by his own hands he may gain self-consciousness and emancipation. Schivelbusch worked on three basic examples, the South and its [[Lost cause]] after the Civil War, France after the Franco-Prussian War 1870/71, and Germany following World War I. Wolfgang Schivelbusch view includes complex psychological and cultural responses of vanquished nations, from every level of society and sees a need and rise of creativity and various narratives for the defeated.&lt;ref&gt;The Culture of Defeat by Wolfgang Schivelbusch, trans Jefferson Chase Granta, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/29/history.highereducation1 Guardian review 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a society [[Walter Benjamin]] believed that Marxist historians must take a radically different view point from the [[bourgeois]] and [[idealist]] points of view, in an attempt to create a sort of [[People's history|history from below]], which would be able to conceive an alternative conception of history, not based, as in classical historical studies, on the philosophical and juridical discourse of [[sovereignty]]—an approach that would invariably adhere to major states (the victors') points of view.  Philosopher Paul Ricoeur asked instead for a plurality in history writing. "We carry on several histories simultaneously, in times whose periods, crises, and pauses do not coincide. We enchain, abandon, and resume several histories, much as a chess player who plays several games at once, renewing now this one, now the another" (''History and Truth'' 186). [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' is a fictional account of the manipulation of the historical record for nationalist aims and manipulation of power.

To some degree, all nations are active in the promotion of such "national stories", with ethnicity, nationalism, gender, power, heroic figures, class considerations and important national events and trends all clashing and competing within the narrative.

With regard to the [[history of science]], the introduction of new paradigms is depicted by [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''.&lt;ref name=kuhnw&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; Innovation in science or technology is not based on single experiments or ideas per se, but needs a supportive environment and technical achievements to allow for a change of perspective.

==Judgement of history&lt;!--'Judgement of history' redirects here--&gt;==
For Hegel, the history of the world is also the Last Judgement. Hegel adopted the expression "[[:de:Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht|Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht]]" ("[[world history]] is a tribunal that judges the world"; a quote from [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s poem "Resignation" (published in 1786) and used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Janez Juhant, Bojan Žalec (eds.), ''Reconciliation: The Way of Healing and Growth'', LIT Verlag Münster, 2012, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the twentieth century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the '''judgement of history'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref name="Curran2000p413"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F.

'''Political decay''' is a political theory, originally described by [[Samuel P. Huntington]],&lt;ref name=World_Politics&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2009286|author=Huntington, Samuel P.|title=Political Development and Political Decay|journal=World Politics|volume=17|number=3 |year=1965|pages=386–430|doi=10.2307/2009286}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes how chaos and disorder can arise from social modernization increasing more rapidly than political and institutional modernization. Huntington provides different definitions for political development and describes the forms of political decay according to the various definitions. Huntington focuses primarily on political development as modernization and institutionalization. However, he points to the different definitions of political development as being arbitrary ways to understanding the rise of political systems and the relationship between the political systems in different nations.

==Political development==
Huntington identifies two characteristics of political development. The first is that development is synonymous with [[modernization]], thus political development can be defined as political modernization. The second is that there are many criteria to measure political development because modernization and development are such broad topics, covering many areas. There are four generally agreed-upon criteria to determine political development. The first is [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], which involves the movement from [[Political particularism|particularism]] to [[universalism]], or, from a political standpoint, a focus on functional differentiation and achievement criteria. The second criterion is [[nationalism]], and national integration. This emphasizes nation-states and nation-building as a key aspect of political development. The third criterion is a focus on [[democratization]], which is in essence a focus on competition and equalization of power. The final criterion is [[mobilization]], which is a focus on political participation. The greater the development, the greater the modernization, the greater the mobilization, and therefore the greater the political participation. Ultimately, political development can be defined as an increase in national political unity and an increase in political participation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Modernization===

According to Huntington's definition of political development as modernization, political decay is the opposite of the linear idea of social progress—although, within the model of modernization, social regression is not possible. Instead, political decay takes place because "modern and modernizing states can change by losing capabilities as well as by gaining them. In addition, a gain in any one capability usually involves costs in others."&lt;ref name=World_Politics/&gt;{{rp|393}} The model of modernization was used to compare the political systems of different countries with social development reflecting the linear progression of political institutions.&lt;ref name=World_Politics/&gt;{{rp|391}} However, research into the relationship between development of political institutions and modernization has pointed to inconsistent development. In some political systems, such as certain Latin American regions, governments have been influenced by military intervention as a result of the government's inability to cope with the strains of modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Geller, Daniel S. "Economic Modernization and Political Instability: A Casual Analysis of Bureaucratic-Authoritarianism" ''The Western Political Quarterly'' 35, no. 1 (March 1982): 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional===

Under the framework of political development as institutional development, political decay occurs when institutions fail to change or adapt when they become unnecessary due to social or economic changes. Dan Halvorson challenges the idea of political decay as an institutional failure by claiming that the idea of political decay is tied to a Western ideal of political institution without taking into account widely-varying cultural institutions and the inability of post-colonial states to adapt to Western ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Halvorson, Dan. States of Disorder: ''Understanding State Failure and Intervention in the Periphery''. Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2013. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama refers to political decay as the social and economic forces that upset the equilibrium of established political order.&lt;ref name=Fukuyama&gt;Fukuyama, Francis, The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions of the Roman Empire government failed to meet the moral and economic needs of the citizens, resulting in the conditions that would facilitate political decay and the fall of the Roman state.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, James Harrington. "Permanence of the American Democracy" ''American Journal of Sociology'' 30, no. 1 (July 1924): 3&lt;/ref&gt; Under the institutional model, political decay can be observed as a decrease in competence and credibility and establishment of institutional corruption over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Crawford. "Zaire: Is There a State?" ''Canadian Journal of African Studies'' 18, no. 1 (1984): 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instability==

Different social and economic factors contribute to both the political development as well as the political decay of nations. Outside forces such as foreign governments affect the stability of established governments due to contrasting social institutions or economic interests. In order to be considered stable, government procedures and institutions must maintain autonomy and be resistant to outside agents.&lt;ref name=World_Politics/&gt;{{rp|402}} The social and economic forces that established political stability could change or disappear, leading to internal instability.&lt;ref name=Fukuyama/&gt; Economic development, such as shifts from agriculture-based economy to manufacturing-based economy, as well as economic collapse, can also lead to political instability. Social developments, such as the proliferation of literacy, lead to the rise and spread of new ideas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Political instability===

Political instability occurs when one faction in a state's government is in opposition with another faction or with another institution in government. Sri Lanka saw a period of political instability following elections in 1994 caused by the ambitions of political leaders. The elected President Kumaratunga attempted to change the constitution and dissolve the parliament in order to remain in power, leading to sudden changes in the structure of the law-making body.&lt;ref&gt;DeVotta, Niel. "Sri Lanka in 2004: Enduring Political Decay and a Failing Peace Process." ''Asian Survey'' 15, no. 1 (January/February 2005: 98-104&lt;/ref&gt; Political instability occurred during the late 18th century in France and other parts of Europe during the 19th century. Political development in France, such as the development of the bureaucracy and other institutions, led to a greater demand for meritocracy and greater political conflict among the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Gillis, John R. "Political Decay and the European Revolutions, 1789-1848." ''World Politics'' 22, no. 3 (April 1970): 344-370.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, political breakdown can occur within the framework of a state's constitution. India has provisions its constitution which grant leaders the power to breach or oppose the constitution in cases of emergency. These breaches of the state law from within the political system can lead to political decay.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Henry C. "The Indian Constitution: Political Development and Decay." ''Asian Survey'' 20, no. 4 (April 1980): 428-451&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social developments===

Huntington's model of political development and decay describes elements such as industrialization, urbanization, education and literacy as social developments that create instability. The presence of violent conflict is not always indicative of social decay. Due to the complex character of state-building and shifts in political systems, violence is not a reliable indicator of political decay or development.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Youssef, Brown, Brian R., Orgnaski, A.F.K. "The Paradoxical Nature of State Making: The Violent Creation of Order." ''The American Political Science Review'' 75, no. 4 (December 1981): 901-910&lt;/ref&gt; The socialization of law is a process by which legislation is changed in order to adapt to economic and social changes. Socialization of law is one of the forces that opposes political decay within Huntington's structure of modernization, by ensuring that the political institutions in place are resistant to social instability.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, James Harrington. "Permanence of the American Democracy." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 30, no. 1 (July 1924): 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Updated by Fukuyama==
Huntington's former student, [[Francis Fukuyama]], has developed the theory of political decay by analysing the sclerosis of democratic institutions in the United States and elsewhere. The second of Fukuyama's two volumes on political order, ''[[Political Order and Political Decay]]'' (2014), echoes the title of Huntington's seminal 1965 essay. Fukuyama focuses on the concept of political decay in the framework of a history of the rise and fall of Chinese dynasties and the causes of political and social stability during each dynasty.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[Image:Red flag II.svg|thumb|[[Red flag (politics)|Red flags]] associated with [[marxism]]]]
'''Political symbolism''' is symbolism that is used to represent a political standpoint.  The symbolism can occur in various media including [[banners]], [[acronyms]], [[pictures]], [[flags]], [[mottos]], and countless more. For example, [[Red flag (politics)|Red flags]] have traditionally been flown by [[socialists]], [[left-wing]] radicals, and [[communist]] groups to represent the "blood of the workers". Black flags have traditionally been flown by [[anarchists|anarchism]], and [[left-wing]] radicals to represent the absence of all oppressive structures. A combination of the two colors in a black flag represents social anarchism, such as [[anarchist communism]] and [[anarcho syndicalism]].

Many groups use the [[political colour]] associated with their political philosophy, for example blue, particularly dark blue, is often associated with [[Conservative political parties|Conservative parties]].

Cultural groups may use symbols in what many consider to be a political way, for example [[LGBT symbols]] like the [[Rainbow flag]] are used to promote the political goal of [[LGBT]] rights.

Substantial [[political violence]] existed in [[Germany]] from the fall of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] and the rise of the [[Weimar Republic]] through the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] until the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] to power in 1933 when a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi totalitarian state]] was formed and opposition figures were arrested.

Due to unrest left from the change of government from a monarchy, based on social standing, to a democratic republic, the people of Germany turned to riots and violence. The drastic change allowed for mobility amongst the classes and new voices to be heard. Many large cities, especially Berlin, experienced political rallies which resulted in violence from opposition. The quick overturn of leaders also influenced crises in the interwar period. Ultimately the National socialists took advantage of the radical setting of Germany but leading to this there was great amounts of political violence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8225">'''''Religio licita''''' ("permitted religion,"&lt;ref&gt;''Licita'' is the [[past participle]] of ''licet'', "is permitted, is lawful."&lt;/ref&gt; also translated as "approved religion"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a phrase used in the ''[[Apologeticus|Apologeticum]]'' of [[Tertullian]]&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''Apologeticum'' 21.1.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the special status of the [[Jews in the Roman Empire]]. It was not an official term in [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Francis Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts: The Social and Political Motivations of Lucan Theology'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 1996), p. 211, begins his analysis of the ''religio licita'' theory "by immediately scotching the idea that Rome had some process for licensing foreign religions. There is no historical support for this whatsoever; … there never was a juridical category of ''religio licita''." See also Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'', p. 35; Solomon Grayzel, "The Jews and Roman Law," ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', 59 (1968), pp. 93-117; [[Ben Witherington III]], ''The Acts of the Apostles: A Socio-rhetorical Commentary ''(Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 1997), p. 542; John J. O'Keefe, entry on "Religio licita," in ''A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it occurs in only one [[Church Fathers|patristic text]] and in no [[classical antiquity|classical]] Roman sources or inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin H. Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' (Princeton University Press, 2004, 2006), p. 449; Tessa Rajak, "Was There a Roman Charter for the Jews?" ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 74 (1984), pp. 107-123. As Stephen Wilson, ''Related Strangers: Jews and Christians, 70–170 C.E.'' (Augsburg Fortress, 1995, 2005), p. 68, has noted, ''religio licita'' "is not a Roman but a Christian concept."&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase has spawned abundant scholarly conjecture on its possible significance. Some scholars have gone so far as to imagine that all religions under the Empire had a legal status as either ''licita'' or ''illicita'', despite the absence of any ancient texts referring to these categories.&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations: Claiming a Place in Ancient Mediterranean Society'' (Augsburg Fortress, 2003), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme view has held that Tertullian's phrase means all foreign religions required a license from the Roman government.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 206, taking note of Foakes Jackson and Kirsopp Lake, B.S. Easton, and the early work of H.J. Cadbury as examples of this extreme of interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was Roman custom to permit or even encourage the subject peoples of the [[Roman province|provinces]] and foreign communities in Rome to maintain their ancestral religion, unless specific practices were regarded as disruptive or subversive:&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'', p. 449; Jörg Rüpke, "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; "A ''religio'' was ''licita'' for a particular group on the basis of tribe or nationality and traditional practices, coupled with the proviso that its rites were not offensive to the Roman people or [[List of Roman deities|its gods]]."&lt;ref&gt;W. H. C. Frend, ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1967), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian uses the phrase in a passage arguing that Christians should be granted the same [[freedom of religion|freedom to practice their religion]] as any other inhabitant of the Empire; the passage itself, and not the phrase ''religio licita'', is evidence of the general [[religious tolerance|tolerance]] afforded under [[Religion in ancient Rome|the Roman system of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Ames, "Roman Religion in the Vision of Tertullian," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism as ''licita''==
''Religio licita'' has sometimes been taken as a formal recognition or [[charter]] originating with [[Julius Caesar]] and embodied by various pieces of Roman legislation pertaining to the Jews, conceived of as a coherent policy.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian: A Study in Political Relations'' (2nd ed.; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1981), p. 539 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the various privileges and exemptions granted to the Jews were responses to specific complaints or requests, made in the context of the traditional [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage network]],&lt;ref&gt;Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations'', pp. 221–222; Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'', 13 (1994) pp. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; and had nothing to do with a supposed ''religio licita'' status.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that the Romans respected Judaism, it was because of the religion's great antiquity, ancestral tradition being regarded as a source of social and political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that "[[Roman magistrates]] treated the Jews the way they did not because they were consciously tolerant, but simply because they had no reason to hinder the free exercise of Jewish religious practices."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'' 13 (1994), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity as ''illicita''==
Some scholars have argued that Christianity was declared a ''religio illicita'' (an impermissible or illegitimate religion) by [[Domitian]] in the [[80s]] AD.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey E.M. de Ste. Croix, "Why Were the Early Christians Persecuted?" ''Past and Present'', 26 (1963), pp. 6-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this term appears nowhere, it has been conjectured that a declaration of Christianity as ''illicita'' was the legal basis for official persecutions. There was, however, "no law, either existing section of criminal law, or special legislation directed against the Christians, under which Christians were prosecuted in the first two centuries."&lt;ref&gt;J.E.A. Crake, "Early Christians and Roman Law," ''Phoenix'' 19 (1965), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome lacked a uniform policy or legal code pertaining to foreign cults,&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Barnes, "Legislation against the Christians," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 58 (1968), 50&lt;/ref&gt; and before Christian hegemony in the 4th century, there was no legal language to designate a concept analogous to "[[heresy]]" or crimes against orthodox religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, "Roman Policy," p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Constantine the Great]], [[Early Christianity|Christianity]] and other religions became tolerated with the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313. Toleration did not extend to religions that practiced [[human sacrifice]], such as [[Druidism]]. This state of affairs lasted until 380, when [[Nicene Creed|Nicene Christianity]] was adopted as the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]], after which time [[Historical_persecution_by_Christians#Roman_Empire|persecution]] of non-Christian and non-Nicene cults began. [[Priscillian]] was executed for heresy in 385, and [[Theodosius I]] began outlawing Rome's traditional religious rituals in 391.

The '''Republican Party of India (Athawale)''' is a [[political party]] in India. The party is a splinter group of the [[Republican Party of India]] and has its roots in the [[Scheduled Castes Federation]] led by [[B. R. Ambedkar]]. The president of the party is [[Ramdas Athawale]].

==History==

Ramdas Athawale was member of the [[Maharashtra Legislative Council]] from 1990 to 1995 and a cabinet member in the [[Government of Maharashtra]]. Subsequently, he was elected to the [[Parliament of India]], representing [[Mumbai North Central (Lok Sabha constituency)|Mumbai North Central]] in the [[12th Lok Sabha]] between 1998-99 and the [[Pandharpur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Pandharpur constituency]] from 1999 to 2004.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

After the 2004 election, it had a small representation in the [[Lok Sabha]] and was a constituent of the ruling [[United Progressive Alliance]]. Its presence is limited to [[Maharashtra]].

All factions of the RPI except [[Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar|Prakash Ambedkar]]'s [[Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh]] have reunited to form a [[Republican Party of India (United)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The two Ambedkarite parties, the Republican Party of India led by Ramdas Athawale and the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh led by Prakash Ambedkar|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/ambedkarites-find-it-hard-to-stay-afloat/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the party aligned itself with the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who are Modi's 26 allies in the NDA?|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/column/ls-election-sheela-says-who-are-modis-26-allies-in-the-nda/20140505.htm|date=5 May 2014|access-date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakhi Sawant resigned from Rashtriya Aam Party and joined Republican Party of India (A) in June 2014 and expressed her desire to work for [[Dalit|dalits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/rakhi-sawant-wants-to-join-rpi/|title=Rakhi Sawant wants to join RPI|date=21 June 2014|publisher= ELECTION COMMISSION OF INDIA, GENERAL ELECTION TO LOK SABHA TRENDS &amp; RESULT 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abplive.in/india/2014/06/28/article352666.ece/Rakhi-Sawant-joins-RPI?id=352666#.U651I5SSx1Y|title=Rakhi Sawant joins RPI|date=28 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910085656/http://www.abplive.in/india/2014/06/28/article352666.ece/Rakhi-Sawant-joins-RPI?id=352666#.U651I5SSx1Y|archivedate=10 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rakhi serves as party's state vice-president and president of woman wing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.webindia123.com/news/Articles/India/20140621/2411873.html Rakhi Sawant express her desire to join RPI]. News.webindia123.com (21 June 2014). Retrieved on 2016-11-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, the RPI(A) was one of 16 parties in Maharashtra to lose its registration for not submitting audited balance sheets and IT return documents since 2005. Thus they have lost their official election symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=16 political parties lose election symbols in the absence of balance sheets|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/16-political-parties-lose-election-symbols-in-the-absence-of-balance-sheets/articleshow/49158818.cms|date=29 September 2015|access-date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athawale is only member in [[Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha|Member of Parliament in Upper House]] of the Indian parliament. He is currently Minister of State for [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment|Social Justice and Empowerment]] Department with Disability Affairs from July 2016 in [[Modi ministry|Narendra Modi ministry]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

'''Riot dog''' is a term used by English-speaking media denoting any of the [[Free-ranging dog|stray dogs]] that, in recent years, accompany [[street protester]]s in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=news&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/theres-only-one-kanellos-riot-dog-fans/story-e6frfro0-1225865078493 "Riot Dog fans"], [[News Corporation|News.com]], Australia, 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that a number of these dogs remain among the protesters even when violent [[rioting]] breaks out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13802940 "Greece's front-line riot dog"], BBC News, 17 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/further/2010/05/07-1 "With Dog on Your Side"] by Jon Queally, [[Common Dreams]], 5 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the dogs have been prominently featured in  media reportage on the protests.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2964101/Demo-dog-loves-street-protests.html "Demo dog loves street protests"], ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', 7 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Greece's Riot Dogs have acquired, through the years, a large following of fans around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/grekisk-rebellhund-hyllas-pa-natet# "Grekisk rebellhund hyllas på nätet"] ("Greek rebel dog is hailed on the web"), ''Dagliga Nyheter'', 5 August 2010 (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kampflieder.de/blogg/index.php/loukanikos-ein-griechischer-held/ "Ein griechischer Held"] ("A Greek Hero"), ''KampfLieder'', 11 October 2011 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;"Amid the turmoil of the Greece financial crisis, photos and videos of street protests have turned up a kind of canine "[[Where's Waldo]]" figure: a mutt that....clearly has a strong interest in civic disorder": From [https://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/20100507/ts_ynews/ynews_ts1963 "Mysterious 'Rebel Dog' of Greek riots becoming latest Web icon"] by Brett Dykes, ''Yahoo News'', 7 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dogs==
'''Kanellos''' ({{Lang-gr|Κανέλλος}}: cinnamon), a distinct blonde, male, mixed-breed canine,&lt;ref name=wink&gt;[http://www.winknews.com/National-World/2010-05-07/Kanellos-the-Greek-protest-dog-makes-another-appearance "Kanellos the Greek protest dog makes another appearance"] ''[[WINK-TV]]'', [[CBS]] affiliate, 7 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was arguably the first incarnation of the Greek Riot Dog. His maiden appearance was in photographs taken at a general assembly of students in the occupied [[National Technical University of Athens]]. Kanellos became famous in the [[2008 Greek riots]], when Greek photographers and cameramen started to notice a dog that kept appearing in their  footage.&lt;ref name=news /&gt;&lt;ref name=sun /&gt; The stray seemed to always walk amongst and side with the protesters.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;"The hound always seems to side with the protesters, whatever the dispute." From [https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/may/06/greece-protest?picture=362290833 "Kanellos the Greek protest dog"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to reports by witnesses, Kanellos, in his final years, suffered from [[arthritis]], which motivated a group of college students to collect money and purchase him a dog's [[wheelchair]]. This allowed him to live indoors, among the students, until he died.&lt;ref name=OK&gt;[http://rebeldog.tumblr.com/post/579120890/ok-lets-clear-this-out-rebel-dog-is-not "OK! let’s clear this out"] RebelDog website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thodoris''' ({{Lang|el|Θοδωρής}}) is a Kanellos look-alike, believed to be one of Kanellos' pups. Thodoris is a light golden-colored, mixed breed dog, who, despite being a stray, has seemingly been provided with all the necessary medical shots, as evidenced by his blue collar.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;[http://photo.newsweek.com/2010/5/greek-protest-dogs.html "Mange Against the Machine"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620104951/http://photo.newsweek.com/2010/5/greek-protest-dogs.html |date=20 June 2010 }}, by Paul Katie, ''[[Newsweek]]'', May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Loukanikos''' ({{Lang|el|Λουκάνικος}}: the sausage [[loukaniko]]) or more commonly '''Louk''' ({{Lang|el|Λουκ}}), sometimes confused by the media for Kanellos,&lt;ref name=lib&gt;[http://libcom.org/gallery/loukanikos-greek-anarchist-dog "Loukanikos, the Greek anarchist dog"] LibCom, 8 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; has been present at nearly every recent protest in [[Athens]] in the past few years.&lt;ref name=lib /&gt; This stray has ostensibly become the symbol of [[Economy of Greece#2010-2011 debt crisis|Greek protests]] against the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]- and [[European Central Bank|ECB]]-prompted [[austerity]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/activist-hounding-greek-cabinet/story-e6frg6so-1226078057707 "Activist hounding Greek cabinet"], ''[[The Australian]]'', 20 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There's uncertainty about the claim that Loukanikos and Thodoris may, in fact, be the same dog.&lt;ref name=black&gt;[http://capinero.blogspot.com/2012/01/blog-post_06.html "Kanellos and Thodoris Loukanikos"] by 'Karlo Krystaller', ''Black Capitalism'', 25 December 2011 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2011, on the occasion of a striking policemen's union marching in the centre of Athens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_27/09/2011_408306 "Police protest low salaries"], ''[[Kathimerini]]'', 27 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Loukanikos, according to eyewitnesses,&lt;ref name=black /&gt; was "initially confused" between two opposite sides both of uniformed policemen but, when the riot police contingent attacked their striking colleagues, the dog sided with "those who were being attacked."

Loukanikos' health was "severely burdened" by the inhaling of [[tear gas]] and other chemicals  during the many riots in which he participated&lt;ref name=avgi&gt;[http://www.avgi.gr/article/4346127/ena-antio-ston-loukaniko "Ena Adio Ston Loukaniko"] ("A Goodbye to Loukanikos"), ''[[I Avgi|Avgi]]'', 9 October 2014 (in [[Greek language|Greek]])&lt;/ref&gt; but lived until approximately ten years of age, dying peacefully on 9 October 2014 at the home of a person who cared for him.&lt;ref name=avgi/&gt;

==Other dogs==

In Chile, in the 2010s, a stray dog has been seen accompanying student protests. Reportedly, protesters nicknamed him "Negro Matapaco" or "Matapaco" (from Spanish ''matar'', to kill, and ''paco'', which is [[List_of_police-related_slang_terms#P|Chilean slang for "policeman"]]; his full nickname therefore translates to "black cop-killer"), or refer to him simply as "El Negro".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiEFhAAWCiw Documental Matapaco (2013)] (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==

In 2011, American singer/songwriter [[David Rovics]] released a song entitled "The Riot Dog".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dimokratianews.gr/content/751/%CE%B7-%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%AE-%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-lucky-%C2%AB%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BA%C2%BB "Η μικρή ιστορία του 'Lucky Λουκ'"] ("The short story of Lucky 'Louk' "), in ''Dimokratia'',  24 June 2011 (in [[Greek language|Greek]])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scottish Politician of the Year''' is an annual award established in 1999. It is held by ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' [[Scottish newspapers|newspaper]] in [[Prestonfield, Edinburgh]].

Although the awards ceremony has been held once at the [[Royal Museum]], [[Prestonfield House]] Hotel is considered to be the home of the event. At the 2004 ceremony &amp;ndash; held at the Prestonfield &amp;ndash;  former [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] and [[life peer]] [[Mike Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie|Mike Watson]], set fire to a curtain, and was subsequently convicted of [[wilful fire raising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4269808.stm |title=Fire-raising peer sent to prison |work=[[BBC News]] | date=22 September 2005 |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2009}}
'''Seniority''' is the concept of a person or group of people taking precedence over another person or group because the former is either older than the latter or has occupied a particular position longer than the latter. Seniority is present between parents and children and may be present in other common relationships, such as among siblings of different ages or between workers and their managers.

Under a seniority system, control is often granted to senior persons due to length of service in a given position. When persons of senior rank have less length of service than their subordinates, "seniority" may apply to either concept.

== In armed forces ==&lt;!--linked from [[Adrian Johns]]--&gt;

In some military [[command structure]]s, the length of time someone has held a particular rank is called "seniority in grade" and determines whether that person is senior to another person of the same [[military rank|rank]]. For instance, a captain who was promoted five years ago can give orders to a captain who was promoted three years ago.

== In politics ==

Seniority in [[United States politics]], when used out of context, is informally defined as the number of years one member of a group has been a part of the group. For example, as of January 2015, [[John Conyers]] from [[Michigan]] is the most senior member of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/seniority&lt;/ref&gt; However, "seniority" can also refer to political power attained by position within the United States Government. For further details, see:
* [[United States Order of Precedence]]
* [[United States Presidential Line of Succession]]
* [[Seniority in the United States Senate]]
* [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives]]
Seniority is viewed sometimes both positively and negatively. Many elected officials are viewed as retaining their position only because they have been there for many years, which can reflect voter stagnancy and the benefits of incumbency. On the other hand, long years of [[Incumbent|incumbency]] can also be seen as a sign of the person's ability to continue pleasing voters or the use of seniority to deliver benefits to constituents.

In some countries the [[Dean of the Diplomatic Corps]] receives special treatment.

== In employment ==
In [[trade union|unionised]] companies, employees with more seniority may enjoy more work privileges. Here are examples: 
* [[Shift work]] at more favourable times
* Work that is deemed easier or more pleasurable
* Working hours at a more convenient time (convenience being relative to the employee)
* Assignment to work, when a work reduction, or a reduction in available work hours results in layoffs

Seniority also has an influence over [[bump (union)|bumping]] rights, which is a reassignment of jobs, possibly for many people at a time.

Some traditionalist employers, common in smaller, single-operated business, take a "last in, first out" ([[LIFO (education)|LIFO]]) perspective, meaning those who have been there longest or who have [[tenure]] have the right to stay, whereas other employers take a "first in, first out" ([[FIFO (disambiguation)|FIFO]]) or "inverse seniority" viewpoint, which tends to emphasize a new or "fresh start" for the company.

Seniority does have several positive factors to its name.  Individuals may be draws toward specific field or occupation with the knowledge that seniority is obtainable.  If seniority were to be banished as a whole, many higher paid employees would be fired first just because they make more money than their peers.  Seniority does an effective job in helping people, interested in staying at one organization, in working towards having a "marathon" career.  One of the goals of a seniority system is [[employee retention]], which ensures an organization is retaining institutional knowledge, erudite employees, and a wealth of wisdom within an organization for new hires to pool from.  It's important to make sure employees are here to stay. 

Though the principle of seniority does an effective job of protecting long-term employees, in some scenarios, it can fail to address several critical factors.  Firstly, spots secured by seniority casts aside some of the most appealing perspectives.  Individuals will become less driven to enter a field that does not reinforce their efforts with employment.  Secondly, the security of [[tenure]] often encourages mediocrity.  Employees with the knowledge that their spot in the workplace is secured will naturally become less likely to improve their working ethics as they may no longer view improvement as a necessity.  Lastly, a system rewarding individuals for their hiring date does not encourage professional growth.  If individuals are aware they only have to reach a certain time-span of employment to have a guaranteed position in a company, they will not grow professionally once they have reached their mark.   &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/heather-wolpertgawron/pros-and-cons-of-the-seni_b_831740.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In transport ===
[[Commercial aviation]] pilots working for a carrier have their privileges determined by their seniority or generally known as the "pilot seniority list." These privileges can be income level, routes flown, types of aircraft, work schedules and positions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airlineempires.net/blog/2008/03/pilot-seniority-101-part-1-the-sacred-cow/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/6984637.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://science.howstuffworks.com/pilot6.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://science.howstuffworks.com/pilot7.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Seniority is most important when deciding which pilots to upgrade to a larger, more complex aircraft type; or for upgrading a [[First Officer (civil aviation)|First Officer]] to the rank of a [[Captain (civil aviation)|Captain]].

[[Engine driver]]s with many [[railway]]s also have a seniority list, but it is focused on work scheduling. Younger engine drivers often serve as back-up personnel and must help out on a very short notice – for example when a colleague calls in sick or has a delay.

'''Sincere voting''' is casting a [[voting|vote]] for an outcome that the voter prefers above all others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Theory of Voting
|first=Robin
|last=Farquharson &lt;!-- |authorlink = Robin Faquharson --&gt;
|publisher=Blackwell (Yale U.P. in the U.S.)

|isbn=0-631-12460-8
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[election]], sincere voting is formally choosing the voter's most preferred [[candidate]]. It might initially seem that all voting would be sincere, since [[voting]] is a method for individuals to contribute to a group decision by expressing an opinion. However, the design of many [[voting system]]s prevents full expression of voter opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolitzky | first1 = Alexander | year = 2009 | title = Fully sincere voting | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825609000074 | journal = Games and Economic Behavior | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 720–735 | doi=10.1016/j.geb.2009.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, voters may attempt to prevent undesired outcomes rather than support positive outcomes. By definition, [[tactical voting|insincere voting]] is when a voter supports an undesired outcome to prevent an even less desired outcome.

==Elections with several candidates==

Elections allowing only one vote among more than two candidates often require a decision between voting sincerely or insincerely. If the voter's most preferred candidate is unlikely to win, the voter often chooses between the two leading candidates by the [[lesser of two evils principle]]. However, [[vote pairing]] is another option that can allow two insincere voters to vote sincerely without changing the runoff outcome between the two leading candidates. For example, in the United States Presidential Election, if a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in the same voting district both agree to vote for third party candidates, they will achieve the same effect in the Democrat/Republican runoff and will also gain the opportunity to vote sincerely for [[Third party (United States)|third party]] candidates.

==Voting systems==

Voting behavior in complex voting systems tends to develop similarly high levels of strategic complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.0038-4941.2005.00294.x | volume=86 | title=Strategic and Sincere Voting in a One-Sided Election: The Canadian Federal Election of 1997* | year=2005 | journal=Social Science Quarterly | pages=129–146 | last1 = Justice | first1 = J.

[[File:Summerfairesign.JPG|thumb|Signs warning of prohibited activities; an example of a social control]]
'''Social control''' is a [[concept]] within the [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]] of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref name="M. Innes"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yXo5ARzFaMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+Social+Control:+Crime+and+Social+Order+in+Late+Modernity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI5JDpgL75xgIVS-0UCh0FRg_z#v=onepage&amp;q=Understanding%20Social%20Control%3A%20Crime%20and%20Social%20Order%20in%20Late%20Modernity&amp;f=false|author=M. Innes|title=Understanding Social Control: Crime and Social Order in Late Modernity - Deviance, crime and social order|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK) 1 Dec 2003, 176 pages, {{ISBN|0335209408}}|accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] identify two basic forms of social control:
# ''Informal means of control'' – [[Internalisation (sociology)|Internalization]] of [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[value (ethics)|value]]s by a process known as [[socialization]], which is "the process by which an individual, born with behavioral potentialities of enormously wide range, is led to develop actual behavior which is confined to the narrower range of what is acceptable for him by the [[Social group|group standards]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lindzey, Gardner (Ed), (1954). Handbook of social psychology. I. Theory and method. II. Special fields and applications. (2 vols)., (pp. II, 655-692). Oxford, England: Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., xx, 1226 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Formal means of social control'' – External [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] enforced by government to prevent the establishment of [[Lawlessness|chaos]] or [[anomie]] in society. Some theorists, such as [[Émile Durkheim]], refer to this form of control as [[regulation]].

As briefly defined above, the means to enforce social control can be either informal or formal.&lt;ref name=Poore&gt;Poore, S. [http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/curric/soc/crime/s_contro.htm Overview of Social Control Theories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822133540/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/curric/soc/crime/s_contro.htm |date=2007-08-22 }}. The Hewett School. Retrieved on: September 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Edward A. Ross]] argues that [[belief]] systems exert a greater control on human behavior than laws imposed by government, no matter what form the beliefs take.&lt;ref name = Ross&gt;Ross, E.A. 2009 (1901). [http://www.transactionpub.com/title/-978-1-4128-1028-9.html Social Control: Control A Survey of the Foundations of Order]. Piscataway, NJ: Transaction Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social control is considered one of the foundations of [[Social order|order within society]].&lt;ref name="E.A. Ross"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c08PekqsQFUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS4turnbTJAhUDOBoKHWYPDqIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=E.A. Ross|title=text|publisher=published by [[Transaction Publishers]] 2009, {{ISBN|1412834279}} |accessdate=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of the concept==
Roodenburg identifies the concept of social control as a classical concept.&lt;ref name="H. Roodenburg"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ1Ty4dxHQ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW2-HgnrTJAhWJHxoKHU9XDgcQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=H. Roodenburg|title=text|publisher=published by Ohio State University Press 2004, {{ISBN|0814209688}} |accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of social control has been around since the formation of organized sociology, the meaning has been altered over time. Originally, the concept simply referred to society's ability to [[Regulation|regulate itself]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sociological Theory and Social Control|author=Morris Janowitz|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=81|number=1|date=Jul 1975|pages=82–108|publisher=The University of Chicago Press Article|jstor=2777055|doi=10.1086/226035}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s, the term took on its more modern meaning of an individual's conversion to [[conformity]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Academics began to study [[Social control theory]] as a separate field in the early 20th century.

The concept of social control is related to the notion of [[social order]], a concept identified as existing in the following areas of society:&lt;ref name="M. Innes"/&gt;
{{bulleted list|The [[Education|education system]]|[[Policing]] and the [[law]]|[[Psychiatry]]|[[Social work]]|The [[welfare state]]|The [[Management|working environment]]}}

==Informal==

===Social values===
Social values present in individuals are products of informal social control, exercised implicitly by a society through particular [[customs]], [[social norm|norms]], and [[mores]]. Individuals internalize the values of their society, whether conscious or not of the indoctrination. [[Traditional values|Traditional society]] relies mostly on informal social control embedded in its customary [[culture]] to socialize its members.

===Sanctions===
Informal sanctions may include [[shame]], [[Appeal to ridicule|ridicule]], [[sarcasm]], [[criticism]], and disapproval, which can cause an individual to stray towards the social norms of the society. In extreme cases sanctions may include social [[discrimination]] and [[social exclusion|exclusion]]. Informal social control usually has more effect on individuals because the social values become [[internalized]], thus becoming an aspect of the individual's [[Personality psychology|personality]].

Informal sanctions check '[[deviant]]' behavior.  An example of a negative sanction comes from a scene in the Pink Floyd film ''[[The Wall]]'', whereby the young protagonist is ridiculed and verbally [[abuse]]d by a high school teacher for writing poetry in a mathematics class. Another example from the movie ''[[About a Boy (film)|About a Boy]]'', when a young boy hesitates to jump from a high springboard and is ridiculed for his fear. Though he eventually jumps, his behavior is controlled by shame.&lt;ref&gt;Holland G., Skinner B. F. ''The Analysis of behaviour (The autoinstructing program)''. McGraw-Hill N. Y., 1961, Lesson 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reward and punishment===
{{see also|Mesolimbic pathway|Reward system}}

Informal controls reward or [[Punishment|punish]] acceptable or unacceptable behavior (i.e., [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]]) and are varied from individual to individual, group to group, and society to society. For example, at a [[Women's Institutes (British)|Women's Institute]] meeting, a disapproving look might convey the message that it is inappropriate to flirt with the minister. In a [[Organized crime|criminal gang]], on the other hand, a stronger sanction applies in the case of someone threatening to inform to the police of illegal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Theoretical bias within the modern media===
Theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]] have argued that [[systemic bias]] exists in the modern media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Powerful ideological, economic and religious [[lobbyists]] have often used school systems and centralized electronic communications to influence [[public opinion]].

==Formal==

===Historically===
Social control developed together with civilization, as a rational measure against the uncontrollable forces of nature, which [[tribe|tribal]] organisations were at prey to, within archaic tribal societies.&lt;ref name="D.S. McIntosh "&gt;{{cite book |jstor=1952567|author=D.S. McIntosh |title=DOI: 10.2307/1952567 (p.619)|publisher=published by The American Political Science Review  September 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[divine right of kings|Rulers]] have [[Legitimation|legitimately]] used [[torture]] as a means of [[mind control]]  as well as [[murder]], [[imprisonment]] and [[exile]] to remove from public space anyone the state authorities deemed undesirable.

In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], harsh penalties for [[crimes]] and [[civil disobedience]] were criticized by [[List of civil rights leaders|philosophers]] such as [[Cesare Beccaria]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]], whose work inspired [[reform movement]]s. These movements eventually led to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, which informs most western [[jurisdictions]] and the similar [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] in 1990.

The word ''[[crime]]''  became part of the [[vocabulary]] of the [[English language]] via [[Old French]], during the [[Middle Ages]], and within the [[Middle English]] of the language.&lt;ref name="B. Hanawalt, D. Wallace"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pIdd74zfZ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-9M7dyLXJAhWJ2hoKHehcChg4ChDoAQgnMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author= B.

In history, [[religion]] provided a moral influence on the community and each person, providing an internal [[locus of control]] oriented toward a [[morality]], so that each person was empowered to have a degree of control over themselves within society. As [[Auguste Comte]] instituted sociology ([[The Course in Positive Philosophy|1830-1842]]), already certain thinkers predicted the discontinuation of a perceived ''false consciousness'' intrinsic to religious belief.  Nevertheless, within the twentieth century, social scientists presumed that religion was still a principal factor of social control.&lt;ref name="R. Stark, W.S. Bainbridge"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVt4yqoeP0YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSmpfmu7XJAhWLcBoKHSBoCMAQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=R.

Comte, and those who preceded him, were breathing the air of a [[revolution]] in the latter part of the eighteenth century ([[French Revolution]]) to bring about a so-called  enlightened way of being in society, which brought about a new [[liberty]] for the individual, without the constraints of an over-seeing [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Wood - [https://books.google.com/books?id=AWI8fmyhN5IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Liberty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipj6nByrXJAhUIcBoKHV2jAwsQ6AEISjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Liberty&amp;f=false text] published by [[Oxford University Press]] September 26, 2009, 800 pages, {{ISBN|0199741093}}  [[Political Science]] [Retrieved 2015-11-29]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context social control through penal and correctional services, the ''rehabilatative ideal'' (Francis Allen 1964) is a key idea that formed within the 20th century—the first principle of which is that behavior is first caused by things that happened before ("Human behaviour is a product of antecedent causes").&lt;ref name="T.G.

===Techniques===
[[Law]] is a technique used for the purposes of social control.&lt;ref name="Roscoe Pound"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1sCffAYNpu0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSmpfmu7XJAhWLcBoKHSBoCMAQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=R.

Historically, homosexuality has been criminalised. In modern times, this is no longer an offence and this is due to shifts in society's values. Howerever, there are still laws regarding age of consent and incest, as these are still deemed as issues in society that require means of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009|title=Roffee, James (2015).

Oberschall, in his work, identifies three elements to the pragmatics of social control as they exist in our current society. These are, confrontational control, such as  [[riot control]] and [[crowd control]], preventative measures to deter non-normal behaviors, which is legislation outlining expected boundaries for behavior,  and measures complementary to preventative measures, which amount to punishment of criminal offences.&lt;ref name="Anthony Oberschall"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT8761v8-x4C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=social+control+riot+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIxrnl-tD5xgIVATwUCh3RJQJZ#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control%20riot%20control&amp;f=false|author=Anthony Oberschall|title=Social Movements: Ideologies, Interests, and Identities|publisher=Transaction Publishers 1995, 402 pages, {{ISBN|1412834368}}|accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities can implement park exclusion orders (prohibiting individuals from frequenting some or all of the parks in a city for an extended period due to a previous infraction), trespass laws (privatizing areas generally thought of as public so police can to choose which individuals to interrogate), and off-limit orders (Stay Out of Drug Areas (SODA) and Stay Out of Areas of Prostitution (SOAP) that obstruct access to these spaces). These are just a few of the new social control techniques cities use to displace certain individuals to the margins of society.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Several common themes are apparent in each of these control mechanisms. The first is the ability to spatially constrain individuals in their own city. Defying any of the above statutes is a criminal offense resulting in possible incarceration.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Though not all individuals subjected to an exclusion order obey it, these individuals are, at the very least, spatially hindered through decreased mobility and freedom throughout the city.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; This spatial constrain on individuals leads to disruption and interference in their lives. Homeless individuals generally frequent parks since the area provides benches for sleeping, public washrooms, occasional public services, and an overall sense of security by being near others in similar conditions. Privatizing areas such as libraries, public transportation systems, college campuses, and commercial establishments that are generally public gives the police permission to remove individuals as they see fit, even if the individual has ethical intent in the space. Off-limit orders attempting to keep drug addicts, prostitutes, and others out of concentrated areas of drug and sex crimes commonly restricts these individuals' ability to seek social services beneficial to rehabilitation, since these services are often located within the SODA and SOAP territories.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

====Broken windows theory in the United States====
In the United States, early societies were able to easily expel individuals deemed undesirable from public space through [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws and other forms of banishment. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, these exclusion orders were denounced as unconstitutional in America&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Herbert, Steve and Katherine Beckett. 2009. Zoning out disorder: Assessing contemporary practices of urban social control. ''Studies in Law, Politics, and Society''. 47: 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently were rejected by the US Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Beckett, Katherine and Steve Herbert. 2008. Dealing with disorder: Social control in the post-industrial city. ''Theoretical Criminology''. 12: 5-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[broken windows theory]] in the 1980s transformed the concepts cities used to form policies, to circumvent the previous issue of unconstitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;Harcourt, Bernard and Jens Ludwig. 2005. Broken windows: New evidence from New York City and a five-city [[social experiment]]. ''The University of Chicago Law Review''. 73: 271-320.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, the environment of a particular space signals its health to the public, including to potential vandals. By maintaining an organized environment, individuals are dissuaded from causing disarray in that particular location. However, environments filled with disorder, such as broken windows or graffiti, indicate an inability for the neighborhood to supervise itself, therefore leading to an increase in criminal activity.&lt;ref name="tented"&gt;Ranasinghe, Prashan. 2010. Public disorder and its relation to the community-civility-consumption triad: A case study on the uses and users of contemporary urban public space. ''Urban Studies''. 48: 1925-1943.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of focusing on the built environment, policies substantiated by the Broken Windows Theory overwhelmingly emphasize undesirable human behavior as the environmental disorder prompting further crime.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; The civility laws, originating in the late 1980s and early 1990s, provide an example of the usage of this latter aspect of the Broken Windows Theory as legitimization for discriminating against individuals considered disorderly in order to increase the sense of security in urban spaces.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; These civility laws effectively criminalize activities considered undesirable, such as sitting or lying on sidewalks, sleeping in parks, urinating or [[drinking in public]], and begging,&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Beckett, Katherine and Steve Herbert. 2010. Penal boundaries: Banishment and the expansion of punishment. ''Law and Social Inquiry''. 35: 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to force the individuals doing these and other activities to relocate to the margins of society.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Not surprisingly then, [[criminalization of homelessness|these restrictions disproportionally affect the homeless]].&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;

Individuals are deemed undesirable in urban space because they do not fit into [[norm (social)|social norms]], which causes unease for many residents of certain neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;England, Marcia. Stay out of drug areas: Drugs, othering, and regulation of public space in Seattle, Washington. ''Space and Polity''. 12: 197-213.&lt;/ref&gt; This fear has been deepened by the Broken Windows Theory and exploited in policies seeking to remove undesirables from visible areas of society.&lt;ref name="tented" /&gt; In the [[post-industrial society|post-industrial city]], concerned primarily with retail, tourism, and the service sector,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; the increasing pressure to create the image of a livable and orderly city has no doubt aided in the most recent forms of social control.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; These new techniques involve even more intense attempts to spatially expel certain individuals from urban space since the police are entrusted with considerably more power to investigate individuals, based on suspicion rather than on definite evidence of illicit actions.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Recent developments==
In the decades leading up to the end of the 1980s, an increased prevalence of the [[Individualism|individual]] as a feature within society led to many new [[List of psychotherapies|therapies]], suggesting the use of therapy as a means of social control (Conrad &amp; Scheider, 1980: Mechanic 1989).&lt;ref&gt;A.V.

{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Statute of the Jewry''' was a [[statute]] issued by [[Edward I of England]] in 1275. It placed a number of restrictions on [[Jews]] of [[England]], most notably outlawing the practice of [[usury]].&lt;ref name="Prestwich"&gt;Prestwich, Michael. Edward I p 345 (1997) Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-07157-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Since the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], Jews had been filling a small but vital role in the English economy. Usury by [[Christian]]s was banned by the [[Catholic Church]] at the time, but Jews were permitted to act as [[moneylenders]] and bankers. That position enabled some Jews to amass tremendous wealth, but also earned them the enmity of the English populace,&lt;ref&gt; Rubenstein, W.D. A History of the Jews p 36 (1996) Macmillan Press. {{ISBN|0-333-55833-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which added to the increasing [[antisemitic]] sentiments of the time, due to widespread indebtedness and financial ruin among the [[gentile]] population.

When Edward returned from the [[Crusades]] in 1274, two years after his accession as [[King of England]], he found that land had become a commodity, and that many of his subjects had become dispossessed and were in danger of destitution. Jews traded land for money, and land was often mortgaged to Jewish moneylenders.

As special direct subjects of the [[King of England|monarch]], Jews could be taxed indiscriminately by the King. Some have described the situation as indirect usury: the monarch permitting and encouraging Jews to practise usury and then taxing the profit. In the years leading up to the Statute, Edward taxed them heavily to help finance his forthcoming military campaigns in [[Wales]], which commenced in 1277. One theory{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} holds that he had exhausted the financial resources of the Jewish community when the Statute was passed in 1275.&lt;ref name="Prestwich" /&gt;

==Provisions==
* Usury was outlawed in every form.
* Debtors of Jews were no longer liable for certain debts.
* Jews were not allowed to live outside certain cities and towns.
* Any Jew above the age of seven had to wear a [[yellow badge]] of felt on his or her outer clothing, six inches by three inches.
* All Jews from the age of 12 on had to pay a special tax of three pence annually.
* Christians were forbidden to live among Jews.
* Jews were licensed to buy farmland to make their living for the next 15 years.
* Jews could thenceforth make a living in England only as merchants, farmers, craftsmen or soldiers.

The licence to buy land was included so that farming, along with trading, could give Jews an opportunity to earn a living with the abolition of usury. Unfortunately, other provisions along with widespread prejudice made this difficult for many.&lt;ref&gt; Glassman, David. Anti-Semitic Stereotypes p 17 (1975) Wayne State University Press. {{ISBN|0-8143-1545-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After fifteen years had passed, it was discovered that Jews widely but secretly continued to practise usury, leading Edward I to issue the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, James. The Jew in the Medieval Community p 394 (1976) Hermon Press. {{ISBN|0-87203-059-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|straight ticket}}
{{voting}}

'''Straight-ticket voting''' or '''straight-party voting''' is the practice of [[voting]] for every candidate that a [[political party]] has on a general election [[ballot]].  In general, straight-ticket voting was a very common occurrence until around the 1960s and 1970s.  Since that time, straight-ticket voting has declined in the United States among the general voting population; however, strong partisans (that is, strong party identifiers) have remained straight-ticket voters.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, Marjorie Randon. Party Politics in America 12th ed. 2007: Longman Classics in Political Science. Pages 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the parties, it was nearly impossible not to vote on a straight-party line vote. Voters would receive a colored ballot with that party's nominees on it.  A split-ticket vote would require two different colored ballots, which confused the voter.{{fact|date=August 2018}}  Often, the voter would choose a specific party, and vote for everyone from that party. Some states have had an option (sometimes known as a '''master lever''')&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/01/10/governor-backs-elimination-master-lever/x68o68mDu9AD1LOTJN5OlO/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; to select "vote straight-ticket Democrat" and "vote straight-ticket Republican" that voters can check instead of voting for each race; states that do so include [[Alabama]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]]. West Virginia, Michigan, and Iowa abolished this practice in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, though Michigan's repeal was blocked by a federal judge due to discrimination issues in 2016 but was reinstated by the 6th Circuit Court and Supreme Court in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/07/21/federal-judge-blocks-michigan-ban-straight-party-voting/87392104/ Federal judge blocks Michigan ban on straight-party voting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/09/07/supreme-court-michigan-straight-ticket/1220941002/ Supreme Court keeps ban on Michigan straight-ticket voting]&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan voted to restore straight-ticket voting through a ballot proposal in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/michigan-voting-proposal-3-results/1885266002/&lt;/ref&gt; Texas's straight-ticket repeal will be effective in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.texastribune.org/2017/06/01/texas-gov-greg-abbott-signs-bill-eliminate-straight-ticket-voting/ Gov. Abbott signs bill to eliminate straight-ticket voting beginning in 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Straight-ticket voting in individual states ==

The straight-ticket voting option differs slightly from state to state.

=== Michigan ===

General-election ballots in Michigan have three sections:

* The partisan section, which includes candidates for partisan offices;
* The non-partisan section, which includes candidates for judgeships, most municipal offices, and school boards; and
* The proposals section, which includes state and local ballot issues.

Voters in Michigan had long been able to vote a straight ticket or a split ticket (voting for individual candidates in individual offices).

Straight-ticket voting only involved the partisan section of the ballot, meaning that if an individual wished to vote in a non-partisan race or for or against a proposal, they had to cast those votes individually. One area in which this issue received attention was in races for the [[Michigan Supreme Court]]. All parties on the ballot can nominate candidates for Justice of the Supreme Court at their party conventions (2–3 months before the election for primary-eligible parties, or before the August primary for alternative parties which nominate only at conventions or county caucuses).  However, the races appear on the ballot in the nonpartisan section, meaning that a straight-ticket vote for either of these parties would not include a vote for that party's candidates for Supreme Court.

The [[Michigan Legislature]] passed and Governor [[Rick Snyder]] signed SB 13 on January 5, 2015, which repeals and abolishes straight-ticket voting in the state. This follows failed attempts to abolish it in 1964 and 2001-2002 after voter referenda repealing abolition. With a $5 million appropriation in SB 13, however, a voter referendum is no longer possible due to a constitutional prohibition on referenda on bills appropriating moneys by the Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/05/snyder-signs-bill-eliminating-straight-ticket-voting/78302866/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2016/01/gov_rick_snyder_signs_bill_eli.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Michigan voters passed a ballot proposal that restored straight-ticket voting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/michigan-voting-proposal-3-results/1885266002/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Carolina ===

North Carolina had an option for voting "straight party" (using the term from an NC ballot) that did not include a vote for the President and Vice President of the United States, through the 2012 elections. A [[voter ID]] law enacted in 2013 abolished all straight-ticket voting in the state, and went into effect in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governor.state.nc.us/newsroom/press-releases/20130812/governor-mccrory-signs-popular-voter-id-law Governor McCrory Signs Popular Voter ID into Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v8.pdf NC General Assembly: SESSION LAW 2013-381]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill eliminating it was HB 589.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the former system, North Carolina made separate selections for the President/Vice President and the straight-party option.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://www.app.sboe.state.nc.us/enrs/samples/DURHAM/8GDURH03.pdf sample ballot from Precinct 3, Durham, North Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt; This idiosyncrasy on the North Carolina ballot was described by some as "a ballot flaw,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Norden |first1=Lawrence |last2=Chen |first2=Margaret |title=How Bad is North Carolina’s Ballot Flaw? The Numbers Say, Pretty Bad. |date=October 21, 2008 |url=http://www.brennancenter.org/blog/archives/how_bad_is_north_carolinas_ballot_flaw_the_numbers_say_pretty_bad/ |publisher=brennancenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially resulting in voters failing to cast a vote for President and Vice President when doing so was their intent. It was introduced in the 1960s to shore up Democrats at the state level as Republicans were gaining strength at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This Year's Butterfly Ballot |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/opinion/27mon2.html?ref=opinion |newspaper=Nytimes.com |date=October 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000 presidential election, there was a 3.15% "undervote" (i.e. (total voter turnout - total votes for President and Vice President) / total voter turnout); in the 2004 presidential election, there was a 2.57% undervote. This means that in raw numbers, more than 92,000 North Carolina voters in the 2000 election turned out to vote but did not vote for president; similarly, in 2004, more than 75,000 North Carolina voters turned out to vote but not vote for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Institute for Southern Studies |title=Voting Rights Watch: Could confusing ballots swing the presidential election in NC? |date=October 20, 2008|url= http://southernstudies.org/facingsouth/2008/10/voting-rights-watch-could-confusing.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Texas ===
[[File:Straight Party voting on Harris County, Texas ballot in 2008 (299101265).jpg|thumb|Straight-party option on Texas ballot in the 2008 general election]]
In Texas, a vote for a straight-party ticket casts votes for all party candidates in all races where the party is fielding a candidate and the voter is eligible to cast a vote, from the President/Vice President (or Governor) to the county constable or justice of the peace. On June 1, 2017, Governor [[Greg Abbott]] signed into law House Bill 25, which eliminates the straight-ticket voting option in Texas for all races beginning in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCullough|first1=Jolie|title=Gov. Abbott signs bill to eliminate straight-ticket voting beginning in 2020|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2017/06/01/texas-gov-greg-abbott-signs-bill-eliminate-straight-ticket-voting/|website=TexasTribune.org|publisher=Texas Tribune, Inc.|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A voter, however, may vote a straight-party ticket and subsequently cast an individual vote in a particular race.  This may happen in cases where
#the voter's party did not field a candidate in a specific race, and the voter wants to cast a vote in that race for one of the candidates from another party, and/or
#the voter does not wish to support the party's candidate in a specific race, but wishes to vote for another candidate in that race.  (However, Texas does not have a "none of the above" option; in a case where a voter wishes not to vote for any candidate in a race where his/her party is fielding one, the voter must cast a vote in each individual race separately and cannot choose the straight-party option.)  An individual vote will override the straight-party vote, but only in those specific races where an individual vote is cast.

Straight-party voting is only available in the general election for partisan elections.  It is not available for:
*party primary elections
*non-partisan races (such as City Council or School Board elections); even if a slate of candidates is endorsed by a particular group the slate cannot be elected on a single ticket, each candidate must be selected individually.
*ballot issues (such as an amendment to the [[Texas Constitution]] or a measure to approve bonds and assess taxes for their repayment), even if a political party officially endorses or opposes such an amendment.

In those cases where a partisan election is combined with a non-partisan election and/or ballot issues, the voter can vote straight-party in the partisan portion, but then must vote individually in the other portion(s).&lt;ref&gt;Texas Election Code, Section 52.071&lt;/ref&gt;

=== West Virginia ===

In West Virginia, voting "straight party" included a vote for all candidates of the party voters selected, including the President and Vice President of the United States. Non-partisan candidates had to be voted separately. In 2015, however, straight-ticket voting was eliminated as an option on ballots through an Act of the State Legislature signed by Governor [[Earl Ray Tomblin]], SB 249.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seneca Nation of Indians]], which operates under a republican form of government on reservations within the bounds of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], offers a straight-ticket voting option. To qualify, a political party must field candidates in each seat up for election in a given year. In practice, only the Seneca Party, which has been the [[dominant-party system|dominant party]] in the nation's politics for decades, has ever received the straight-ticket option. Opponents of the Seneca Party have accused the party of using the straight-ticket option to eavesdrop on voters and punish them with the loss of their jobs if they do not use it, also using the promise of jobs to those running in opposing parties to get them to drop out and deny those parties the straight-ticket option.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Rick (October 26, 2016).

"'''Thank God for Mississippi'''" is a common [[adage]] in the [[United States]], particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]], that is generally used when discussing [[rankings]] of [[U.S. state]]s.&lt;ref&gt; Key, V. O. ''Southern Politics in State and Nation''. New York: A.A. Knopf, 1949. Print. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.newsok.com/health/2013/02/26/thank-god-for-mississippi-or-oklahoma/ |title=Thank God for Mississippi … or Oklahoma? |publisher=Blog.newsok.com |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Since the U.S. state of [[Mississippi]] commonly (or stereotypically) ranks at or near the bottom of such rankings, residents of other states ranking near the bottom may proclaim, "Thank God for Mississippi", since the presence of that state in 50th place spares them the shame of finishing in last place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://hunger.cwsglobal.org/site/News2?id=14125 |title='Thank God for Mississippi' - Church World Service |publisher=Hunger.cwsglobal.org |date=April 26, 2012 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List_of_U.S._states_by_life_expectancy|life expectancy]], or other objective criteria of the quality of life or government in the fifty states.

Mississippi's poor reputation is such a common trope in American culture that when Mississippi does indeed rank well in something, the phrase "Thank God for Mississippi" may get brought up just to discuss how it does not apply in the given circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/mississippi-thad-cochran-108289.html|title=‘Thank God for Mississippi!’|author=Larry J.

[[Territories of the United States]] sometimes have rankings worse than [[Mississippi]]; for example, Mississippi had a [[List of U.S. states and territories by poverty rate|poverty rate]] of 21.9%, while [[American Samoa]] had a poverty rate of 65%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-157.html ''"Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the U.S.: 2014".''

The saying has been attributed since before the induction of [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]] as states in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Popik |first=Barry |url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/thank_god_for_mississippi_thank_heaven_for_mississippi/ |title=The Big Apple: "Thank God for Mississippi" ("Thank Heaven for Mississippi") |publisher=Barrypopik.com |date=October 11, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its use, while found throughout the entire country, is especially common in [[Alabama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zengerle |first=Jason |url=https://newrepublic.com/blog/the-plank/mississippi-education |title=Mississippi Is For . . .
