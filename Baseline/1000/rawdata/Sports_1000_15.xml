The '''2009 Malmö Davis Cup riots''' were anti-[[Israel]] riots in the Swedish city of [[Malmö]] against a [[Davis Cup]] tennis match [[2009 Davis Cup World Group#Sweden vs. Israel|between Sweden and Israel]] on 7 March 2009.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anti-Israel protest staged at Sweden tennis match|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sweden-davis-protests-idUSTRE5261R220090307|publisher=Reuters|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anti-Israel protest turns violent|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2009/03/200937141836935467.html|work=Al Jazeera|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In February, the tennis match had been decided by Malmö's [[Red-Greens (Sweden)|red-green]] city coalition to be closed to the public, a decision that was heavily criticised by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF).&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sweden-Israel Davis Cup to go ahead without public|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/sports/24iht-tennisdavis24.20403874.html|work=The New York Times|date=24 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Owen|last=Gibson|title=Fans banned from Israel's Davis cup tie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/28/tennis-israel-gaza-davis-cup|work=The Guardian|date=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayor of Malmö, [[Ilmar Reepalu]] personally said he thought the game should not be played at all, and the decision was thus considered to be more politically motivated than out of security concerns.&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Davis Cup Double Fault: Israel-Sweden Fan Lockout Stirs Controversy|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/davis-cup-double-fault-israel-sweden-fan-lockout-stirs-controversy-a-611738.html|work=Der Spiegel|date=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Riots==
In anticipation of protests around 1,000 police officers sanctioned off a large area around the Baltic Hall tennis stadium to keep protesters and rioters away.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; A reported 170 truck loads of pavement stones were transported out of the area before the protests, and three schools were closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ole|last=Rothenborg|title=Stenhögar kan stoppa polisinsatsen|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/stenhogar-kan-stoppa-polisinsatsen/|work=Dagens Nyheter|date=4 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, for the first time in history, riot vehicles were brought in from [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jacob|last=Lund|title=Frykter sammenstøt i Sverige|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/sverige/frykter-sammenstoet-i-sverige/a/551211/|work=Verdens Gang|date=7 March 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The match was initially met with protest of around 6,000 to 7,000 anti-Israel demonstrators, with speeches held by the leader of the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]], [[Lars Ohly]], who while wearing a Palestinian scarf was seen holding a map of Palestine with Israel eradicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Karl-Johan|last=Karlsson|title=Här raderar Lars Ohly Israel|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/har-raderar-lars-ohly-israel/|work=Expressen|date=27 February 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Demonstranterna till attack mot polisen i Malmö|url=http://www.expressen.se/kvp/demonstranterna-till-attack-mot-polisen-i-malmo/|publisher=Expressen/TT|date=7 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrators were joined by several hundred militants of which around 200 to 300 began attacking police with stones, fireworks and paint bombs.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Pål|last=Stokka|title=Anti-israelsk demonstrasjon sporet av i Malmø|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/03/07/nyheter/utenriks/sverige/5181651/?www=1|work=Dagbladet|date=7 March 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Israel rioters included [[Antifascistisk Aktion|AFA]] [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascists]], militant [[Islamism|Islamists]], organised [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Linda|last1=Hjertén|first2=Per-Ola|last2=Ohlsson|title=100 omhändertagna efter demonstrationen|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article11689300.ab|work=Aftonbladet|language=Swedish|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Godmorgon, världen!: Söndag 8 mars|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=438&amp;artikel=2682135|publisher=Sveriges Radio|date=6 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=David Nannini|last=Nilsson|title=Nazister väntas till tennismatch|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article11685560.ab|work=Aftonbladet|date=5 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Daniel|last=Poohl|title=Nazister i demonstration mot Davis Cup-match|url=http://expo.se/2009/nazister-i-demonstration-mot-davis-cup-match_2482.html|publisher=Expo|date=5 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as activists from neighbouring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Richard|last=Lööf|title=SVT:s Richard Lööf rapporterar: "Malmö sämsta tänkbara för högriskmatch"|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/svt-s-richard-loof-rapporterar-malmo-samsta-tankbara-for-hogriskmatch|publisher=SVT|date=6 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Kenan|last=Habul|title=De vill göra allt för att stoppa matchen|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/de-vill-gora-allt-for-att-stoppa-matchen/|work=Sydsvenskan|date=7 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police eventually detained around 100 rioters, arresting ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Swedish teen jailed for Davis Cup protest|url=http://www.jta.org/2009/04/29/news-opinion/world/swedish-teen-jailed-for-davis-cup-protest|publisher=JTA|date=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional eighteen rioters were later identified and put on trial for their part in the riots,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Polis angreps av autonoma aktivister vid Davis Cup-match|url=http://www.sakerhetspolisen.se/publikationer/fallstudier-och-artiklar-fran-arsbocker/politisk-extremism/-polis-angreps-av-autonoma-aktivister-vid-davis-cup-match.html|publisher=[[Swedish Security Service]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with several convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Daniel|last=Persson|title=Fängelse för tenniskravaller|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/fangelse-for-tenniskravaller/|work=Sydsvenskan|date=29 April 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Fortsatt rättegång om tennisbråk|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/fortsatt-rattegang-om-tennisbrak/|publisher=Sydsvenskan/TT|date=2 June 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Mikael|last=Funke|title=Fängelse efter tenniskravaller|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/fangelse-efter-tenniskravaller/|work=Sydsvenskan|date=25 February 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Joakim|last=Palmkvist|title=Tre tonåringar dömda för Davis Cup-kravaller|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/tre-tonaringar-domda-for-davis-cup-kravaller/|date=10 September 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The decision to close the tennis match to the public resulted in Malmö being banned from hosting tennis matches by the ITF for five years.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sweden punished for Israel Davis Cup lockout|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/daviscup/5095836/Sweden-punished-for-Israel-Davis-Cup-lockout.html|work=The Telegraph|date=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to having to provide $15,000 in minimum gate receipts for the match, the Swedish Tennis Association was fined an additional $25,000.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; The [[Swedish Tennis Association]] responded by issuing penalties to Malmö mayor Ilmar Reepalu for his involvement in the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Federico|last=Moreno|title=Tennisförbundet skickar ny nota till Reepalu|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/tennisforbundet-skickar-ny-nota-till-reepalu/|work=Sydsvenskan|date=21 April 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest and riots led to accusations of [[antisemitism]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sverige anklagas för antisemitism|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/sverige-anklagas-for-antisemitism/|publisher=Sydsvenskan/TT|date=9 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Anna|last=Ekström|title="Politiker måste agera mot antisemitism"|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/opinion/aktuella-fragor/politiker-maste-agera-mot-antisemitism/|publisher=Sydsvenskan|date=14 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish history professor [[Kristian Gerner]] described the situation as "the worst crisis for Jews in Sweden since the Second World War."&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt;

A 2012 European Men's Handball Championship [[2012 European Men's Handball Championship qualification#Group 4|qualifier between Sweden and Israel]] set to be played in [[Karlskrona]] in June 2011 raised concerns due to the riots, and was considered to be moved to another location by Swedish sports authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Oro i Karlskrona för nya kravaller|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/handboll/article12425388.ab|publisher=Aftonbladet/TT|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Politiker rädda för Israelkravaller|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/handboll/politiker-radda-for-israelkravaller/|publisher=Sydsvenskan/TT|date=21 April 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was played as scheduled, with a minor anti-Israel demonstration being held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sweden-Israel Handball Game Sparks anti-Israel Protests|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/sweden-israel-handball-game-sparks-anti-israel-protests-1.367327|work=The Associated Press and Anna Ekström|publisher=Haaretz|date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Against Chess Olympiad''' ({{Lang-ar|الأولمبياد الضَاد الشطرنج}} ''al-Awlambayād aḍ-ḍādi ash-Shatranji''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.ie/search?q=%22against+chess+olympiad%22&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_en-GBIE647IE647&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGxYHn3aLUAhXEIMAKHYDXAVgQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=887&amp;bih=734#imgrc=aKO0FDZHNSfe1M:|title="against chess olympiad" - Google Search|website=www.google.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was arranged as an alternative to the official [[22nd Chess Olympiad|22nd]] [[Chess Olympiad]], held in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], almost simultaneously. This unofficial Olympiad took place in [[Tripoli]], [[Libyan Arab Republic]] from October 24 to November 15, 1976.

==Background==

When [[FIDE]] decided to award the hosting of the 1976 Olympiad to Israel, it caused considerable controversy, as several countries, including the Soviet Union and all of the Arab nations, did not recognize the state of Israel. After FIDE refused to change the venue, the Soviet team boycotted the tournament in Haifa in protest, as did all the Soviet satellite states in the Eastern Bloc, and the Arab member nations of FIDE. 

The Arab nations held their own Olympiad in Tripoli at the same time as the official one. In the promotion material, this event was called the ''Against Israel Olympiad'', but it has later become known by the politically less volatile name ''Against Chess Olympiad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allermann.blogspot.ie/2014/08/the-against-chess-olympiad.html|title=The Against Chess Olympiad|website=allermann.blogspot.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the unofficial Tripoli Olympiad was a highly charged political event, the actual chess played was on quite a different level. None of the major chess nations, Eastern or Western, came to Libya, meaning the field consisted of the Arab states, a number of minor chess nations, and some that were not members of FIDE at the time. No [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmasters]] were present, and very few [[International Master]]s attended. 

The Philippines, Italy, and Uruguay were the only nations to send teams to both Olympiads, and none of them were able to win any medals at either event.

==Results==

Thirty-four teams played a 13-round [[Swiss system tournament]]. In a somewhat surprising outcome, the completely unknown Salvadoran team, which included 17-year-old talent [[Boris Pineda]], took home the gold medals. Silver and bronze went to Tunisia and Pakistan, respectively.

An '''assault course''' (also called '''trim trail''') is a special sort of [[trail]] that combines [[running]] and [[Physical exercise|exercising]]. It was more popular in the 1970s than it is now.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} It is heavily used in [[military training]]. The prime use is to evaluate progress and weaknesses within the team involved.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

==Military training==
Assault courses are used in military training to increase fitness, to demonstrate techniques that can be used for crossing very rough terrain, and to increase teamwork and self-confidence.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

Often military assault courses will be standardised, and will have, for example (in the UK), a six-foot and a ten-foot wall, a climbing net, some type of bar to climb over, and a high rope or net that must be crossed (these being or representing the most likely difficult terrain that a soldier will come across). The standardisation means that every course will be to the same quality, though it also means that there will be certain parts that may be familiar if practised.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

However, they have different purposes. For example, they can be short (less than a minute) with a range on the end (e.g. Junior Leaders, Folkestone), or long (five minutes) as at Thetford.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} This is partially because of space restraints and training objectives. The short one can be run as an individual course and a warmup for the range. The long Thetford course is more of an exercise in endurance and teamwork.

==Trim trail==
The term "trim trail" has more recently been applied to a series of wooden exercise stations, scattered in parkland or other locations beside a jogging or walking trail, which can be used to develop balance, strength and coordination.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} They are suitable for both adults and children, and the individual stations have been scientifically designed to provide a range of exercise.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} Most have simple instructions attached to them, and the stations include balance beams, sit-up bars, chin-up bars, parallel bars, and more challenging stations such as pole climbs and ladder walks.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} Bristol City Council have now installed trim trails in six parks, ranging in complexity from Withywood Park, which has a single station, to Victoria Park, which has nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loughgallcountrypark.co.uk/?page=cycling&amp;sub=17 |title=Welcome to Loughall Country Park |publisher=Loughall Country Park |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/node/6645 |title=Trim trail exercise stations |publisher=Bristol City Council |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the trim trail at [[Hollingworth Lake]], in [[Greater Manchester]], which was the idea of the Friends of Hollingworth Lake and opened in August 2010, was provided by the [[Big Lottery Fund|Big Lottery]] Community Spaces fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwest.groundwork.org.uk/oldham--rochdale/news--events/news/2010/woodland-wonder-opens-for-all.aspx |title=Woodland Wonder opens for all |publisher=Groundwork Oldham and Rochdale |date=17 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212114711/http://www.northwest.groundwork.org.uk/oldham--rochdale/news--events/news/2010/woodland-wonder-opens-for-all.aspx |archivedate=12 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic sports form the bulk of popular sporting activities, with other major forms including [[motorsports]], [[:Category:Precision sports|precision sports]], extreme sports and [[animal sports]].

Athletic contests, as one of the earliest types of sport, are prehistoric and comprised a significant part of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]], along with [[equestrianism|equestrian events]].&lt;ref&gt;Sansone, David (1992). [https://books.google.com/books?id=z6nrLVrlcTcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=athletics%20derivation&amp;source=gbs_slider_thumb#v=onepage&amp;q=athletic%20equestrian&amp;f=false Greek athletics and the genesis of sport, p.72]. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-08095-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "athletic" is derived from the {{lang-grc|άθλος}} (athlos) meaning "contest." Athletic sports became organized in the late 19th century with the formation of organizations such as the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] in the [[United States]] and the [[Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques]] in [[France]]. The [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States]] (later the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]) was established in 1906 to oversee athletic sports at [[college]]-level in the United States, known as [[college athletics]].

Athletics has gained significant importance at educational institutions; talented athletes may gain entry into [[higher education]] through [[athletic scholarship]]s and represent their institutions in [[athletic conference]]s. Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], people in the developed world have adopted an increasingly [[sedentary lifestyle]]. As a result athletics now plays a significant part in providing routine [[physical exercise]]. [[Sports club|Athletic clubs]] worldwide offer athletic training facilities for multitudes of sports and [[game]]s.

{{TOCLimit|2}}

==Etymology==
The word athletics is derived from the Greek word "athlos" (ἄθλος), meaning "contest" or "task." The [[Ancient Olympic Games]] were born of war and featured various forms of athletics such as [[running]], [[jumping]], [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]] competitions.

In the modern [[English language]] the term athletics has taken on two distinct meanings.  Its meaning in [[Comparison of American and British English|American English]] broadly denotes human physical sports and their respective systems of training.  The other, narrower principal meaning of the word comes from [[British English]] and variants within the [[British Commonwealth]]; this meaning of athletics refers solely to the concept of the [[sport of athletics]] (a category of sporting competition that comprises [[track and field]] sports and various forms of [[foot racing]]), rather than physical sport in general.

== Biological factors ==
[[File:Spalding's official athletic almanac (1800) (14766385385).jpg|thumb|A few athletes]]

Gender and [[human genetics|genetics]] play major roles in athletic [[Somatotype|body types]]. Significantly fewer [[football]] leagues exist for women; however, women have been active in [[martial arts]] for centuries, and sports like [[figure skating]] and [[tennis]] tend to favor women in terms of spectator popularity. [[Basketball]], [[high jump]], and [[volleyball]] favor taller athletes, while [[gymnastics]] and [[wrestling]] favor shorter ones. [[Long-distance track event|Long distance]] runners tend to be thinner, while competitive [[powerlifting|powerlifters]] and [[American football]] players tend to be stockier. Athletic development often begins with athletic parents.&lt;ref name = "Kennedy"&gt;{{cite book | author = Kennedy and Guo | title = Jingwu|year=2010 | page = 2 | publisher = Blue Snake Books | isbn = 978-1-58394-242-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article2745210.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Sadie | last=Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical conditioning is a primary athletic function for competition.  Most often, trainers utilize proven athletic principles to develop athletic qualities; these qualities include coordination, flexibility, precision, power, speed, endurance, balance, awareness efficiency, and timing.&lt;ref name = "Lee"&gt;{{cite book | author = Bruce Lee | title = Tao of Jeet Kune Do|year=1975 | page = 43 | publisher = Ohara Publications | isbn = 0-89750-048-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[physical strength]] is prized over most other qualities in Western athletics,&lt;ref name = "Feinberg"&gt;{{cite book | author = Lisa Feinberg Densmore | title = Ski Faster|year=2000 | page = 22 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn = 0-07-134381-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it is forbidden in the physical conditioning of [[T'ai chi ch'uan]].&lt;ref name = "Thompson"&gt;{{cite book | author = Clem W. Thompson | title = Manual of Structural Kinesiology |year=1989 | publisher = Times/Mirror | isbn = 0-8016-5031-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Witherell"&gt;{{cite book | author = Warren Witherell and David Evrard | title = The Athletic Skier|year=1994 | page = 4 | publisher = The Athletic Skier, Inc.| isbn = 1-55566-117-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sports medicine]] not only treats injuries with [[medical procedure]], but attempts to prevent problems such as [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] and [[Repetitive strain injury|overuse injuries]].  Sports medicine can also include the use of [[massage]], [[glucose test]]ing, [[Rolfing]], [[physical therapy]], and [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|performance-enhancing drugs]] like caffeine and [[anabolic steroid]]s.  

[[Sports nutrition]] is the study and practice of nutrition and diet as they relate to athletic performance. It is concerned with the type and quantity of fluid and food taken by an athlete, and deals with nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, supplements and organic substances such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Although an important part of many sports training regimens, it is most intensely applied in strength sports (such as weight lifting and bodybuilding) and endurance sports (for example cycling, running, swimming).

==Training and coaching==
Athletes first learn basic movement patterns such as running, stopping, jumping and throwing. Coaches help athletes refine these movements into [[sports training|sport specific]] skills. A skill such as high jumping can then be refined into a competitive technique like the Western roll or the [[Fosbury Flop]].  An individual’s expression of a technique is often called a style; while various competitive [[swimming strokes]] are also called styles. Team sports often develop and practice [[play from scrimmage|plays]] or [[strategy|strategies]] where players carry out specific tasks to coordinate a team effort of attack or defense.

Technical training may also include teaching the [[Regulation of sport|rules and restrictions]] of a sport or game.&lt;ref name = "Balmain"&gt;{{cite book | author = Patrick Thias Balmain | title = The Inner Glide|year=2005 | publisher = Destiny Books | isbn = 1-59477-160-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elite athletes and teams require high-level coaching. A [[coach (sport)|coach]] is often associated only with an athlete’s technical development; however, a coach will likely play all the roles of mentor, physical trainer, therapist, medical responder, technical trainer and performance facilitator. Coaches may or may not involve [[sportsmanship]] in their program. Coaching typically signifies a quadrennial, ongoing mentorship for athletic development, as opposed to a clinician who might only assist for a short period of time.&lt;ref name = "Scates"&gt;{{cite book | author = Allen E. Scates | title = Winning Volleyball|year=1989 | pages = 221–251 | publisher = William C. Brown Publishers | isbn = 978-0-697-06351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only must coaches be able to teach technical form, but recognize and correct problems with a teams' or an athlete’s technique and conditioning. Recent advancements in video technology can provide accurate biomechanical data to optimize the form, precision, timing, efficiency and power of an athlete’s movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Critical to a team’s or an athlete’s success is a [[Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing|winning attitude]]. Inherent in the drive to win is the ability to remain relaxed and focused under the pressure of competition. Modern athletic coaches employ the use of [[sports psychology|sports psychologists]] to help athletes organize themselves through visualization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ans/psychology/health_psychology/mentalimagery.html

[[Title IX]] of the Education Amendments of 1972 was created to prohibit sex discrimination in education programs that receive (U.S.) federal funding. The original statute made no reference to athletics or athletics programs. From 1972 to 2006, Title IX underwent a series of amendments for gender equity which became high impact on high school and [[College athletics|collegiate athletics]] because it promoted maximum female participation in athletics through equal spending.

[[Professional sports]] are sports in which athletes receive payment for their performance. Professional athletics is seen by some as a contradiction of the central ethos of sport -- [[competition]] performed for its own sake and pure enjoyment rather than as a means of earning a living.

A '''bodystocking''' is a one-piece [[skin-tight garment]] that covers the torso, legs and sometimes the arms of the wearer. It is a [[foundation garment]] or an article of [[lingerie]] usually made from a [[sheer fabric]] similar to that used for [[stockings]] or [[pantyhose]], or from [[fishnet]], [[lace]] or an opaque material, or a variation of these materials.&lt;ref name=voices&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/bodystockings-sexy-lingerie-many-occasions-695889.html|title=Bodystockings: Sexy Lingerie for Many Occasions|accessdate=26 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619123326/http://voices.yahoo.com/bodystockings-sexy-lingerie-many-occasions-695889.html|archivedate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bodystocking differs from a [[unitard]], which is worn as an outfit or article of clothing, and a [[leotard]], which is used as a practice garment or performance costume for [[acrobatics|acrobats]], [[gymnasts]] and other similar performers. Designed to be revealed, but not to be too revealing, bodystockings may be worn as undergarments by performers such as [[belly dancer]]s and [[exotic dancer]]s.

==Description==
Oftentimes body stockings are made of sheer fabric and are worn with or without undergarments such as a [[Brassiere|bra]].&lt;ref name=voices /&gt; Bodystockings normally come in only two sizes, especially when they use stretch material. A body stocking may be worn for the smooth line it gives or because it cannot become untucked from trousers or a skirt. When worn as underwear, it is usually not worn with other underwear. It may be worn with [[panties]] for extra coverage or a bra for extra support. [[Sheer fabric|Sheer]] body stockings are too revealing to be worn alone.

[[File:CSD 2006 Cologne sexy 2.jpg|thumb|A woman wearing a fencenet bodystocking]]

Opaque bodystockings can be worn in place of [[tights]] and a blouse. Bodystockings also come in fishnet, lace and [[satin]], the latter which may just consist of the top portion of the bodystocking, allowing it to be worn underneath a suit jacket to serve as a blouse. These types of bodystockings are also made sheer, enabling the wearer to wear a more revealing outfit coupled with sheer coverage for line smoothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/26/magazine/this-spring-s-under-statements.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=February 26, 1989, New York Times article |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-02-26 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodystockings are put on through the neck, in a similar technique to putting on a pair of tights: the body and arm sections are rolled down and then the legs are scrunched up like stockings; one would put one foot in and pull the stocking part up, and then the same on the other leg; from the waist, the bodystocking is pulled up over the torso to the chest, and then the arms are scrunched up and put on in same way as the legs; and the garment is then adjusted as required, and any ribbons and fasteners tied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funkybodystockings.co.uk/How-to-Wear-a-Bodystocking_ep_44-1.html How to Wear a Bodystocking]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its design, and its close-fitting and one-piece aspect, the wearer may have to remove the bodystocking in order to urinate or defecate, but crotchless bodystockings are also available. If a bodystocking is a foundation garment, all the over clothing will also need to be removed.

==History==
It is unclear when the first bodystocking was made or when it was first worn.

The first notable occasion, was when American actress [[Adah Isaacs Menken]] wore one in 1861 in the play ''Mazeppa'', based on [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s "[[Mazeppa (Byron)|Mazeppa]]", in which she played a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] man who was tied nude to the back of a wild horse by his enemies. In the scene Menken wore a flesh coloured bodystocking to preserve her [[modesty]] while giving the illusion of nudity. The practice created controversy.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks, Daphne A. “Lady Menken’s Secret: Adah Isaacs Menken, Actress Biographies and the Race for Sensation.” ''Legacy'', Volume 15. Number 1. (1998): pages 68-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funkybodystockings.co.uk/History-of-Bodystockings_ep_49-1.html#first |title=History of Bodystockings |publisher=Funky Bodystockings |date= |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A body stocking was used in a [[tableau vivant]] style short film ''The Birth of the Pearl'' (1901)&lt;ref&gt;Produced by [[Frederick S. Armitage]] for the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]].&lt;/ref&gt; which featured an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-coloured body stocking in a direct frontal pose&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms1.html Sex in Cinema: Pre-1920s]&lt;/ref&gt; and provided a provocative view of the female body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awmi10/d21.html American Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9440">The '''burpee''', or '''squat thrust'''{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, is a full body exercise used in [[strength training]] and as an [[aerobic exercise]]. The basic movement is performed in four steps and known as a "four-count burpee":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130104/new-york-city/real-story-behind-exercise-you-love-hate-burpee |title=The Real Story Behind the Exercise You Love to Hate: the Burpee |publisher=''DNA Info'' |author=Sheryl Dluginski |date=January 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818135031/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130104/new-york-city/real-story-behind-exercise-you-love-hate-burpee |archivedate=August 18, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

# Begin in a standing position.
# Move into a [[Squat (exercise)|squat]] position with your hands on the ground. (count 1)
# Kick your feet back into a plank position, while keeping your arms extended.  (count 2)
# Immediately return your feet into squat position. (count 3)
# Stand up from the squat position (count 4)

==Origin==
The exercise was named in the 1930s for American [[physiologist]] Royal H. Burpee, who developed the ''burpee test''. He earned a Ph.D. in [[applied physiology]] from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] in 1940 and created the "burpee" exercise as part of his Ph.D. thesis as a quick and simple way to assess fitness.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pk.tc.columbia.edu/item/Seven-Quickly-Administered-Tests-Of-Physical-Capacity-And-Their-Use-In-Detecting-Physical-Incapacity-For-Motor-Activity-In-Men-And-Boys-51865 |title=Reference extract from Teachers College, Columbia University archive |work= |publisher=Teachers College, Columbia University |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exercise was popularized when the United States Armed Services adopted it as a way to assess the fitness level of recruits when the US entered [[World War II]]. Consisting of a series of the exercises performed in rapid succession, the test was meant to be a quick measure of agility, coordination, and strength.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/burpee |title=Definition of burpee from Oxford Dictionaries Online |work= |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progression ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}
The way to perform a burpee as originally intended has progressed since the 1930s. The up phase of the burpee used to be with the feet landing between the hands while still grounded, which creates unnecessary pressure on the lower back. It's now more common to land the feet on the outside of the hands.

== Confusion ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}
The burpee is sometimes confused with a [[Sprawl (grappling)|sprawl]]. A sprawl is similar to the burpee with the main difference being that the hips are thrust towards the ground in the plank position.

== Variants ==

; CrossFit speed burpee : The athlete drops to the ground with the chest and thighs touching the floor, creating a hollow back through hip extension, rolling onto the knees getting up, and perform a jump with hands above the head. This version is all about efficiency, high reps.
; Dumbbell burpee: The athlete holds a pair of [[dumbbell]]s while performing the exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_QjiZGhZcM | title=Reebok CrossFit ONE Movement Demo "Dumbbell Burpee" | publisher=Reebok Crossfit One | date=Feb 22, 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Jump-over burpee : The athlete jumps over an obstacle between burpees.
; Jump up burpee : The athlete jumps straight up as high as possible at the end of the movement, before beginning the next burpee.&lt;ref name="dare_BurpJ"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Burpees| website= darebee.com| access-date = February 10, 2018 | url = https://darebee.com/exercises/burpees-exercise.html}} - includes jump and push up variations&lt;/ref&gt;
; Knee push-up burpee : The athlete bends their knees and rests them on the ground before performing the push up.
; Long-jump burpee : The athlete jumps forward, not upward.
; Muscle-up burpee : Combine a muscle-up (a variation of a [[pull-up (exercise)|pull-up]]) with the jump or do a muscle-up instead of the jump.
; One-armed burpee : The athlete uses only one arm for the whole exercise including the [[pushup]].
; One leg burpee : The athlete stands on one leg, bends at the waist and puts hands on ground so they are aligned with shoulders. Next jump back with the standing leg to plank position.  Jump forward with the one leg that was extended, and do a one-leg jump.  Repeat on opposite side.&lt;ref&gt;http://strength.stack52.com/periodic-table-of-bodyweight-exercises/&lt;/ref&gt;
; Parkour burpee : Following one burpee on the ground, the athlete jumps upon a table and performs the second burpee on the table, then jumps back to the initial position.
; Pull-up burpee : Combine a pull-up with the jump or do a pull-up instead of the jump.
; Side burpee : The athlete bends at waist and places hand shoulder-width apart to the side of right or left foot.  Jump both legs out to side and land on the outer and inner sides of your feet.  Jump back in, jump up, and repeat on opposite side.
; Squat Thrust : Same as a four-count burpee.
; Tuck-jump burpee : The athlete pulls their knees to their chest (tucks) at the peak of the jump.

{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}

A '''bye''' in sports (and certain other competitions) refers to organizers scheduling a competitor to not participate in a given round of competition, due to one of several circumstances. 

In [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out (single-elimination) tournaments]] this can be granting a special privilege to reward the best ranked participant(s), or to make a working [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]] if the number of participants is not a power of two (e.g. 16 or 32) - or both. 

In [[round-robin tournament]]s, usually one competitor gets a bye in each round when there are an odd number of competitors, as it is impossible for all competitors to play in the same round. However, over the whole tournament, each plays the same number of games as well as sitting out for the same number of rounds.

Similar to the round-robin context, in league sports with weekly regular-season play such as [[gridiron football]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]], a team not scheduled to play on a given week or fixture (competition period) can be said to be on its "bye week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fantasy Football Terms You Need to Know|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/fantasy-football-terms-you-need-to-know.html|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byes are needed if there is an odd number of teams, but can be used even with an even number of teams, as has been done in the NFL.

==Elimination tournaments==

In a standard [[single-elimination tournament]], each round has half the number of teams as the preceding round. Thus the finals will have two, the semi-finals will have four, the quarter finals will have eight, etc. Thus tournaments with competitors numbering a [[Power of two#The first 96 powers of two|power of two]] can have a standard bracket in which all teams are paired up with the loser of each match eliminated and the winner moving on to the next round until only one champion remains.

Therefore, if the number of teams is not a power of two, a simple elimination tournament would eventually produce a round with an odd number of teams (if the number is not odd to start with). For example, a tournament of nine teams could only have four matches in the first round, while a simple tournament of ten teams would produce a second round with five teams, meaning only two matches could occur.
Thus, if the number of participants is not a power of two (e.g. 16 or 32), to make a working [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]] byes are provided to automatically move certain participants into a later round without requiring them to compete in an earlier one. 

When participants are ranked, participants with the highest ranking going into the tournament are given a bye to the second round, as it is generally seen as an advantage to be assured entry into a later round. In the [[National Football League playoffs|NFL playoffs]], for example, the top two division-leaders in each conference are given byes to the second round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ob1gui/nflrules.htm |title=NFL PLayoff Seeding &amp; Tie Breaker Rules |publisher=Home.earthlink.net |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) also grants a bye to its two division winners, directly to the division finals as four other teams compete in a semi-final week. In other tournaments where teams are unranked, random draw may be used to determine the byes.

The number of teams offered a bye is generally designed to ensure that the next round consists of a power-of-two number of teams so the tournament can proceed as a simple single-elimination tournament from that round onward. 

If the byes are all single first-round byes into the second round of a tournament, the number of byes required is the difference between the number of teams and the next-highest power of two. For example, a 12-team tournament will require four byes (16−12) to ensure that instead of six teams in the second round, eight advance (as the four byes avoid two of the four teams being eliminated).

===Examples from Gaelic football===
In the Provincial Championships of Gaelic football, some teams receive a bye due to the irregular number of teams competing in each province. The different numbers resulted in different byes alignments in each Provincial Championship.

For example, below is an assessment of the 2012 Provincial Championships, and their use of the "bye".

Seven teams contested the [[Connacht Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Connacht Senior Football Championship]], so a quarter-final was not played by [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]]. Mayo therefore advanced directly to the semi-final to await the winner of the game between [[Leitrim GAA|Leitrim]] and [[London GAA|London]].

Eleven teams contested the [[Leinster Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Leinster Senior Football Championship]], so five teams were given first round byes. Three teams ([[Carlow GAA|Carlow]], [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] and [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]]) played winners of the three preliminary matches, while the other two played each other in the quarter-finals without playing a game in the preliminary round.

Six teams contested the [[Munster Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Munster Senior Football Championship]], so two teams ([[Clare GAA|Clare]] and [[Cork GAA|Cork]]) were permitted to advance to the semi-finals without playing a game in the quarter-finals.

Nine teams contested the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Ulster Senior Football Championship]], so only [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] and [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]] played in the preliminary round, while the other seven advanced via bye to the quarter-finals without playing a game in the preliminary round.

==="Double Byes"===

While less common, byes can be offered for multiple rounds (e.g. a "double bye" directly into the third round), or starting in a later round (e.g. the top-ranked team in the first round is given a bye straight to the third round). A bye granted in a later round of the tournament eliminates the need for two byes in the previous round. 
 
In the English [[FA Cup]], the football clubs in the top two [[English football league system#The system|league divisions]] receive two-round byes and enter in the third round "proper" (of eight); the two next-highest divisions' teams will have entered in the first round. Another example is the [[UEFA Europa League]].

The [[WNBA]] also grants double byes to the league's top two seeds, while the next two seeds get first-round byes for their [[WNBA Playoffs|playoffs]].

In [[NCAA Division I]] basketball, the [[2009 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament]] introduced "double byes", as the conference invited all 16 members to participate for the first time (previously only the top twelve were invited). To limit the number of games each round to four, the four highest seeded teams were advanced to the third round of competition, the 5th-8th seeded teams given byes to the second round, and the bottom eight competed the first day. 

Due to the [[2010–2014 NCAA conference realignment|realignment of major conferences]], "double byes" were no longer needed by the Big East after 2013, but were added by the [[2013_SEC_Men's_Basketball_Tournament|SEC in 2013]], the [[2014_ACC_Men's_Basketball_Tournament|ACC in 2014]], and the [[2015_Big_Ten_Conference_Men's_Basketball_Tournament|Big Ten in 2015]].

===Hidden Byes (Play-in Games)===

In certain tournaments, the byes are somewhat disguised. When more teams are given first-round byes than actually compete in the first round, these first games may be referred to as "play-in" games and might not be a formally labelled as a tournament round.

Since 2012, the [[Major League Baseball postseason|Major League Baseball playoffs]] has included ten teams consisting of six division winners and four wildcard teams (the top-ranked non-division-winners). The first round of the playoffs consists two [[Major League Baseball wild-card game|wild-card games]]: single-game matches in which the four wild-card teams are reduced to two. The winners move on to the Divisional series with the six division winners for an eight-team, three-round tournament. Although this is billed as adding two extra "one-game showdowns" to the post-season, it could also be viewed as adding a fourth round to the ten-team tournament with six byes for the division winners. 

The [[FA Cup]] also has certain teams compete in up to 6 preliminary rounds to qualify for the first round "proper". 

Another example is the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which since 2011 has had 68 teams, effectively granting 60 byes, while eight teams compete in the "First Four" games for remaining four spots in the round of 64. From 2011 to 2015, the "First Four" was considered the first round, the round of 64 played on Thursday and Friday, was called the "second round"; the round of 32 was then called the "third round", consisting of games played on Saturday and Sunday. In 2016, the naming reverted to the round of 64 being the "first round" once again, and the round of 32 being the "second round".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leger |first=Justin |title=NCAA To Rename 'Rounds of 64 and 32' To 'First And Second Rounds' In 2016 |url=http://nesn.com/2014/11/ncaa-to-rename-rounds-of-64-and-32-to-first-and-second-rounds-in-2016/ |publisher=[[New England Sports Network|NESN]] |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though the play-in round and all eight of those teams are officially part of the tournament.

==American and Canadian Football/Rugby Bye weeks==

Certain professional [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[gridiron football|gridiron]] football leagues use the term "bye week" for any week during the regular season in which a team does not play a game. (School teams may also have non-competing weeks, but these are scheduled by individual schools and more commonly termed "open dates".)

===United States===

Each [[National Football League | NFL]] team has one "bye week" during a normal season; this is placed on the team's schedule, usually falling between Week 5 and Week 11 inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating the NFL Schedule|url=https://operations.nfl.com/the-game/creating-the-nfl-schedule/|website=NFL Operations|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The NFL added the bye week in [[1990 NFL season | 1990]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/28/sports/nfl-lengthens-its-season-to-fit-new-tv-arrangement.html|title=N.F.L. Lengthens Its Season To Fit New TV Arrangement|author=Eskenazi, Gerald|date=February 28, 1990|publisher=''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to extend the 16-game regular season schedule to span 17 weeks to increase the number of viewable games for TV contracts. The [[1993 NFL season]] spanned 18 weeks with each team having 2 bye weeks. In the rare case of a game postponement that cannot be made up within the week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/14/sports/sp-nflrep14|title=Texans game postponed due to storm | agency= Associated Press | work = Los Angeles Times |date=September 14, 2008|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a bye week may act as an available date to reschedule the delayed game, with the day of postponement acting as the new "bye week"; although both teams would have to be available on the same bye week; this was done during the [[2008 NFL season]] when the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[Houston Texans]] had to reschedule their Week 2 matchup in Houston due to [[Hurricane Ike]], which also impacted the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]' schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80ac4273&amp;template=without-video&amp;confirm=true |title= Ravens-Texans game postponed; Bengals also affected|accessdate=September 14, 2009 |work=[[NFL.com]]|publisher= |date=September 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] were given a Week 1 bye week due to [[Hurricane Irma]] in the 2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thephinsider.com/2017/9/6/16262418/2017-miami-dolphins-hurricane-irma-schedule-adjusted-week-1-tampa-bay-buccaneers-week-11-bye-week|title=Miami Dolphins schedule after Hurricane Irma Week 1 delay: History and oddity|author=Nogle, Kevin|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=The Phinsider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1960 NFL season | 1960]] and [[1966 NFL season | 1966]] NFL seasons, the league had an odd number of teams due to expansion. Each week during those seasons, one team had a bye, including one team each in the first and last week of the season. (Thus, because they had to play all their games with no break in the middle, those two teams effectively had ''no'' byes.) The [[American Football League]] (at the time a completely separate league, but later became the [[American Football Conference]]) also had an odd number of teams in 1966 and 1967 following the addition of the Miami Dolphins, leaving each team with two bye weeks.

Between the [[1999 NFL season| 1999]] through [[2001 NFL season | 2001]] seasons, the NFL had an odd number of teams, 31, as a result of the [[Cleveland Browns]] re-entering the league. Each week during these three seasons featured at least one team with its bye week (the 2001 season also added an additional impromptu league-wide bye the weekend after the [[September 11 attacks]]). The league returned to having an even number of teams (32) in the 2002 season with the addition of the [[Houston Texans]], and implemented the current bye week system.

Sarcastically, the media may refer to a team having a "bye week" if that team is playing an especially bad team and is all but assured of a win.

===Canada===

Traditionally, the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] has had nine teams and required bye weeks. Beginning 2018, each team has three bye weeks and 18 games over a 21-week regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/cfl-to-announce-immediate-end-to-full-contact-practices-1.855515|title=CFL immediately ends full-contact practices|author=Naylor, Dave|date=September 17, 2017|publisher=TSN}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most seasons, (from 2014 to 2017 and prior to 2007), each team has two bye weeks during the 20 week 18-game regular season.  When the league had only 8 teams, the league usually had no bye weeks.  However between 2007 and 2013, the league had one bye per team over in two weeks in August (4 teams would have a bye during week 6 and the other 4 teams would have a bye on week 7).

===Australia===

In Australia's [[National Rugby League]] (NRL), each team has two byes each season. During the representative period of the season (such as the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]]), byes are generally scheduled to the clubs that are expected to have the most players involved in the representative match, in the round preceding (or following) the representative fixture, to allow those clubs to sufficiently rest those players and prevent them from fielding a weakened side. On the competition ladder, teams are awarded two points (equivalent to a win) during their bye week except for the [[Melbourne Storm]] in 2010, who were barred from receiving premiership points for the remainder of the season as a punishment for [[Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal|gross long-term breaches of the salary cap]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrl.com/melbourne-storm-breach-nrl-salary-cap/tabid/10874/newsid/58359/default.aspx Melbourne Storm breach NRL salary cap], ''NRL.com official website'', 22 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Australian Football League]], which comprises an even number of clubs, gives each club a bye week in mid-season. In  [[1915 VFL season|1915]], [[1919 VFL season|1919]] [[1924 VFL season|to 1924]], [[1942 VFL season|1942]] [[1943 VFL season|and 1943]], [[1991 AFL season|1991]] [[1994 AFL season|to 1994]] and [[2011 AFL season|2011]], when there were an odd number of clubs competing, each club was given two byes.

In both leagues, and under many other professional and amateur sports leagues in Australia, higher placed teams don't earn byes during [[playoffs|finals]], but instead the opportunity not to be eliminated by losing their first-round match (also called a double chance).  This practice is common in Australia, but it is not used in most other countries, to earn an easier passage to the Grand Final as reward for finishing higher on the ladder.  This is different from a double elimination format, in which a team has to lose both in the tournament and the repechage to be eliminated.

== Gymnastics ==

In a variation of the round-robin case, at certain high-level competitions in [[artistic gymnastics]], teams cycle through the apparatuses in an "Olympic Order" with scheduled byes in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grassie |first1=Julia |title=Gymnastics 101: Competition format |url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/gymnastics-101-competition-format |website=NBCOlympics.com |publisher=NBC Universal |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the [[NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championships]] has 36 teams with six teams apiece at six  regional sites, with 12 advancing to two semifinal rounds of six that decide participants for the final "Super Six".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/2018-womens-gymnastics-bracket.pdf|title=Womens Gymnastics Bracket|publisher=NCAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=September 2018}} In each of these nine sextets, each team  competes during four of six "rotations" with the other two as byes - scheduled before the parallel bars and the floor exercise. For example, Semifinal II of the 2018 championships operated as follows &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/2018-womens-gymnastics-2018.pdf|title=Womens Gymnastics 2018|publisher=NCAA}} &lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}

==Swiss system tournaments==
In a [[Swiss-system tournament]] with an odd number of players, one player gets a bye in each round, but not all players will get a bye (as there are fewer rounds than there are players). However, as with the case of NFL "bye weeks", these "byes" do not confer any advantage, or in the case of a seeded tournament, that any player/team receiving one is perceived as any better than one that does not, as all of the participants receive one, whereas the awarding of a bye in a single-elimination tournament most definitely does, in both cases.

The '''cloud swing''' (not to be confused with the '''Mexican cloud swing''') is an aerial act that usually combines static and swinging trapeze skills, drops, holds and rebound lifts.

The apparatus itself is a soft rope about 25-30mm thick. It can be made from a single rope, or from a cotton-filled sheath. On its simplest level the cloud swing resembles a [[Spanish web]] in length and width, with each end braided and spliced-lashed with a thimble, forming a loop. Two high-caliber swivels are required to support the weight; the swivels are anchored to a crane bar or a stationary rig, with the swing itself hanging in a "V" shape. Generally, the motion provided to swing the performer is supplied by an assistant pulling on a tether at the bottom of the "V". "Cloud swing" is often performed at lower altitudes relative to "Mexican cloud swing". This is what distinguished "cloud swing" from "Mexican cloud swing".

The cloud swing is a relatively new apparatus, and many of the figures performed on it are borrowed or adapted from static and swinging [[trapeze]].

A '''combat sport''', or '''fighting sport''', is a competitive [[contact sport]] that usually involves one-on-one combat. In many combat sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Common combat sports include [[Mixed Martial Arts|mixed martial arts]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[fencing]], [[savate]], [[kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Sanda (Sport)|Sanda]], [[Tae Kwon Do]], [[Capoeira]], [[Brazilian Jiu-jitsu]], [[Historical medieval battles|HMB]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]], [[Kyokushin]], and [[Kūdō]].

== History ==
{{further information|History of martial arts}}
[[Folk wrestling|Tradition styles of wrestling]] exist in most cultures; [[wrestling]] can be considered a [[cultural universal]]. [[Boxing]] contests date back to ancient [[Sumer]] in the 3rd millennium BCE and [[ancient Egypt]] ''circa'' 1350 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boxing|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/boxing|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|accessdate=May 12, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Olympic Games]] included several combat-related sports: [[Hoplitodromos|armored foot races]], boxing, wrestling, and [[pankration]], which was introduced in the [[Olympic Games]] of 648 BCE.

In [[ancient China]], combat sport appeared in the form of [[lei tai]]. It was a no-holds barred combat sport that combined boxing and wrestling. There is evidence of similar combat sports in ancient Egypt, [[History of India|India]] and [[History of Japan|Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brownell|first=Susan Elaine|title=The olympic movement on its way into Chinese culture|date=1990|publisher=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]]|pages=29, 63|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ita1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=ancient+leitai|language=en|quote=In both ancient China and Greece, the most popular sports were probably wrestling, boxing, and combinations thereof (Greek pankration, Chinese leitai). The same might be argued for ancient Egypt, India and Japan. [...] In both ancient China and Greece, the no-holds-barred combat sport (Greek pankration, Chinese leitai) was probably the most popular one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[Middle ages]] and [[Renaissance]], the [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]] was popular. Tournaments were competitions that featured several mock combat events, with [[jousting]] as a main event. While the tournament was popular among [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s, combat sports were practiced by all levels of society. The [[German school of fencing|German school]] of late medieval martial arts distinguished sportive combat (''schimpf'') from serious combat (''ernst''). In the [[German Renaissance]], sportive combat competitions were known as [[Fechtschule]]n, corresponding to the [[Prize Playing]] in [[Tudor England]]. Out of these Prize Playing events developed the English [[boxing]] (or ''prizefighting'') of the 18th century, which evolved into modern boxing with the introduction of the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]] in 1867.

[[Amateur boxing]] has been part of the modern Olympic Games since their introduction in 1904. [[Professional boxing]] became popular in the United States [[Boxing in the 1920s|in the 1920s]] and experienced a "golden age" [[Boxing in the 1950s|after World War II]].

The creation of [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] is attributed to the [[Gracie family|Gracie]] family of Brazil in 1925 after Asian martial arts were introduced to Brazil. [[Vale-tudo]], wrestling, [[muay thai]] kickboxing and luta livre gained popularity.
Modern [[Muay Thai]] was developed in the 1920s to 1930s. [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] was introduced in the [[Soviet Union]]. Modern [[Taekwondo]] also emerged after the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] and became an Olympic sport in 2000. [[Sanshou]] as part of [[Wushu (sport)|modern wushu]] was developed in the [[People's Republic of China]] since the 1950s. [[Kickboxing]] and [[full contact karate]] were developed in the 1960s and became popular in Japan and the West during the 1980s and 1990s. Modern [[Mixed Martial Arts]] developed out of the interconnected subcultures of [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] and [[shoot wrestling]]. It was introduced in Japan in the form of [[Shooto]] in 1985, and in the United States as [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) in 1993. The [[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]] were introduced in 2000, and the sport experienced peak popularity in the 2000s. During this period, multiple brands and promotions were established. The most well-known promotion for MMA is UFC.

== Popularity of combat sports by gender ==
Combat sports are generally more popular among men, both as athletes and as spectators. For many years, participation in combat sports was practically exclusive to men; [[USA Boxing]] had a ban on women's boxing until 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Boxing/About-Us/History-of-Amateur-Boxing.aspx|title=History of Amateur Boxing|work=Team USA|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A study conducted by Greenwell, Hancock, Simmons and Thorn in 2015 revealed that combat sports had a largely male audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenwell, Hancock, Simmons, Thorn|year=2015|title=The effects of gender and social roles on the marketing of combat sport.|journal=Sport Marketing Quarterly|volume=24|issue=1|page=19|issn=1061-6934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combat sport promotions such as UFC or [[Bellator MMA]] are generally advertised to men.

== Modern sports ==
Combat [[Sportsperson|athletes]] usually [[fight]] one-on-one. Different sports involve different skill sets and moves. For example, [[boxing]] only allows [[Punch (strike)|punches]], [[taekwondo]] largely involves [[kick]]s, and both [[muay thai|Muay Thai]] and [[Burmese boxing]] allow the use of [[Elbow (strike)|elbows]] and [[Knee (strike)|knees]]. There are also combat sports based on [[grappling]], such as both [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Collegiate wrestling]]. Modern [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] is similar to the ancient Greek Olympic sport of [[pankration]]; Both allow a wide range of both [[strike (attack)|striking]] and grappling techniques.

Some combat sports involve the use of [[weapons]] and armor, such as [[fencing]], [[kendo]], and the new sport [[SCA Heavy Combat]]; In [[Gatka]] and [[Modern Arnis]], sticks are used.

==Techniques==

The techniques used can be categorized into three domains: [[Strike (attack)|striking]], [[grappling]], and [[martial arts weapon|weapon usage]], with some [[hybrid martial arts|hybrid]] rule-sets combining striking and grappling. In combat sports the use of these various techniques are highly regulated to minimize permanent or severe physical damage to each participant though means of organized officiating by a single or multiple referees that can distribute penalties or interrupt the actions of the competitors during the competition. In weapon based sports, the weapons used are made to be non-lethal by means of modifying the striking portions of the weapon and requiring participants to wear protective clothing/armor.

== Olympic Combat Sports ==
* [[Amateur boxing]] - (1904 - 2016). Boxing has been staged at every summer Olympic games since 1904 except Stockholm in 1912 due to Swedish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/boxing-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Boxing Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Judo]] - (1964, 1972 - 2016). Judo was not included in the 1968 Mexico City summer Olympics. Women's judo was added to the Olympics in 1992 in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/judo-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Judo Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Taekwondo]] - 1988 Seoul Games (demonstration sport), 2000 - 2016. Became an official medal sport at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/taekwondo-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Taekwondo Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wrestling ([[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]]) - (1908 - 2016). The first form of wrestling to be held at the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/wrestling-greco-roman-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Wrestling Greco Roman Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wrestling ([[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]]) - (1920 - 2016). Was modified at the 2000 Sydney Games and reduced the amount of weight categories provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/wrestling-freestyle-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Wrestling Freestyle Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pankration]] and [[singlestick]] are two other forms of combat sports that have been included in the olympics. These combat sports were introduced to the Olympic Games in the early 1900s however singlestick was only represented at the 1904 Olympic games and pankration whilst lasting four centuries in Ancient Greek Olympia's, was not included at all after 1900.
* [[Fencing]] - (1896 - 2016) Competitive fencing is one of the five activities which have been featured in every modern Olympic Games, the other four being athletics, cycling, swimming, and gymnastics.

== Protective Gear/Clothing ==
In combat sports, victory is obtained from blows, punches or attacks to the head to a point of physical injury that the opponent is unable to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ama.com.au/position-statement/combat-sport-2015|title=Combat Sport - 2015|date=2015-11-21|website=Australian Medical Association|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of combat sport have different rules and regulations into the equipment competitors have to wear. In Amateur boxing seen at the Olympics, competitors are permitted to wear head guards and correctly weighted padded gloves, mouth guards are optional and the canvas floor protection from a hard fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/boxing-equipment-and-history|title=Boxing Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sports such as Taekwondo, competitors are permitted to wear a trunk protector, head guard, gloves, groin guard and shin and forearm pads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/taekwondo-equipment-and-history|title=Taekwondo Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional boxing and UFC are two of the most dangerous combat sports in the world due to the lack of protective gear worn. Competitors in these two sports have the option to wear a mouthguard and must wear suitable gloves. The lack of protective clothing makes competitors vulnerable to concussion and further traumatic head injuries. A scientific experiment, conducted last year by Dr Andrew McIntosh of ACRISP at the Federation University of Australia, tested the impact of 7 different head guards in combat sport. The results of the experiment revealed the benefits of the combination of a glove and headguard in maximising the impact energy attenuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/17/1113.full|title=Sign In|publisher=|pmid=26192195}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by Lystad showed that combat sports with little to no protective gear such as MMA or boxing has an injury incidence rate range of 85.1-280.7 per 1000 athletes in comparison to another striking combat sport like Taekwondo which has a large amount of protective gear such as pads, headgear, mouth guard and gloves, has an injury incidence rate range of 19.1-138.8 per 1000 athletes. This means that injury rates are drastically lowered when protective gear is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lystad|first=Reidar|year=2015|title=Epidemiology of injuries in full-contact combat sports|journal=Australasian Epidemiologist|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''List of Protective Gear/Clothing'''
* Gloves
* Head gear
* Mouthguard
* Shin Guards
* Arm Guards
* Groin Guard
* Trunk Protector
* Wraps (Material wrapped around the hand that provides added protection and support)

== Fighting area ==
*Mat
::Circular, rectangular layout
*Ring
::boxing ring, sumo ring ([[dohyō]]), sand ring
*Fenced area (generically referred to as "cage")
::Can be round or have at least six sides. Cages vary: some replace the metal fencing with a net, others have a different shape (a hexagon, an octagon). The fenced area is called a cage, or a hexagon, an octagon depending on the shape.
*No-rope ring (sometimes referred by fans as "the pit") 
::A circle which is 27 feet in diameter, of which the inner 24 feet is colored blue. The next 3 feet is yellow, which is the caution area. When the fighter gets to the yellow area, he knows he's getting close to stepping out-of-bounds. The last edge of the ring is the red zone, which features a 30-degree upward angle. When a fighter steps on the red area, he's stepping up slightly, letting him know he's out-of-bounds.

[[File:Curtain call.jpg|thumb|319px|[[Turandot]] directed by [[Roberto De Simone]]. January 2012, [[Teatro Comunale Bologna]]]]
A '''curtain call''' (often known as a '''walkdown''' or a '''final [[Bowing|bow]]''') occurs at the end of a performance when individuals return to the stage to be recognized by the audience for their performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060108193717/http://www.biography.ms/Acting_terms.html Theater Terminology] ''Biography.ms''.  URL Accessed July 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolshows.demon.co.uk/resources/technical/gloss1.htm Glossary of Theatre Terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618145841/http://www.schoolshows.demon.co.uk/resources/technical/gloss1.htm|date=2006-06-18}} ''Schoolshows.demon.co.uk''. URL Accessed July 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[musical theatre]], the performers typically recognize the orchestra and its conductor at the end of the curtain call. [[Luciano Pavarotti]] holds the record for receiving 165 curtain calls, more than any other artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mervinblock.com/60-minutes-story-about-singer-hits-false-note|title='60 Minutes' Story About Singer Hits False Note|last=Block|first=Mervin|date=October 15, 2004|publisher=Poynter Online|accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in film and television==
In film and television, the term "curtain call" is used to describe a sequence at the end of the film and before the closing credits, in which brief clips, stills, or outtakes featuring each main character are shown in sequence with the actor's name captioned. This sequence results in a similar individual recognition of each actor by the audience as would occur in a stage curtain call. This is not common, but when seen is more common in films that are light-hearted and have many characters, or perhaps a long list of cameo appearances.

On occasion, long-running television series, particularly those filmed in front of a live audience, have featured a theater-style curtain call at the conclusion of their runs, with the cast breaking character and often showing the audience and crew. The final episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', entitled "[[The Last Show (Mary Tyler Moore Show episode)|The Last Show]]" was a famous example of this. Since then, this term has been, more or less, associated with the [[series finale]] of a particular show.

==Sports curtain calls==
Athletes who also perform well may return to the field of play after a big play or at the conclusion of the game for recognition. Professional [[baseball]] players usually take their cap or helmet by the brim and hold it in the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060720/NEWS99/307200001 Detroit Free Press] ''Freep.com''. URL Accessed July 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to baseball historian Peter Morris, in May 1881 Detroit fans cheered a home run by Charlie Bennett until he bowed to them.

On October 3, 1951, after [[Bobby Thomson]] hit [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|the pennant-winning home run]] for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] in the ninth inning of the third game of the National League playoff, jubilant Giants fans swarmed the playing field of the [[Polo Grounds]], running after the triumphant Giant players, who raced towards the clubhouse which was located in center field. Author [[Joshua Prager (writer)|Joshua Prager]], in his definitive volume of Thomson's homer ''The Echoing Green'', wrote, "(T)housands of fans hungry for a curtain call stood now outside a green clubhouse chanting 'We want Thomson!' We want Thomson!'" Several minutes later (about 15 minutes after the actual home run), "word reached Thomson that he was wanted outside, that only a curtain call might dissipate the stubborn throng ... And so out Thomson went, wading through the packed clubhouse to its top outdoor step." ''[[New York Times]]'' sportswriter [[John Drebinger]] called the crowd's response "the most frenzied 'curtain calls' ever afforded a ballplayer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Echoing Green|last=Prager|first= Joshua|year=2006|publisher=[[Random House|Vintage Books]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=978-0-375-71307-1|pages=235–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Portal|Sports}}

A '''derby''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|d|ɑːr|b|i}} {{respell|DAR|bee}}, {{IPAc-en|us|ˈ|d|ɜːr|b|i}} {{respell|DUR|bee}}) is a type of [[Horse-racing|horse race]] named after the [[Derby Stakes]] run at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]] in England.{{sfn|Reeves|1997|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=taIfkYgVCWIC&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.134]}} That was in turn named after [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby]], who inaugurated the race in 1780.{{sfn|Vesey|2003|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5YiIzxJT5o8C&amp;lpg=RA1-PT110&amp;pg=RA1-PT110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 135]}} Perhaps the best-known example after the original is the [[Kentucky Derby]] in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Freeman|1997|loc=[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=dujiiVP2KJIC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eL9tTPubFY6CvgPVkdz1Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 68]}}{{sfn|Schreifer|Sivell|1996|[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=NhXkvhEQaCQC&amp;lpg=SL11-PA1&amp;pg=SL11-PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.

Traditionally, the term "derby" is used strictly to refer to races restricted to three-year-olds,{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} as the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United Kingdom|English]] and [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S.]] [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] races all are. The most notable exceptions to this rule are the [[Hong Kong Derby]] and [[Singapore Derby]], restricted to four-year-old Thoroughbreds, and the Canadian Pacing Derby, an annual [[harness racing|harness race]] for "aged pacers" ([[Standardbred horse|Standardbreds]]) four years old and up.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In [[Scandinavia]]n harness racing Derby is restricted to four-year-olds. Exception is [[finnhorse|the Finnhorse Derby]], which is restricted to five-year-olds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2521">The exercise '''dưỡng sinh''' or '''Dưỡng Sinh''' (compare Chinese Yang-Sheng 養生&lt;ref&gt;Bryan S. Turner, Yangwen Zheng The Body in Asia 2009 - Page 35 "A summary of this history illustrates the kind of body-cultural analysis advocated here. Like many languages ... Yang sheng, 'to cultivate life,' referred to the Taoist physical exercises that were aimed at achieving bodily immortality."&lt;/ref&gt;) is a form of partly indigenous breathing and [[yoga]] exercise similar to [[Tai Chi]] popularized in Vietnam by the historian and political activist [[Nguyễn Khắc Viện]].&lt;ref&gt;Vietbao [http://vietbao.vn/Suc-khoe/Khoe-voi-duong-sinh-Nguyen-Khac-Vien/40146877/248/ Khỏe với “dưỡng sinh Nguyễn Khắc Viện”] 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Viện had been trained as a medical doctor in the field of women's and children's [[psychotherapy]]. When he himself was given three years to live he turned to practice of traditional breathing exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam News [http://vietnamnews.vn/Sunday/Miscellany/158866/men-battle-mortal-maladies-with-sheer-willpower.html Men battle mortal maladies with sheer willpower] (05-11-2006) I first met him in 1963 after he was expelled from France because of his patriotic activities. Before that, back in the 1950s, his Parisian doctors had given him no more than three years to live as he was suffering from pulmonary consumption and was left with just half a lung after seven operations. Turning to Oriental wisdom while retaining the scientific spirit acquired during his many years in the Western world, Vien created and assiduously applied what he called duong sinh (psychosomatic exercises to preserve the vital breath) that kept him alive and kicking until his death in 1997, at the ripe age of 84.&lt;/ref&gt; However although the name "dưỡng sinh" was popularised by Viện in ''Từ sinh lý đến dưỡng sinh'' and other books, the idea of "dưỡng sinh" is well known to village people anyway as a compliment to [[thuốc Nam]] herbal medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taylor  Modernity and Re-Enchantment: Religion in Post-Revolutionary Vietnam 2007 - Page 99 "There are two kinds of folk medicine known to villagers; one is related to herbal medicine, and the other to a ...dưỡng sinh... Most people in Đại Yên, regardless of age, gender or background, had some knowledge about how to grow and use thuốc nam."&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period, Barcelona gained their motto ''Més que un club'' (''English: More than a club'') because of its alleged connection to [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]] as well as to [[progressivism|progressive]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; During Franco's regime, however, Barcelona was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.com/actualidad/articulo/franco-recibio-medallas-barca/daspor/20031109dasdai_6/Tes|title=Franco recibió dos medallas del Barça |publisher=Diario AS|language=Spanish |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The links between senior Real Madrid representatives and the Francoist regime were undeniable;&lt;ref name="McNeillp261"/&gt; for most of the Catalans, Real Madrid was regarded as "[[the establishment]] club", despite the fact that presidents of both clubs like [[Josep Sunyol]] and [[Rafael Sánchez Guerra]], suffered at the hands of Franco's supporters in the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref name="josepsunyol"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcultural.es/version_papel/LETRAS/21841/El_deporte_en_la_guerra_civil|title=El deporte en la guerra civil |publisher=''EL CULTURAL''|language=Spanish |date= |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpueblodeceuta.es/200906/20090630/200906305111.html |title=Rafael Sánchez Guerra |publisher=''elpueblodeceuta.es'' |language=Spanish |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720140340/http://www.elpueblodeceuta.es/200906/20090630/200906305111.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image for both clubs was further affected by the creation of [[Ultras]] groups, some of which became [[Football hooliganism|hooligans]]. In 1980, Ultras Sur was founded as a far-right-leaning Real Madrid ultras group, followed in 1981 by the foundation of the initially left-leaning and later on far-right, Barcelona ultras group [[Boixos Nois]].

In Catalonia, forces of all the political spectrum are overwhelmingly in favour of Barcelona. Nevertheless, the support of the blaugrana club goes far beyond from that region, earning its best results among young people, sustainers of a federal structure of Spain and citizens with [[left-wing]] ideology, in contrast with Real Madrid fans which politically tend to adopt [[right-wing]] views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/noticias/20090720/53749146392/la-izquierda-es-cule-y-la-derecha-merengue-segun-el-cis-madrid-fc-barcelona-barsa-real-madrid-espany.html|title=La izquierda es culé y la derecha, merengue, según el CIS|publisher=LaVanguardia.com|language=Spanish |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2003/02/28/deportes/1046386805_850215.html|title=¿Del Madrid o del Barça?|publisher=elpais.com|language=Spanish |date=23 February 2003|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1943 Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals===
On 13 June 1943, Real Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 at home in the second leg of a semi-final of the [[Copa del Rey|Copa del Generalísimo]], the Copa del Rey having been renamed in honour of [[General Franco]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph 20111209"&gt;{{cite news|title=Real Madrid v Barcelona: six of the best 'El Clásicos'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/la-liga/8946213/Real-Madrid-v-Barcelona-six-of-the-best-El-Clasicos.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 December 2011|date=9 December 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first leg, played at Barcelona's [[Camp de Les Corts|Les Corts]] stadium in [[Catalonia]], had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,&lt;ref name="p67"/&gt; with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. A campaign began in Madrid. Barcelona player Josep Valle recalled: "The press officer at the DND and ABC newspaper wrote all sorts of scurrilous lies, really terrible things, winding up the Madrid fans like never before". Former Real Madrid goalkeeper [[Eduardo Teus]], who admitted that Madrid had "above all played hard", wrote in a newspaper: "the ground itself made Madrid concede two of the three goals, goals that were totally unfair".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=2l6zHv_reuUC&amp;pg=PA68 Sid Lowe: Fear and loathing in La Liga.. Barcelona vs Real Madrid]" p. 68. Random House. 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. Real Madrid released a statement after the match which former club president (1985–1995) [[Ramón Mendoza]] explained, "The message got through that those fans who wanted to could go to El Club bar on Calle de la Victoria where Madrid's social center was. There, they were given a whistle. Others had whistles handed to them with their tickets." The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker [[Mariano Gonzalvo]] said of the incident, "Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins." Barcelona goalkeeper [[Lluis Miró]] rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As [[Francisco Calvet]] told the story, "They were shouting: ''Reds! Separatists!''... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=2l6zHv_reuUC&amp;pg=PA70 Sid Lowe: Fear and loathing in La Liga.. Barcelona vs Real Madrid]" p. 70. Random House. 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a "completely normal tackle". Madrid's [[José Llopis Corona]] recalled, "At which point, they got a bit demoralized," while Mur countered, "at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'." Madrid scored in minutes 31', 33', 35', 39', 43' and 44', as well as two goals ruled out for offside, made it 8–0. Basilo de la Morena had been caught out by the speed of the goals. In that atmosphere and with a referee who wanted to avoid any complications, it was humanly impossible to play... If the azulgranas had played badly, really badly, the scoreboard would still not have reached that astronomical figure. The point is that they did not play at all." Both clubs were fined 2,500 pesetas by the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] and, although Barcelona appealed, it made no difference. Piñeyro resigned in protest, complaining of "a campaign that the press has run against Barcelona for a week and which culminated in the shameful day at Chamartín".&lt;ref name="Spaaij 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Spaaij |first=Ramn |title=Understanding football hooliganism: a comparison of six Western European football clubs |year=2006 |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-90-5629-445-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i21W_KN_iUMC&amp;pg=284 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sid. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

The match report in the newspaper ''La Prensa'' described Barcelona's only goal as a "reminder that there was a team there who knew how to play football and that if they did not do so that afternoon, it was not exactly their fault".&lt;ref name="p72"&gt;Lowe, Sid. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Another newspaper called the scoreline "as absurd as it was abnormal".&lt;ref name="p67"/&gt; According to football writer [[Sid Lowe]], "There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims."&lt;ref name="p67"&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=2l6zHv_reuUC&amp;pg=PA67 Sid Lowe: Fear and loathing in La Liga.. Barcelona vs Real Madrid]" p. 67. Random House. 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the game, said, "There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=2l6zHv_reuUC&amp;pg=PA77 Sid Lowe: Fear and loathing in La Liga.. Barcelona vs Real Madrid]" p. 77.

===Di Stéfano transfer===
[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|upright|[[Alfredo Di Stéfano]]'s controversial 1953 transfer to Real Madrid instead of Barcelona intensified the rivalry.]]

The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]]. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for [[Club Deportivo Los Millonarios|Los Millionarios]] in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], during a players' strike in his native [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="di Stefano"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28204560 |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; Alfredo Di Stefano: Did General Franco halt Barcelona transfer?|publisher=BBC News |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Real Madrid and Barcelona attempted to sign him and, due to confusion that emerged from Di Stéfano moving to Millonarios from [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] following the strike, both clubs claimed to own his registration.&lt;ref name="di Stefano" /&gt; After intervention from [[FIFA]] representative Muñoz Calero, it was decided that both Barcelona and Real Madrid had to share the player in alternate seasons. Barcelona's humiliated president was forced to resign by the Barcelona board, with the interim board cancelling Di Stéfano's contract.&lt;ref name="di Stefano" /&gt; This ended the long struggle for Di Stéfano, as he moved definitively to Real Madrid.&lt;ref name="di Stefano" /&gt;

Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the initial five [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions Cup]] competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alfredo di Stéfano was one of football's greatest trailblazers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jul/07/alfredo-di-stefano-real-madrid|accessdate=12 October 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the [[UEFA|European]] stage when they met twice at the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], Real Madrid winning in 1960 and Barcelona winning in 1961.

===Luís Figo Transfer===
[[File:Luis Figo-2009 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Luís Figo]]'s transfer from Barcelona to Real Madrid in 2000 resulted in a hate campaign by some of his former club's fans.]]

In 2000, Real Madrid's then-presidential candidate, [[Florentino Pérez]], offered Barcelona's vice-captain [[Luís Figo]] $2.4 million to sign an agreement binding him to Madrid if he won the elections. If the player broke the deal, he would have to pay Pérez $30 million in compensation. When his agent confirmed the deal, Figo denied everything, insisting, "I'll stay at Barcelona whether Pérez wins or loses." He accused the presidential candidate of "lying" and "fantasizing". He told Barcelona teammates [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Luis Enrique]] and [[Pep Guardiola]] he was not leaving and they conveyed the message to the Barcelona squad.&lt;ref name="p344"&gt;Lowe, Sid. p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July, ''[[Sport (Spanish newspaper)|Sport]]'' ran an interview in which he said, "I want to send a message of calm to Barcelona's fans, for whom I always have and always will feel great affection. I want to assure them that Luís Figo will, with absolute certainty, be at the Camp Nou on the 24th to start the new season... I’ve not signed a pre-contract with a presidential candidate at Real Madrid. No. I'm not so mad as to do a thing like that."&lt;ref name="p344"/&gt;

The only way Barcelona could prevent Figo's transfer to Real Madrid was to pay the penalty clause, $30 million. That would have effectively meant paying the fifth highest transfer fee in history to sign their own player. Barcelona's new president, [[Joan Gaspart]], called the media and told them, "Today, Figo gave me the impression that he wanted to do two things: get richer and stay at Barça." Only one of them happened. The following day, 24 July, Figo was presented in Madrid and handed his new shirt by Alfredo Di Stéfano. His buyout clause was set at $180 million. Gaspart later admitted, "Figo's move destroyed us."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=2l6zHv_reuUC&amp;pg=PA345 Sid Lowe: Fear and loathing in La Liga.. Barcelona vs Real Madrid]" p. 345, 346. Random House. 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Barcelona in a Real Madrid shirt, banners with "Judas", "Scum" and "Mercenary" were hung around the stadium. Thousands of fake 10,000 peseta notes had been printed and emblazoned with his image, were among the missiles of oranges, bottles, cigarette lighters, even a couple of mobile phones were thrown at him.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sid. p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; In his third season with Real Madrid, the 2002 Clásico at Camp Nou produced one of the defining images of the rivalry. Figo was mercilessly taunted throughout; missiles of coins, a knife, a whisky bottle, were raining down from the stands, mostly from areas populated by the [[Boixos Nois]] where he had been taking a corner. Among the debris was a pig's head.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sid. p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3038589/Barcelona-are-braced-for-a-stiff-penalty.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Barcelona are braced for a stiff penalty|date=27 November 2002|location=London|first=Tony|last=Jefferies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last three decades, the rivalry has been augmented by the modern Spanish tradition of the ''Pasillo'', where one team is given the guard of honor by the other team, once the former clinches the La Liga trophy before El Clásico takes place. This has happened in three occasions. First, during El Clásico that took place on 30 April 1988, where Real Madrid won the championship on the previous round. Then, three years later, when Barcelona won the championship two rounds before El Clásico on 8 June 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Deportes |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/376322/0/clasico/pasillo/historia/www.20minutos.es |title=(Spanish) |publisher=20minutos.es |date= |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last pasillo, and most recent, took place on 7 May 2008, and this time Real Madrid had won the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futfanatico.com/2011/12/05/real-madrid-v-barcelona-glance-pasillos/ |title=Real Madrid v.

While El Clásico is regarded as one of the fiercest rivalries in world football, there have been rare moments when fans have shown praise for a player on the opposing team.

The rivalry intensified in 2011 where, due to the [[2011 Copa del Rey Final|final of the Copa Del Rey]] and the meeting of the two in the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], Barcelona and Real Madrid were scheduled to meet each other four times in 18 days. Several accusations of unsportsmanlike behaviour from both teams and a war of words erupted throughout the fixtures which included four red cards.

As seen below, [[Football records in Spain#Most successful clubs overall (official titles, 1903–present)|Barcelona leads Real Madrid 93–89]] in terms of official overall trophies.&lt;ref&gt;Copa Eva Duarte (Defunct) is not listed as an official title by the UEFA, but it is [http://www.rfef.es/noticias/supercopa/conoce-antecedentes-supercopa considered as such by the RFEF], as it is the direct predecessor of the Supercopa de España&lt;/ref&gt; While the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup is recognised as the predecessor to the UEFA Cup, it was not organised by [[UEFA]]. Consequently, UEFA does not consider clubs' records in the Fairs Cup to be part of their [[UEFA#Competitions|European record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/history/index.html |title=UEFA Europa League: History: New format provides fresh impetus |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[FIFA]] does view the competition as a major honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=1903416/index.html |title=Classic Football: Clubs: FC Barcelona |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=31083/index.html |title=Classic Football: Clubs: AS Roma |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American and Canadian [[sports]], a '''fight song''' is a [[song]] associated with a [[team]]. In both [[professional]] and [[amateur sports]], fight songs are a popular way for fans to cheer for their team, and are also laden with history; in singing a fight song, fans feel part of a large, time-honored tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cheerleading.lovetoknow.com/High_School_Fight_Songs|title=High School Fight Songs {{!}} LoveToKnow|work=LoveToKnow|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "fight song" is primarily used in the United States, the use of fight songs is commonplace around the world, but they may also be referred to as '''team anthems''', '''team songs''' or '''games songs''' in other countries, even such as [[Australia]], [[Mexico]] and [[New Zealand]]. Fight songs differ from [[stadium anthem]]s, used for similar purposes, in that they are usually written specifically for the purposes of the team, whereas stadium anthems are not.

Hundreds of [[college]]s have fight songs, some of which are over a century old. The oldest collegiate fight song in the United States is [[Boston College#For Boston|Boston College's]] "For Boston", composed by T.J. Hurley in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://at.bc.edu/songsofbc/ |title=@BC » Feature Archive » Beyond "For Boston" |publisher=At.bc.edu |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the oldest games songs in Australia is [[Melbourne Grammar]]'s 'Play Together, Dark Blue Twenty', which is sung to the tune of '[[Men of Harlech|The March of the Men of Harlech]]'.&lt;ref&gt;The Melbourne Grammar games song comprises verses from the school's three main sports at the time, Australian rules football, cricket and rowing. For example the Australian rules verse is:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;'Play together, Dark Blue Twenty,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Long and little marks in plenty;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Get your kick, let none prevent ye,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Make the leather roll.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mark your men, keen effort straining,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;On the ball and show your training;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Still though short the time remaining,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Get another goal.'

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The chorus between each verse is:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;'None our ranks shall sunder.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Who will shirk or blunder?

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;If all are true

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;To our Dark Blue,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Our foemen must go under.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Honour ye the old School’s story,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Those who played and won before ye,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Bear the Dark Blue flag to glory,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Grammar to the fore.'

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The cricket verse:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Bat with patience unremitting,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yorker, shooter, break outwitting,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;All the loose ones freely hitting,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;That’s the game to play.
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Skill the bat and ball in wielding,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Smartness, judgement in the fielding,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Iron nerve and pluck unyielding,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Scarce can lose the day.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The rowing verse:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Row the race, boys swing together,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sinews tough as cords of leather,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Strong, yet light upon the feather,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lift her, make her go!
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Get the catch at the beginning,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Churn the tide in eddies spinning,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now a spurt, you gain! you’re winning!
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Melbourne Grammar, row!

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;A fourth verse with its own chorus was added in the early 20th century with imperial connotations:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;'Some, in strife of sterner omen,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Faced the Empire’s stubborn foemen;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fought, as erst their sires - her yeomen;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Won the deathless name.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Praise ye these who stood for Britain,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;These by foreign marksmen smitten;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Praise them, for their names are written

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;High in storied fame.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;None their ranks could sunder;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Who could shirk or blunder?

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;So stood they true

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;To the old Dark Blue,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;And all their foes went under.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Honour ye the old School’s story,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Heroes who - her sons before ye -

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Died or lived, but fought for glory,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Honoured evermore.'

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;While it is not officially discontinued, this addition is no longer sung.

==List of college fight songs==
''Notes:''
*Colleges whose names begin with "University of" or "College of" are listed by traditional name; for example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] is listed under ''C'', not ''U''.
*The service academies are universally referred to in sports media by their associated branch of service. This means, for example, that the [[United States Military Academy]] is found at ''A'', for ''Army''.
* The abbreviation "St.", standing for "Saint", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out. Some schools officially abbreviate the word (such as [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] in New York City), while others officially spell it out (such as [[Saint Louis University]]).
*Schools which are normally known by a different contraction of their official name, or an acronym/initialism, are listed by their most common name. Examples:
**The [[University of California, Berkeley]] is most often referred to by American sports media as either "California" or "Cal", meaning it can be found at ''C''.
**The [[University of California, Los Angeles]] is generally called "UCLA", meaning it can be found at ''U''.
** A few branch campuses of state university systems prefer to be known by their city for athletics purposes. Among them are the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] ("Charlotte"), [[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga]] ("Chattanooga"), [[University of Nebraska Omaha]] ("Omaha"), [[University of Wisconsin–Green Bay]] ("Green Bay"), and [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] ("Milwaukee"). Such schools can be found at the first letter of their city name.
*Other regional campuses, such as [[California State University, Fresno]], are listed by their regional name, meaning the aforementioned school can be found under ''F''.

The '''final''' of a [[Competition#Sports|competition]] is the match or round in which the winner of the entire event is decided.

In [[sport]]s competitions following a [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] system, where only two individuals or teams compete in each match, the final is usually played between the winners of two [[semi-final]]s. However, if more than two entrants are required for each match, then qualification for the final may be through some other process such as winning ''heats''.

The final is usually, but not always, the last match in a tournament to be played, and the winner of this match is declared the winner of the whole tournament. In many contests, the winner(s) and runner(s)-up receive [[Gold medal|gold]] and [[Silver medal|silver]] medals respectively. Another game, or competition, between the two players who lost in the semi-finals is done to determine who receives the [[bronze medal]]. Unusually, many teams (32 in recent years) qualify for the FIFA World Cup finals. These teams then play each other in various formats until the ultimate two 'finalists' play off for the gold and silver medals.

If the final round is contested in a "best-of" format (like "best-of-7"), the term is sometimes called "finals," ([[playoffs]]) to denote that there is more than one game (like "the [[NBA Finals]]")  The [[Stanley Cup]] Final has been referred to in the singular since the 2005-06 season.  However, it refers to its semi-final round as the Conference Finals, because there are two separate ones being contested.

[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|A partial view of the [[Green Monster]] at [[Fenway Park]], with standings for the [[American League East]] division, including a "GB" column]]
In most North American sports, the phrase '''games behind''' or '''games back''' (often abbreviated '''GB'''), is a common way to reflect the gap between a leading team and another team in a sports league, conference, or division.

==Example==
In the below standings from the [[1994 Major League Baseball season]], the [[Atlanta Braves]] are six ''games behind'' the [[Montreal Expos]]. Atlanta would have to win six games, and Montreal would have to lose six games, to tie for first. The leading team is always zero games behind itself, and this is typically indicated in standings by a dash rather than a zero.
&lt;center&gt;{{1994 NL East standings}}&lt;/center&gt;
==Computing games behind==
Games behind is calculated by using either of the following formulas, in which Team A is a leading team, and Team B is a trailing team. Example math in this section uses the above standings, with Montreal as Team A and Atlanta as Team B.


:&lt;math&gt;\text{Games Behind} = \frac{(\text{Team A's wins – Team A's losses}) - (\text{Team B's wins – Team B's losses})}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\text{Games Behind} = \frac{(\text{74 – 40}) - (\text{68 – 46})}{2} = \frac{\text{34 – 22}}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6&lt;/math&gt;


Alternately:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Games Behind} = \frac{(\text{Team A's wins – Team B's wins}) + (\text{Team B's losses – Team A's losses})}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\text{Games Behind} = \frac{(\text{74 – 68}) + (\text{46 – 40})}{2} = \frac{\text{6 + 6}}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6&lt;/math&gt;


Notes:
* It can alternately be said that Montreal is six ''games ahead'' of Atlanta.
* A games behind situation can change rapidly when two teams contesting for the lead play each other. For example, Atlanta could cut Montreal's lead in half (to three games) by sweeping a three-game head-to-head series.
* The leading team, in terms of games behind, is the team with the best won–loss ''difference''. This is not always the team with the most wins. For example, a team with a 80–70 record (10 more wins than losses) would be one game behind a team with a 79–67 record (12 more wins than losses).

==Anomalies==
The formulas implicitly treat any difference in the number of games played by the two teams as each unplayed game being "worth" 0.5 wins and 0.5 losses. This can lead to anomalies when teams have played an unequal number of games, especially during the early portion of a season.

* Two teams with different [[winning percentage]]s may be tied in terms of games behind. For example Team A at 6–4 would be tied with Team B at 4–2, in terms of games behind. However, Team B has the better winning percentage, at .667 compared to .600 for Team A.

* A team with a lower winning percentage may lead (in terms of games behind) a team with a higher winning percentage. For example, Team A at 6–4 would lead Team B at 2–1, by a half-game when calculating games behind. However, Team B has the better winning percentage, at .667 compared to .600 for Team A.

::An example of this occurred in May 2018, when the [[New York Yankees]] were 28–13 and the [[Boston Red Sox]] were 30–14. The ''games behind'' calculation had New York a half-game behind Boston; however, New York had the better winning percentage, at .683 compared to .682 for Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/?year=2018&amp;month=05&amp;day=17 |title=MLB Scores and Standings |website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |date=May 17, 2018 |accessdate=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leagues generally use winning percentage to order teams, so in both of the above examples, Team B would be considered to be in first place.

==Usage==
[[File:NBA_Standings_29Nov1965.png|thumb|right|NBA standings in November 1965 as published in ''[[Star Tribune|The Minneapolis Star]]'']]
The games behind calculation is often used in professional [[baseball]] and [[basketball]], where tie games are not permitted. [[Standings]] for these sports appearing in print or online during a season will have teams ordered by winning percentages, with a "GB" column provided as a convenience to the reader. Games behind is used less often in [[American football]], where ties are possible but relatively uncommon. Games behind is rarely used in [[ice hockey]] and [[Association football|soccer]], where ties are common and standings points are typically used.

===Major League Baseball===
[[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) defines games behind as "the average of the differences between the leading team wins and the trailing team wins, and the leading teams losses and the trailing team losses."&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/?tcid=mm_mlb_standings&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2018}} A games behind column almost always appears in MLB standings for each five-team division.

====Wild card race====
In the [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994 MLB season]], the [[American League]] and [[National League]] each split into three divisions, and each added a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team to the playoffs. Following this change, it became common for the media to publish an additional set of standings for the wild card race. It included all teams from a league, with the exception of the division leaders, and games behind was calculated with respect to the team with the highest standing in the wild card race.

In the [[2012 Major League Baseball season|2012 MLB season]], both leagues add a second wild card team. Now, games behind in the wild card race is calculated with respect to the team with ''second highest'' standing in the wild card race. MLB's website distinguishes this statistic as ''wild card games behind'', abbreviated WCGB. Assuming that teams are not tied for first place in the wild card race, this results in the team leading the wild card race being shown as some number of "games ahead" of the second place team, indicated by a plus sign ("+") in the standings. 

===National Basketball Association===
[[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) standings typically report games behind within each five-team division. However, it is not as closely followed as in baseball, because more teams qualify for the NBA playoffs, and the divisional statistics are not as important for playoff qualification. Sometimes, especially nearing the end of the regular season, games behind will be given with respect to the eighth position in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] and [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]], as the eighth position is the last to qualify for the playoffs in each conference.

===National Football League===
[[File:NFL_Standings_23Oct1972.png|thumb|right|NFL standings in October 1972 as published in the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'']]
[[National Football League]] (NFL) standings sometimes report games behind, although the statistic is not emphasized; winning percentage is used, computed from each team's win–loss–tie record. This is especially true since the introduction of the bye week in [[1990 NFL season|1990]], exacerbating differences in the number of games that teams have played at various points in time. Games behind is omitted from standings on the NFL's website and is absent from most published standings.

===Other sports===
The games behind statistic is eschewed in sports where tie games are traditionally common, such as the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS). Leagues in these sports typically rank teams by awarding a certain number of points for each win or tie. The [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) also does not use games behind, and awards standings points.

===Related usage===
Teams are sometimes referred to as being over or under "five hundred", in comparison to a [[Winning percentage#500|.500]] winning percentage. The calculation for this is simple subtraction (there is no division by two).  For example, a team at 55–50 is "five games over five hundred", while a team at 40–50 would be "ten games under five hundred". 'Above' and 'below' can be substituted for 'over' and 'under', respectively.

'''The Institute of Groundsmanship''' is the world's largest [[not-for-profit]] organisation representing [[Groundskeeping|grounds men]]. Founded in 1934 by W. H. Bowles as the then National Association of Groundsmen, it has sought to improve both the status and standards of grounds professionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iog.org/membership-ben/about_the_iog/our_history&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute offers both short term practical [[Course (education)|courses]] with IOG certification and long-term educational qualifications certified by [[City and Guilds of London Institute|City and Guilds]] for groundsmen, as well as literature, [[Job placement|jobs]], a technical [[reference library]], advice and consultancy, a local [[support network]], and updates and newsletters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iog.org/membership-ben/membership-forms&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
Membership of the IOG is divided into three sectors: Individual, Associate, and Corporate. The IOG currently has over 2,000 paying individual members; membership entitles them to a monthly [[magazine]] subscription, a technical reference library, free legal advice, support through local branches, access to the IOG [[Continuous professional development|Continuous Professional Development]] programme, discounts off [[high street]] stores, and IOG training courses.

An '''isometric exercise tool''' is a device used to exercise most body parts including the [[wrist]] and is often used as part of [[physical therapy]] or in order to build muscle strength in a low impact manner. Devices can range in size from large bulky machines used by physicians to small hand-held devices that can be used by an individual. Isometric devices have been used for centuries. The first devices did not display the users' output; nowadays there are devices that can digitally output the users force. Before that some devices used an analog format.

==How it works==
Isometric exercise tools perform exercises or strength test using static contraction of a muscle without any visible movement in the angle of the joint. This is reflected in the name; the term "isometric" combines the prefix "iso" (same) with "metric" (distance), meaning that in these exercises the length of the muscle does not change,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/isometric-exercises.html Article on static strength training]&lt;/ref&gt;  as compared to ''isotonic contractions'' ("tonos" means "tension" in Greek) in which the contraction strength does not change but the joint angle does. New isometric exercise tools often used force gauges and a micro processor and then output the force onto an LCD screen or store the information later to be downloaded onto a computer.

==Medical uses==
Isometric exercises can also be used at the bedside to differentiate various [[heart murmur]]s; the murmur of [[mitral regurgitation]] gets louder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pediatrics.uchicago.edu/chiefs/ClinicCurriculum/documents/WCEvaluationofMurmursintheClinicSetting.pdf | title = Evaluation of Cardiac Murmurs in the Clinic Setting | publisher = University of Chicago | accessdate = 2008-01-10 | last = Ching | first = W }}&lt;/ref&gt; as compared to the quieter murmur of [[aortic stenosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassidy J, Aronow WS, Prakash R |title=The effect of isometric exercise on the systolic murmur of patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis |journal=Chest |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=395–7 |year=1975 |pmid=1168115 |doi=10.1378/chest.67.4.395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with dynamic exercises==
Isometric exercises have some differences in training effect as compared to dynamic exercises. While isometric training increases strength at the specific joint angles of the exercises performed and additional joint angles to a lesser extent, dynamic exercises increase strength throughout the full [[range of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindh M |title=Increase of muscle strength from isometric quadriceps exercises at different knee angles |journal=Scand J Rehabil Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–6 |year=1979 |pmid=419396 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking however, people who train isometrically don't train through a full range of motion as the strength gained at the training joint angle is where they require it. While dynamic exercises are slightly better than isometric exercises at enhancing the twitch force of a muscle, isometrics are significantly better than dynamic exercises at increasing maximal strength at the joint angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duchateau J, Hainaut K |title=Isometric or dynamic training: differential effects on mechanical properties of a human muscle |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=296–301 |year=1984 |pmid=6706740 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Flexibility may be increased when isometrics are performed at joint range of motion extremes.  These isometric contractions recruit muscle fibers that are often neglected in some dynamic exercises.  For example, gymnasts are extremely strong at great ranges of motion through the practice of isometric holds.

==Association football==
{{Main|Association football}}
{{See also| National Football League|American Football League|Canadian Football League}}

[[Rugby football]] in Canada had its origins in the early 1860s, and over time, a unique code of football known as [[Canadian football]] developed. Both the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and [[Football Canada]], the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1882 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union (later reorganized as the Canadian Rugby Union). In 1909, the [[Grey Cup]] was donated by the then [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey]], to recognize the top amateur rugby football team in Canada. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the two senior leagues of the CRU (the [[Canadian Football League East Division|Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] and the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Interprovincial Football Union]]) gradually evolved from amateur to professional leagues, and found they had less and less in common with the amateur leagues, and consequently in 1956 formed a new umbrella organization, the Canadian Football Council. In 1958, the CFC left the CRU altogether and was renamed the Canadian Football League. By this time, teams from the amateur [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] had stopped challenging for the Grey Cup, and ever since, it has been exclusively awarded to CFL teams. Since 1965, [[CIS football|university teams]] have competed for the [[Vanier Cup]].&lt;ref name="Football Canada timeline"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footballcanada.com/history_timeline.asp |title=Canadian Football Timelines (1860 – present) |accessdate=2006-12-23 |publisher=[[Football Canada]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228064050/http://www.footballcanada.com/history_timeline.asp |archivedate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian rules football==

{{Main|Australian rules football}}


Unlike other sports, Australian rules football has not resisted becoming a professional sport.

Although the sport began as amateur competition, the [[Australian Football League]] is an elite professional league and has been for nearly 80 years since its initial formation as the Victorian Football Association and then the Victorian Football League in 1897. The league changed its name to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) in 1990 amid the increasing professionalism and national expansion of the game.

The game was invented in the [[United States]] in the 1890s, in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. The first professional basketball leagues emerged in the 1920s in the [[United States]].  Prominent among these were the [[American Basketball League (1925-1955)|American Basketball League]], which formed in 1925, and the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]], which was launched in 1937 by General Electric, Firestone and Goodyear as a way to improve their national profile.&lt;ref name="Steve Dimitry"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/6925/abl1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+07:07:30 "Steve Dimitry's Extinct Sports Leagues."]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946 the [[Basketball Association of America]] was founded by the owners of major sports arenas, particularly the [[Madison Square Garden]]. The BAA later merged with the NBL in 1949 to become the [[National Basketball Association]], the preeminent league in the world with 29 teams in the United States and one in Canada.  The [[American Basketball Association]], founded in 1967, subsequently joined the NBA in the 1976 [[ABA-NBA merger]].

The second-oldest professional basketball league in the world is the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. The PBA was long considered to be the best league in [[Asia]], but the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] has grown tremendously in recent years. The league was born on April 9, 1975 at the [[Araneta Coliseum]], [[Cubao]], [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]].

Outside of the NBA, the top professional leagues in the world are those of [[FIBA Europe]]. According to the [[European national basketball league rankings|official league rankings]] produced by [[Euroleague Basketball (company)|Euroleague Basketball]], the body that conducts the continent-wide [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]], the top five national domestic leagues on the continent (from 1 to 5) are those [[Liga ACB]] (Spain), the [[Russian Professional Basketball League]], the [[Greek Basket League]], [[Lega Basket Serie A]] (Italy), and the [[Turkish Basketball League]].

European basketball is also characterized by its long established and well-developed transnational club competitions, most notably the Euroleague, which features top clubs from as many as 18 different domestic leagues. Two other continental club competitions, the [[ULEB Eurocup]] and [[EuroChallenge]], are also conducted annually. Europe also has transnational regional leagues, such as the [[Liga ABA]] (Adriatic League, formerly [[Yugoslavian Basketball League|Yugoslavian League]]), and [[Baltic Basketball League]] (originally limited to the Baltic states, now also including Kazakhstan).

==Cricket==
{{Main|History of English amateur cricket}}
{{See also|World Series Cricket|County cricket}}

Cricket at the highest level has developed into a fully professional international sport from which leading players can earn a large income. However professionalism has a long history in English cricket. The first professionals had appeared by the first half of the eighteenth century, when heavy gambling on the game encouraged wealthy patrons to draft the best players into their teams. They would often offer these players full-time employment as gardeners or gamekeepers on their estates. In the second half of the century, the famous Hambledon Club paid its players match fees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In the middle of the nineteenth century William Clarke's All-England Eleven was a highly successful all-professional venture which did much to popularise the game. The earliest overseas tours were also all-professional affairs.

In the early 21st century cricket is as lucrative as some other sports, and domestic cricketers typically earn several times the average salary in their country. Regular members of the [[England cricket team|English cricket team]] earn several hundred thousand [[pound sterling|pounds]] a year. However, the highest paid cricketers in the world are the star members of the [[Australia national cricket team|Australian cricket team]] or the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] who make most of their income from endorsement contracts.

==Ice hockey==
{{Main|Professional ice hockey}}
It is played with two teams, while 5 skaters and 1 goalie are allowed on the ice at a time. In NHL rules, the periods are 20 minutes long. There are three periods.

The 64-member governing body is the International Ice Hockey Federation, (IIHF). Ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924, and was in the 1920 Summer Olympics. North America's [[National Hockey League]] is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic hockey.

Ice hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can curve either way as to help a left- or right-handed player gain an advantage.

There are early representations and reports of hockey-type games being played on ice in the Netherlands, and reports from Canada from the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the modern game was initially organized by students at McGill University, Montreal in 1875 and, by two years later, codified the first set of ice hockey rules and organized the first teams.

==Lacrosse==
{{Main|Lacrosse}}
Lacrosse is played mainly in [[North America]], however, countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have small lacrosse leagues. It has also expanded into both Europe and Asia, with the latter forming the Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union (APLU) in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://filacrosse.com/fil-welcomes-the-aplu/|title=Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union|accessdate=2016-02-26|publisher=[[Federation of International Lacrosse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States currently has two top-level professional lacrosse leagues in operation, [[Major League Lacrosse]] and the [[National Lacrosse League]].

==Rugby league==
{{See also|History of rugby league|Football}}

Rugby league came into existence due to the very issue of professionalism. Rugby football split into 'union' and 'league' over the issue of payment to player. Rugby league favoured payments and has thus been a professional sport since its [[1895–96 Northern Rugby Football Union season|beginnings in 1895]], when 22 clubs based in northern England [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|split]] from the more amateur-minded [[Rugby Football Union]]. The officially amateur RFU had previously brought charges of professionalism against some clubs for their use of "broken time" payments to compensate players for missing work due to matches or injuries received whilst playing. On August 29, 1895 in a meeting at the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield]], the clubs decided to break away and form the Northern Rugby Union, which later would become the [[Rugby Football League]]. The rules of rugby league were gradually changed so that now it and rugby union are distinctly different games, however rugby union has since turned professional as well. On 17 December 1967 the first professional Sunday matches of rugby league were played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Rugby union ==

{{See also|History of rugby union|Football}}

Rugby union continued with its amateur ideals past the schism between union and league and throughout much of the 20th century. This position changed in 1995. The threat of big payments from professional rugby league clubs in countries where rugby league had a significant following was becoming too great. A committee conclusion decided that the only way to end this threat, the hypocrisy of [[Shamateurism]] and keep control of rugby union was to make the sport professional. On August 26, 1995 the International Rugby Board declared rugby union an "open" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game.

The PBR is different from the classic rodeo as it consists of only bull riding. It was founded in 1992 because a group of bull riders decided that their sport should be separated from the classic rodeo and could, as it was easily the most popular event. Riders and bulls are judged on a 50-point scale. Riders are only given a score if they stay on for the mandatory 8 seconds, while bull scores are given regardless of what the rider does.

==Blackball and "British-style" eight-ball pool==
&lt;!--The above is NOT a typo; "eight-ball" and "eight-ball pool" are NOT synonymous!--&gt;
This section lists world champions in the recently world-standardized eight-ball variant [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]], and its older competing-standards versions (usually referred to as "eight-ball pool") played at the amateur and semi-professional levels in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and a few European nations. These tournaments are played on a 7-foot [[Billiard table|pool table]] with either the "spots and stripes" numbered balls, or coloured balls - typically yellow and blue, or yellow and red, with a black ball.

===WPA Men's Champions===

[[File:Oscar Pistorius 2 Daegu 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Oscar Pistorius]] running during the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics]] in [[Daegu]], South Korea]]

The '''mechanics of the running blades''' used by South African Paralympic runner [[Oscar Pistorius]] depend on [[Flex-Foot Cheetah|special]] [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] [[prosthesis|prosthetics]].  Pistorius has double below-the-knee [[amputations]] and competes in both non-disabled and [[T44 (classification)|T44]] amputee [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] events. Pistorius's eligibility to run in international non-disabled events is sanctioned by the International Association of Athletics Federations ([[IAAF]]).

Pistorius began running in 2004 after a rugby knee injury which led to rehabilitation at the [[University of Pretoria]]'s High Performance Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Mike Moon |title=Blade Runner: Oscar Pistorius is forcing the world to rethink what it means to be disabled |url=http://www.rdasia.com/article/2730/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AH3zjOKd?url=http://www.rdasia.com/article/2730/ |archivedate=29 August 2012 |magazine=[[Reader's Digest|Reader's Digest Asia]] |year=2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with coach Ampie Louw.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/mysport/2312850/My-Sport-Oscar-Pistorius.html|author=Davies, Gareth A. (interviewer)|date=23 May 2007|title=My sport: Oscar Pistorius|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (London)|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first racing blades were fitted by South African [[prosthetist]] Francois Vanderwatt. Because he was unable to find suitable running blades in [[Pretoria]], Vanderwatt ordered some to be made by a local engineer at Hanger Orthopedic Group. These quickly broke, and Vanderwatt referred Pistorius to American prosthetist and Paralympic sprinter [[Brian Frasure]] to be fitted for carbon-fibre blades by [[Iceland]]ic company [[Össur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Felix Gillette |title=Racing tall: A Paralympian stands accused of getting an illegal leg up |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/left_field/2004/11/racing_tall.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AcuKt59K?url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/left_field/2004/11/racing_tall.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=10 November 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pistorius's participation in non-disabled international sprinting competitions in 2007 raised questions about his use of running blades, and the IAAF amended their rules to ban the use of "any technical device that incorporates springs, wheels or any other element that provides a user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device." After initial studies, Pistorius was ruled ineligible for competitions under these IAAF rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/2288489/IAAF-call-time-on-Oscar-Pistorius-dream.html|author=Knight, Tom|date=10 January 2008|title=IAAF call time on Oscar Pistorius' dream|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (London)|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After further research was presented, the Court of Arbitration ([[Court of Arbitration for Sport|CAS]]) ruled that his running prostheses were not shown to provide a net competitive advantage over biological legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/may/18/olympicgames2008.athletics |author=Mackay, Duncan|date=18 May 2008|title=Diack relaxed over Pistorius's victory|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Pistorius qualified for and competed in both the [[2012 Olympic Games]] and the [[2012 Paralympic Games]] using his running blades, becoming the first amputee sprinter to run in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/oscar-pistorius-makes-history-double-amputee-sprinter-compete/story?id=16929845|title=Pistorius, 25, Is First Double-Amputee Sprinter to Compete in Olympic Games|author=Shaw, Alexis|publisher=ABC|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pistorius's athletics prostheses==
The blades are [[transtibial prosthesis|transtibial prostheses]], meaning they replace legs and feet that are amputated below the knee (BK). They were developed by medical engineer [[Van Phillips (inventor)|Van Phillips]] who incorporated Flex-Foot, Inc., in 1984, and in 2000 sold the company to [[Össur]] which now (in 2012) manufactures the blades. They are designed to store kinetic energy like a spring, allowing the wearer to jump and run effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Personal Call to a Prosthetic Invention|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/sports/olympics/02cheetah.html?ref=sports|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=19 September 2012|publisher=New York Times|author=Pogash, Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon fibre is actually a [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]], and is a strong, light-weight material used in a number of applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high [[strength-to-weight ratio]] is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally [[epoxy]], but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.&lt;ref name=blades /&gt;

Pistorius has been using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without [[fibula]]e and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear prosthetic legs. He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/column-pistorius-revolutionizes-olympic-notions|title=Column: Pistorius revolutionizes Olympic notions|author=Leicester, John|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pistorius uses custom-made spike pads on the blades. Before development of the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive treadmill and film at 500 [[Frame rate|fps]] to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670487/how-nike-made-track-spikes-for-oscar-pistorius-s-carbon-fiber-blades|title=How Nike Made Track Spikes For Oscar Pistorius’s Carbon Fiber Blades|author=Wilson, Mark|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the curved design, the blades have to be slightly longer than a runner's biological leg and foot would be. The blades replace the hinge of an ankle with elastic compression that bends and releases the blade with every stride, so the uncompressed blade leaves the user standing on tiptoe. They are designed to move forward, so have no heel support in the back. According to Josh McHugh of [[Wired Magazine]], "The Cheetahs seem to bounce of their own accord. It’s impossible to stand still on them, and difficult to move slowly. Once they get going, Cheetahs are extremely hard to control."&lt;ref name=blades&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/blade.html?pg=2&amp;topic=blade&amp;topic_set=|author=McHugh, Josh|date=March 2007|publisher=Wired Magazine|title=Blade Runner|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the blades work==
[[File:Oscar Pistorius-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Pistorius running in Iceland in 2007.]]

In 2007 Pistorius applied to run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but questions quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue to run in non-disabled meets as long as he uses the equipment that was studied in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/29/paralympics-2012-oscar-pistorius|title=Paralympics 2012: Oscar Pistorius shows what Paralympians can achieve|author=Bull, Andy|date=28 August 2012|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pistorius's performance in the early non-disabled races raised questions because of two major concerns: his pattern of running the races and his leg-swing times. Most sprinters spring out of the blocks with their fastest time and slow down as the race progresses, but Pistorius ran a "negative split," starting slowly and building up speed in the last half of the race (though he no longer uses this pattern). His average time was also less in the 400m race when compared to other runners than in the 200m.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/writers/david_epstein/08/03/oscar-pistorius-london-olympics/index.html|title=Fair or foul? Experts split over whether Pistorius has advantage|author=Epstein, David|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy about the use of the blades persists, but the research provided considerable information on how they work in application, and other research is expected to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://theconversation.edu.au/pistorius-loss-to-oliveira-fuels-the-disruptive-technology-debate-9250|title=Pistorius' loss to Oliveira fuels the ‘disruptive technology’ debate|author=Lyons, Keith|date=3 September 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-disabled sprinters have calves and ankles that return and amplify the energy supplied by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work because he does not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by ''[[Engineering &amp; Technology]]'' magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his [[gluteal muscles|gluteal]] and [[quadriceps]] muscles that a normal sprinter would.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://engtechmag.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/london-2012-paralympic-games-oscar-pistorius-blades-an-annotated-graphic|title=London 2012 Paralympic games, Oscar Pistorius’ blades – an annotated graphic|publisher=Engineering &amp; Technology|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/track-and-field/science-of-olympics-how-oscar-pistorius-blades-work.html|title=Science of the Olympics: How Oscar Pistorius' blades work|publisher=NBC|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.&lt;ref name=blades /&gt;

Pistorius is always slow in starting a race because the flexible blades do not provide thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/sports/olympics/pistorius-eliminated-track-and-field-roundup.html?pagewanted=all|title=Pistorius Misses Chance at Final, but Remains Upbeat|publisher=The New York Times|author=Borden, Sam|date=5 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/no-advantage-to-being-an-amputee-a-defense-of-oscar-pistoriuss-prostheses/260878|title='No Advantage to Being an Amputee': A Defense of Oscar Pistorius's Prostheses|author=Simpson, Jake|publisher=The Atlantic|date=8 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps his head down and takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may be able to use the inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.&lt;ref name=blades /&gt;

==Research==

===Brüggemann study===
[[File:Oscar Pistorius, the first round of the 400m at the London 2012 Olympic Games.jpeg|thumb|left|Pistorius running in the first round of the 400m at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London]]

To resolve questions about the blades, Pistorius was asked to take part in a series of scientific tests in November 2007 at the [[German Sport University Cologne]] with Professor of [[Biomechanics]] Peter Brüggemann and IAAF technical expert Elio Locatelli. After two days of tests, Brüggemann reported that Pistorius used about 25 percent less energy expenditure than non-disabled athletes once he achieved a given speed. The study also found that he showed major differences in sprint mechanics, with significantly different maximum vertical ground return forces, and that the positive work or returned energy was close to three times higher than that of a human ankle. The energy loss in the blade during stance phase when the foot was on the ground was measured as 9.3 percent, while that of normal ankle joint was measured at 42.4 percent, showing a difference of more than 30 percent. Brüggemann's analysis stated that the blades allowed lower energy consumption at the same speed, and that the energy loss in the blade is significantly less than in a human ankle at maximum speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.iaaf.org/news/printer,newsid=42896.htmx|title=Oscar Pistorius - Independent Scientific study concludes that cheetah prosthetics offer clear mechanical advantages|date=14 January 2008|publisher=IAAF|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of that year, Brüggemann stated to ''[[Die Welt]]'' newspaper that Pistorius "has considerable advantages over athletes without prosthetic limbs who were tested by us. It was more than just a few percentage points. I did not expect it to be so clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report: Artificial limbs give paralympic champion competitive edge|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/20/sports/athletics20.php|newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was published in 2008 in ''Sports Technology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://users.auth.gr/~lmademli/Analysi_Vadisis/Pistorius_SportsTechnology2008.pdf |title=Biomechanics of double transtibial amputee sprinting using dedicated sprinting prostheses |first=Gert-Peter |last=Bruggemann |first2=Adamantios |last2=Arampatzis |first3=Frank |last3=Emrich |first4=Wolfgang |last4=Potthast |year=2008 |accessdate=3 October 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but later researchers stated that the analysis "did not take enough variables into consideration". Commentators have also argued that the IAAF study did not accurately determine whether Cheetahs confer a net advantage because measuring the net advantage or disadvantage conferred on an athlete using Cheetahs is not possible given current scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jonathan Clayton|title=Oscar Pistorius vows to fight Olympics ban|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/athletics/article3186862.ece|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the IAAF study may not have measured Pistorius’s performance against appropriate controls. IAAF used five non-disabled athletes, who run 400-meter races in similar times to Pistorius, as controls. However, because Pistorius was relatively new to the sport of running, he may not have trained enough to maximize his physical potential and reach his peak performance when the IAAF study was conducted. In March 2007, approximately 9 months before the IAAF study was conducted, Pistorius’s coach commented that Pistorius had not trained enough to achieve an upper body commensurate with the upper bodies of most elite sprinters. To obtain the most accurate understanding of how the prostheses affect Pistorius’s performance, he should be compared to athletes with similar physical potential. Consequently, the IAAF study may have been flawed because it compared Pistorius, who might have the physical potential to run faster than his current times, against athletes at their peak.

===Weyand, et al. study===
In 2008 a team of seven researchers conducted tests at [[Rice University]], including Peter Weyand, [[Hugh Herr]], Rodger Kram, Matthew Bundle and Alena Grabowski. The team collected [[metabolic]] and mechanical data by indirect [[calorimetry]] and ground reaction force measurements on Pistorius's performance during constant-speed, level treadmill running, and found that the energy usage was 3.8 percent lower than average values for elite non-disabled distance runners, 6.7 percent lower than for average distance runners and 17 percent lower than for non-disabled 400m sprint runners. At sprinting speeds of 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0&amp;nbsp;m/s, Pistorius produced longer foot to ground contact times, shorter leg swing times, and lower average vertical forces than able bodied sprinters. The team concluded that running on the blades appears to be physiologically similar but mechanically different from running with biological legs. The study was published several months later in the ''[[Journal of Applied Physiology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/specialsections/summerolympics/Does-Double-Amputee-Oscar-Pistorius-Have-an-Unfair-Advantage-at-the-2012-Olympic-Games-162598806.html#ixzz26wkjbD00|title=Does Double-Amputee Oscar Pistorius Have an Unfair Advantage at the 2012 Olympic Games?|author=Eveleth, Rose|date=23 July 2012|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/107/3/903.abstract|publisher=Journal of Applied Physiology|title=The fastest runner on artificial legs: different limbs, similar function?|first=Peter G.|last=Weyand|first2=Matthew W.|last2=Bundle|first3=Craig P.|last3=McGowan|first4=Alena|last4=Grabowski|first5=Mary Beth|last5=Brown|first6=Rodger|last6=Kram|first7=Hugh|last7=Herr|date=17 February 2009|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kram also stated that Pistorius's "rate of energy consumption was lower than an average person but comparable to other high-caliber athletes."&lt;ref name=study&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.denverpost.com/perspective/ci_21056327/cu-boulder-researchers-help-oscar-pistorius-become-first#ixzz26ya4Ropt|title= CU-Boulder researchers help Oscar Pistorius become first amputee to compete in Olympics: Research shows his prostheses are not an advantage|date=11 July 2012|author=Bryen, Whitney|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lightness and rigidity of the blade compared to muscle and bone may allow blade runners to swing their legs faster than non-disabled runners. In comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that the study found that Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.&lt;ref name=study2&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rami-hashish/oscar-pistorius-prosthetic-legs-advantage_b_1766417.html|title=Oscar Pistorius' Prosthetic Legs: Do They Give Him an Advantage Over Other Olympic Runners?|author=Hashish, Rami|publisher=Huffington Post|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grabowski, et al. study===
In 2008 a research team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades which was published in ''[[Biology Letters]]''. Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the running surface on a high-speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of [[the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital]], and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found no difference in leg swing times at different speeds, and recorded leg swing times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. They also found that single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed, the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/11/02/rsbl.2009.0729.abstract|title=Running-specific prostheses limit ground-force during sprinting|first=Alena M.|last=Grabowski1|first2=Craig P.|last2=McGowan|first3=William J.|last3=McDermott|first4=Matthew T.|last4=Beale|first5=Rodger|last5=Kram|first6=Hugh M.|last6=Herr|publisher=Biology Letters|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other discussion===
Discussion continues about the relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers and analysts also point out that the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do not take into account differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www2.teamusa.org/US-Paralympics/Features/2012/August/04/American-blade-runner-Jarryd-Wallace.aspx?p=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806200822/http://www.teamusa.org/US-Paralympics/Features/2012/August/04/American-blade-runner-Jarryd-Wallace.aspx?p=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 August 2012 |title=American blade runner: Jarryd Wallace |author=Rosewater, Amy |date=4 August 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Paralympics==
A controversy over the effects of running blade length arose at the [[2012 Paralympic Games]], as Brazilian runner [[Alan Oliveira]] and USA runner [[Blake Leeper]] changed to longer running blades within a few months before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the [[International Paralympic Committee|IPC]] rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9517308/Oscar-Pistorius-blade-controversy-sour-grapes-or-is-South-African-right-to-complain-about-Alan-Oliveiras-blades.html|title=Oscar Pistorius blade controversy: sour grapes or is South African right to complain about Alan Oliveira's blades?|author=Hart, Simon|date=3 September 2012|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including [[Jerome Singleton]] and [[Jack Swift]], who called for the [[T43 (classification)|T43]] double blade and [[T44 (classification)|T44]] single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Sam Cunningham |title=Oscar 'right to fight' as Paralympics blades row speeds up |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2198913/Oscar-Pistorius-right-fight-blades-row-speeds-up.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ATEzRGgf?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2198913/Oscar-Pistorius-right-fight-blades-row-speeds-up.html |archivedate= 6 September 2012 |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=5 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The improvement in running time and the wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the blade length affects performance. Pistorius' stride length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sportsscientists.com/2012_09_01_archive.html |title=Pistorius vs Oliveira and Technology.

The '''Munich massacre''' was an attack during the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], in which the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] terrorist group [[Black September Organization|Black September]] took eleven [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Israeli Olympic team]] members hostage and killed them along with a West German police officer.&lt;ref name="Sanchez2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Juan Sanchez|title=Terrorism &amp; Its Effects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AK6QA_WotRYC&amp;pg=PT144|accessdate=16 December 2012|date=7 August 2007|publisher=Global Media|isbn=978-81-89940-93-5|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJJG14mHbGAC&amp;pg=PA34|title=The new dimension of international&amp;nbsp;...|publisher=Google Books|date=11 September 2001|accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOfkAoDb_2IC&amp;pg=PA248|title=Encyclopedia of terrorism|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AWzieu562dQC&amp;pg=PA107|title=The terrorist trap: America's&amp;nbsp;...|publisher=Google Books|date=18 July 1976|accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the crisis began, a Black September spokesman demanded that 234 Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel and the West German–held founders of the [[Red Army Faction]], [[Andreas Baader]] and [[Ulrike Meinhof]], be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Simon|last=Reeve|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/olympics-massacre-munich--the-real-story-524011.html|title=Olympics Massacre: Munich&amp;nbsp;– The real story|newspaper=The Independent |date=22 January 2006 |accessdate=3 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316084844/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/olympics-massacre-munich--the-real-story-524011.html|archivedate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/baffled-bob-costas-to-call-own-minute-of-silence-during-olympic-broadcast-for-slain-israeli-team/2012/07/22/0/?print|title="Baffled" Bob Costas to Call Own Minute of Silence During Olympic Broadcast for Slain Israeli Team|newspaper=The Jewish Press|date=22 July 2012|accessdate=23 July 2012|author=Fleisher, Malkah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black September called the operation ''"[[Iqrit]] and [[Kafr Bir'im|Biram]]"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LAXixXUu5wC&amp;pg=RA1-PA224|title=Terrorism: A Global Scourge&amp;nbsp;– Google Livres|publisher=Books.google|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; after two [[Palestinian Christians|Palestinian Christian]] villages whose inhabitants were expelled by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].

Police officers killed five of the eight Black September members during a failed attempt to rescue the hostages. A West German policeman was also killed in the crossfire. The other three Palestinian hijackers were captured. The next month, however, following the hijacking of [[Lufthansa Flight 615]], the West German government released them in a hostage exchange. [[Mossad]] responded with the [[1973 Israeli raid on Lebanon]] and [[Operation Wrath of God]], tracking down and killing Palestinians suspected of involvement in the Munich massacre.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Two days prior to the start of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], in a ceremony led by Brazilian and Israeli officials, the [[International Olympic Committee]] honored the eleven Israelis that were killed at Munich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Sports/First-official-IOC-ceremony-in-memory-of-Munich-victims-463185 "First official Olympic ceremony held in memory of Munich victims"], jpost.com; accessed 5 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
At the time of the hostage-taking, the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] were in their second week. The West German Olympic Organizing Committee had hoped to discard the military image of Germany. The Committee was wary of the image portrayed by the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], which [[Nazi]] dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] used for his benefit. Security personnel known as Olys were inconspicuous and prepared to deal mostly with ticket fraud and drunkenness.&lt;ref name="when the terror began"/&gt; The documentary film ''[[One Day in September]]'' claims that security in the athletes' village was unfit for the Games and that athletes could come and go as they pleased. Athletes could sneak past security, and go to other countries' rooms, by going over the fencing that encompassed the village.&lt;ref name="when the terror began"/&gt;

The absence of armed personnel had worried Israeli delegation head Shmuel Lalkin even before his team arrived in Munich. In later interviews with journalists [[Serge Groussard]] and Aaron J. Klein, Lalkin said that he had expressed concern with the relevant authorities about his team's lodgings. The team was housed in a relatively isolated part of the Olympic Village, on the ground floor of a small building close to a gate, which Lalkin felt made his team particularly vulnerable to an outside assault. The West German authorities apparently assured Lalkin that extra security would be provided to look after the Israeli team, but Lalkin doubts that any additional measures were ever taken.&lt;ref name="when the terror began"/&gt;

Olympic organizers asked West German forensic psychologist Georg Sieber to create 26 terrorism scenarios to aid the organizers in planning security. His "Situation 21" accurately forecast armed Palestinians invading the Israeli delegation's quarters, killing and taking hostages, and demanding Israel's release of prisoners and a plane to leave West Germany. Organizers balked against preparing for Situation 21 and the other scenarios, since guarding the Games against them would have gone against the goal of "Carefree Games" without heavy security.&lt;ref name="when the terror began"/&gt;

===Accusation of German foreknowledge of the attack===
The German weekly news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' wrote in a 2012 cover story that the West German authorities had a tip-off from a Palestinian informant in Beirut three weeks before the massacre. The informant told West Germany that Palestinians were planning an "incident" at the Olympic Games, and the [[Foreign Ministry in Bonn]] viewed the tip-off seriously enough to pass it to the secret service in Munich and urge that "all possible security measures" be taken.

But, according to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', the authorities failed to act on the tip, and have never acknowledged it in the following 40 years. The magazine said that this is only part of a 40-year cover-up by the German authorities of the mishandling of its response to the massacre.&lt;ref name="Times of Israel Munich Knew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/germany-had-a-tip-off-three-weeks-in-advance-that-palestinians-were-planning-incident-at-munich-olympics-but-failed-to-act-der-spiegel-claims|title=Germany had a tip-off three weeks ahead of Munich massacre, Der Spiegel claims|publisher=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=22 July 2012|accessdate=22 July 2012|author=Ahren, Raphael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohr |first=Felix |last2=Frohn |first2=Axel  |last3=Latsch |first3=Gunther  |last4=Neumann |first4=Conny |others=Wiegrefe, Klaus |title=Die angekündigte Katastrophe |journal=Der Spiegel |number=30 |date=23 July 2012 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-87508597.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hostage-taking==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
[[File:MunichIsraeliOlympicFront.jpg|thumb|right|The site where the hostages were taken is almost unchanged today. The window of Apartment 1 is to the left of and below the balcony.]]
On Monday evening, 4 September, the Israeli athletes enjoyed a night out, watching a performance of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' and dining with the star of the play, Israeli actor [[Shmuel Rodensky]], before returning to the [[Olympiapark, Munich|Olympic Village]].&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, Klein and Groussard.{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the return trip in the team bus Lalkin denied his 13-year-old son — who had befriended weightlifter [[Yossef Romano]] and wrestler [[Eliezer Halfin]] — permission to spend the night in their apartment at [[Connollystraße]] 31, which probably saved the boy's life.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4:30&amp;nbsp;am local time on 5 September, as the athletes slept, eight tracksuit-clad members of the [[Black September Organization|Black September]] faction of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], carrying [[duffel bag]]s loaded with [[AKM]] assault rifles, [[TT-33|Tokarev pistols]], and grenades, scaled a {{convert|2|metre|ft|adj=on|frac=2}} chain-link fence with the assistance of unsuspecting athletes who were also sneaking into the Olympic Village. The athletes were originally identified as Americans, but were claimed to be Canadians decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Kelly, Cathal|title=Munich massacre helped unwittingly by Canadians in 1972 Olympic atrocity|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/article/1169848--kelly-munich-massacre-terrorists-helped-by-canadians-in-1972-olympic-atrocity?bn=1|date=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once inside, the Black September members used stolen keys to enter two apartments being used by the Israeli team at Connollystraße 31.&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewsinsports.org/Olympics.asp?sport=olympics&amp;ID=413|title=Ladany, Shaul|publisher=Jewsinsports.org|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yossef Gutfreund]], a wrestling referee, was awakened by a faint scratching noise at the door of Apartment 1, which housed the Israeli coaches and officials. When he investigated, he saw the door begin to open and masked men with guns on the other side. He shouted a warning to his sleeping roommates and threw his 135&amp;nbsp;kg (300&amp;nbsp;lb) weight against the door in a futile attempt to stop the intruders from forcing their way in. Gutfreund's actions gave his roommate, weightlifting coach Tuvia Sokolovsky, enough time to smash a window and escape. Wrestling coach [[Moshe Weinberg]] fought the intruders, who shot him through his cheek and then forced him to help them find more hostages.&lt;ref name="GuardianMoment26"/&gt;

Leading the intruders past Apartment 2, Weinberg lied by telling them that the residents of the apartment were not Israelis. Instead, Weinberg led them to Apartment 3; there, the gunmen corralled six wrestlers and weightlifters as additional hostages. It is possible that Weinberg had hoped that the stronger men would have a better chance of fighting off the attackers than those in Apartment 2, but they were all surprised in their sleep.&lt;ref name="GuardianMoment26"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnton|first=Simon|title=50 stunning Olympic moments No 26: The terrorist outrage in Munich in 1972|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=2 May 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/may/02/50-stunning-olympic-moments-munich-72|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the athletes from Apartment 3 were marched back to the coaches' apartment, the wounded Weinberg again attacked the gunmen, allowing one of his wrestlers, [[Gad Tsobari]], to escape via the underground parking garage.&lt;ref name=Abrahamson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2002/sep/05/sports/sp-munichmain05|title=Black September|work=Los Angeles Times|date=5 September 2002|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg knocked unconscious one of the intruders and slashed at another with a fruit knife but failed to draw blood before being shot to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwkrv-yn57MC&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=Shaul+Ladany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AkcqUc7TLMW30AHts4CYCA&amp;ved=0COABEOgBMCE|title=Warrior Elite: 31 Heroic Special-Ops Missions from the Raid on Son Tay to the Killing of Osama Bin Laden|author=Nigel Cawthorne|publisher=Ulysses Press|year=2011|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weightlifter [[Yossef Romano]], a veteran of the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967, also attacked and wounded one of the intruders before being shot and killed. In its publication of 1 December 2015, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Romano was castrated after he was shot.&lt;ref name="nytimes1972"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borden|first1=Sam|title=Long-Hidden Details Reveal Cruelty of 1972 Munich Attackers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/sports/long-hidden-details-reveal-cruelty-of-1972-munich-attackers.html?_r=1|accessdate=1 December 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gunmen were left with nine hostages. They were, in addition to Gutfreund, sharpshooting coach [[Kehat Shorr]], track and field coach [[Amitzur Shapira]], fencing master [[Andre Spitzer]], weightlifting judge [[Yakov Springer]], wrestlers [[Eliezer Halfin]] and [[Mark Slavin]], and weightlifters [[David Mark Berger|David Berger]] and [[Ze'ev Friedman]]. Berger was an expatriate American with dual citizenship; Slavin, at 18 the youngest of the hostages, had only arrived in Israel from the Soviet Union four months before the Olympic Games began. Gutfreund, physically the largest of the hostages, was bound to a chair (Groussard describes him as being tied up like a mummy); the rest were lined up four apiece on the two beds in Springer and Shapira's room, and bound at the wrists and ankles and then to each other. Romano's bullet-riddled corpse was left at his bound comrades' feet as a warning. Several of the hostages were beaten during the stand-off, with some suffering broken bones as a result.&lt;ref name="nytimes1972"/&gt;

Of the other members of Israel's team, [[racewalker]] [[Shaul Ladany]] had been jolted awake in Apartment 2 by Gutfreund's screams. He jumped from the second-story balcony of his room and fled to the American dormitory, awakening U.S. track coach [[Bill Bowerman]] and informing him of the attack.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/la/shaul-ladany-1.html|title=Shaul Ladany biodata/stats|publisher=Sports-reference.com|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0KzECrIQDQC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Shaul+Ladany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AkcqUc7TLMW30AHts4CYCA&amp;ved=0CJkBEOgBMBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Shaul%20Ladany&amp;f=false |title=Jews and the Olympic Games: The Clash Between Sport and Politics&amp;nbsp;– With a Complete Review of Jewish Olympic Medalists|author=Paul Taylor|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=2004|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LT2q2tSuIO8C&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Shaul+Ladany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AkcqUc7TLMW30AHts4CYCA&amp;ved=0CPYBEOgBMCU#v=onepage&amp;q=Shaul%20Ladany&amp;f=false|title=Making Other Plans: A Memoir|author=Tom Mackin|year=2009|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladany, a survivor of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], was the first person to spread the alert.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1" /&gt; The other four residents of Apartment 2 (sharpshooters [[Henry Hershkowitz]] and [[Zelig Shtroch]], fencers [[Dan Alon]] and [[Yehuda Weisenstein]]), plus [[chef de mission]] Shmuel Lalkin and the two team doctors, hid and eventually fled the besieged building.  The two female members of Israel's Olympic team, sprinter and hurdler [[Esther Roth-Shahamorov|Esther Shahamorov]] and swimmer Shlomit Nir, were housed in a separate part of the Olympic Village. Three more members of Israel's Olympic team, two sailors and their manager, were housed in [[Kiel]], {{convert|900|km|mi|-2}} from Munich.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The attackers were reported to be Palestinian [[Terrorism|terrorists]] from refugee camps in [[Lebanon]], Syria, and [[Jordan]]. They were identified as [[Luttif Afif]] (using the [[code name|codename]] Issa), the leader (three of Issa's brothers were also reportedly members of Black September, two of them in Israeli jails), his deputy [[Yusuf Nazzal]] ("Tony"), and junior members [[Afif Ahmed Hamid]] ("Paolo"), [[Khalid Jawad]] ("Salah"), Ahmed Chic Thaa ("Abu Halla"), [[Mohammed Safady]] ("Badran"), [[Adnan Al-Gashey]] ("Denawi"), and Al-Gashey's cousin, [[Jamal Al-Gashey]] ("Samir").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeve|first1=Simon|title=One Day in September: The Full Story of the 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre and the Israeli Revenge Operation "Wrath of God"|date=1 August 2011|publisher=Regnery Publishing|isbn=1628721413|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTn_DQAAQBAJ&amp;q=khalid+jawad#v=snippet&amp;q=khalid%20jawad&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author Simon Reeve, Afif (the son of a Jewish mother and Christian father), Nazzal, and one of their confederates, had all worked in various capacities in the Olympic Village, and had spent a couple of weeks scouting for  their potential target. A member of the [[Uruguay]]an Olympic delegation, which shared housing with the Israelis, claimed that he found Nazzal inside 31 Connollystraße less than 24 hours before the attack, but since he was recognized as a worker in the Village, nothing was thought of it at the time. The other members of the group entered Munich via train and plane in the days before the attack. All the members of the [[Uruguay]] and Hong Kong Olympic teams, which also shared the building with the Israelis, were released unharmed during the crisis.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==International reaction==
On 5 September, [[Golda Meir]], then Prime Minister of Israel, appealed to other countries to "save our citizens and condemn the unspeakable criminal acts committed." She also stated, "&lt;!--Our immediate reaction is negative--&gt;if we [Israel] should give in, then no Israeli anywhere in the world shall feel that his life is safe{{nbsp}}... it's blackmail of the worst kind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neil |first=Terry |title=The Game Behind the Game: High Pressure, High Stakes in Sports Television |publisher=Harper and Row |date= 1989 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yg-DAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22blackmail%22 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein of Jordan]], the only leader of an Arab country to denounce the attack publicly, called it a "savage crime against civilization&amp;nbsp;... perpetrated by sick minds."&lt;ref name="Cooley"&gt;Cooley.{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] privately discussed a number of possible American responses, such as declaring a national day of mourning (favored by Secretary of State [[William P. Rogers]]), or having Nixon fly to the athletes' funerals. Nixon and [[Henry Kissinger]] decided instead to press the [[United Nations]] to take steps against international terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/how-nixon-got-shot-of-munich-1.181028|title=How Nixon got shot of Munich|last=Oren|first=Amir|date=23 February 2006|work=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiations==
The hostage-takers demanded the release of 234 Palestinians and non-Arabs jailed in [[Israel]], along with two West German insurgents held by the West German penitentiary system, [[Andreas Baader]] and [[Ulrike Meinhof]], who were founders of the West German [[Red Army Faction]]. The hostage-takers threw the body of Weinberg out of the front door of the residence to demonstrate their resolve. Israel's response was immediate and absolute: there would be no negotiation. Israel's official policy at the time was to refuse to negotiate with terrorists under any circumstances, as according to the Israeli government such negotiations would give an incentive to future attacks.

It has been claimed{{By whom|date=February 2015}} that the German authorities, under the leadership of [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]] and Minister for the Interior [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], rejected Israel's offer to send an [[Israeli Security Forces|Israeli special forces]] unit to West Germany.&lt;ref name = "Reeve"&gt;Reeve, Simon. ''One Day in September'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bavarian interior minister Bruno Merk, who headed the crisis centre jointly with Genscher and Munich's police chief Manfred Schreiber, denies that such an Israeli offer ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/interview-uns-ging-es-darum-das-leben-der-geiseln-zu-retten-1.740623|title=Interview "Uns ging es darum, das Leben der Geiseln zu retten|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=1 January 2006|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journalist [[John K. Cooley]], the hostage situation presented an extremely difficult political situation for the Germans because the hostages were Jewish. Cooley reported that the Germans offered the Palestinians an unlimited amount of money for the release of the athletes, as well as the substitution by high-ranking Germans. However, the kidnappers refused both offers.&lt;ref name="Cooley"/&gt;

Munich police chief Manfred Schreiber, and Bruno Merk, interior minister of Bavaria, negotiated directly with the kidnappers, repeating the offer of an unlimited amount of money. According to Cooley, the reply was that "money means nothing to us; our lives mean nothing to us." Magdi Gohary and Mohammad Khadif, both Egyptian advisers to the Arab League, and A.D. Touny, an Egyptian member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) also helped try to win concessions from the kidnappers, but to no avail. However, the negotiators apparently were able to convince the terrorists that their demands were being considered, as "Issa" granted a total of five deadline extensions. Elsewhere in the village, athletes carried on as normal, seemingly oblivious of the events unfolding nearby. The Games continued until mounting pressure on the IOC forced a suspension some 12 hours after the first athlete had been murdered. United States marathon runner [[Frank Shorter]], observing the unfolding events from the balcony of his nearby lodging, was quoted as saying, "Imagine those poor guys over there. Every five minutes a psycho with a machine gun says, 'Let's kill 'em now,' and someone else says, 'No, let's wait a while.' How long could you stand that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/flashbacks/munich/shootings_in_the_night|title=Shootings in the Night|author=Moore, Kenny|work=Sports Illustrated|date=18 September 1972|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829111601/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/flashbacks/munich/shootings_in_the_night|archivedate=29 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Spitzer and Shorr.jpg|thumb|left|Israeli hostages [[Kehat Shorr]] (left) and [[Andre Spitzer]] (right) talk to West German officials during the hostage crisis.]]
At 4:30&amp;nbsp;pm, a squad of 38 West German police officers was dispatched to the Olympic Village. Dressed in Olympic sweatsuits (some also wearing [[Stahlhelme]] and carrying [[Walther MP]] sub-machine guns), they were members of the [[Bundesgrenzschutz|German border police]], although according to former Munich policeman Heinz Hohensinn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2NFd_ildHs|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were regular Munich police officers, with no experience in combat or hostage rescue. Their plan was to crawl down from the ventilation shafts and kill the terrorists. The police took up positions awaiting the codeword "Sunshine", which upon hearing, they were to begin the assault. In the meantime, camera crews filmed the actions of the officers from the German apartments, and broadcast the images live on television. Thus, the terrorists were able to watch the police prepare to attack. Footage shows one of the kidnappers peering from the balcony door while one of the police officers stood on the roof less than  {{convert|20|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} from him. In the end, after "Issa" threatened to kill two of the hostages, the police retreated from the premises.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Heinz Hohensinn in [[One Day in September]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point during the crisis, the negotiators demanded direct contact with the hostages to satisfy themselves the Israelis were still alive. Fencing coach [[Andre Spitzer]], who spoke fluent German, and shooting coach [[Kehat Shorr]], the senior member of the Israeli delegation, had a brief conversation with West German officials while standing at the second-floor window of the besieged building, with two kidnappers holding guns on them. When Spitzer attempted to answer a question, he was clubbed with the butt of an [[AK-47]] in full view of international television cameras and pulled away from the window. A few minutes later, Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Walter Tröger, the mayor of the Olympic Village, were briefly allowed into the apartments to speak with the hostages. Tröger spoke of being very moved by the dignity with which the Israelis held themselves, and that they seemed resigned to their fate.&lt;ref name="Reeve"/&gt;

Tröger noticed that several of the hostages, especially Gutfreund, showed signs of having suffered [[physical abuse]] at the hands of the kidnappers, and that David Berger had been shot in his left shoulder. While being debriefed by the crisis team, Genscher and Tröger told them that they had seen "four or five" attackers inside the apartment. Fatefully, these numbers were accepted as definitive. While Genscher and Tröger were talking with the hostages, Kehat Shorr had told the West Germans that the Israelis would not object to being flown to an Arab country, provided that strict guarantees for their safety were made by the Germans and whichever nation they landed in. At 6&amp;nbsp;pm Munich time, the Palestinians issued a new dictate, demanding transportation to [[Cairo]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Failed rescue==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}

===Ambush plan===
The authorities feigned agreement to the Cairo demand{{unclear inline|date=October 2018}} (although Egyptian Prime Minister [[Aziz Sedki]] had already told the West German authorities that the Egyptians did not wish to become involved in the hostage crisis).&lt;ref name="Groussard"&gt;Groussard.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Bell UH-1]] military helicopters were to transport the terrorists and hostages to nearby [[Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base|Fürstenfeldbruck]], a NATO airbase. Initially, the perpetrators' plan was to go to [[Munich-Riem airport|Riem]], which was the international airport near Munich at the time, but the negotiators convinced them that Fürstenfeldbruck would be more practical. The authorities, who preceded the Black Septemberists and hostages in a third helicopter, had an ulterior motive: they planned an armed assault at the airport.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Realizing that the Palestinians and Israelis had to walk 200 metres through the underground garages to reach the helicopters, the West German police saw another opportunity to ambush the perpetrators, and placed sharpshooters there. But "Issa" insisted on checking the route first. He and some other Palestinians walked pointing their AK-47s at Schreiber, Tröger and Genscher. At that time, the police snipers were lying behind cars in the sidestreets, and when they approached the latter crawled away, making noise in the process. Thus the terrorists were immediately alerted of the dangerous presence, and they decided to use a bus instead of walking. The bus arrived at 10:00 pm and drove the contingent to the helicopters. "Issa" checked them with a flashlight before boarding in groups.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Tröger in ''[[One Day in September]]''&lt;!-- when? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Five West German policemen were deployed around the airport in sniper roles—three on the roof of the control tower, one hidden behind a service truck and one behind a small signal tower at ground level. However, none of them had any special sniper training, nor any special weapon (being equipped with the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|H&amp;K G3]], the ordinary battle rifle of the [[Bundeswehr|German Armed Forces]] without optics or night vision devices). The soldiers{{contradict inline|reason=soldiers or police|date=October 2018}} were selected because they shot competitively on weekends.&lt;ref name="when the terror began"&gt;{{citation|author1=Alexander Wolff|authorlink1=Alexander Wolff |author2=Don Yaeger |authorlink2=Don Yaeger|title=When the Terror Began |url= https://www.si.com/vault/2002/08/26/328187/when-the-terror-began-thirty-years-later-the-hostage-drama-that-left-11-israeli-olympians-dead-seems-even-more-chilling-and-offers-grim-reminders-to-todays-security-experts|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]| accessdate=16 November 2015 |date =26 August 2002| volume=97| issue=8|pages=58-72| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20021004071720/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/news/2002/08/20/main/ |archivedate=4 October 2002|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a subsequent German investigation, an officer identified as "Sniper No. 2" stated: "I am of the opinion that I am not a sharpshooter."&lt;ref name="cbsnews"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/05/world/main520865.shtml| title=Munich Massacre Remembered| date=5 September 2002|accessdate=10 February 2010|first=Francie |last=Grace|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the crisis team{{mdash}}Schreiber, Genscher, Merk and Schreiber's deputy Georg Wolf{{mdash}}supervised and observed the attempted rescue from the airport control tower. Cooley, Reeve and Groussard all place [[Mossad]] chief [[Zvi Zamir]] and Victor Cohen, one of Zamir's senior assistants, at the scene as well, but as observers only. Zamir has stated repeatedly in interviews over the years that he was never consulted by the Germans at any time during the rescue attempt and thought that his presence actually made the Germans uncomfortable.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A [[Boeing 727]] jet was positioned on the tarmac with sixteen West German police inside dressed as flight crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Munich Massacre| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7-WvfWXn7U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=LLItb2dLp-6NlYuBFl4AwvKg&amp;t=390|publisher=ESPN via YouTube| accessdate =18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was agreed that "Issa" and "Tony" would inspect the plane. The plan was that the West Germans would overpower them as they boarded, giving the snipers a chance to kill the remaining terrorists at the helicopters. These were believed to number no more than two or three, according to what Genscher and Tröger had seen inside 31 Connollystraße. However, during the transfer from the bus to the helicopters, the crisis team discovered that there were actually eight of them.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Failure===
At the last minute, as the helicopters were arriving at Fürstenfeldbruck, the West German police aboard the airplane voted to abandon their mission, without consulting the central command. This left only the five sharpshooters to try to overpower a larger and more heavily armed group. At that point, Colonel [[Ulrich Wegener]], Genscher's senior aide and later the founder of the elite German counter-terrorist unit [[GSG 9]], said "I'm sure this will blow the whole affair!".&lt;ref name="Reeve"/&gt;

The helicopters landed just after 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm and the four pilots and six of the kidnappers emerged. While four of the Black September members held the pilots at gunpoint (breaking an earlier promise that they would not take any Germans hostage), Issa and Tony walked over to inspect the jet, only to find it empty. Realizing they had been lured into a trap, they sprinted back toward the helicopters. As they ran past the control tower, Sniper 3 took one last opportunity to eliminate "Issa", which would have left the group leaderless. However, due to the poor lighting, he struggled to see his target and missed, hitting "Tony" in the thigh instead. Meanwhile, the West German authorities gave the order for snipers positioned nearby to open fire, which occurred around 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm.

In the ensuing chaos, Ahmed Chic Thaa and Afif Ahmed Hamid, the two kidnappers holding the helicopter pilots, were killed while the remaining gunmen{{mdash}}some possibly already wounded{{mdash}}scrambled to safety, returning fire from behind and beneath the helicopters, out of the snipers' line of sight, shooting out many of the airport lights. A West German policeman in the control tower, Anton Fliegerbauer, was killed by the gunfire. The helicopter pilots fled; the hostages, tied up inside the craft, could not. During the gun battle, the hostages secretly worked on loosening their bonds and teethmarks were found on some of the ropes after the gunfire had ended.&lt;ref name="Groussard"/&gt;

===Massacre===
The West Germans had not arranged for armored personnel carriers ahead of time and only at this point were they called in to break the deadlock. Since the roads to the airport had not been cleared, the carriers became stuck in traffic and finally arrived around midnight. With their appearance, the kidnappers felt the shift in the status quo, and possibly panicked at the thought of the failure of their operation.

At four minutes past midnight of 6 September, one of them (likely Issa) turned on the hostages in the eastern helicopter and fired at them with a [[Kalashnikov assault rifle]] from [[point-blank range]]. Springer, Halfin and Friedman were killed instantly; Berger, shot twice in the leg, is believed to have survived the initial onslaught (as his autopsy later found that he had died of smoke inhalation). The attacker then pulled the pin on a hand grenade and tossed it into the cockpit; the ensuing explosion destroyed the helicopter and incinerated the bound Israelis inside.

Issa then dashed across the tarmac and began firing at the police, who killed him with return fire. Another, Khalid Jawad, attempted to escape and was gunned down by one of the snipers. What happened to the remaining hostages is still a matter of dispute. A German police investigation indicated that one of their snipers and a few of the hostages may have been shot inadvertently by the police. However, a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reconstruction of the long-suppressed Bavarian prosecutor's report indicates that a third kidnapper (Reeve identifies Adnan Al-Gashey) stood at the door of the western helicopter and raked the remaining five hostages with machine gun fire; Gutfreund, Shorr, Slavin, Spitzer and Shapira were shot an average of four times each.&lt;ref name="when the terror began" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Groussard"/&gt;

Of the four hostages in the eastern helicopter, only [[Ze'ev Friedman]]'s body was relatively intact; he had been blown clear of the helicopter by the explosion. In some cases, the exact cause of death for the hostages in the eastern helicopter was difficult to establish because the rest of the corpses were burned almost beyond recognition in the explosion and subsequent fire. Three of the remaining men lay on the ground, one of them feigning death, and were captured by police. [[Jamal Al-Gashey]] had been shot through his right wrist,&lt;ref name="Reeve"/&gt; and Mohammed Safady had sustained a flesh wound to his leg.&lt;ref name="Groussard"/&gt; [[Adnan Al-Gashey]] had escaped injury completely. Tony escaped the scene, but was tracked down with police dogs 40 minutes later in an airbase parking lot. Cornered and bombarded with tear gas, he was shot dead after a brief gunfight. By around 1:30&amp;nbsp;am on 6 September, the battle was over.

===Outcome===
Initial news reports, published all over the world, indicated that all the hostages were alive, and that all the attackers had been killed. Only later did a representative for the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) suggest that "initial reports were overly optimistic." [[Jim McKay]], who was covering the Olympics that year for the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), had taken on the job of reporting the events as [[Roone Arledge]] fed them into his earpiece. At 3:24&amp;nbsp;am, McKay received the official confirmation:

{{quote|We just got the final word&amp;nbsp;... you know, when I was a kid, my father used to say "Our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized." Our worst fears have been realized tonight. They've now said that there were eleven hostages. Two were killed in their rooms yesterday morning, nine were killed at the airport tonight.

Several sources listed Ladany as having been killed.&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Turnbull|first=Simon|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/shaul-ladany-still-king-of-the-road-6295322.html|title=Shaul Ladany: Still king of the road&amp;nbsp;– Olympics|publisher=The Independent|date=27 January 2012|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladany recalled later: 

{{Quote|The impact did not hit me at the time, when we were in Munich. It was when we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd—maybe 20,000 people—and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway. Some friends came up to me and tried to kiss me and hug me as if I was almost a ghost that came back alive. It was then that I really grasped what had happened and the emotion hit me.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;}}

===Criticism===
Author [[Simon Reeve (British TV presenter)|Simon Reeve]], among others, writes that the shootout with the well-trained Black September members showed an egregious lack of preparation on the part of the German authorities. They were not prepared to deal with this sort of situation. This costly lesson led directly to the founding, less than two months later, of police counter-terrorism branch [[GSG 9]]. German authorities made a number of mistakes. First, because of restrictions in the post-war West German [[Grundgesetz|constitution]], the [[Bundeswehr|army]] could not participate in the attempted rescue, as the German armed forces are not allowed to operate inside Germany during peacetime. The responsibility was entirely in the hands of the [[Munich]] police and the [[Bavaria]]n authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Ulrich Wegener]] in ''[[One Day in September]]''.&lt;!-- When --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2012|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use [[Template:Cite web]] or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see [[WP:CITE]]) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

It was known a half-hour before the hostages and kidnappers had even arrived at [[Fürstenfeldbruck]] that the number of the latter was larger than first believed. Despite this new information, Schreiber decided to continue with the rescue operation as originally planned and the new information could not reach the snipers since they had no radios.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, pp. 103, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a basic tenet of sniping operations that there are enough snipers (at least two for each ''known'' target, or in this case a minimum of ten) deployed to neutralize as many of the attackers as possible with the first volley of shots.&lt;ref&gt;Groussard, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 ''National Geographic'' Channel's ''[[Seconds From Disaster]]'' profile on the massacre stated that the helicopters were supposed to land sideways and to the west of the control tower, a maneuver which would have allowed the snipers clear shots into them as the kidnappers threw open the helicopter doors. Instead, the helicopters were landed facing the control tower and at the centre of the airstrip. This not only gave them a place to hide after the gunfight began, but put Snipers 1 and 2 in the line of fire of the other three snipers on the control tower. The snipers were denied valuable shooting opportunities as a result of the positioning of the helicopters, stacking the odds against what were effectively three snipers versus eight heavily armed gunmen.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

According to the same program, the crisis committee delegated to make decisions on how to deal with the incident consisted of Bruno Merk (the Bavarian interior minister), Hans-Dietrich Genscher (the West German interior minister) and Manfred Schreiber (Munich's Chief of Police); in other words, two politicians and one tactician. The program mentioned that a year before the Games, Schreiber had participated in another hostage crisis (a failed bank robbery) in which he ordered a marksman to shoot one of the perpetrators, managing only to wound the robber. As a result, the robbers shot an innocent woman dead. Schreiber was consequently charged with [[involuntary manslaughter]]. An investigation ultimately cleared him of any wrongdoing, but the program suggested that the prior incident affected his judgment in the subsequent Olympic hostage crisis.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

As mentioned earlier, the five German snipers at [[Fürstenfeldbruck]] did not have radio contact with one another (nor with the German authorities conducting the rescue operation) and therefore were unable to coordinate their fire. The only contact the snipers had with the operational leadership was with Georg Wolf, who was lying next to the three snipers on the control tower giving orders directly to them.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, pp. 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt; The two snipers at ground level had been given vague instructions to shoot when the other snipers began shooting, and were basically left to fend for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, pp. 106–07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the snipers did not have the proper equipment for this hostage rescue operation. The [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3]] [[battle rifle]]s used were considered by several experts to be inadequate for the distance at which the snipers were trying to shoot. The G3, the standard service rifle of the [[Bundeswehr]] at that time, had a {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} barrel; at the distances the snipers were required to shoot, a {{convert|27|in|mm|adj=on}} barrel would have ensured far greater accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Groussard, pp. 354–55.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the rifles were equipped with telescopic or infrared sights.&lt;ref name="Reeve, pg. 116"/&gt; Additionally, none of the snipers were equipped with a steel helmet or bullet-proof vest.&lt;ref name="Reeve, pg. 116"&gt;Reeve, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; No armored vehicles were at the scene at Fürstenfeldbruck, and were only called in after the gunfight was well underway.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, pp. 118-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also numerous tactical errors. As mentioned earlier, "Sniper 2", who was stationed behind the signal tower, wound up directly in the line of fire of his fellow snipers on the control tower, without any protective gear and without any other police being aware of his location.&lt;ref name="Reeve, pg. 116"/&gt; Because of this, "Sniper 2" didn't fire a single shot until late in the gunfight, when hostage-taker Khalid Jawad attempted to escape on foot and ran right at the exposed sniper. "Sniper 2" killed the fleeing perpetrator but was in turn badly wounded by a fellow police officer, who was unaware that he was shooting at one of his own men. One of the helicopter pilots, Gunnar Ebel, was lying near "Sniper 2" and was also wounded by friendly fire. Both Ebel and the sniper recovered from their injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, pp. 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the errors made by the Germans during the rescue attempt were ultimately detailed by Heinz Hohensinn, who had participated in Operation Sunshine earlier that day. He stated in ''[[One Day in September]]'' that he had been selected to pose as a crew member. He and his fellow policemen understood that it was a suicide mission, so the group unanimously voted to flee the plane. None of them were reprimanded for that desertion.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, pp. 236–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The bodies of the five Palestinian attackers—Afif, Nazzal, Chic Thaa, Hamid and Jamal—killed during the Fürstenfeldbruck gun battle were delivered to Libya, where they received heroes' funerals and were buried with full military honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sonneborn |first=Liz |title=Murder at the 1972 Olympics in Munich |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=dMsqeStglxMC&amp;pg=PT53&amp;dq=The+five+Palestinian+terrorists+killed+during+the+operation+were+also+moruned+in+their+homeland.+During+a+funeral+ceremony+in+Libya,+more+than+30,000+people+turned+out+to+honor+the+dead.&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDjfmNoKHaAhXEPFAKHXx7DaAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20five%20Palestinian%20terrorists%20killed%20during%20the%20operation%20were%20also%20moruned%20in%20their%20homeland.%20During%20a%20funeral%20ceremony%20in%20Libya%2C%20more%20than%2030%2C000%20people%20turned%20out%20to%20honor%20the%20dead.&amp;f=false|publisher=Rosen Publishing |year=2003 |page=52 |isbn=9780823936540}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September, Israeli planes [[1972 Israeli air raid in Syria and Lebanon|bombed ten PLO bases in Syria and Lebanon]] in response to the massacre, killing scores of militants and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/olympics-massacre-munich-the-real-story-5336955.html Olympics Massacre: Munich - The real story], ''The Independent'', 22 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three surviving Black September gunmen had been arrested after the [[Fürstenfeldbruck]] gunfight, and were being held in a Munich prison for trial. On 29 October, [[Lufthansa Flight 615]] was hijacked and threatened to be blown up if the Munich attackers were not released. Safady and the Al-Gasheys were immediately released by West Germany, receiving a tumultuous welcome when they touched down in Libya and (as seen in ''One Day in September'') giving their own firsthand account of their operation at a press conference broadcast worldwide.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XE8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sdEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5061,4223635&amp;dq=lufthansa+615+olympics&amp;hl=en|title=West Germany Cool to Capitulation Charge|publisher=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|date=30 October 1972|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google8"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wwPNjSnxcYC&amp;pg=PA439&amp;lpg=PA439&amp;dq=lufthansa+615++olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rpRAKK0nfS&amp;sig=3XdM6nnMpR22VAbk5OCVz-BXlm8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XW4vUYyMEsfA0QHnu4CICw&amp;ved=0CIkBEOgBMA0#v=onepage&amp;q=lufthansa%20615%20%20olympics&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Terrorism|author=Peter Chalk|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2012|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on the Games===
In the wake of the hostage-taking, competition was eventually suspended for the first time in modern Olympic history, after public criticism of the Olympic Committee's decision to continue the games. On 6 September, a memorial service attended by 80,000 spectators and 3,000 athletes was held in the Olympic Stadium. IOC President [[Avery Brundage]] made little reference to the murdered athletes during a speech praising the strength of the Olympic movement and equating the attack on the Israeli sportsmen with the recent arguments about encroaching professionalism and disallowing [[Rhodesia]]'s participation in the Games, which outraged many listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/games-must-go-on-says-brundage-1.36208|title='Games must go on', says Brundage|date=7 September 1972|accessdate=13 August 2016|first=Jack|last=Ellis|publisher=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims' families were represented by Andre Spitzer's widow Ankie, Moshe Weinberg's mother, and a cousin of Weinberg, Carmel Eliash. During the memorial service, Eliash collapsed and died of a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/3032261/Athletics-Memories-stirred-of-Olympic-hostage-horror.html|title=Athletics: Memories stirred of Olympic hostage horror|date=6 August 2002|accessdate=11 October 2012|first=Brendan|last=Gallagher|publisher=[[The Telegraph (UK)]]|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the 80,000 people who filled the Olympic Stadium for [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]]'s [[Football at the 1972 Summer Olympics|football]] match with [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] carried noisemakers and waved flags, but when several spectators unfurled a banner reading "17 dead, already forgotten?" security officers removed the sign and expelled those responsible from the grounds.&lt;ref name="when the terror began"/&gt; During the memorial service, the [[Olympic Flag]] was flown at [[half-staff]], along with the flags of most of the other competing nations at the request of [[Willy Brandt]]. Ten [[Arab]] nations objected to their flags being lowered to honor murdered Israelis; their flags were restored to the tops of their flagpoles almost immediately.&lt;ref name = "CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/events/1996/olympics/daily/july29/flemfile.html |title=Remembering the Munich 11? |accessdate=22 July 2006 |last=Fleming |first=David |date=29 July 1996 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000916002402/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/events/1996/olympics/daily/july29/flemfile.html |archive-date=16 September 2000 |work=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willi Daume, president of the [[Munich]] organizing committee, initially sought to cancel the remainder of the Games, but in the afternoon Brundage and others who wished to continue the Games prevailed, stating that they could not let the incident halt the Games.&lt;ref name="when the terror began"/&gt; Brundage stated "The Games must go on, and we must&amp;nbsp;... and we must continue our efforts to keep them clean, pure and honest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1972/1972-Election/12305688736666-2/#title |title=Munich Crisis |publisher=Upi.com |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was endorsed by the Israeli government and Israeli Olympic team chef de mission Shmuel Lalkin.&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Encarta article on the Olympic Games |url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761562380__1/Olympic_Games.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx81INBj?url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761562380__1/Olympic_Games.html |archivedate= 1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September, after the memorial service, the remaining members of the Israeli team withdrew from the Games and left Munich. All Jewish sportsmen were placed under guard. [[Mark Spitz]], the American swimming star who had already completed his competitions, left Munich during the hostage crisis (it was feared that as a prominent Jew, Spitz might now be a kidnapping target). The [[Egypt]]ian team left the Games on 7 September, stating they feared reprisals.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,12269,1298214,00.html Guardian article on the massacre], 7 September 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippines|Philippine]] and [[Algeria]]n teams also left the Games, as did some members of the Dutch and Norwegian teams. American [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] runner [[Kenny Moore]], who wrote about the incident for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', quoted Dutch distance runner [[Jos Hermens]] as saying "It's quite simple. We were invited to a party, and if someone comes to the party and shoots people, how can you stay?"&lt;ref name="NYT-2002-08-12"&gt;{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=Pat|publication-date=12 August 2002|title=ATHLETICS: In Munich, Israelis honor '72 victims|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/sports/12iht-track_ed3_.html|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many athletes, dazed by the tragedy, similarly felt that their desire to compete had been destroyed, although they stayed at the Games.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Four years later at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montreal, the Israeli team commemorated the massacre: when they entered the stadium at the Opening Ceremony, their national flag was adorned with a black ribbon.

The families of some victims have asked the IOC to establish a permanent memorial to the athletes. The IOC has declined, saying that to introduce a specific reference to the victims could "alienate other members of the Olympic community," according to the BBC.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3581866.stm BBC News article on commemoration at 2004 Olympics], 20 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Gilady, an Israeli IOC official, told the BBC: "We must consider what this could do to other members of the delegations that are hostile to Israel."

The IOC rejected an international campaign in support of a [[2012 Olympics one minute of silence campaign|minute of silence]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]] of the [[2012 London Olympics]] in honour of the Israeli victims on the 40th anniversary of the massacre.&lt;ref name="Rogge rejects1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/rogge-again-rejects-calls-for-minutes-silence-for-victims-of-1972-munich-massacre/2012/07/21/gJQAjL6h0W_story.html |title=Rogge again rejects calls for minute's silence for victims of 1972 Munich massacre |work=The Washington Post |agency=The Associated Press |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogge rejects 4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/still-refusing-moment-of-silence-olympic-head-says-memorial-will-be-held-in-germany/ |title=Still refusing moment of silence, Olympic head says memorial will be held in Germany |work=The Times of Israel |date=22 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012 |author=Davidovich, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Rogge]], the IOC President, said it would be "inappropriate," although the opening ceremony included a memorium for the victims of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pbsinternational.org/programs/munich-72-and-beyond|title=Munich '72 and Beyond |publisher=Pbsinternational.org|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of the decision, Olympian Shaul Ladany, who survived the attack, commented: "I do not understand.

There is a memorial outside the Olympic stadium in Munich in the form of a stone tablet at the bridge linking the stadium to the former Olympic village. There is a memorial tablet to the slain Israelis outside the front door of their former lodging at 31 Connollystraße. On 15 October 1999 (almost a year before the Sydney 2000 Games), a memorial plaque was unveiled in one of the large light towers (Tower 14) outside the Sydney Olympic Stadium.&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2000/8/Going%20for%20Gold-%20Israel%20at%20the%20Sydney%202000%20Olympics|title=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs article on Sydney 2000 Olympics and Plaque|publisher=MFA|accessdate=7 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329154039/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2000/8/Going%20for%20Gold-%20Israel%20at%20the%20Sydney%202000%20Olympics|archivedate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JSF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/14360/edition_id/279/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Simon Reeve's article in 2000: ''Munich massacre's echoes heard amid Sydney's jubilee''|publisher=Jewishsf|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli response===
{{main|Operation Wrath of God|1973 Israeli raid on Lebanon}}
[[Golda Meir]] and the Israeli Defense Committee secretly authorized the [[Mossad]] to track down and kill those allegedly responsible for the Munich massacre.&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;Morris.{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation that this was motivated by a desire for vengeance was disputed by [[Zvi Zamir]], who described the mission as "putting an end to the type of terror that was perpetrated" in Europe.&lt;ref name="Yossi"&gt;Melman.{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end Mossad set up a number of special teams to locate and kill these [[fedayeen]], aided by the agency's stations in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1695135,00.html "Munich: Mossad breaks cover"] by Ewen MacAskill and Ian Black, ''The Guardian'', 26 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2006 interview,&lt;ref name="Yossi"/&gt; former Mossad chief Zvi Zamir answered direct questions:

{{quote|multiline=y|Was there no element of vengeance in the decision to take action against the terrorists?

No. We were not engaged in vengeance. We are accused of having been guided by a desire for vengeance. That is nonsense. What we did was to concretely prevent in the future. We acted against those who thought that they would continue to perpetrate acts of terror. I am not saying that those who were involved in Munich were not marked for death. They definitely deserved to die. But we were not dealing with the past; we concentrated on the future.

'Did you not receive a directive from Golda Meir along the lines of 'take revenge on those responsible for Munich?

Golda abhorred the necessity that was imposed on us to carry out the operations. Golda never told me to 'take revenge on those who were responsible for Munich.' No one told me that.&lt;ref name="Yossi"/&gt;}}

The Israeli mission later became known as ''Operation Wrath of God'' or ''Mivtza Za'am Ha'El''.&lt;ref name="Reeve"/&gt; Reeve quotes General [[Aharon Yariv]]—who, he writes, was the general overseer of the operation—as stating that after Munich the Israeli government felt it had no alternative but to exact justice. 

{{quote|We had no choice. We had to make them stop, and there was no other way&amp;nbsp;... we are not very proud about it. But it was a question of sheer necessity. We went back to the old biblical rule of an eye for an eye&amp;nbsp;... I approach these problems not from a moral point of view, but, hard as it may sound, from a cost-benefit point of view. If I'm very hard-headed, I can say, what is the political benefit in killing this person? Will it bring us nearer to peace? Will it bring us nearer to an understanding with the Palestinians or not? In most cases I don't think it will. But in the case of Black September we had no other choice and it worked. Is it morally acceptable? One can debate that question. Is it politically vital? It was.&lt;ref name="Reeve"/&gt;}}

[[Benny Morris]] writes that a target list was created using information from "turned" [[PLO]] personnel and friendly European intelligence services. Once completed, a wave of assassinations of suspected Black September operatives began across Europe. On 9 April 1973, Israel launched [[1973 Israeli raid on Lebanon|Operation "Spring of Youth"]], a joint Mossad–IDF operation in [[Beirut]]. The targets were Mohammad Yusuf al-Najjar (Abu Yusuf), head of [[Fatah]]'s intelligence arm, which ran Black September, according to Morris; Kamal Adwan, who headed the PLO's Western Sector, which controlled PLO action inside Israel; and Kamal Nassir, the PLO spokesman. A group of [[Sayeret]] commandos were taken in nine missile boats and a small fleet of patrol boats to a deserted Lebanese beach, before driving in two cars to downtown Beirut, where they killed Najjar, Adwan and Nassir. Two further detachments of commandos blew up the PFLP's headquarters in Beirut and a Fatah explosives plant. The leader of the commando team that conducted the operations was [[Ehud Barak]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

On 21 July 1973, in the [[Lillehammer affair]], a team of Mossad agents mistakenly killed [[Ahmed Bouchiki]], a Moroccan man unrelated to the Munich attack, in [[Lillehammer]], Norway,&lt;ref name="The hunt for Black September"&gt;Shalev, Noam [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4627388.stm 'The hunt for Black September']. BBC. Retrieved 4 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; after an informant mistakenly said Bouchiki was [[Ali Hassan Salameh]], the head of [[Force 17]] and a Black September operative. Five Mossad agents, including two women, were captured by the Norwegian authorities, while others managed to slip away.&lt;ref name="Morris" /&gt; The five were convicted of the killing and imprisoned, but were released and returned to Israel in 1975. The Mossad later found [[Ali Hassan Salameh]] in Beirut and killed him on 22 January 1979 with a remote-controlled car bomb. The attack killed four passersby and injured 18 others.&lt;ref name=time1979&gt;{{cite news |title=MIDDLE EAST: Death of a Terrorist |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,946209,00.html |work=Time |date=5 February 1979|volume=113|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to CIA officer Duane "Dewey" Claridge, chief of operations of the CIA Near East Division from 1975 to 1978, in mid-1976, Salameh offered Americans assistance and protection with Arafat's blessings during the American embassy pull-out from Beirut during the down-spiraling chaos of the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. There was a general feeling that Americans could be trusted. However, the scene of cooperation came to an end abruptly after the assassination of Salameh. Americans were generally blamed as Israel's principal benefactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Posner |first=Gerald |page=13 |title=Why America slept: the failure to prevent 9/11 |year=2004 |publisher=Random House Inc. |isbn=0-8129-6623-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Reeve writes that the Israeli operations continued for more than twenty years. He details the assassination in Paris in 1992 of [[Atef Bseiso]], the PLO's head of intelligence, and says that an Israeli general confirmed there was a link back to Munich. Reeve also writes that while Israeli officials have stated ''Operation Wrath of God'' was intended to exact vengeance for the families of the athletes killed in Munich, "few relatives wanted such a violent reckoning with the Palestinians." Reeve states the families were instead desperate to know the truth of the events surrounding the Munich massacre. Reeve outlines what he sees as a lengthy cover-up by German authorities to hide the truth.&lt;ref name="Reeve"/&gt; After a lengthy court fight, in 2004 the families of the Munich victims reached a settlement of €3 million with the German government.

=== Alleged German cover-up ===

An article in 2012 in a front-page story of the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that much of the information pertaining to the mishandling of the massacre was covered up by the German authorities. For twenty years, Germany refused to release any information about the attack and did not accept responsibility for the results. The magazine reported that the government had been hiding 3,808 files, which contained tens of thousands of documents. ''Der Spiegel'' said it obtained secret reports by authorities, embassy cables, and minutes of cabinet meetings that demonstrate the lack of professionalism of the German officials in handling the massacre. The newspaper also wrote that the German authorities were told that Palestinians were planning an "incident" at the Olympics three weeks before the massacre, but failed to take the necessary security measures, and these facts are missing from the official documentation of the German government.&lt;ref name="Times of Israel Munich Knew" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Der Spiegel Munich"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/officials-ignored-warnings-of-munich-olympics-massacre-a-845867.html |title=Officials Ignored Warnings of Terrorist Attack |publisher=Der Spiegel |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haaretz Munich"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/germany-was-warned-one-month-before-munich-massacre-claims-der-spiegel.premium-1.452809 |title=Germany was warned one month before Munich massacre, claims Der Spiege |work=Ha'aretz |date=22 July 2012 |accessdate=23 July 2012 |author=Aderet, Oferet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPost Der Spiegel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=278504 |title=Der Spiegel: Germany had warning of Munich attack |date=22 July 2012 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, ''Der Spiegel'' reported that following the massacre, Germany began secret meetings with Black September, at the behest of the West German government, due to the fear that Black September would carry out other terrorist attacks in Germany. The government proposed a clandestine meeting between German Foreign Minister [[Walter Scheel]] and a member of Black September to create a "new basis of trust." In return for an exchange of the political status of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], the PLO would stop terrorist attacks on German soil. When French police arrested [[Abu Daoud]], one of the chief organizers of the Munich massacre, and inquired about extraditing him to Germany, Bavaria's justice secretary {{Interlanguage link multi|Alfred Seidl|de}} recommended that Germany should not take any action, causing the French to release Abu Daoud and the [[Hafez al-Assad|Assad]] regime to shelter him until he died at a Damascus hospital in 2010.&lt;ref name="Jpost munich germany"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=282656 |title='Germany met with Munich terrorists after attack' |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=26 August 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2012 |author=Weinthal, Benjamin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826221215/http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=282656 |archivedate=26 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the three surviving gunmen, Mohammed Safady and Adnan Al-Gashey, were allegedly killed by Mossad as part of ''Operation Wrath of God''. Al-Gashey was allegedly located after making contact with a cousin in a [[Persian Gulf|Gulf State]], and Safady was found by remaining in touch with family in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; This account was challenged in a book by Aaron J. Klein, who claims that Al-Gashey died of heart failure in the 1970s, and that Safady was killed by Christian [[Kataeb Party|Phalangists]] in Lebanon in the early 1980s. However, in July 2005, PLO veteran Tawfiq Tirawi told Klein that Safady, whom Tirawi claimed as a close friend, was "as alive as you are."&lt;ref name="when the terror began"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klein |first=Aaron |title=Striking back: The 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre and Israel's deadly response |publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks |location=New York |year=2007 |isbn=9780812974638}}{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third surviving gunman, [[Jamal Al-Gashey]], was known to be alive as of 1999, hiding in North Africa or in [[Syria]], claiming to still fear retribution from Israel. He is the only one of the surviving terrorists to consent to interviews since 1972, having granted an interview in 1992 to a Palestinian newspaper, and having briefly emerged from hiding in 1999 to participate in an interview for the film ''[[One Day in September]]'', during which he was disguised and his face shown only in blurry shadow.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/186705/One-Day-in-September/details |title=One Day in September |accessdate=22 November 2008 |work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abu Daoud ===

Of those believed to have planned the massacre, only [[Abu Daoud]], the man who claims that the attack was his idea, is known to have died of natural causes. Historical documents released to ''Der Spiegel'' by the German secret service show that [[Dortmund]] police had been aware of collaboration between Abu Daoud and neo-Nazi {{Interlanguage link multi|Willi Pohl|de}} ({{aka}} E. W. Pless and, since 1979, officially named Willi Voss) seven weeks before the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.de/national/20120617-43199.html Neo-Nazi 'aided Munich Olympics massacre'], The Local 17 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1977, Abu Daoud was intercepted by French police in Paris while traveling from [[Beirut]] under an assumed name.&lt;ref name="'70s 319"&gt;{{cite book |title=How We Got Here: The '70s |last=Frum |first=David |authorlink=David Frum |year=2000 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York City |isbn=0-465-04195-7 |page=319 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under protest from the PLO, [[Iraq]], and [[Libya]], who claimed that because Abu Daoud was traveling to a PLO comrade's funeral he should receive [[diplomatic immunity]], the French government refused a West German extradition request on grounds that forms had not been filled in properly, and put him on a plane to [[Algeria]] before Germany could submit another request.&lt;ref name="'70s 319"/&gt; On 27 July 1981, he was shot 5 times from a distance of around two meters in a [[Warsaw]] Victoria (now Sofitel) hotel coffee shop, but survived the attack, chasing his would-be assassin down to the coffee shop's front entrance before collapsing.

Abu Daoud was allowed safe passage through Israel in 1996 so he could attend a PLO meeting convened in the [[Gaza Strip]] for the purpose of rescinding an article in its charter that called for Israel's eradication.&lt;ref name="when the terror began"/&gt; In his autobiography, ''From Jerusalem to Munich'', first published in France in 1999, and later in a written interview with ''Sports Illustrated'',&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/news/2002/08/20/sb2 |title=The Mastermind |publisher=Sports Illustrated |work=Sports Illustrated |date=26 August 2002 |accessdate=7 June 2010 |author=Wolff, Alexander|archive-date=4 October 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021004095420/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/news/2002/08/20/sb2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Daoud wrote that funds for Munich were provided by [[Mahmoud Abbas]], Chairman of the PLO since 11 November 2004 and President of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] since 15 January 2005.&lt;ref name="ILC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israellawcenter.org/page.asp?id=340&amp;show=photo&amp;pn=1093&amp;ref=report |title=Israel Law Center on Abu Mazen |publisher=Israel law center |accessdate=3 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331131708/http://www.israellawcenter.org/page.asp?id=340&amp;show=photo&amp;pn=1093&amp;ref=report |archivedate=31 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Though he claims he didn't know what the money was being spent for, longtime Fatah official Mahmoud Abbas, aka Abu Mazen, was responsible for the financing of the Munich attack.&lt;ref name="Daoud"&gt;Abu Daoud.{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abu Daoud believed that if the Israelis knew that Mahmoud Abbas was the financier of the operation, the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] would not have been achieved, during which Mahmoud Abbas was seen in photo ops at the [[White House]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

Abu Daoud, who lived with his wife on a pension provided by the [[Palestinian Authority]], said that "the Munich operation had the endorsement of Arafat," although Arafat was not involved in conceiving or implementing the attack. In his autobiography, Abu Daoud writes that Arafat saw the team off on the mission with the words "God protect you."&lt;ref name="CNS"&gt;{{cite web |last=Goodenough |first=Patrick |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/InDepth/archive/199905/IND19990505c.html |title=Munich Olympics Massacre Said to Be PLO Operation |date=5 May 1999 |website=CNSNews.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404022532/http://www.cnsnews.com/InDepth/archive/199905/IND19990505c.html |archivedate=4 April 2004 |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ankie Spitzer, widow of fencing coach [[Andre Spitzer|Andre]], declined several offers to meet with Abu Daoud, saying that the only place she wants to meet him is in a courtroom.

The use of terms and images referring to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]/[[First Nations]] as the name or [[mascot]] for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their "[[Chief Wahoo]]" logo); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term "[[Redskin (slang)|redskin]]s" being defined in most American English dictionaries as "derogatory slang"). The year 2017 was marked by numerous professional sports player protests during the national anthem against racism and police brutality. As a result, criticism of the stereotyping of Native Americans as mascots also increased, including the decision to have the Washington Redskins host a game on Thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0027-8378| last = Zirin| first = Dave| title = By Having the Washington R*dskins Host a Game on Thanksgiving, NFL Owners Show Their True Colors| magazine = The Nation| accessdate = November 24, 2017| date = November 17, 2017| url = https://www.thenation.com/article/by-having-the-washington-rdskins-host-a-game-on-thanksgiving-nfl-owners-show-their-true-colors/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, have been made since the 1970s.

The issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.&lt;ref name="King.2010"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages.&lt;ref name="Davis.2010"&gt;{{cite journal| issn = 1068-3844| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = 11–14| last = Davis| first = Laurel R.| title = The problems with Native American mascots| journal = Multicultural Education| accessdate = October 10, 2017|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ649928}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship. The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups, thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals.&lt;ref name="Morris.2015"&gt;{{cite journal| author=S.P.

==History==
[[European American]]s have had a history of "playing Indian" that dates back to the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]]. In the 19th century, fraternal organizations such as the [[Tammanies|Tammany Societies]] and the [[Improved Order of Red Men]] adopted the words and material culture of Native Americans in part to establish an aboriginal identity, while ignoring the dispossession and conquest of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Deloria| first=Philip J.| year=1998| title=[[Playing Indian]]| location=New Haven| publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300080674/playing-indian| title=Playing Indian| publisher=Yale University Press| accessdate=January 6, 2016| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630090119/http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300080674/playing-indian| archivedate=June 30, 2016| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice spread to youth groups such as the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) (in particular, the [[Order of the Arrow]]) and many summer camps. University students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted Indian names and symbols for their sports teams, not from authentic sources but rather as Native American life was imagined by European Americans.&lt;ref name="Spindel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spindel|first=Carol|year=2002|title=Dancing at Halftime: Sports and the Controversy Over American Indian Mascots|location=New York|publisher=New York University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Dancing_at_Halftime.html?id=4p62ket04PgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional team nicknames had similar origins. In professional baseball the team that is now the [[Atlanta Braves]] was founded as the Boston Red Stockings in 1871; becoming the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Braves]] in 1912. Their owner at that time, [[James E. Gaffney|James Gaffney]], was a member of New York City's political machine, [[Tammany Hall]], one of the societies formed to honor [[Tamanend]], a chief of the [[Lenape|Delaware]]. The team that moved to become the [[Washington Redskins]] in 1937 was originally also known as the Boston Braves since the [[American football|football]] and baseball teams played at [[Braves Field]]. After moving to [[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]], the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a "red" identifier while retaining the Braves "Indian Head" logo. While defenders of the Redskins often cite coach [[William Henry Dietz]], who claimed Native American heritage, to justify the name; the use of Native American names and imagery by this [[National Football League|NFL]] team began in 1932 before hiring Dietz in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/wasbos/bosskins.html|title=The Boston Redskins|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cleveland Indians]]' name originated from a request by club owner [[Charles Somers]] to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace the "Naps" following the departure of their star player [[Nap Lajoie]] after the 1914 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Baseball writers select "Indians" as the best name to apply to the former Naps |url= |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=January 17, 1915 |access-date= |quote=With the going of Nap Lajoie to the Athletics, a new name had to be selected for the Cleveland American league club.

The stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the [[Native American boarding schools|boarding schools]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order to educate them as European Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/policy/mascots-justif.pdf|title=APA Resolution Justifications|year=2005|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland ([[Anishinaabe]] heritage) and David E. Wilkins ([[Lumbee]]) both professors of [[Native American studies|American Indian Studies]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]: "Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as ''[[noble savage]]s'', ''[[Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America|ignoble savages]]'', ''teary-eyed [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]]'' or, most recently, simply as ''casino-rich'', native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Star Tribune|title=Stereotypes in sports, chaos in federal policy|author=Carter Meland and David E.

In the 1940s, the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI) created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hylton|first=J Gordon|title=BEFORE THE REDSKINS WERE THE REDSKINS: THE USE OF NATIVE AMERICAN TEAM NAMES IN THE FORMATIVE ERA OF AMERICAN SPORTS, 1857–1933|publisher=North Dakota law review|date=2010-01-01|volume=86|page=879| url=https://law.und.edu/_files/docs/ndlr/pdf/issues/86/4/86ndlr879.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAI maintains that teams with mascots such as the [[Braves]] and the [[Redskin (slang)|Redskin]]s perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native American people, and demean their native traditions and rituals: "Often citing a long held myth by non-Native people that "Indian" mascots "honor Native people," American sports businesses such as the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Washington Redskins|Washington 'Redskins']] and [[Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City 'Chiefs']], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]'s [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland 'Indians']] and [[Atlanta Braves|Atlanta 'Braves']], and the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when white superiority and segregation were commonplace."&lt;ref name="NCAI.2013"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncai.org/resources/ncai_publications/ending-the-legacy-of-racism-in-sports-the-era-of-harmful-indian-sports-mascots| title=Ending the Legacy of Racism in Sports &amp; the Era of Harmful Indian Sports Mascots| accessdate=October 10, 2017| publisher=NCAI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Policy Paper| url=http://www.ncai.org/attachments/policypaper_mijapmouwdbjqftjayzqwlqldrwzvsyfakbwthpmatcoroyolpn_ncai_harmful_mascots_report_ending_the_legacy_of_racism_10_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native mascots are also part of the larger issues of [[cultural appropriation]] and the violation of [[indigenous intellectual property]] rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Riley| first=Angela| title=Straight Stealing: Towards an Indigenous System of Cultural Property Protection| journal=Washington Law Review| volume=80| issue=69| date=2005| ssrn=703283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic [[Social exclusion|marginalization]]. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]], are made while excluding Native concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beyond-standing-rock-the-native-american-economic_us_58b6e21de4b0e5fdf619792b| author=Dedrick Asante-Muhammad| title=Beyond Standing Rock: The Native American Economic Experience| quote=The U.S. has gained far too much from the marginalization of Native Americans| date=March 1, 2017| publisher=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another incident cited as indicative of the misunderstanding of Native American legal status because of stereotyping is the [[Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl|Baby Veronica case]], in which a child was adopted by a white family without the consent of her father, and enrolled member of the [[Cherokee Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/the-washington-redhawks-culture-jam/| title=The Washington Redhawks Culture Jam: Jacqueline Keeler joins the show to talk native mascotry| host=Dave Zirin| publisher=The Nation| accessdate=December 20, 2017| date=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Native Americans are united in total opposition to mascots. Steven Denson, director of diversity for [[Southern Methodist University]] and member of the [[Chickasaw]] nation, while not issuing a blanket endorsement, has nevertheless stated that there are acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner. He states: "I believe it is acceptable if used in a way that fosters understanding and increased positive awareness of the Native-American culture. And it must also be done with the support of the Native-American community. There is a way to achieve a partnership that works together to achieve mutually beneficial goals."&lt;ref name="SMU"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/153383/nativeamerican_nicknamesmascots/index.html| title=Native-American Nicknames/Mascots|publisher=Red Orbit| date=June 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAI recognized the right of individual tribes to established relationships with teams which allowed them to retain their names.&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social sciences and education===

The harm done by the use of Native American mascots, particularly in an academic context, was stated by the Society of Indian Psychologists in 1999:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Stereotypical and historically inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views of indigenous peoples and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aiansip.org/uploads/SIP_Indian_Mascot_Position_Statement.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031052230/http://aiansip.org/uploads/SIP_Indian_Mascot_Position_Statement.pdf| archive-date=October 31, 2015|title=Society of Indian Psychologists|date=January 27, 1999|accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sports mascots have been cited as an example of [[Microaggression theory|microaggressions]], the everyday insults that members of marginalized minority groups are subject to in the comments and actions of other groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Microaggressions and Marginality: Manifestation, Dynamics, and Impact| author=Derald Wing Sue| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| date=2010| page=384| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WZxpPnnjzkC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=sports+mascot+microaggression&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YeoTsr0Vy-&amp;sig=nl35tZtC0zkDMsBstdFa5ut4YiY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAmoVChMIrq2r2pqJxwIVAvMeCh2STAyE#v=onepage&amp;q=sports%20mascot%20microaggression&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative impact on the self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights. It also impacts non-natives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, preventing learning about Native American culture. The APA states that stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs, traditions and values of Native Americans.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/indian-mascots.aspx|title=Summary of the Resolution Recommending Retirement of American Indian Mascots|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar resolutions have been adopted by the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasss.org/nasss-native-american-imagery-resolution/| title=NASSS Native American Imagery Resolution| date=October 28, 2005| publisher=North American Society for the Sociology of Sport| accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Sociological Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/about/Council_Statements/use_of_native_american_nicknames_logos_and_mascots.cfm |title=Statement by the Council of the American Sociological Association on Discontinuing the Use of Native American Nicknames, Logos and Mascots in Sport |publisher=American Sociological Association |date=March 6, 2007 |accessdate=2013-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221184942/http://asanet.org/about/Council_Statements/use_of_native_american_nicknames_logos_and_mascots.cfm |archivedate=February 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Counseling Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counseling.org/docs/resolutions/resolutions-2001-present.pdf?sfvrsn=2 |publisher=American Counseling Association |title=Opposition to Use of Stereotypical Native American Images as Sports Symbols and Mascots |year=2001 |accessdate=2013-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915125336/http://counseling.org/docs/resolutions/resolutions-2001-present.pdf?sfvrsn=2 |archivedate=2013-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Anthropological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/rdcms-aaa/files/production/public/FileDownloads/pdfs/issues/press/upload/Sports-Mascot-Resolution-Release-Final.pdf |title=AAA Calls on Sports Organizations to Denounce Inappropriate American Indian Mascots |date=March 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204135245/http://s3.amazonaws.com/rdcms-aaa/files/production/public/FileDownloads/pdfs/issues/press/upload/Sports-Mascot-Resolution-Release-Final.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 report on the status of Native American students, the [[National Education Association]] included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as one of its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Report on the Status of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Education|first=|author=Trujillo, Octaviana (Ph.D.)|author2=Alston, Denise (Ph.D.)|year=2005|publisher=National Education Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] announced it would no longer consider teams with racist mascots, such as the Kansas City and Washington football teams, for its annual RWJF Sports Award, which recognizes organizations that contribute to public health through sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/05/07/kansas-city-chiefs-washington-redskins-racist-mascots-football-rwjf-sports-award-column/584858002/| title=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: We honored sports teams with racist mascots.

Social science research gives weight to the perceptions of those directly affected.

===Civil rights===

The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for the end of the use of Native American names, images, and mascots in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aistm.org/naacp_1999_resolution.htm |title=NAACP 1999 Resolution |accessdate=2013-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128103322/http://www.aistm.org/naacp_1999_resolution.htm |archivedate=2012-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] released an advisory opinion calling for an end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.&lt;ref name=USCCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/press/archives/2001/041601st.htm |title=Statement of the United States Commission on Civil Rights on the use of Native American images and nicknames as sports symbols |accessdate=2016-12-10|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report issued in 2012, a [[United Nations]] expert on Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples cited the continued use of Native American references by sports team as a part of the stereotyping that "obscures understanding of the reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep alive racially discriminatory attitudes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14497&amp;LangID=E |title=USA: 'Redskins' Team mascot hurtful reminder of past suffering of Native Americans – UN rights expert |publisher=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145318/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14497&amp;LangID=E |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Murray Sinclair, the head of Canada's [[Truth and reconciliation commission|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] said in 2015 "sports teams with offensive names, such as Redskins and cartoonish aboriginal-looking mascots have no place in a country trying to come to grips with racism in its past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Stop using offensive indigenous mascots in sports, Justice Murray Sinclair says| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/11/15/stop-using-offensive-indigenous-mascots-in-sports-justice-murray-sinclair-says.html| first=Chinta| last=Puxley| publisher=The Toronto Star| date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal remedies====
While all advocates for elimination of Native mascots agree that the practice is morally wrong, many do not find a basis for legal remedy. Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular [[African American]]s, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the "noble savage" honors Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name=MDCR&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Department of Civil Rights: Continued Use of American Indian Mascots Hurts Student Achievement |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0,4613,7-138--294605--,00.html |publisher=State of Michigan |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218160526/http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0%2C4613%2C7-138--294605--%2C00.html |archivedate=18 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130603/NEWS06/306030121/indian-mascot-ban-tossed-michigan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605075801/http://www.freep.com/article/20130603/NEWS06/306030121/indian-mascot-ban-tossed-michigan| archive-date=June 5, 2013|title=Feds toss Michigan complaint to ban Indian mascots for sports teams|date=June 3, 2013|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|first=Lori|last=Higgins|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal claim of discrimination rests upon a group agreeing that a particular term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage who say they are not offended. This raised the difficulty of [[Native American identity in the United States]], also an evolving controversy.&lt;ref name="Morris.2015"/&gt;

===Religious organizations===

In 1992, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] issued a resolution calling for the end of sports teams names that promote racism, in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Redskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/resolutions/1992/racism-1992/|title=Resolution Adopted by the CCAR: Racism|year=1992|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Association]] passed a resolution to establish relationships with groups working to end the use of Indian images and symbols for sports and media mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uua.org/statements/resolution-establish-formal-relationships-national-coalition-racism-sports-and-media| title=Resolution to Establish Formal Relationships with the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and Media| accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the [[United Methodist Church]] also passed a resolution condemning the use of Native American team names and sports mascots, which was highlighted in a meeting of the Black caucus of that organization in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5765541&amp;ct=3722449| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204042505/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5765541&amp;ct=3722449| archivedate=February 4, 2014|title=Black caucus joins Native American mascot fight|date=April 4, 2007|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umc-gbcs.org/faith-in-action/native-american-mascots-must-go |title=Native American mascots must go: Time to remove them is long passed |author=Rev.

A group of sixty-one religious leaders in Washington, D.C. sent a letter to NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] and Redskin's owner [[Daniel Snyder]] stating their moral obligation to join the "Change the Mascot" movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended.&lt;ref name="faith"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/local/letter-to-goodell-and-snyder/695/|title=Letter to Goodell and Snyder|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/faith-leaders-urge-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-and-nfl-to-change-teams-name/2013/12/05/e1dad2be-5dd3-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html|title=Faith leaders urge Redskins owner Dan Snyder and NFL to change team's name|first=Theresa|last=Vargas|date=December 5, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Indian Affairs Committee of the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the [[Quakers|Society of Friends]] approved a formal statement condemning the name of the Washington football team, stating that "the NFL has violated its core principles for decades by allowing the team playing in Washington, D.C., to carry the name 'redskins,' a racist epithet that insults millions of Native Americans.

Redskin's spokesman [[Tony Wyllie]] offered a response, saying, "We respect those who disagree with our team's name, but we wish the United Church of Christ would listen to the voice of the overwhelming majority of Americans, including Native Americans, who support our name and understand it honors the heritage and tradition of the Native American community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/churches-propose-a-boycott-of-redskins-unless-the-team-change-its-name/2014/03/01/488669bc-a189-11e3-b8d8-94577ff66b28_story.html|title=Churches propose a boycott of Redskins unless the team changes its name|first=Carol|last=Morello|date=March 1, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its annual meeting in June 2014, the membership of the UCC also passed a resolution supporting the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nativenewsonline.net/currents/united-church-christ-central-atlantic-conference-passes-resolution-calling-washington-nfl-team-name-change-calls-member-boycott/|title=UCC Central Atlantic Conference Passes Resolution Calling for Washington NFL Team Name Change &amp; Calls for Member Boycott|date=June 15, 2014|publisher=Native News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2014/06/14/church-of-christ-boycott-washington-redskins-name/10524269/|title=Church group latest to boycott Redskins over name|first=Erik|last=Brady|date=June 14, 2014|newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution and boycott was passed by the National Synod of the UCC in June, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.19actionnews.com/story/29433519/cleveland-church-calling-on-the-washington-redskins-to-change-its-name-logo| title=Cleveland church calls on Washington Redskins to change name, logo| date=June 29, 2015| first=Scott| last=Taylor| publisher=19 Action News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic became an issue on a national level in the twenty-first century, with a hearing before the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indian.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?hearingID=e655f9e2809e5476862f735da16ba74a| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212132533/http://www.indian.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?hearingID=e655f9e2809e5476862f735da16ba74a|archive-date=December 12, 2012| title=OVERSIGHT HEARING on Stolen Identities: The Impact of Racist Stereotypes on Indigenous People|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a symposium at the Smithsonian [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Institution"/&gt; In November, 2015 President Obama, speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, stated "Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans" and praised [[Adidas]] for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/259331-obama-teams-should-drop-native-american-mascots| date=November 5, 2015| title=Obama: Teams should drop Native American mascots| first=Jordan| last=Fabian| publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream opinion reflects the function of identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol5Iss2/FanDevelopment.htm| title=The Social Psychology of the Creation of a Sports Fan Identity: A Theoretical Review of the Literature| author=Beth Jacobson |publisher=Athletic Insight - The Online Journal of Sports Psychology| date=2003| accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Letter from Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to fans| date= October 9, 2013| publisher=The Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/letter-from-washington-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-to-fans/2013/10/09/e7670ba0-30fe-11e3-8627-c5d7de0a046b_story.html| accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When self-esteem becomes bound to the players and the team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-psychology-of-why-sports-fans-see-their-teams-as-extensions-of-themselves/2015/01/30/521e0464-a816-11e4-a06b-9df2002b86a0_story.html| title=The psychology of why sports fans see their teams as extensions of themselves| author=Eric Simons | date=January 30, 2015| publisher=The Washington Post| accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots clearly racist.&lt;ref name="Banks.1993"/&gt;

Some individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respectful, and to pay homage to Native American people. Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, then vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team, declared in the magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that his team's name "symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership", and that the "Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people".&lt;ref name="bar"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Emert| first=Phyllis Raybin| year=2003| url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| title=Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?| journal=Respect (newsletter)| publisher=New Jersey State Bar Foundation| volume=2| issue=2 (Winter 2003)| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103052217/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| archivedate=2011-01-03| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. [[Richard Lapchick]], director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: "Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in [[Blackface|black face]] at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with [[Body painting|war paint]] on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lapchick/050825&amp;num=0|title=Mascots are a matter of respect|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. [[Chief Illiniwek]], the former athletic symbol for the [[University of Illinois]], became the subject of protest in 1988.&lt;ref name="Spindel"/&gt; In 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: "His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty. The Chief keeps the memory of the people of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands of Illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them. However, the tribal costume was not of the [[Illinois Confederation]], but that of the [[Lakota people|Lakota tribe]]. The [[Peoria (tribe)|Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma]] is the closest living descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy. In response to requests by former Chief Illiniwek portrayer's to bring back occasional performances, Peoria Chief John P. Froman reaffirmed the tribe's position that Chief (Illiniwek) "was not in any way representative of Peoria culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2013-05-07/updated-peoria-tribe-leader-doesnt-back-chief-return.html| title=Peoria tribe leader doesn't back Chief return| date=May 7, 2013| author=Christine Des Garennes| publisher=News-Gazette| accessdate=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative columnists often assert that outrage over mascots is manufactured by white liberals, rather than being the authentic voice of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/redskins-manufactured-controversy-9395|title=Redskins: A Manufactured Controversy|author=W.

====Other team names and ethnic groups====
Many argue there is a double standard in Native Americans being so frequently used as a sports team name or mascot when the same usage would be unthinkable for other racial or ethnic group. One current exception is the [[Coachella Valley High School]] "Arabs"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/07/arab-team-mascot-ethnic-slur/3461059/|title=California high school's Arab mascot draws ire|date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has also been the subject of controversy, resulting in the retirement of its more cartoonish representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/education/2014/09/09/mighty-arab-coachella-valley-high/15368751/|title='Mighty Arab' takes its place at Coachella Valley High|first=Brett|last=Kelman|newspaper=The Desert Sun|date=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents also see this argument as a false equivalency, because it ignores systemic inequality, and serves to discount the Native American voice by saying that if one group isn't hurt by a particular portrayal, then no group has the right to be hurt, regardless of vastly different backgrounds, treatment, and social positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2008/10/05/notre-dames-fighting-irish-mascot|title=Sociological Images| author=Gwen Sharp, PhD| date=October 5, 2008| publisher=The Society Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Financial impact of change====
Many supporters of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots would far outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate millions of dollars in sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless.&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt; The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120518/NEWS/205180322|title=State bans Native American mascots|date=May 18, 2012|first=Sanne|last=Specht|newspaper=Mail Tribune|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. [[Clyde Bellecourt]], when director of the [[American Indian Movement]] stated: "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawks]], the chicken [[War bonnet|feather headdresses]], people wearing [[Body painting|war paint]] and making these ridiculous [[Battle cry|war whoops]] with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially on our youth, is devastating."&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt;

A study done by the [[Emory University]] [[Goizueta Business School]] indicates that the growing unpopularity of Native American mascots is a financial drain for professional teams, losing money compared to more popular animal mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.emory.edu/sportsmarketing/2013/12/19/the-financial-impact-of-mascots-on-sports-brands/?_ga=1.256951951.500422532.1397069844b|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020044121/https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/esma/2013/12/19/the-financial-impact-of-mascots-on-sports-brands/?_ga=1.256951951.500422532.1397069844b| archivedate=October 20, 2014| title=The Financial Impact of Mascots on Sports Brands|publisher=Emory University|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public opinion surveys====
{{see also|Washington Redskins name opinion polls}}
A survey conducted in 2002 by [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|The Harris Poll]] for [[Sports Illustrated]] (SI) found that 81 percent of Native Americans who live outside traditional Indian reservations and 53 percent of Indians on reservations did not find the images discriminatory. The authors of the article concluded that "Although most Native American activists and tribal leaders consider Indian team names and mascots offensive, neither Native Americans in general nor a cross section of U.S. sports fans agree". According to the article, "There is a near total disconnect between Indian activists and the Native American population on this issue." An Indian activist commented on the results saying "that Native Americans' self-esteem has fallen so low that they don't even know when they're being insulted".&lt;ref name=PriceWoo&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.si.com/vault/2002/03/04/8100154/the-indian-wars-the-campaign-against-indian-nicknames-and-mascots-presumes-that-they-offend-native-americansbut-do-they-we-took-a-poll-and-you-wont-believe-the-results| author = S.L. Price| title = The Indian Wars| work = Sports Illustrated| date = March 4, 2002| pages=66–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the SI article, a group of five social scientists experienced in researching the mascot issue published a journal article arguing against the validity of this survey and its conclusions. First they state that "The confidence with which the magazine asserts that a 'disconnect' between Native American activists and Native Americans exists on this issue belies the serious errors in logic and accuracy made in the simplistic labeling of Native Americans who oppose mascots as 'activists.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jss.sagepub.com/content/26/4/381|title=Of Polls and Race Predudice|doi=10.1177/0193732502238255|journal=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=November 2002|volume=26|issue=4|page=381|author1=C.

More recent surveys, rather than addressing the larger issue, have targeted the controversy over the name of the Washington Redskins, asking if the word is offensive or if it should be changed. By a large majority (71–89 percent), public opinion has maintained that the name should not change. However, more than half (53–59 percent) agree that "redskin" is not an appropriate term for Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=b41b9bde-1b19-40f7-af86-0b585eb8df03| title=Results of SurveyUSA News Poll #20802| date=October 15, 2013| accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/06/25/National-Politics/Polling/release_246.xml?44|title=Should the Washington Redskins change their name?|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wusa9.com/longform/sports/nfl/2014/09/25/nfl-washington-redskins-name-survey-dc-maryland-virginia-response/16098841/|title=DC Speaks: Keep Redskins name|author=Greg Cohen|publisher=WUSA|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey most frequently cited by opponents of change as definitive of Native American opinion was performed in 2004 as part of the [[National Annenberg Election Survey]]. Among other questions regarding election year issues, respondents who identified themselves as being Native American were asked: "The professional football team in Washington calls itself the Washington Redskins. As a Native American, do you find that name offensive or doesn't it bother you?" In response, ninety percent replied that the name did not bother them, while nine percent said that it was offensive, and one percent would not answer.&lt;ref name="Annenberg.20140927"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kathleen Hall Jamieson Ph.D. |title=Most Indians Say Name of Washington "Redskins" Is Acceptable While 9 Percent Call It Offensive |url=http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/most-indians-say-name-of-washington-redskins-is-acceptable-while-9-percent-call-it-offensive/ |website=The Annenberg Public Policy Center |accessdate=September 27, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014154005/http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/most-indians-say-name-of-washington-redskins-is-acceptable-while-9-percent-call-it-offensive/ |archivedate=October 14, 2013 |deadurl=no |date=September 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The methods used in this survey and the conclusions that can be drawn from it have been criticized by social scientists,&lt;ref name="too"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Charles Springwood|title='I'm Indian Too!': Claiming Native American Identity, Crafting Authority in Mascot Debates|publisher=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=February 2004|volume=28|page=56|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0193732503261477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American scholars&lt;ref name="ClarkD.2005"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Indigenous Voice and Vision as Commodity in a Mass-Consumption Society: The Colonial Politics of Public Opinion Polling|author=D.

In May 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' essentially replicated the Annenberg poll, getting the same results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/new-poll-finds-9-in-10-native-americans-arent-offended-by-redskins-name/2016/05/18/3ea11cfa-161a-11e6-924d-838753295f9a_story.html | title=New poll finds 9 in 10 Native Americans aren’t offended by Redskins name | work=Washington Post | date=19 May 2016 | accessdate=19 May 2016 | author=Cox, John Woodrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/how-the-washington-post-conducted-the-survey-on-the-redskins-name/2016/05/19/98c0a4ae-1b8c-11e6-9c81-4be1c14fb8c8_story.html| title=How The Washington Post conducted the survey on the Redskins’ name| author1=Scott Clement| author2=Emily Guskin| date=May 19, 2016| publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/washington-post-poll-of-native-americans-on-redskins-team-name/2032/| title=Washington Post poll of Native Americans on Redskins' team name - Survey conducted December 16, 2015 to April 12, 2016| accessdate=May 24, 2016| publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attempting to address some of the flaws in the earlier poll it received many of the same criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nativeappropriations.com/2016/05/wapos-new-redskns-survey.html| title=WaPo’s new Redsk*ns survey: Faulty data and missing the point| author=Dr. Adrienne Keene, EdD| date=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncai.org/news/articles/2016/05/19/ncai-response-to-new-poll-on-r-skins-team-name| title=NCAI Response to New Poll on R*skins Team Name | date=May 19, 2016| accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.naja.com/news/m.blog/509/naja-and-unity-respond-to-recent-washington-nfl-team-name-poll| title=NAJA and UNITY respond to recent Washington NFL team name poll| date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A flaw unique to polls of Native Americans is they rely upon self-identification to select the target population. In an editorial in the [[The Herald-Times|Bloomington Herald Times]], Steve Russell (an enrolled [[Cherokee]] citizen and associate professor of criminal justice at [[Indiana University]]), states that both SI and Annenberg's samples of "self-identified Native Americans&amp;nbsp;... includes plenty of people who have nothing to do with Indians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~mstd/e320/amerind/flap.html|title=Some collected materials about the NCAA's decision to ban Indian sports mascots from the Indianapolis area|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals claiming to be Native American when they are not is well known in academic research, and people claiming Indian identity specifically to gain authority in the debate over sports mascots has been criticised.&lt;ref name="too" /&gt;

At the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at [[California State University]], San Bernardino a survey has conducted of 400 individuals whose identity as Native American was verified, finding that 67% agreed with the statement that "Redskins" is offensive and racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lindseyadler/native-americans-offended-by-racial-slur|title=New Study Finds 67% Of Native Americans Find Redskins Name Offensive|publisher=Buzzfeed.com|date=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cips.csusb.edu/docs/PressRelease.pdf|title=Survey on Redskins team name found most American Indians believe it to be offensive and racist.|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
&lt;!--As in the lead section, this is a summary of the sections that follow, and thus does not include references for each statement.--&gt;

While protests began in the 1970s, national attention to the issue did not occur until widespread television coverage of college and professional games brought the behaviour of some fans to the attention of Native Americans. The appearance of the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1991 World Series]] and the [[Washington Redskins]] at the 1992 [[Super Bowl XXVI|Super Bowl]] prompted the largest response because the games were played in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], which has a large Native American population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://miamioh.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/native-mascots/index.html| title=Native Mascots Become a National Controversy | publisher=Miami University of Ohio| accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents most often cited to justifying the elimination of Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] in 2001 and a resolution by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=APA/&gt;&lt;ref name=USCCR/&gt; Neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness, but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination. However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor=C. Richard King|title=The Native American Mascot Controversy: A Handbook|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Maryland|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8108-6731-4|page=1| chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual school districts have responded to complaints by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 when one of the teams in the [[National College Prospects Hockey League]] (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/07/28/social-media-blasts-lake-erie-warriors-over-racist-logo-165302| title=Social Media Blasts Lake Erie Warriors Over Racist Logo| first=Vincent| last=Schilling| date=July 28, 2016| publisher=Indian Country Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uni-watch.com/2016/07/30/lake-erie-warriors-renamed-lake-erie-eagles-probably/ |title=Lake Erie Warriors Renamed Lake Erie Eagles (probably)| first=Paul| last=Lukas| date=July 30, 2016| publisher=Uni-Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal and administrative action===
{{main|Native American mascot laws and regulations}}
Statewide laws or school board decisions regarding team names and mascots have passed in states with significant Native American populations; including California (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB30| title=AB-30 School or athletic team names: California Racial Mascots Act. | accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coloradopolitics.com/995638-american-indian-mascot-bill-dies-committee/

In the original law, a single individual could file a complaint with the burden of proof on the school to defend their mascot, in the new law a petition signed by 10% of the school district residents is needed, and the petitioners need to prove discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wislawjournal.com/2013/11/17/opponents-urge-walker-to-veto-mascots-bill/|title=Opponents urge Walker to veto mascots bill|date=November 17, 2013|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Wisconsin Law Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdcgamingreports.com/menominee-leader-criticizes-wis-school-mascot-law/|title=Menominee leader criticizes Wis. school mascot law|first=TODD|last=RICHMOND|publisher=Associated Press|date=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wrn.com/2015/03/sokoagan-chair-changes-to-mascot-law-a-mockery-of-indigenous-people/| title=Sokaogon chair: changes to mascot law 'a mockery of indigenous people'| date=March 5, 2015| first=Bob| last=Hague| publisher=Wisconsin Radio Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary schools and youth leagues===
[[Secondary schools]] in both the United States and Canada have had histories similar to colleges, some changing voluntarily while others maintain their current mascots.

An analysis of a database in 2013 indicates that there are currently more than 2,000 high schools with mascots that reference Native American culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munguia|first1=Hayley|title=The 2,128 Native American Mascots People Aren't Talking About|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2128-native-american-mascots-people-arent-talking-about/|website=fivethirtyeight.com|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to around 3,000 fifty years ago.&lt;ref name="NCAI"/&gt; While 28 high schools dropped the name "Redskins" in the 25 years between 1988 and mid-2013, 14 schools changed the name in the years since.

====Canada====
The Department of Educational Foundations at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] passed a resolution calling for the retirement of all school mascots and logos that depict [[First Nations]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/staff-at-saskatchewan-university-calls-for-end-of-first-nations-logos-mascots-1.1546812|title=Staff at Saskatchewan university calls for end of First Nations logos, mascots|publisher=CTVNews.ca|date=November 16, 2013|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to moving to changing their own mascots, school boards in Ontario are also considering a ban on students wearing any articles bearing offensive names or logos, be they professional or local teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2016/02/24/school-boards-onside-with-move-to-ban-racist-logos.html| title=School boards onside with move to ban 'racist logos'| first=Kristin| last=Rushowy| date=February 24, 2016| publisher=The Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Champeau, an [[Ojibway]] man in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, filed a human rights complaint against the Nepean Redskins Football Club on behalf of his five-year-old daughter in an effort to get the team to change its name. "How are they going to differentiate the playing field from the school yard? What's going to stop them from calling my daughter a redskin in the school yard? That's as offensive as using the [[Nigger#The N-word euphemism|n-word]]." [[Assembly of First Nations]] National Chief [[Shawn Atleo]] said he supports the move because the word ''Redskin'' is "offensive and hurtful and completely inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/09/04/redskins-human-rights-complaint-a-tribe-called-red_n_3866220.html|title=Nepean Redskins Human Rights Complaint: A Tribe Called Red Member Takes Football To Tribunal| publisher=HuffPost Canada Music| first=Jason| last=MacNeil| date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was changed to the "Nepean Eagles", chosen from 70 suggestions submitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/sports/archives/2014/01/20140114-112929.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213035125/http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/sports/archives/2014/01/20140114-112929.html| archivedate=February 13, 2015||title=Nepean Redskins says changing its 'controversial' name to cost about $100Gs|date=January 14, 2014|publisher=Sun News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niigaan Sinclair ([[Anishinaabe]]), a writer and assistant professor at the [[University of Manitoba]], applauded the decision and contrasted it to the decision of [[Daniel Snyder]], the Washington team owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/no-honour-in-native-names-238687531.html|title=No 'honour' in native names|first=Niigaan|last=Sinclair|date=January 4, 2014|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee]] sent a letter to two northern Idaho school districts with American Indian mascots asking that they be changed. The mascots are the Sacajawea Junior High Braves in [[Lewiston School District|Lewiston]] and the [[Nezperce, Idaho|Nezperce]] High School Indians. The school officials state that they will have meetings and gather public opinions before making a decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/57451183-68/board-district-lewiston-mascot.html.csp|title= At request of American Indians, Idaho schools eye mascot name change|author=The Associated Press|date=January 26, 2014|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the media coverage of the Washington Redskins, high schools with the name Redskins have received particular attention, including three which have a majority of Native American students. Advocates for the name conclude that because some Native Americans use the name to refer to themselves, it is not insulting.&lt;ref name=Spoken&gt;{{cite web|first=Rick |last=Reilly |title=Have the people spoken? |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds/ |website=ESPN |accessdate=October 15, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919035546/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds |archivedate=September 19, 2013 |deadurl=no |date=September 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the principal of one of these, [[Red Mesa High School]] in [[Teec Nos Pos, Arizona]], said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created."&lt;ref name="Michelle Peirano"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cronkitenewsonline.com/2013/05/in-debate-over-redskins-name-is-the-r-word-for-racism-or-respect/|title=In debate over Redskins name, is the 'R-word' for racism or respect?|date=May 1, 2013|first=Michelle|last=Peirano|newspaper=Cronkite News|accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships with tribes to retain Native names have been established at the high school level. [[Arapahoe High School (Centennial, Colorado)]] now uses a logo provided by the [[Arapaho]] Tribe of Wyoming, which initially included an agreement that the image would not be placed on the gym floor or any article of clothing. The latter provision has not always been observed, but the logo does not appear on the team uniforms. The agreement also includes tribal participation in school events. A similar agreement has been worked out between the Northern Arapahoe Tribe and the Strasburg High School " Indians" in [[Strasburg, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/05/14/indian-mascot-at-hs-gets-blessing-from-tribe-and-without-cultural-controversy-im-honored| title= Indian mascot at HS gets blessing from tribe — and without cultural controversy: ‘I’m honored’ | date=May 14, 2018| author=Dave Urbanski| publisher=KCNC-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was discussion about the "Indians" name at El Reno High School, [[El Reno, Oklahoma]] when a Native American student was not allowed to wear a beaded [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] at graduation. The result was the signing of a Spirit Charter with the Cheyenne &amp; Arapaho Tribes to retain the name while agreeing to avoid any derogatory or disrespectful Native American references, including the wearing of Native American regalia by non-natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elrenops.org/| title=El Reno Public Schools| accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.koco.com/article/native-american-tribes-give-blessing-for-el-reno-high-schools-mascot/8777394| title=Native American tribes give blessing for El Reno High School’s mascot| date=February 13, 2017| author=Patrina Adger| publisher=KOCO-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local controversy may continue after a name change. [[Park High School (Cottage Grove, Minnesota)|Park High School]], in [[Cottage Grove, Minnesota]] changed from the Indians to the Wolfpack in 1994. 
An "Indian Head" mosaic in the main hallway created in 1965 has become the subject of current contention between Native Americans and their supporters who want it removed, and others in the community who consider it a work of art and part of the school's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.swcbulletin.com/news/education/4404789-fate-park-indian-head-mosaic-divides-community#.Wog-F2xsvzQ.facebook| title=Fate of Park Indian head mosaic divides community| author=William Loeffler| date=February 16, 2018| accessdate=February 16, 2018| newspaper=South Washington County Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colleges and universities===
[[File:Ticket Washington vs Stanford 1930 side1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1930 football ticket stub depicting the former Stanford Indian mascot]]
Some college teams voluntarily changed their names and mascots. [[Stanford University]] had "The Stanford Indian" as its mascot from 1930 to 1972. Today Stanford's athletic team identity is built around the "[[Stanford Cardinal]]", reflecting the primary [[school colors|school color]] that has been used from the earliest days, while the unofficial mascot shown on its primary logo is the [[Stanford Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Color: Stanford Identity Toolkit|url=http://identity.stanford.edu/color.html|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early change was the "[[Saltine Warrior#Mascot|Saltine Warrior]]" that represented [[Syracuse University]] from 1931 until 1978. After a brief attempt to use a Roman warrior, the mascot became [[Otto the Orange]] for the school color. [[Miami University]] began discussion regarding the propriety of the Redskins name and images in 1972, and changed its team nickname to [[Miami RedHawks|RedHawks]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.muohio.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/index.html|title=Mascot Story|accessdate=February 5, 2013|publisher=Miami University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the team name of [[Eastern Michigan University]] changed from the [[Hurons]] to the Eagles in 1991, the change remained controversial as some students and alumni sought to restore it. In 2012, the university president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside a flap of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated intent of recognizing the past. However, the return of the Hurons logo has prompted protests from Native Americans at the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/eastern-michigan-university-hurons-logo/28797179/| title=Native Americans rally against Hurons logo at EMU| first=Kim| last=Kozlowski| newspaper=The Detroit News| date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/huron-logo-emu/28828217/| title=Community wants logo off EMU band uniforms| first=David| last=Jesse| newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marquette University]] changed their team name from the Warriors to the Golden Eagles in 1994. The school's president stated: "We live in a different era than when the Warriors nickname was selected in 1954. The perspective of time has shown us that our actions, intended or not, can offend others. We must not knowingly act in a way that others will believe, based on their experience, to be an attack on their dignity as fellow human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomarquette.com/genrel/051105aaa.html|title=Trustees announce new nickname selection process|date=May 11, 2005|publisher=Marquette University|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1994, [[St. John's University (New York)]] changed the name of its athletic teams from the Redmen to the Red Storm after the university was pressured by American Indian groups who considered the term "Redmen" a slur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/09/nyregion/use-of-indians-as-mascots-to-be-subject-of-an-inquiry.html|title=Use of Indians As Mascots To Be Subject Of an Inquiry|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 9, 1998|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2002, The Strategic Planning Committee of [[Stonehill College]] determined that the then-current mascot, the chieftain, was disrespectful to American Indians and decided that it would be changed. After discussion, the mascot was changed to the Skyhawk in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonehillskyhawks.com/Why_A_Skyhawk|title=Why a Skyhawk?|accessdate=October 20, 2014|publisher=Stonehill College}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jim Seavey, associate director of athletics, stated: "Twelve years ago, the college discarded the logo that depicted the Indian with the headdress and feathers and stuff. We really did not have anything to represent our identity that we were comfortable with. We felt&amp;nbsp;... that it wasn't appropriate to have a physical representation of a Native American as our mascot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/02/27/digging_for_new_name_sends_stonehill_to_web/|title=Digging for new name sends Stonehill to Web|first=Emily|last=Sweeney|date=February 27, 2005|newspaper=The Boston Globe|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, teams that are not directly affected by this controversy have issued their opinions. The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lssaa.wisc.edu/aisas/policy07.html |title=University Of Wisconsin Athletic Department Policy On Native American Logos And Names |accessdate=February 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221010322/http://www.lssaa.wisc.edu/aisas/policy07.html |archivedate=February 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Iowa]] have both refused to schedule non-conference games against schools with Native American mascots. The University of Iowa's own nickname, "Hawkeyes", has Native American origins (Iowa is the "[[Hawkeye State]]"), although the team uses a [[hawk]] as its symbol rather than an Indian.

Although [[Dartmouth College]] had not used an Indian mascot for many years, [[Yale University]] printed a program for the 2016 game commemorating its 100th game against Dartmouth showing historical program covers featuring depictions of Native Americans that are now viewed as racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/10/10/football-programs-criticized-for-racist-imagery/| title=Football programs criticized for racist imagery| first=Manasa| last=Rao| date=October 10, 2016| publisher=Yale Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Florida State Seminoles]] of [[Florida State University]] use names and images associated with the [[Seminole]] people but this use is officially sanctioned by the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wieberg|first=Steve|title=NCAA allowing Florida State to use its Seminole mascot|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2005-08-23-fsu-mascot-approved_x.htm|publisher=USAToday|accessdate=November 21, 2011|date=August 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Collegiate Athletic Association====
{{main|NCAA Native American mascot decision}}
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) distributed a "self evaluation" to 31 colleges in 2005, for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice. Subsequently, 19 teams were cited as having potentially "hostile or abusive" names, mascots, or images, that would be banned from displaying them during post-season play, and prohibited from hosting tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ncaa.org/static/champion/where-pride-meets-prejudice/index.php| title=Where Pride Meets Prejudice| first=Amy| last=Schwarb| publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association| accessdate=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the colleges previously using Native American imagery changed except for those granted waivers when they obtained official support from individual tribes based upon the principle of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="NCAI"/&gt;

[[San Diego State University]] (SDSU) was not cited by the NCAA in 2005 due to a decision that the Aztecs were not a Native American tribe with any living descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20050806/news_1s6mascots.html| title=NCAA puts limited ban on Indian mascots: Postseason policy doesn't hit Aztecs| first=Brent| last=Schrotenboer| date=August 6, 2005| publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2017 the SDSU Native American Student Alliance (NASA) supported removal of the mascot, calling its continued use "institutional racism" in its official statement to the Committee on Diversity, Equity and Outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailyaztec.com/81677/news/native-american-student-alliance-proposes-removal-of-aztec-mascot/| title=Native American Student Alliance proposes removal of Aztec mascot| author=Allyson Myers| date=February 27, 2017| publisher=The Daily Aztec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwEYVqMcYGJOOF8xb0FxVFFwR0NqQldPN1BzbVR0aTRyZ1Fz/view| title=NASA 2016-2017 Mascot Statement| accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that resolution was rejected by the SDSU Associated Students, the University Senate, which represents the administration, faculty, staff and students, has voted to phase out the human depiction of the Aztec Warrior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesofsandiego.com/sports/2017/11/08/no-more-aztec-warrior-sdsu-university-senate-votes-to-retire-mascot/| title=No More Aztec Warrior?

===Professional teams===
{{see also|List_of_sports_team_names_and_mascots_derived_from_indigenous_peoples#Prior_pro_usage|label 1=List of prior names and mascots}}
Few professional teams using Native names and imagery remain, several changing when they moved to other cities, while others went out of business. The [[Atlanta Hawks]] were originally the [[Quad Cities|Tri-Cities]] Blackhawks (using an "Indian" logo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/tri/tricities.html |title=Tri-Cities Blackhawks (1946–1951) |accessdate=November 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120054903/http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/tri/tricities.html |archivedate=January 20, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]] were originally the [[Buffalo Braves]].

The [[United States national rugby league team]] was known as the Tomahawks until 2015, when [[USA Rugby League]] replaced the [[American National Rugby League]] as the sport's governing body in the U.S. and chose the simpler Hawks as the new name for the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.usarl.com/2015/05/hawks-swoop-in-for-new-usa-national-team-name/| title=Hawks swoop in for new USA National Team Name| accessdate=December 9, 2016| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529173837/http://www.usarl.com/2015/05/hawks-swoop-in-for-new-usa-national-team-name/| archivedate=May 29, 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atlanta Braves====
The [[Atlanta Braves]] remain the home of the [[tomahawk chop]] (although it began at [[Florida State University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/atl/video/v21042257/this-is-why-we-chop-the-history-of-the-tomahawk-chop|title=The history of the tomahawk chop| accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo has changed through the years from an Indian in full headdress to an Indian with a [[Mohawk hairstyle]] and single feather (described as either laughing or shouting), then to the Braves name in script over a tomahawk. The mascot [[Chief Noc-A-Homa]] was replaced in 1986 by a baseball-headed "Homer the Brave",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://lastwordonbaseball.com/2017/01/19/homer-braves-alternative-mascot/| title=Homer is a Fraud: A Look at Braves Alternative Mascot Ideas

====Chicago Blackhawks====
{{main|Chicago Blackhawks name and logo controversy}}
Native American rights advocate [[Suzan Shown Harjo]] ([[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes|Cheyenne]] and Hodulgee [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Muscogee]]) says the Blackhawks have escaped the scrutiny given to other teams using Native imagery because [[Ice hockey|hockey]] is not a cultural force on the level of [[American football|football]]. But she says national American Indian organizations have called for an end to all Indian-related mascots and that she found the hockey team's name and Indian head symbol to be offensive. "It lacks dignity," she said. "There's dignity in a school being named after a person or a people. There's dignity in a health clinic or hospital. There's nothing dignified in something being so named (that is used for) recreation or entertainment or fun." The National Congress of American Indians also opposes the Blackhawks' logo, as it does all Native American mascots.&lt;ref name=Keilman.2013&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-19/news/ct-met-indian-mascots-20130619_1_american-indians-black-hawk-mascots| title=Protests rare over Blackhawks' name, logo: While critics say use of Indian mascots perpetuates outdated image, hockey club says it has mutually beneficial ties with local community| date=June 19, 2013| first=John| last=Keilman| newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Cleveland Indians name and logo controversy}}
[[File:Vizquel96.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Former Cleveland Indians player [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] [[Omar Vizquel]] wearing a baseball cap showing the image of the Cleveland Indians mascot, [[Chief Wahoo]]]]
Native Americans used the occasion of the 175th anniversary of the founding of Cleveland in 1971 to protest the history of native mistreatment by non-natives, from massacres to Chief Wahoo.&lt;ref name=oakley.1971&gt;{{cite news|last=Oakley|first=Don|title=Dilemmas Dog Indians|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2rhQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ltAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5731,2180138&amp;dq=chief+wahoo+protest&amp;hl=en|accessdate=June 7, 2013|newspaper=The Portsmouth Times|date=August 21, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests have continued on Opening Day of the baseball season each year since 1973.&lt;ref name=cnn.2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Siek|first=Stephanie|title=New baseball season brings fresh protests against Cleveland Indians mascot|url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/06/new-baseball-season-brings-fresh-protests-against-cleveland-indians-mascot/|accessdate=June 8, 2013|publisher=CNN|date=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Wahoo is part of an exhibit at the [[Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia]] maintained by [[Ferris State University]] in Michigan. For Dr. David Pilgrim, a sociology professor at Ferris State and an expert in racial imagery, the symbol is a "red Sambo" that hardly differs from the caricatures of blacks popular in the Jim Crow era in which Wahoo was created, when such depictions of minority races were popularly used to inflame prejudice and justify discriminatory laws and behavior. Pilgrim explains how the exaggerated features serve their discriminatory purpose by emphasizing the differences of the depicted race, thereby reinforcing the idea that the caricaturized race is inferior.

The team's Vice President of Public Relations has defended the use of Chief Wahoo, saying that fans only associate Wahoo with baseball.&lt;ref name=Pattakos.2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Pattakos|first=Peter|title=The Curse of Chief Wahoo: Are we paying the price for embracing America's last acceptable racist symbol?|url=http://www.clevescene.com/gyrobase/the-curse-of-chief-wahoo/Content?oid=2954423&amp;showFullText=true|accessdate=May 17, 2013|newspaper=The Cleveland Scene|date=April 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120062629/http://www.clevescene.com/gyrobase/the-curse-of-chief-wahoo/Content?oid=2954423&amp;showFullText=true|archivedate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the team in the 2016 season led to renewed attention,&lt;ref name="Jerry Howarth"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Peter|title=Jerry Howarth refuses to say Cleveland team name|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/baseball/2016/10/11/jerry-howarth-refuses-to-say-cleveland-team-name.html|website=Toronto Star|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/architect-douglas-cardinal-files-human-rights-complaint-against-use-of-cleveland-s-name-logo-1.3806662| title=Architect Douglas Cardinal files human rights complaint against use of Cleveland's name, logo: Major League Baseball 'does not give baseball teams license for such wanton discrimination,' lawyer says| publisher=CBC News| date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/mlb/activist-in-court-today-to-bar-cleveland-indians-from-using-name-and-chief-wahoo-logo-in-ontario| title=Cleveland Indians can use name and 'Chief Wahoo' logo during ALCS games in Toronto, judge rules| first=Joseph| last=Brean| date=October 17, 2016| publisher=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/cleveland-indians-native-americans-rally-logo-161025193242211.html| title=Cleveland Indians: Native Americans rally against logo| date=October 25, 2016| publisher= Aljaxeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; with pressure from current MLB Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]] that there should be progress towards elimination of the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/sports/commissioner-starts-to-press-cleveland-indians-about-logo.html| title=Commissioner Starts to Press Cleveland Indians About Logo| author=David Waldstein | date=April 12, 2017| newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Edmonton Eskimos#Origins of the name}}
In part because they do not use any native imagery, the Eskimos are rarely mentioned with regard to the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/washington-redskins-fight-could-put-pressure-on-edmonton-eskimos-1.2680161|title=Washington Redskins fight could put pressure on Edmonton Inuit|first=Matt|last=Kwong|publisher=CBC|date=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Natan Obed]], the President of [[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami]], Canada's national Inuit organization, has stated that "''Eskimo'' is not only outdated, it is now largely considered a derogatory term" and is a "relic of colonial power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/attention-edmonton-eskimos-inuit-are-not-mascots/article27512855/|title=Attention Edmonton Eskimos: Inuit are not mascots| first=Natan| last=Obed| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial board of the Toronto Star sees a name change as the inevitable result of social evolution, and reflecting respect for indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2017/11/26/edmontons-eskimos-should-get-with-the-times-and-change-their-name.html| title=Edmonton’s Eskimos should get with the times and change their name| author=Star Editorial Board| newspaper=Toronto Star| date=November 26, 2017| accessdate=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kansas City Chiefs====

In 1963 the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] adopted a name referring to Native Americans, when the Dallas Texans (AFL) relocated. The team was named in honor of Kansas City mayor [[Harold Roe Bartle]] who was instrumental in bringing the Texans to [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Bartel earned his nickname as founder of a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] honor camping society, [[Tribe of Mic-O-Say]], in which he was "Chief" Lone Bear. In 1989 the Chiefs switched from [[Warpaint (mascot)|Warpaint]], a [[Pinto horse]] ridden by a man in a feathered headdress, to their current mascot [[K. C. Wolf]]. Warpaint returned in 2009, but is ridden by a [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/cheerleaders/warpaint.html|title=Warpaint|publisher=Kansas City Chiefs|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the appearance of photographs of fans attending an October 2013 game wearing feathers and warpaint—and doing the tomahawk chop—in the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'', numerous Native Americans submitted complaints to the publication. One caller, who was especially upset that the photographs were published on [[Columbus Day]], described the images as a "mockery" and "racist". Writing for the ''Star'''s "Public Editor" column, Derek Donovan explained that he found the complaints "reasonable" and suggested that the newspaper depict "other colorful, interesting people in the crowds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/10/27/4577055/fans-indian-dress-is-problematic.html|title=Chiefs fans' 'Indian' dress is problematic|date=October 27, 2013|first=DEREK|last=DONOVAN|newspaper=The Kansas City Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to a reporter's question in 2013, team owner [[Daniel Snyder]] said: "We'll never change the name.&amp;nbsp;... It's that simple.

On June 18, 2014, the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] voted to cancel the team's trademarks in a two to one decision that held that the term "redskins" is disparaging to a "substantial composite of Native Americans."&lt;ref name=BelsonK.20140618&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nyti.ms/1l2Wela|title=U.S. Patent Office Cancels Redskins Trademark Registration|author1=Ken Belson|author2=Edward Wyatt|date=June 18, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GormanD.20140801&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/UNITEDSTATESInaSplitDecisiontheTTABAffirmsCancellationofREDSKINSTrademarks.aspx| title=UNITED STATES: In a Split Decision, the TTAB Affirms Cancellation of REDSKINS Trademarks| work=INTA Journal| publisher=International Trademark Association| author=Danielle Gorman| date=August 1, 2014| volume=69| issue=14| accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 19, 2017 in a separate case ([[Matal v.

In response to the possibility that the team could return to the District of Columbia in a new stadium, a coalition of nine civil rights organizations issued a statement in August, 2018 that such a move should not be made "unless the team agrees to drop the “R-word” racial slur as its mascot."&lt;ref name="NAACP.2018"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.naacp.org/latest/leading-national-civil-rights-racial-justice-organizations-announce-joint-opposition-washington-nfl-team-locating-new-stadium-district-columbia/| title=Leading National Civil Rights and Racial Justice Organizations Announce Joint Opposition to Washington NFL Team Locating New Stadium in District of Columbia| date=August 24, 2018| website=NAACP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==

===Stereotyping by rival fans===
In addition to the behavior of the teams that have Native American names or mascots, their rivals often invoke racist stereotypes.

In December 2013 when the Washington Redskins played the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] an employee of a [[Sonic Drive-In]] in Missouri placed a message outside that used [[scalping]], [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and [[Whisky|whiskey]] to disparage the "Redskins". It was quickly removed with the owner's apologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2520773/Sonic-Drive-restaurant-upsets-racist-sign-scalp-Washington-Redskins.html|title=Fast food restaurant upsets customers with racist sign promising that the Kansas City Chiefs would 'scalp' the Washington Redskins|publisher=Daily Mail|first=Sara|last=Malm|date=9 December 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rubber severed "Indian" head impaled on a knife has been used by a sports fan in [[Philadelphia]] to taunt rival teams with Native American mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nativeappropriations.com/2010/06/thanks-for-the-severed-head-youve-proved-my-point.html|title=Thanks for the severed head. You proved my point|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of incidents of rival high school teams displaying banners or signs referencing the ''[[Trail of Tears]]'', which have been criticized for both insensitivity and ignorance of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/Blog/2013/11/19/McAdory-High-School-in-Alabama-apologizes-for-Trail-of-Tears-sign/5471384871891/|title=McAdory High School in Alabama apologizes for 'Trail of Tears' sign|first=Evan|last=Bleier|date=November 19, 2013|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/11/heres-another-high-school-football-team-promoting-trail-tears|title=Here's Another High School Football Team Promoting the "Trail of Tears"|first=Tim|last=Murphy|date=November 21, 2013|publisher=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/osu-football-trail-of-tears-college-gameday-sign-condemned-by-university/article/5337476?custom_click=rss|title=OSU football: 'Trail of Tears' College GameDay sign condemned by university|first=Erik|last=Horne|date=August 30, 2014|publisher=NewsOK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://deadspin.com/cheerleaders-display-trail-of-tears-banner-before-gam-1788354107| title=Cheerleaders Display "Trail Of Tears" Banner Before Game Against Team With Indian Mascot| first=Timothy| last=Burk| date=October 29, 2016| publisher=Deadspin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Central Michigan Chippewas]] have the support of the [[Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation]] of [[Michigan]], a student at rival [[Western Michigan University]] designed a T-shirt showing a Native American behind bars with the legend "Caught a Chippewa about a week ago". It was quickly condemned by both university presidents, who agreed that anyone wearing the shirt at a game would be ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wwmt.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/WMU-CMU-presidents-offer-swift-action-following-t-shirt-controversy-59232.shtml#.VHacPtab2Q4| title=WMU, CMU presidents offer swift action following t-shirt controversy| date=November 22, 2014| publisher=WWMT-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the [[University of North Dakota]] changing their nickname from the Fighting Sioux to the [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks|Fighting Hawks]], students at rival [[North Dakota State University]] (NDSU) continue to chant "Sioux suck shit" whenever their football team makes a first down. The NDSU president, along with the presidents of the student body and faculty senates, have called for an end to the practice, which they describe as hateful, and coming from a misplaced sense of tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/4138709-ndsu-president-calls-end-hateful-sioux-chant-bison-football-games#.WAWqJt0tDBY.facebook| title=NDSU president calls for end of 'hateful' Sioux chant at Bison football games| author=Patrick Springer | date=October 17, 2016| publisher=Grand Forks Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some NDSU fans also wear T-shirts with graphics depicting variations on the "Sioux suck" theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/11/19/offensive-t-shirt-shows-ndsu-fans-cant-let-go-sioux-suck-chant-lives-166519| title=Offensive T-Shirt Shows NDSU Fans Can’t Let Go: ‘Sioux Suck’ Chant Lives On| author=Konnie LeMay| date=November 19, 2016| publisher=Indian Country TodayN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varying degrees of offensiveness===
To further complicate this controversy, many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending upon the name of the team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the [[Cleveland Indians]]' [[Chief Wahoo]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=5437|title=Coalition Of Religious Investors Fight Baseball Team Logo|date=July 10, 1997|accessdate=January 18, 2013|publisher=Catholic Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as [[redskin (slang)|Redskins]] or [[Squaw]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dodgecountynews.com/archives/7311-Squaws-are-region-runner-upshost-first-round-of-state-Friday.html| title=Squaws are region runner-ups:host first round of state Friday| date=February 15, 2017 | accessdate=March 6, 2017| publisher=The Dodge County News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures; such as the tomahawk chop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/5/1/4292152/yeah-the-tomahawk-chop-bugs-me-heres-why| title=Yeah, the "Tomahawk Chop" bugs me. Here's why| first=Mike| last=Bates| date=May 1, 2013| publisher=SBNation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practices of individual schools and teams have changed in response to the controversy. A local example is [[Washington High School (Sioux Falls, South Dakota)|Washington High School]] in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. Many Native American images have been removed, and the "Warriors" nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a "circle of courage" logo with eagle feathers and has also "updated" the murals of Chief [[Hollow Horn Bear]] in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at [[Sinte Gleska University]] in Mission, stated: "We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as long as my great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity." However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.argusleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/stu-whitney/2015/01/17/whitney-sioux-falls-team-indian-nickname/21925163/| title=Does Washington High have nickname problem?| first=Stu| last=Whitney| date=January 17, 2015| publisher=Argus Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teams outside the Americas===
{{further|List of sports team names and mascots derived from indigenous peoples}}
Native American names and images are used by teams in other countries, generally those playing American-style sports and copying the imagery of American teams. Several are in countries that also have a tradition of [[Native American hobbyism in Germany|Native American hobbyists]] often associated with the popularity of the stories written by German author [[Karl May]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes.2018.05.07"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/sports/native-american-mascots-europe.html| title=Tomahawk Chops and Indian Mascots: In Europe, Teams Don’t See a Problem| author=Andrew Keh| newspaper=The New York Times| date=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Old Firm''' is the collective name for the Scottish [[association football|football]] clubs [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], which are both based in [[Glasgow]]. The two clubs are by far the most successful and popular in Scotland, and the rivalry between them has become deeply embedded in Scottish culture. It has reflected, and contributed to, political, social, and religious division and [[sectarianism]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/other_football/15149515.Passion__pride__tradition_and_nastiness__Why_Old_Firm_match_is_greatest_derby_in_the_world/|title=Passion, pride, tradition and nastiness: Why Old Firm match is greatest derby in the world|work=Evening Times|date=11 March 2017|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the fixture has had an enduring appeal around the world.&lt;ref name="FIFA"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326141358/https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2009/m=2/news=old-firm-enduring-appeal-1023776.html|archivedate=26 March 2018|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/rivalries/newsid=1023776/index.html |title=Classic Rivalries: Old Firm's enduring appeal |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=16 April 2016|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between them the two clubs have won 103 [[List of Scottish football champions|Scottish League championships]] (Rangers with 54 and Celtic with 49),&lt;ref name=champions&gt;{{cite web|title=Scotland - List of Champions - Summary |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scotchamp.html#sall|website=RSSSF|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 71 [[Scottish Cup]]s,&lt;ref name=scottishcup&gt;{{cite web|title=Scotland - List of Cup Finals - Summary |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scotcuphist.html#sall|website=RSSSF|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 44 [[Scottish League Cup]]s.&lt;ref name=leaguecup&gt;{{cite web|title=Scotland - List of League Cup Finals - Summary |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scotleagcuphist.html#sum|website=RSSSF|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interruptions to their ascendancy have occurred rarely, most recently with the challenge of the [[New Firm (Scotland)|New Firm]] of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in the first half of the 1980s. Since the [[1985–86 in Scottish football|1985–86 season]], one half of the Old Firm has won the [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish League]] consistently and in all but [[2005–06 Scottish Premier League|one]] of seventeen seasons between [[1995–96 in Scottish football|1995–96]] and [[2011–12 in Scottish football|2011–12]], both clubs finished in the top two places. In recent years Rangers have endured financial difficulties, and were liquidated in 2012. Subsequently, they were re-established as a new company and entered the fourth tier of the Scottish league. Celtic have won the last seven consecutive Scottish championships.

Celtic and Rangers have played each other 414 times in major competitions: Rangers have won 159 matches, Celtic 156 matches, and 99 ended in a draw.&lt;ref name="soccerabaseh2h"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rsssfh2h"/&gt;

The clubs have large fan bases around Glasgow and Scotland, and have supporters clubs in most towns throughout Scotland and Northern Ireland and in many cities around the world. In 2005 the presence of Rangers and Celtic was estimated to be worth £120 million to the [[Economy of Scotland|Scottish economy]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Old Firm on the ball for economy|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4635535.stm|work=BBC |publisher=BBC News  |date=29 June 2005|accessdate=29 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of 'Old Firm'==
The origin of the term is unclear but may derive from the two clubs' initial match in which the commentators referred to the teams as "like two old, firm friends",&lt;ref&gt;Murray, William J. (1984) The Old Firm: sectarianism, sport, and society in Scotland; Edinburgh: J. Donald Publishers; Atlantic Highlands, N.J. {{ISBN|0-85976-121-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively may stem from a [[Satire|satirical]] cartoon published in a magazine prior to the [[1904 Scottish Cup Final]] between the sides, depicting an elderly man with a [[sandwich board]] reading ''"Patronise The Old Firm: Rangers, Celtic Ltd"'', highlighting the mutual commercial benefits of their meetings.&lt;ref name=classic&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/13198793.Six_classic_matches__the_birth_of_the_Old_Firm_and_the_day_Hampden_burned/|title=Six classic matches: the birth of the Old Firm and the day Hampden burned|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=1 June 2017|publisher=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=joined&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/the-old-firm-story-when-fans-joined-forces-to-riot-1-4162491|title=The Old Firm story: When fans joined forces to riot|date=24 June 2016|accessdate=1 June 2017|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name may also be a reference to these two teams being among the original eleven members of the [[Scottish Football League]] formed in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Graham and Alan Bairner.

==Rivalry and sectarianism==
{{Main|Sectarianism in Glasgow}}

The competition between the two clubs had roots in more than just a simple sporting rivalry.&lt;ref name="FIFA"/&gt; It has as much to do with Northern Ireland as Scotland and this can be seen in the flags, cultural symbols, and emblems of both clubs.&lt;ref name="Alottodo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2324152/Old-Firm-rivalry-Its-a-lot-to-do-with-football.html|title=Old Firm rivalry? It's a lot to do with football|work=The Telegraph|location=London|first=Roddy|last=Forsyth|date=26 October 2007|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was infused with a series of complex disputes, sometimes centred on [[religion]] ([[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]]), [[Northern Ireland]]-[[Politics of Northern Ireland|related politics]] ([[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist]] and [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]]), national identity (British or Irish Scots), and social ideology ([[Conservatism in the United Kingdom|Conservatism]] and [[Socialism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wilson, "Inside the Divide" (Edinburgh: Canongate Books, 2012), p. 87: "What is being asserted is two identities: Rangers and Celtic. There are other boundaries: Protestant and Catholic / Unionist and Republican / Conservative and Socialist...."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another primary contributor to the intensity of the rivalry in the west of Scotland was that Rangers supporters are historically native Scots and [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]],&lt;ref name=define/&gt; and Celtic supporters are historically [[Irish-Scots]]. Although the confrontation between the two sets of supporters was often labelled as 'Sectarianism', 'Native-Immigrant tension' was an equally accurate catalyst for hostility between the two teams' supports in Scotland. Rangers' traditional support was largely from the Protestant community, and for decades the club had an [[unwritten rule]] whereby they [[Rangers F.C. signing policy|would not knowingly sign a player of the Catholic faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotzine.com/2012/12/fran-sandaza-interview-opens-up-old-wounds-of-sectarianism/ |title=Fran Sandaza interview opens up old wounds of Sectarianism at Rangers |work=Scotzine |date=2012-12-30 |accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was decried by [[Graeme Souness]] when he became manager, and he brought ex-Celtic forward [[Mo Johnston]] to the club in a very public move away from the practice, which no longer continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rangers.co.uk/club/history/club-history/item/507-the-souness-revolution |title=The Souness Revolution |work=www.rangers.co.uk |publisher=Rangers FC |date= |accessdate=2 December 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005080733/http://www.rangers.co.uk/club/history/club-history/item/507-the-souness-revolution |archivedate=5 October 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mojo&gt;{{cite web|author=Ewan Murray |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/jul/10/maurice-mo-johnston-rangers-celtic |title=Why Mo Johnston still stirs emotions across Glasgow |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mojo2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/11/rangers-sign-catholic |title=10 July 1989: Rangers sign a Catholic |first=Bill |last=McMurdo |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=11 July 2009 |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFPdivide/&gt; Celtic's support was largely from those of [[Irish people|Irish]] Roman Catholic backgrounds and while the club practiced no exclusion of Protestants and signed many of them to play for the team, there was a pro-Catholic mindset among some of the employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew|title=Tommy Gemmell: The Celtic full-back who took role to the future |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/tommy-gemmell-the-celtic-full-back-who-took-role-to-the-future-1-4381762|accessdate=1 June 2017|work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One effect is that [[Flag of Scotland|Scottish flag]]s are rarer than might be expected amongst both sets of supporters; Celtic fans are more likely to wave the [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] while Rangers fans tend to wave the [[Union Jack]].&lt;ref name=disunited/&gt;

There was serious fan disorder during an Old Firm match played on a Sunday evening in May 1999 at [[Celtic Park]], with the usual tensions heightened by the fact that Rangers could [[1998-99 Scottish Premier League|clinch the league title]] with victory (and it became clear that they would do so from the early stages of the match). Several objects were thrown by Celtic fans, one of which struck referee [[Hugh Dallas]] forcing the game to be stopped while he received medical treatment.&lt;ref name = "dallas"/&gt;&lt;ref name=disunited/&gt;&lt;ref name=moments/&gt; With many of those in attendance having spent a full weekend drinking alcohol prior to the event, at least four Celtic fans invaded the field of play to confront Dallas during the game,&lt;ref name = "dallas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/scottish_premier/334094.stm |title=Rangers make history out of chaos |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News|date=3 May 1999|accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more missiles were thrown at players on the pitch after the game.&lt;ref name = "dallas"/&gt; Since the events of that day, Old Firm league matches have normally been played in the early afternoon and the possibility of an Old Firm title decider has been deliberately avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/spl/2927038/Old-Firm-date-is-set-to-avoid-title-trouble.html|title=Old Firm date is set to avoid title trouble|work=The Scottish Sun|publisher=News International|last=MacKay|first=Ronnie|date=10 April 2010|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Drysdale|first=Neil|publisher=STV Sport|date=14 April 2010|accessdate=28 November 2010|title=Old Firm derby reduced to a mere sideshow?

===Incidents involving players===
Over the hundreds of matches played between the rivals, players and staff have been involved in many incidents beyond the usual bad tackles and red cards commonly associated with derby mataches around the world; in the modern age of video footage, such incidents are more frequently observed, reviewed and scrutinised. [[Rangers F.C. 2–2 Celtic F.C.

In 2000, after being sent off during an Old Firm match, Rangers midfielder [[Barry Ferguson]] was involved in a violent brawl with Celtic fans at a hotel later in the same evening;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BARRY+WATCH+K.O.%3b+Reconstruction+of+what+really+went+on+at+the+Battle...-a064963416 |title=Barry Watch K.O.; Reconstruction of what really went on at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge |date=3 September 2000 |work=Sunday Mail |first=Charles |last=Lavery |via=The Free Library (Farlex) |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a year later, Ferguson (by now club captain) was sitting in the stand when he appeared to throw ice packs towards the Celtic dugout after Rangers conceded a late goal, however the referee missed the incident and no action was taken.&lt;ref name=action&gt;{{cite web |title=Football: Clubs must take action |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3a+Clubs+must+take+action.-a078946600 |date=7 October 2001 |work=Sunday Mirror |first=Ray |last=Hepburn |via=The Free Library (Farlex) |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same match, a Celtic supporter was photographed making an 'aeroplane' gesture towards American Rangers player [[Claudio Reyna]] a few weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=action/&gt; A 2004 match at Ibrox which "descended into even more mayhem and madness than usual" led to a police enquiry over the conduct of the players and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/nov/22/match.rangers|title=Inquiry into Old Firm mayhem|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Graham Clark|date=22 November 2004|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/4025379.stm|title=Rangers 2–0 Celtic |work=BBC Sport|date=20 November 2004|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, Celtic goalkeeper [[Artur Boruc]] was cautioned by the police for gestures he made to Rangers supporters during a match at Ibrox; six months later, it was clarified that this was for "Conduct which appears to incite disorder" rather than simply making the [[sign of the cross]] as he entered his area, as some had thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5292656.stm|title=Player caution 'not for blessing' |work=BBC News|date=28 August 2006|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also blessed himself in the fixture in December of that year, annoying Rangers fans who saw it as a provocative act, although the police stated that no offence had been committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/celtic-keeper-makes-rangers-fans-cross-1-734722|title=Celtic keeper makes Rangers fans cross|work=The Scotsman|date=18 December 2006|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boruc, who became known as the 'Holy Goalie' for his overt displays of his Catholic faith, escaped personal punishment in 2008 for displaying a t-shirt with the slogan "God bless the Pope" and an image of fellow Pole [[Pope John Paul II]] after an Old Firm win at Parkhead in April 2008, although Celtic faced scrutiny from FIFA as it was an unauthorised garment under their regulations on slogans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/celtic-keeper-boruc-escapes-sfa-action-over-old-firm-pope-tshirt-7266598.html|title=Celtic keeper Boruc escapes SFA action over Old Firm Pope T-shirt |work=[[Evening Standard]]|date=29 April 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2298874/Celtic-may-carry-can-for-Boruc-behaviour.html|title=Celtic may carry can for Boruc behaviour|work=Daily Telegraph|author=Ewing Grahame|date=30 April 2008|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was fined £500 and warned for (non-religious) gestures made towards Rangers fans in a defeat at the same venue in September of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/09/celtic.rangers|title=Boruc in trouble again over Old Firm 'gesture'|work=The Guardian|date=9 September 2008|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/09/celtic.rangers|title=Boruc escapes with £500 fine for stirring up Rangers fans |work=The Guardian|author=Ben Rumsby|date=24 October 2008|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to an international match between [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in 2009, graffiti of a threatening nature mentioning Boruc appeared on walls in a Rangers-supporting area of Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/death-threat-to-celtic-star-boruc-before-world-cup-game-1655567.html|title=Death threat to Celtic star Boruc before World Cup game|work=The Independent|date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, an angry exchange took place on the touchline at Celtic Park between Celtic manager [[Neil Lennon]] and Rangers assistant coach [[Ally McCoist]], requiring police officers to separate them, at the end of a match in which three players had also been dismissed; again captured on live television footage, the incident resulted in both men being banned from the dugout for disconduct.&lt;ref name=moments/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/10/neil-lennon-ally-mccoist-sfa|title=Celtic's Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist of Rangers guilty of misconduct |work=The Guardian|author=Ewan Murray|date=10 March 2011|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/scottish-premier/8374330/Neil-Lennon-and-Ally-McCoist-banned-over-touchline-confrontation-during-Celtics-win-over-Rangers.html|title=Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist banned over touchline confrontation during Celtic's win over Rangers|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|author=Roddy Forsyth|date=10 March 2011|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 'crisis meeting' was convened involving the clubs, the Scottish Government and Strathclyde Police some days later regarding the trend of violence among supporters away from the pitch increasing on Old Firm mathdays and concerns that incidents during the matches was a factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/scottish-premier/8369897/Old-Firm-agree-six-point-plan-to-curb-derby-turmoil.html|title=Old Firm agree six-point plan to curb derby turmoil|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|author=Roddy Forsyth|date=8 March 2011|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident occurred during the tense environment of [[2010–11 in Scottish football|a season]] where seven Old Firm matches took place (including a [[2011 Scottish League Cup Final|League Cup final]] and a [[2010–11 Scottish Premier League|fight for the title]] eventually won by Rangers by one point).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/9484609.stm|title=Kilmarnock 1 – 5 Rangers|work=BBC Sport|date=15 May 2011|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visitor allocation and crushing incident===
During the 2018 close season, Rangers announced that they would be cutting the ticket allocation for Celtic fans at Ibrox from around 7,000 (the entire Broomloan Stand) to 800, situated in a corner where smaller travelling supports were usually accommodated, following a fan survey backing the proposal as well as an upturn in season ticket sales. In response, Celtic indicated they would do likewise, bringing to an end a long tradition of both clubs offering an generous proportion of their stadium to their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/rangers-cut-celtic-ticket-allocation-to-800-1-4744615 | title=Rangers cut Celtic ticket allocation to 800 | work=The Scotsman | date=24 May 2018 | accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development was criticised by former players as diluting the famous atmosphere of the fixtures,&lt;ref name=donnelly&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/16251770.Former_Celtic_striker_Simon_Donnelly__it_s_not_the_fans_that_make_the_difference_but_the_quality_of_the_players/ | title=Former Celtic striker Simon Donnelly: it's not the fans that make the difference but the quality of the players  | work=Evening Times | date=26 May 2018 | accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangers-board-put-scottish-football-12598671 | title=Rangers board have put Scottish football back years with farcical Celtic ticket decision - Chris Sutton | work=Daily Record| date=26 May 2018 | accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others praised the extra income the change would likely generate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangers-decision-cut-celtics-ticket-12597588 | title=Rangers decision to cut Celtic's ticket allocation was justified as it will generate money for Steven Gerrard - Barry Ferguson | work=Daily Record| date=26 May 2018 | accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first Old Firm fixture at Celtic Park under the new arrangements, many more home fans were able to attend but segregation was still required outside the stadium to keep them apart from the smaller away support. In the minutes before kick-off, a main access road was closed as part of the amended segregation plan and thousands of spectators approaching Celtic Park from both directions were directed to the narrow enclosed walkway below the North Stand to reach the opposite side of the stadium, along with those trying to enter that stand via turnstiles. The volume of people in the walkway area built up to the extent that many were unable to move forward with more approaching from either side, and [[Stampede#Human stampedes and crushes|crushing]] was experienced in the congested area for some minutes, causing panic, with several fans scaling a high perimeter wall and fence to escape; one of them fell from the wall and later required hospital treatment, while four other persons were treated at the scene as the situation subsided. Those involved expressed their anger afterwards regarding the arrangements and the policing at the stadium on the day, with Celtic issuing an official apology to the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-45396058 | title=Celtic apologise to fans after crush incident before Old Firm game | work=[[BBC News]] | date=3 September 2018 | accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-fans-demand-probe-terrifying-13183745 | title=Celtic fans demand probe into terrifying crush before Rangers game to ensure it never happens again | work=Daily Record| date=3 September 2018 | accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/16686313.celtic-park-crush-dad-takes-traumatised-son-15-to-hospital/ | title=Celtic Park ‘crush’: Dad takes traumatised son, 15, to hospital | work=Evening Times | date=4 September 2018 | accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
From 1 March 2012, the police were given more powers to act against Sectarian acts at football matches through the new [[Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012]]. The law was designed specifically to target the Old Firm rivalry by reducing the religious hatred between the two opposing sides.&lt;ref name=eternal/&gt; The Act created two new offences, one covering behaviour in and around football matches and the other related to posts sent by either electronic or postal methods. People convicted under the act could face up to five years imprisonment, a much higher sentence than was previously in place. It was hoped it would make it much easier to prosecute this misbehaviour, which had proved difficult in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20205917 |title=New sectarian law hailed a success by Lord Advocate |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 a protest by a number of Celtic fans took place to protest against the new laws and the subsequent match bans that a number of fans had received for breaking the Act. The protesters, known as the "[[Green Brigade]]," had marched without police authority and the event was therefore cracked down on by local authorities resulting in thirteen arrests. The protestors claim that the police instigated the trouble that occurred at this march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-21813699 |title=Arrests made as Green Brigade protest is broken up |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the march, media coverage reported that the fans were growing further apart from the police than ever before. They claimed that the trust the fans hold with the police to work in cooperation with them is falling dramatically. The march that took place resulted in a number of complaints from both Celtic and Rangers fan groups that they were harassed by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21849341 |title=Old Firm fans in danger of 'losing trust in police', say MSPs |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC |date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour MSP [[James Kelly (Scottish politician)|James Kelly]] introduced the ''Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Repeal) (Scotland) Bill'' in June 2017. Kelly had described the 2012 legislation as having "completely failed to tackle sectarianism" and as "illiberal" which "unfairly targets football fans", and was "condemned by legal experts, human rights organisations and equality groups".&lt;ref name=eternal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Report - 25 January 2018|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=11325&amp;mode=pdf|website=Scottish Parliament|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Sir [[Tom Devine]] previously spoke of the Football Act as "''the most illiberal and counterproductive act passed by our young Parliament to date''" and a "''stain on the reputation of the Scottish legal system for fair dealing''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheriff who called SNP's anti-bigotry law 'mince' steps down from bench after 27 years|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sheriff-who-called-snps-anti-8222982|work=Daily Record|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much was made of when a Sheriff described the law as "mince".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=James|title=Why the SNP must scrap the act|url=https://scraptheact.com/2018/01/23/agenda-column/|website=ScrapTheAct|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events post-2012==
{{Main|Administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club plc}}

In 2012, Rangers suffered a financial collapse leading to the liquidation of the commercial entity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-20141946|title=Lord Hodge approves liquidation of former Rangers FC|work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18413384|title=Rangers in liquidation Q&amp;A|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the sporting assets were [[Ownership of Rangers F.C.|acquired by a new company]]&lt;ref name = "smith"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18447530|title=Charles Green completes Rangers purchase despite Walter Smith bid|publisher=BBC News|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed its playing membership to continue unbroken (albeit in the lowest division of the [[Scottish football league system]]).&lt;ref name="SFA website"&gt;{{cite news|title=Agreement on Transfer of Membership|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_fa_news.cfm?page=2986&amp;newsID=10252&amp;newsCategoryID=1|date=27 July 2012|publisher=SFA website|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, this would mean that for the first time in 120 years, no fixtures would be played between Rangers and Celtic.

The status of the Old Firm was also challenged,&lt;ref name=define&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/the-old-firm-story-how-sectarianism-came-to-define-a-derby-1-4166492|title=The Old Firm story: How sectarianism came to define a derby|last=Smith|first=Andrew|publisher=The Scotsman|date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the logic that since Rangers 'died' during the events of 2012, the rivalry also expired and any matches played since that point would be between Celtic and a 'new Rangers', albeit playing at the same stadium, in the same colours, with the same supporters and some of the same players as before.&lt;ref name = "smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name=demise&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/14863559.Hugh_MacDonald__Why_does_the_demise_or_otherwise_of_Rangers_matter_so_much_/|title=Why does the demise or otherwise of Rangers matter so much?|first=Hugh|last=MacDonald|publisher=The National|date=26 March 2016|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents to this point of view refer to the club disparagingly as ''Sevco'' (the original name of the post-2012 holding company),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://local.stv.tv/glasgow/186158-falkirk-fc-stadium-announcer-suspended-after-rangers-sevco-comment/ |title=Falkirk FC stadium announcer suspended after Rangers 'Sevco' comment |publisher=STV |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830154625/http://local.stv.tv/glasgow/186158-falkirk-fc-stadium-announcer-suspended-after-rangers-sevco-comment/ |archivedate=30 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rangers supporters as 'zombies' or 'the undead'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14728943.Irish_pub_causes_a_stir_with_a_Zombie_Rangers_FC_advert/|title=Irish pub in Glasgow causes a stir with a Zombie Rangers FC advert|publisher=The Herald|date=8 September 2016 |accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference of opinion became a new factor in the rivalry.&lt;ref name=demise/&gt;

Some Celtic supporters were particularly vociferous in their assertions, to the extent of a group paying for a full-page newspaper advertisement in January 2015 announcing that their club would soon play its first fixture against the new Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic-fans-spark-storm-protest-5040733|title=Celtic fans spark storm of protest after claiming Rangers are new club and "Old Firm" derby is dead in newspaper advert|publisher=Daily Record|date=25 January 2015|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/former-rangers-heroes-laugh-celtic-5042508|title=Former Rangers heroes laugh off Celtic fans' advert that claims Ibrox outfit is a new club|publisher=Daily Record|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/old-firm-once-hampden-rocking-5047530|title=Old Firm?

In 2013 numerous complaints were made to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) over official marketing communications from Rangers which stated they were "Scotland’s most successful club", with this claim being disputed as the complainants declared the club had only been in existence for one year. Having considered the evidence including advice from UEFA, the ASA did not uphold the complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/the-rangers-football-club-ltd-a13-224406.html|title=ASA Adjudication on The Rangers Football Club Ltd|publisher=[[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|ASA]]|date=18 December 2013 |accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, a large [[Tifo|banner]] was displayed at Celtic Park during a game showing a cartoon zombie representing Rangers rising from the grave before being shot by a sniper, drawing criticism due to the gunman resembling a paramilitary from the Northern Ireland conflict, although Celtic escaped formal punishment over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/13076679.Celtic_cleared_over_zombie_banner_but_issue_still_rankles/|title=Celtic cleared over zombie banner but issue still rankles|publisher=The Herald|date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/celtic-cleared-by-sfa-over-zombie-banner-at-norwich-match-1-2568427|title=Celtic cleared by SFA over ‘zombie’ banner at Norwich match|publisher=The Scotsman|date=12 October 2012|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green Brigade|Celtic fan groups]] have continued to display banners claiming Rangers are ‘dead’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/celtic-fans-unveil-rip-banner-aimed-at-rangers-1-4567971 |title=Celtic fans unveil RIP banner aimed at Rangers |publisher=The Scotsman|date=23 September 2017 |accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as mocking other aspects of their economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/713609/celtic-fans-blasted-after-trainspotting-themed-banner-mocks-rangers-over-cash-woes-and-child-abuse/ |title=CHOOSE STRIFE: Celtic fans blasted after Trainspotting-themed banner mocks Rangers over cash woes and child abuse |publisher=The Sun|date=13 March 2017|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hampden, [[Scotland national football team|Scotland's national stadium]] and home of [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], is situated roughly an equal distance from Ibrox and Celtic Park in Glasgow. Due to the frequency of the two teams appearing in semi-finals and finals held there (often facing one another), its West and East stands are always allocated to the same club and are informally known as the ''Rangers end'' and ''Celtic end'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1990319.stm|title=Hampden enjoys the party|quote=Once inside, the disparity in terms of support was even more evident, with the Spanish followers occupying the whole of what is traditionally regarded as the Rangers end of the ground.

The [[1971 Ibrox disaster]] – in which 66 Rangers supporters died in a crush on an exterior stairway – occurred at the end of an Old Firm match,&lt;ref name="proud"/&gt; although the identity of the opposition was not a factor in the incident other than having drawn a large crowd of at least 75,000 to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/rangers/8230503/The-Ibrox-Disaster-of-January-2-1971-which-claimed-66-lives-was-a-tragedy-waiting-to-happen.html|title= The Ibrox Disaster of January 2, 1971 which claimed 66 lives was a tragedy waiting to happen|first=Roddy|last=Forsyth|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 December 2010|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since redevelopments completed in the 1990s, all three venues are all-seater with much smaller capacities of between 50,000 and 60,000, meaning the above records may never be beaten – the attendance of 72,069 at 'old style' Hampden for the Old Firm [[1989 Scottish Cup Final]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19890522&amp;id=izNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RlkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3687,251027 |newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=22 May 1989 |page=22 |title=Tension and fear spoil show-piece |first=James |last=Traynor |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become a landmark figure as no match in Scotland has come close to matching it since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/hearts-clash-celtic-scottish-footballs-13466380.amp |title=Hearts’ clash with Celtic will boast Scottish football’s biggest crowd in 29 years |work=Daily Record |date=24 October 2018|author=Gavin Berry |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Average attendances===
When compared to other clubs in Scotland, the Old Firm maintain considerably higher attendances;&lt;ref name=efsavesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/nav/attnsco.htm|title=Attendances – Scotland|work=european-football-statistics.co.uk|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celtic's recorded crowds tend to be higher than Rangers as their stadium holds approximately 9,000 more seats. Both clubs (among others) have been accused of inflating their attendance figures by counting all season ticket holders in the crowd when many have not actually attended the match in question, with the accurate figures reported to the police for crowd control being lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic--rangers-attendances-up-1767244|title=Celtic &amp; Rangers attendances up to 20,000 per game lower than figures released to public, say police|work=Daily Record|date=16 March 2013|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/28/football-clubs-leagues-attendance-figures-arsenal-celtic-mls|title=Football clubs should stop exaggerating their attendance figures |work=The Guardian|author=Ian Thomson|date=28 September 2017|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dominance of Scottish football==
{{See also|History of Scottish football#Old Firm Domination}}

The intensity of the rivalry is fuelled by the clubs' historical duopoly in Scottish football, with most meetings between them being pivotal in deciding the destiny of a championship or cup and anything but a title-winning season seen as a major disappointment, particularly as it would usually mean 'the enemy' has won the trophy.

[[File:Old Firm pic.PNG|thumb|320px|left|Side-by-side comparison of Celtic's and Rangers' final league positions from 1891–2017]]
Statistics show that Rangers and Celtic have been by far the most successful clubs involved in the [[Scottish Football League]] since its formation in [[1890–91 in Scottish football|1890]]. The pair were the only participants in every edition of the competition until [[2011–12 in Scottish football|2012]], when Rangers were [[Administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc|removed from the top tier for economic reasons]]; they returned for the [[2016–17 in Scottish football|2016–17]] season. Of the [[List of Scottish football champions|121 championships played]], 103 (85%) have been won by one of the Old Firm with Rangers ahead on 54 titles to Celtic's 49, and 19 between ten other clubs (including a shared title between Rangers and [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]).

Although there have been brief periods when silverware went elsewhere, there have also been long spells of domination by each Old Firm club, the longest run of 9-in-a-row being first set by Celtic between [[1966–67 in Scottish football|1966]] and [[1973–74 in Scottish football|1974]], matched by Rangers between [[1988–89 in Scottish football|1989]] and [[1996–97 in Scottish football|1997]].

On just five occasions since 1891 have neither of the Glasgow giants been the league winner nor the runner-up. This includes [[1964–65 in Scottish football|1964–65]], the only season in which both Rangers and Celtic failed to finish in the top three places. The Old Firm have finished 1st and 2nd 48 times overall. Between the [[History of Celtic F.C. (1994–present)#The Fergus McCann era (1994–1999)|resurgence of Celtic in the mid-1990s]] and the liquidation of Rangers in 2012, '1–2' finishes were recorded in all but one of 17 ''[[Scottish Premier League#Old Firm dominance|SPL]]-era'' seasons.

The longest sequence without an Old Firm title is three years between [[1982–83 in Scottish football|1983]] and [[1984–85 in Scottish football|1985]], while the longest unbroken run of championships between the two clubs began immediately afterwards and is ongoing: 33 seasons and counting since [[1985–86 in Scottish football|1986]] (overtaking a previous sequence of 27 years between [[1904–05 in Scottish football|1905]] and [[1930–31 in Scottish football|1931]]).

===Scottish Cup===
{{See also|List of Scottish Cup finals}}

Although the initial [[Scottish Cup]] was played in [[1873–74 Scottish Cup|1874]], 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).

There have been 14 Old Firm finals, while there have been just 39 finals involving neither Rangers or Celtic, 17 of which were in the 1800s.

The longest run of Old Firm wins is 11 between [[1970–71 in Scottish football|1971]] and [[1980–81 in Scottish football|1981]].

==Women's football==
The Rangers–Celtic rivalry in women's football has existed only in the 21st century, with [[Rangers W.F.C.]] having formed in 2008, one year after the [[Celtic F.C. women's team]]. The footballing environment is also very different, with a third team in the city – [[Glasgow City F.C.]] – not merely competing in the same division as the more famous names and attracting a similar fanbase, but dominant over them in the [[Scottish Women's Premier League|domestic league]], with eleven consecutive titles up to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41960565|title=Glasgow City beat Hibs to wrap up 11th successive SWPL title |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=12 November 2017|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=womensep18&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45465408 |title=Celtic 0-0 Rangers: Old Firm sides goalless in women's game |work=BBC Sport |date=10 September 2018|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers have only finished above Celtic once ([[2014 Scottish Women's Premier League|2014]]), and neither club has won the [[Scottish Women's Cup]]; Celtic have lifted the [[Scottish Women's Premier League Cup|SWPL Cup]] on one occasion, in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/8679584.stm|title=Celtic secure women's League Cup|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=4 June 2018|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sport|sports]], '''parity''' is when participating teams have roughly equivalent levels of talent. In such a league, the "best" team is not significantly better than the "worst" team.  This leads to more competitive contests where the winner cannot be easily predicted in advance. The opposite condition, which could be considered "disparity" between teams, is a condition where the elite teams are so much more talented that the lesser teams are hopelessly outmatched.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/03/13/how-does-parity-compare-among-the-major-u-s-sports-nfl-nba-mlb-nhl-college-football-college-basketball/&lt;/ref&gt;

Different major governing organizations attempt to achieve parity in different ways. For example, the [[National Football League]] (NFL) in the U.S. has established the shared revenue plan, in which all teams equally benefit from television revenue and sales of NFL franchised goods.

Many consider the NFL to be the most "fair" or competitive league, with many different teams having a chance to win each year. In the NFL, complete parity would be a state where on any given Sunday, any given team can win any given game. The illusion of parity in the NFL may be somewhat of a misconception, given that several teams such as the [[New England Patriots]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Green Bay Packers]] have appeared in the playoffs in almost all of the past ten years, while a team such as the [[Cleveland Browns]] has a [[list of NFL franchise post-season droughts|playoff drought]] that is currently over a decade long. The most important thing to remember is that a franchise can be struggling and the reason for it can be due to the team's ineptitude when it comes evaluating talent, coaching strategies, developing players, having a good organizational structure, and overall team and player operations.

An example of disparity in sports is [[Portuguese Liga]], the top-flight professional [[association football|football (soccer)]] league in [[Portugal]], where [[Big Three (Portugal)|three clubs]] have accounted for 75 of the 77 championships in league history.

Salary cap limits set a maximum amount of money that may be spent on athletes' contracts. These limits exist to different extents in several other leagues as well. For example, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) in the U.S. does not have a cap, but charges a [[luxury tax (sports)|luxury tax]] beyond a certain level.

Another example of disparity would be demonstrated by the [[NBA]] from the [[2014–15 NBA season]] to the [[2017–18 NBA season]], where the [[Golden State Warriors]] and [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] have been the only franchises to reach the [[NBA Finals]] during that specific time span and during the [[2017 NBA finals]] and the [[2018 NBA finals]] the [[Golden State Warriors]] won 8 out of the possible 9 finals games.

==History==
The company was started in [[London]] in early 2004 by [[Simon Mottram]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penn|first=Rob|title=Pedalling fashion: the rise of cycle style|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/hot-50-supplement/hot-50-rapha/|publisher=Design Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luke Scheybeler]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Lucie|title=New sportswear line|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a6984224-546b-11e4-b2ea-00144feab7de|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first products were launched in July of that year. The name Rapha was taken from the 1960s cycling team [[Rapha (cycling team)|Rapha]], which was named after the [[Apéritif and digestif|apéritif]] drink company Saint Raphaël.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Original Rapha|url=http://inrng.com/2012/05/original-rapha-history/|work=The Inner Ring|accessdate=21 May 2013|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Rapha partnered with British designer [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]] to create a range of limited-edition cycle clothing and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapha + Paul Smith collection unveiled|url=http://roadcyclinguk.com/news/gear-news/rapha-paul-smith-collection-unveiled.html|work=Road Cycling UK|accessdate=1 October 2012|date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Rapha collaborated with bikepacking design pioneer Apidura on a limited range of cycling luggage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cyclingindustry.news/rapha-partners-apidura-for-bar-and-saddlebag-line/|title=Rapha partners Apidura for bar and saddlebag line|date=2016-06-15|work=Cycling Industry News|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Rapha clothing is produced in a number of different locations including the UK, Italy and the Far East. UK production included some early Merino wool pieces and also leather gloves which are made in Somerset, England. Italian production focuses on stretch fabric and stretch garments such as shorts and tights. In China production focuses on the most technical items, such as outerwear.

In recent years, Rapha has developed an international cycling club, in which members have access to exclusive club apparel and high-end bike rentals (currently supplied by [[Canyon Bicycles]]).  The Rapha Cycling Club (RCC) hosts rides and events at stores known as Clubhouses in 21 international locations throughout the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia.  Each clubhouse consists of a retail space that sells Rapha apparel and accessories, as well as a cafe that serves coffee and food while screening live cycle racing.  Clubhouses also play host to a number of cycling-related events and art exhibitions throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.rapha.cc/clubs&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, it was announced that Rapha would be purchased by RZC Investments, a company setup by [[Steuart Walton]], for £200m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walmart heirs' fund wins £200m race for cycling brand Rapha|url=http://news.sky.com/story/walmart-heirs-fund-wins-200m-race-for-cycling-brand-rapha-10978288|accessdate=7 August 2017|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorships==
Rapha used to co-own the UK-based cycling team {{ct|RCS|2014}} with London bike brand [[Condor Cycles]] and the [[cyclocross]] team Rapha Focus; at the end of 2014 Rapha announced they would end their grassroots sponsorship to focus on Team Sky and {{ct|WGN}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rapha-focus.cx/sponsors/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427233133/http://rapha-focus.cx/sponsors/ |archivedate=2014-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2012, it was announced that as of 2013, Rapha would be producing the clothing for the British cycling team, {{ct|SKY|2013}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merrill|first=Jamie|title=Sky's the limit for cult clothing brand Rapha|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/skys-the-limit-for-cult-clothing-brand-rapha-8101496.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=1 October 2012|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Australian Cyclocross champion for 2013 and 2014, Lisa Jacobs, chooses to wear Rapha clothing.
On November 3, 2015, Rapha announced that their {{ct|SKY|2016}} sponsorship would end after the 2016 season.  In an effort to grow and promote women's cycling, Rapha began supplying clothing to the [[UCI Women's WorldTour]] team [[Canyon-SRAM]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.rapha.cc/feature/canyon-sram-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Companies law}}

'''Sociedad anónima deportiva''' ("Public limited sports company") is a special type of [[public limited company]] in [[Spain]]. The new legal status was introduced in 1990&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csd.gob.es/csd/asociaciones/6SAD/ (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; to improve financial management and transparency in sports clubs. Many Spanish [[Association football|football]] and [[basketball]] clubs add the suffix '''S.A.D.''' to the end of their official name, e.g. [[Atlético Madrid|Club Atlético de Madrid, S.A.D.]].

Every club which plays in [[Segunda División]] or [[Liga ACB]] and remains in the league is obliged to convert to S.A.D. status.

For historical reasons, [[Athletic Bilbao|Athletic Club]], [[FC Barcelona]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]] were allowed to retain their status as non-commercial sports associations.

'''Sperry''' or Sperry Top-Sider is the original American brand of [[Boat shoes|boat shoe]] designed in 1935 by [[Paul A. Sperry]], older brother of writer and illustrator [[Armstrong Sperry]], whose books often featured a sailing theme. Sperrys, or Top-Siders, were the first boat shoes introduced into the boating and footwear markets. Today the Sperry brand is owned by [[Wolverine World Wide]] and is headquartered in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].

==History==
While sailing on the Long Island Sound, inventor and sailor [[Paul A. Sperry]] slipped on the deck of his boat and fell overboard. He was able to pull himself back on board, but the experience drove him to develop a non-slip shoe.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Connecticut Icons: 50 Symbols of the Nutmeg State|last = Monagan|first = Charles A.|publisher = Globe Pequot Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-7627-3548-8|location = Guilford, Connecticut|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While experimenting with possibilities for non-slip shoes, he noticed his dogs’ ability to run down the icy hill without slipping.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The grooves on the paws of his [[cocker spaniel]], Prince, inspired him to try cutting grooved patterns ([[Siping (rubber)|siping]]) into a natural rubber sole.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The pattern of grooves or cracks on his dog's paws gave him the idea for a canvas upper-shoe with a [[herringbone pattern]] of grooves on the [[Sole (shoe)|sole]].

The cutting of grooves in the sole of the Top-Sider was an implementation of a process of splitting or [[Siping (rubber)|siping]] a shoe sole invented and patented in the 1920s by John Sipe. This process was instrumental in maximizing the traction of the Authentic Original Sperry Top-Sider boat shoe, which was first introduced in 1935. Sperry's first shoe featured a white outsole, which prevented the shoe from leaving marks on a boat's deck. The [[Commonwealth Shoe and Leather Co.]] later partnered with Paul A. Sperry to design a new leather shoe design made with specially tanned leather which later became the Sperry Authentic Original boat shoe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sperry's shoes remained a niche product for boaters until 1939 when the [[U.S. Navy]] negotiated the right to manufacture the shoe for its sailors at the [[United States Naval Academy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result of this increase in production, Paul A. Sperry sold the Sperry brand to the [[United States Rubber Company|U.S. Rubber Co.]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1979 the [[Stride Rite Corporation]] purchased both Sperry and [[Keds (shoes)]] from the U.S. Rubber Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stride Rite Corp Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Stride Rite Corp|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Stride_Rite_Corp.aspx|website = www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Payless ShoeSource]] acquired Sperry Top-Sider as part of a multi-brand acquisition, but the company was again acquired in 2012, along with the other brands from the [[Collective Brands Inc.|Collective Brands]] Performance and Lifestyle Group portfolio,  by [[Wolverine World Wide]] and [[Blum Capital|Blum Capital Partners]] for $1.23 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wolverine Worldwide To Complete Acquisition Of Collective Brands' Performance + Lifestyle Group|url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wolverine-worldwide-to-complete-acquisition-of-collective-brands-performance--lifestyle-group-173274541.html|website = www.prnewswire.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Sperry 1937.tif|thumb|The patent application for the [[Paul A. Sperry|Paul A. Sperry's]] Sperry Authentic Original boat shoe.]]

==Present day==
From 2001 to 2014 Craig L. Reingold served as the Brand President of Sperry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wolverine World Wide switches up leadership of Keds, Sperry Top-Sider brands|url = http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2014/09/wolverine_world_wide_switches.html|website = MLive.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but upon Reingold's exit from the company Wolverine World Wide announced in a press release on September 15, 2015 that Rick Blackshaw, the former Brand President of Keds, would be leading Sperry as the Brand President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wolverine Worldwide Names Rick Blackshaw President of Sperry Top-Sider and Chris Lindner President of Keds|url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wolverine-worldwide-names-rick-blackshaw-president-of-sperry-top-sider-and-chris-lindner-president-of-keds-275108341.html|website = www.prnewswire.com|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015 Sperry President Rick Blackshaw announced that the brand had dropped the "Top-Sider" moniker from the company name as part of the footwear company's new brand campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://footwearnews.com/2015/business/media/sperry-new-brand-identity-13806/ |title=Sperry Prez Rick Blackshaw Talks New Brand Identity |publisher=''Footwear News' |date=2015-02-19 |accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Wolverine World Wide CEO Blake Kruger appointed Tom Kennedy, previously the President of the Apparel &amp; Accessories group, to the position of Brand President.

== Retail Stores ==
In 2009 Sperry opened its first five retail stores with locations in [[Tampa, Florida]], [[Orlando, Florida]], [[Boca Raton, Florida]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and [[Dallas, Texas]]; in November 2010, the brand opened stores in [[Burlington, Massachusetts]], [[Houston]], [[Durham, North Carolina]] and [[Westchester, New York]].

By the end of 2015 Sperry had opened 68 specialty and outlet stores in malls across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Find a Store {{!}} Sperry|url = http://www.sperry.com/en/stores|website = www.sperry.com|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sperry retail store in Natick, MA.jpeg|thumb|280x280px|The Sperry retail store in the [[Natick Mall]].]] --&gt;

== Sailing ==

===US Sailing Team Sperry===
Sperry is the official footwear sponsor of the [[US Sailing]] Team Sperry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/san-diego-sailor-trains-for-his-first-olympics-1462898776 | title=San Diego Sailor Trains for His First Olympics | work=[[Wall Street Journal]] | date=10 May 2016 | accessdate=22 May 2016 | author=Potkewitz, Hilary}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US Junior Olympic Sailing Team and the US Paralympics Sailing Team.

=== America's Cup ===
In 1987, Sperry Top-Sider served as the official sponsor of the [[America's Cup World Series]]. Sperry shoes were worn by champion sailor [[Dennis Conner]] during the race.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Discover Sperry’s History &amp; Current Events {{!}} Sperry|url = http://www.sperry.com/en/our-story/|website = www.sperry.com|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sperry served as the footwear sponsor for the America's Cup sailing tournament for several years, but later began to sponsor other sailing events.

On December 9, 2015 Sperry announced that they had become the official Footwear Partner of the 35th America's Cup and the official footwear supplier for ORACLE TEAM USA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = SPERRY® AND THE AMERICA’S CUP ANNOUNCE NEW PARTNERSHIP|url = http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7700251-sperry-america-s-cup-partnership/|website = Multivu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Rick Blackshaw stated in a press release that, "In seeking a competitive advantage, [[America's Cup]] athletes look to footwear that will help them maintain agility and mobility on the high-performance catamarans used in competition. Sperry will work together with ORACLE TEAM USA to support and improve performance by developing a special shoe for use during training and racing."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Footwear News'' announced on February 19, 2016 that Sperry had also become the Official Footwear supplier of SoftBank Team Japan. Through their America's Cup partnership, Sperry announced that they would collaborate with athletes to create custom footwear to wear during the rigorous competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://footwearnews.com/2016/runway/fall-16-couture/sperry-shoes-americas-cup-sailing-competition-194264/|title=Sperry Official Footwear Of SoftBank Team Japan for 35th America’s Cup|last=Schneider-Levy|first=Barbara|date=2016-02-19|newspaper=Footwear News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Odyssey Project ==
[[File:Sperry.jpg|thumb|An Authentic Original boat shoe invented by [[Paul A. Sperry]] in 1935.]]
In February 2015, Sperry announced that, in celebration of their 80th anniversary, the company was going to send 80 influencers, innovators, and athletes on adventures around the world. Participating influencers would then create content and share blog posts about their journey on Sperry's website and social media channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sperry Goes Back to Basics With a Campaign for Adventurous Millennials|url = http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/sperry-goes-back-basics-campaign-adventurous-millennials-162983|website = AdWeek|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the brand's "Odysseys Await" brand campaign, Sperry encouraged consumers to explore and escape their comfort zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wolverine Worldwide's new $18M Sperry campaign targets adventurous Millennials|url = http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2015/04/wolverine_worldwides_new_18m_s.html|website = MLive.com|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odyssey Project travelers were sent on trips to [[New Zealand]], [[California]], [[Florida]], [[Iceland]], [[Alaska]], [[Costa Rica]], and [[Cuba]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; among other destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Odyssey Project|url = http://odyssey.sperry.com/|website = odyssey.sperry.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Sport in [[childhood]]. [[Association football]], shown above, is a [[team sport]] which also provides opportunities to nurture [[physical fitness]] and [[social actions|social interaction]] skills.]]

'''Sport''' ([[British English]]) or '''sports''' ([[American English]]) includes all forms of [[Competition|competitive]] [[physical activity]] or [[game]]s which,&lt;ref name=sportaccord&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idIndex=32&amp;idContent=14881 |title=Definition of sport |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028112912/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idIndex=32&amp;idContent=14881 |archivedate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, [[entertainment]] for spectators.&lt;ref name=council&gt;{{cite web |last=Council of Europe |title=The European sport charter |url=https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=206451 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in [[team]]s or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as [[racing]], many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a ''match'') is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide [[tie-breaking methods]] to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a [[tournament]] producing a [[champion]]. Many [[sports league]]s make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular [[sports season]], followed in some cases by [[playoffs]].

Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical [[athleticism]] or physical [[dexterity]], with the largest major competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]] admitting only sports meeting this definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/sports |title=List of Summer and Winter Olympic Sports and Events |publisher=The Olympic Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organisations such as the [[Council of Europe]] using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.&lt;ref name=council/&gt; However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as [[mind sport]]s. The International Olympic Committee (through [[Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations|ARISF]]) recognises both [[chess]] and [[Contract bridge|bridge]] as ''bona fide'' sports, and [[SportAccord]], the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, [[draughts]] (checkers), [[Go (game)|Go]] and [[xiangqi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=World Mind Games |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&amp;idContent=658 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508021848/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&amp;idContent=658 |archivedate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=Members |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&amp;idIndex=32 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507073823/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&amp;idIndex=32 |archivedate=7 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

Sport is usually governed by a set of [[regulation of sport|rules]] or [[tradition|customs]], which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring [[goal (sport)|goals]] or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.

Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in [[sports journalism|sport news]]. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with [[spectator sport]] drawing large crowds to [[sport venue]]s, and reaching wider audiences through [[broadcasting of sports events|broadcasting]]. [[Sport betting]] is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.

According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21585012-sportswomen-are-beginning-score-more-commercial-goalsbut-they-still-have-lot-ground |title=Women in sport: Game, sex and match |work=The Economist |date=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's most accessible and practised sport is [[running]], while [[association football]] is its most popular spectator sport.&lt;ref name=wa/&gt;

==Meaning and usage==
===Etymology===
The word "sport" comes from the [[Old French]] ''desport'' meaning "[[leisure]]", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being "anything humans find amusing or entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sport&amp;searchmode=none |title=sport (n.) |accessdate=20 April 2008 |first=Douglas |last=Harper |work=Online Etymological Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged |publisher=G&amp;C Merriam Company |location=Springfield, MA |page=2206 |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roget's defines the noun sport as an "activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms including diversion and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Roget's II: The New Thesaurus, Third Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/sport |year=1995 |isbn=0-618-25414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomenclature===
The singular term "sport" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. "children taking part in sport"), with "sports" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. "football and rugby are the most popular sports in England"). American English uses "sports" for both terms.

===Definition===
{{see also|Game#Definitions}}
[[File:ChessStartingPosition.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The International Olympic Committee recognises some board games as sports including [[chess]].]]
[[File:Showjumping white horse.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Show jumping]], an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport]]
The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by [[SportAccord]], which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including [[association football]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[cycling]], [[tennis]], [[equestrianism|equestrian sports]], and more), and is therefore the ''de facto'' representative of international sport.

SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;
*have an element of competition
*be in no way harmful to any living creature
*not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as [[arena football]])
*not rely on any "luck" element specifically designed into the sport.

They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as [[rugby union|rugby]] or [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]]), primarily mind (such as [[chess]] or [[Go (game)|Go]]), predominantly motorised (such as [[Formula 1]] or [[powerboating]]), primarily co-ordination (such as [[cue sports|billiard sports]]), or primarily animal-supported (such as [[equestrian sport]]).&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Judicial review of 'sport' or 'game' decision begins |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34320201 |date=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.

There has been an increase in the application of the term "sport" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as [[video game]]s, also called [[esports]], especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations. According to [[Council of Europe]], European Sports Charter, article 2.i, {{"'}}Sport' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, [https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016804c9dbb Revised European Sports Charter] (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
There are opposing views on the necessity of [[competition]] as a defining element of a sport, with almost all [[professional sport]] involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or SportAccord.&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity. For instance, the [[Council of Europe]] include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.

In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school [[sports day]]s, although moves like this are often controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Front |first=Rebecca |work=The Guardian |title=A little competition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/school-sport-competitive-children-achievement-ambition |date=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=ParentDish |title=Why parents hate school sports day |last=Scrimgeour |first=Heidi |date=17 June 2011 |url=http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2011/06/17/why-parents-hate-school-sports-day/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their "result" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with "handicaps" or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement. In [[gymnastics]] or [[diving (sport)|diving]] the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.

==History==
{{Main article|History of sport}}
[[File:Greek statue discus thrower 2 century aC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bronze reduction of [[Myron]]'s [[Discobolos]], 2nd century AD.]]

Artifacts and structures suggest [[sport in China]] as early as 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa032301a.htm |title=Sports History in China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient past. Monuments to the [[Pharaoh]]s indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ioa.leeds.ac.uk/1980s/84085.htm |title=Mr Ahmed D.

[[Ancient Persia]]n sports such as the traditional [[Iran]]ian martial art of [[Zourkhaneh]] had a close connection to warfare skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kuwait-info.com/newsnew/NewsDetails1.asp?id=78319&amp;dt=10/13/2006&amp;ntype=World |title=Persian warriors |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326081959/http://www.kuwait-info.com/newsnew/NewsDetails1.asp?id=78319&amp;dt=10%2F13%2F2006&amp;ntype=World |archivedate=26 March 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are [[polo]] and [[jousting]].

[[File:Bruno Senna 2006 Australian Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Motorsport|Motorised sports]] have appeared since the advent of the modern age.]]
[[File:Goście Intel Extreme Masters (8465481816).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Electronic sports]] are a recent development.]]
A wide range of sports were already established by the time of [[Ancient Greece]] and the military culture and the development of sport in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp |title=Ancient Olympic Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought increased [[leisure time]], letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent of [[mass media]] and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes&amp;nbsp;– all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the turn of the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, there has been increasing debate about whether [[transgender]] sportspersons should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Sport and the Law: Historical and Cultural Intersections, p 111, Sarah K. Fields - 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair play==
===Sportsmanship===
{{Main article|Sportsmanship}}
{{See also|Gamesmanship|Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing}}

Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=sportsmanship |publisher=Merriam-Webster |title=Sportsmanship}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fish |first1=Joel |last2=Magee |first2=Susan |year=2003 |title=101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent |publisher=Fireside |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lacey |first=David |date=10 November 2007 |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html |title=It takes a bad loser to become a good winner |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist [[Grantland Rice]], that it's "not that you won or lost but how you played the game", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]]: "The most important thing... is not winning but taking part" are typical expressions of this sentiment.

===Cheating===
{{see also|Match fixing|cheating}}
Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win. Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.

Participants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains. The widespread existence of [[gambling]] on the results of sports fixtures creates a motivation for [[match fixing]], where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win.

===Doping and drugs===
{{main article|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport}}
The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as [[Blood doping|increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means]].

All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.

===Violence===
[[Violence in sports]] involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. [[Rioting]] or [[hooliganism]] by fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests.

==Participation==
===Gender participation===

{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{see also|Women's sports|Women's professional sports|Women's sports in the United States}}
Female participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for [[child development]] and [[physical fitness]]. Despite gains during the last three decades, a gap persists in the enrollment figures between male and female players. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics. Gender balance has been accelerating from a 32% increase in 1973–74 to a 63% increase in 1994–95. Hessel (2000).{{Full citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Youth participation===
{{expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{See also|College sport}}
Youth sport presents children with opportunities for fun, socialisation, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and [[athletic scholarship]]s. Activists for [[education]] and the [[war on drugs]] encourage youth sport as a means to increase [[Participation inequality|educational participation]] and to fight the [[illegal drug trade]]. According to the [[Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus)#Research and education|Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital]], the biggest risk for youth sport is death or serious injury including [[concussion]]. These risks come from running, basketball, association football, volleyball, gridiron, gymnastics, and ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2009/08/04/why-are-more-kids-getting-hurt-in-gym-class/ "Gym class injuries up 150% between 1997 and 2007"], ''Time'', 4 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Youth sport in the US is a $15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gregory |first1=Sean |title=How Kids' Sports Became a $15 Billion Industry |url=http://time.com/4913687/how-kids-sports-became-15-billion-industry/ |accessdate=24 August 2017 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disabled participation===
[[File:David Bizet - Marathon de Paris 2014.jpg|thumb|right|A runner gives a friendly tap on the shoulder to a wheelchair racer during the [[Paris Marathon|''Marathon International de Paris'' (Paris Marathon)]] in 2014.]]
{{see also|Disabled sports}}
'''Disabled sports''' also '''adaptive sports''' or '''parasports''', are sports played by persons with a [[disability]], including [[physical disability|physical]] and [[intellectual disabilities]]. As many of these are based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as ''adapted sports''. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.

===Spectator involvement===
[[File:1906 Athens stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Spectators at the 1906 unofficial Olympic Games]]
{{Main article|Spectator sport}}
The competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of [[spectator sport]].

Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast media including [[radio broadcasting|radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcast. Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or [[pay-per-view]] television broadcast.

It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures. The football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] attracts a global [[television]] audience of hundreds of millions; the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup Finals|final]] alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700&amp;nbsp;million and the [[2011 Cricket World Cup Final]]  attracted an estimated audience of 135&amp;nbsp;million in India alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=135 mn saw World Cup final: TAM |date=10 April 2011 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |newspaper=Hindustan Times |accessdate=1 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803013151/http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |archivedate=3 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the championship game of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the [[Super Bowl]], has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year.&lt;ref name="SB15"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/super-bowl-sets-viewership-record-161138960.html |title=Super Bowl XLIX was the most-viewed television program in U.S. history |publisher=Yahoo Sports |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cbc8df2a-aafd-11e4-81bc-00144feab7de.html |title=Super Bowl most watched television show in US history |work=Financial Times |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and considerations==
===Amateur and professional===
[[File:OHL-Hockey-Plymouth-Whalers-vs-Saginaw-Spirit.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Modern sports have complex [[Regulation of sport|rules]] and are highly organised.]]
{{See also|professional sport|amateur sport}}
Sport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a [[wage]] or [[salary]]). Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called "grassroots sport".&lt;ref name="council"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White Paper"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=European Commission |title=The White Paper on Sport |url=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/white-paper/index_en.htm |accessdate=11 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916202200/http://ec.europa.eu/sport/white-paper/index_en.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of [[spectator sport]] as a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised a high paying [[professional sport]] culture, where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run into millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Sports Illustrated |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/specials/fortunate50-2011/index.html |title=Fortunate 50 2011 |last=Freedman |first=Jonah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of allowing only [[amateur sport]]. The [[Olympic Games]] started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.&lt;ref name=OIdeology&gt;{{cite book |last=Eassom |first=Simon |title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology |year=1994 |location=Ontario |publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies |pages=120–123 |isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1971, Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship,&lt;ref name="InfoPlease"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/olympic-athletes.html |title=Olympic Athletes |publisher=Info Please |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1986, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics,&lt;ref name="InfoPlease"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/22/opinion/greene-olympics-amateurs/ |title=What changed the Olympics forever |publisher=CNN |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exceptions of [[boxing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/13894/olympic-boxing-must-remain-amateur-despite-moves-to-turn-it-professional-states-warren- |title=Olympic boxing must remain amateur despite moves to turn it professional states Warren |publisher=Inside the Games |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njefAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400&amp;dq=only+amateur+boxers+at+olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0jbCDYw8R1&amp;sig=6_-OvLg15u_iGOSTCS6lxm8dedw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwATgKahUKEwi6xNfgiI3GAhVRBNsKHf_HAJ0#v=onepage&amp;q=only%20amateur%20boxers%20at%20olympics&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Boxing |last1=Grasso |first1=John |date=2013 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1529280-olympic-wrestling-is-important-for-pro-wrestlers-and-its-fans |title=Olympic Wrestling Is Important for Pro Wrestling and Its Fans |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=only+amateur+wrestlers+at+olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7VnB9vii1&amp;sig=E0kjCilT-UbvD94prBgV1LIgmSE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwB2oVChMI9NP2pomNxgIVoQrbCh2kbQC_#v=onepage&amp;q=only%20amateur%20wrestlers%20at%20olympics&amp;f=false |title=Boys' Life |date=August 1988 |page=24 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
Technology plays an important part in modern sport. With it being a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport), it is used in others to improve performance. Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.
 
[[Sports science]] is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved [[running shoe]]s or [[competitive swimwear]]. [[Sports engineering]] emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big data to [[wearable technology]].&lt;ref name="Gaining Steam in Sports Technology"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gaining Steam in Sports Technology |url=https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/06/17/mit-steam-sports-technology/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150052/https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/06/17/mit-steam-sports-technology/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2014 |website=Slice of MIT |accessdate=3 January 2015 |ref=Slice of MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants. For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits were banned by [[FINA]], as they were enhancing swimmers' performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/swimming/8161867.stm |title=Hi-tech suits banned from January |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-body-swimsuit-now-banned-professional-swimmers/story?id=9437780 |title=Full Body Swimsuit Now Banned for Professional Swimmers |publisher=ABC News |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official using instant replays to make decisions.

===Politics===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
{{Main article|Politics and sports}}
Sports and politics can influence each other greatly.

[[Benito Mussolini]] used the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], which was held in [[Italy]], to showcase [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWj7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |title=Soccer Vs. the State: Tackling Football and Radical Politics |last1=Kuhn |first1=Gabriel |date=2011 |page=28 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Fascism"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=PA630 |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |last1=Blamires |first1=Cyprian |date=2006 |pages=630–632 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] also used the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Berlin]], and the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], to promote the [[Nazi ideology]] of the superiority of the [[Aryan race]], and inferiority of the Jews and other "[[Untermensch|undesirables]]".&lt;ref name="World Fascism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sociology Sport"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKarC6oX3P8C&amp;pg=PT32&amp;dq=hitler+used+1936+olympics+to+promote+ideology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x6N1Va3pJ-Sa7gaVoICoBA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hitler%20used%201936%20olympics%20to%20promote%20ideology&amp;f=false |title=The Sociology of Sport and Physical Education |last1=Saxena |first1=Anurag |year=2001 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany used the Olympics to give of itself a peaceful image while it was very actively preparing the war.&lt;ref&gt;Kulttuurivihkot 1 2009 Berliinin olympialaiset 1936 Poliittisen viattomuuden menetys Jouko Jokisalo 28-29{{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[apartheid]] was the official policy in [[South Africa]], many sports people, particularly in [[rugby union]], adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00165.x |title=Sport and apartheid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of [[Ireland]], Gaelic sports were connected with [[cultural nationalism]]. Until the mid-20th&amp;nbsp;century a person could have been banned from playing [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], or other sports administered by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) if she/he played or supported [[Association football]], or other games seen to be of [[Great Britain|British]] origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and [[rugby union]] at Gaelic venues. This ban, also known as Rule 42,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fulton |first=Gareth |last2=Bairner |first2=Alan |year=2007 |title=Sport, Space and National Identity in Ireland: The GAA, Croke Park and Rule&amp;nbsp;42. |url= |journal=Space &amp; policy |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=55–74 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in [[Croke Park]] while [[Lansdowne Road]] was redeveloped into [[Aviva Stadium]]. Until recently, under Rule&amp;nbsp;21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.

[[Nationalism]] is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the [[Football War]]. These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.

A very famous case when sport and politics collided was the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli olympic team and killed many of their men. This was known as the [[Munich massacre]].

A study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results. A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5&amp;nbsp;percent. A loss had the opposite effect, and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Ohio State's Football Team Decide Who Wins the White House? |author1=Tyler Cowen |author2=Kevin Grier |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=24 October 2012 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/how_the_presidential_race_between_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_could_be.html |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when [[Washington Redskins]] win their final game before an election, then the incumbent President is more likely to win, and if the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win; this has become known as the [[Redskins Rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2012/11/03/will-redskins-rule-again-determine-outcome-of-presidential-election/ |title=Will Redskins Rule again determine outcome of presidential election? |author=Mike Jones |date=3 November 2012 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2012/10/redskins-rule-mnfs-hirdt-on-intersection-of-football-politics/ |title='Redskins Rule': MNF's Hirdt on intersection of football &amp; politics |work=ESPN Front Row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sports as a means of controlling and subduing populations====
[[Étienne de La Boétie]], in his essay ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their subjects by distracting them.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Do not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy, nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait, than are all these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest feather passed, so to speak, before their mouths. Truly it is a marvelous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy. Plays, farces, spectacles, gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny. By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples, fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes, learned subservience as naïvely, but not so creditably, as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books.&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne de La Boétie]], ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' (1549), Part 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religious views on sports===
The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of [[idolatry]], in which "human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves."&lt;ref name=Watson1&gt;''Sports and Christianity: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives'', Nick J. Watson, ed. (Routledge: 2013), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of "collective pride" and "national self-deification" in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worship.&lt;ref name=Watson1/&gt;

[[Tertullian]] condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting "the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''[[De spectaculis]]'', Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
God has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness. ... Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that. Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them&amp;nbsp;– the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De spectaculis]]'' Chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Periodization''' is the systematic planning of [[physical training|athletic or physical training]].&lt;ref name=Rowbottom&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowbottom|first=David J.|editor1-first=William E.|editor1-last=Garrett|editor2-first=Donald T.|editor2-last=Kirkendall|title=Periodization of Training|year=2000|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780683034219|page=499|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx22TcXodrwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 20, 2013|chapter=Periodization of Training|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx22TcXodrwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA499#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to reach the best possible performance in the most important competition of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]] (1973). Periodization or Peaking at the right time, in: Track Technique 54 (1973), pp.1720- 1724&lt;/ref&gt; It involves progressive cycling of various aspects of a training program during a specific period. Conditioning programs can use periodization to break up the training program into the off-season, preseason, inseason, and the postseason. Periodization divides the year round condition program into phases of training which focus on different goals.

==History==
The roots of periodization come from [[Hans Selye]]’s model, known as the [[General adaptation syndrome]]
The GAS describes three basic stages of response to stress: (a) the Alarm stage, involving the initial shock of the stimulus on the system, (b) the Resistance stage, involving the adaptation to the stimulus by the system, and (c) the Exhaustion stage, in that repairs are inadequate, and a decrease in system function results. The foundation of periodic training is keeping one's body in the resistance stage without ever going into the exhaustion stage.  By adhering to cyclic training the body is given adequate time to recover from significant stress before additional training is undertaken. The response to a new stress is to first respond poorly and the response drops off. For example when the body is first exposed to sun a sunburn might develop. During the resistance stage adaptation improves the response to a higher level, called super compensation, than the previous equilibrium. The example would be that a suntan develops. The exhaustion stage is a continuation of the stimulus at too high a level and the increase gained from adaptation is now offset and all gains are lost. The example would be that wrinkles, spots, or even skin cancer develop. The goal in sports periodization is to reduce the stress at the point where the resistance stage ends so the body has time to recover. In this way the exhaustion stage does not reduce the gains achieved, the body can recover and remain above the original equilibrium point. The next cycle of increased stimulus now improves the response further and the equilibrium point continues to rise after each cycle.

Selye (1957) labeled beneficial stresses as "[[eustress]]" and detrimental stresses as "distress". In athletics, when physical stress is at a healthy level (eustress), an athlete experiences muscular strength and growth, while excessive physical stress (distress) can lead to tissue damage, disease, and death. Periodization is most widely used in resistance program design to avoid over-training and to systematically alternate high loads of training with decreased loading phases to improve components of muscular fitness (e.g. strength, strength-speed, and strength-endurance). The Selye-cycles are similar to the "micro cycles" used at later times.

[[Russia]]n [[physiologist]] [[Leo Matveyev]] and Romanian sport scientist [[Tudor Bompa]] expanded and further organized the periodization model. Matveyev has been regarded as the father of modern periodization. He analysed the results of the Soviet athletes of the 1952 and 1956 summer Olympics and compared successful and not so successful athletes and their training schedules. From these training plans periodized schedules were developed for the 1960 Olympics. With the success of the Soviet athletes, Matveyev's plans were spread all over the Eastern  Bloc in their annual coordination meetings. From there it also spread to Romania, where [[Tudor Bompa]] developed the system further. In the 1968 it was used for the first time in the GDR and in 1972 in West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]. Nachwort zum neusten Stand der Literatur zur Periodisierung, in: L. P. MATWEJEW: Periodisierung des sportlichen Trainings. Berlin: Bartels &amp; Wernitz 1972, 201 - 231 (2. Aufl. 1978). Also basis for the French translation: Postface.La base de l'entraînement.Paris: Vigot 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Soviet Union, periodization started to become modified. While Matveyev followed Pavlov{{which|date=May 2016}} and assumed that everybody should use the same periodization, individualised systems, using more and more biological data, were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. PLATONOV: General theory of training of athletes in Olympic sports. Kiew: Olympic Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic training systems typically divide time up into three types of cycles: microcycle, mesocycle, and macrocycle. The microcycle is generally up to 7 days. The mesocycle may be anywhere from 2 weeks to a few months, but is typically a month. A macrocycle refers to the overall training period, usually representing a year or two. There are longer cycles as well for the Olympian, being 4 or 8 years, and the career plan which is usually only considered for Olympians and professional athletes.

==Theory of planning==
Training should be organized and planned in advance of a competition or performance.
It should consider the [[sportsperson|athlete]]’s potential, his/her performance in tests or [[competition]], and calendar of competition. It has to be simple, suggestive, and above all flexible as its content can be modified to meet the athletes rate of progress.

===The macrocycle===
A [[macrocycle]] is an annual plan that works towards peaking for the goal competition of the year. There are three phases in the macrocycle: preparation, competitive, and transition.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization&gt;{{cite web|title=Periodisation in fencing|url=http://zfw-fencing.co.uk/articles/periodisation-fencing|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire preparation phase should be around 2/3 to 3/4 of the macrocycle. The preparation phase is further broken up into general and specific preparation of which general preparation takes over half. An example of general preparation would be building an [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic base]] for an [[Endurance sports|endurance athlete]] such as running on a [[treadmill]] and learning any rules or regulations that would be required such as proper [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] stroke as not to be disqualified. An example of specific preparation would be to work on the proper form to be more efficient and to work more on the final format of the sport, which is to move from the treadmill to the [[Road surface|pavement]].

The competitive phase can be several competitions, but they lead up to the main competition with specific tests. Testing might include any of the following: performance level, new shoes or gear, a new race tactic might be employed, pre-race meals, ways to reduce [[anxiety]] before a race, or the length needed for the taper. When the pre-competitions are of a higher priority there is a definite taper stage while lower priority might simply be integrated in as training. The competitive phase ends with the taper and the competition.

The transition phase is important for [[Psychology|psychological]] reasons, a year of training means a vacation is in order. A typical [[wikt:weekend warrior|weekend warrior]] might take three months while a professional athlete might take as little as two weeks.

===The mesocycle===
A mesocycle represents a phase of training with a duration of between 2 – 6 weeks or microcycles, but this can depend on the sporting discipline.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization/&gt; A mesocycle can also be defined as a number of continuous weeks where the training program emphasize the same type of physical adaptations, for example muscle mass and anaerobic capacity. During the preparatory phase, a mesocycle commonly consists of 4 – 6 micro-cycles, while during the competitive phase it will usually consist of 2 – 4 micro-cycles depending on the competition’s [[calendar]].

The goal of the plan is to fit the mesocycles into the overall plan timeline-wise to make each mesocycle end on one of the phases and then to determine the [[workload]] and type of work of each cycle based on where in the overall plan the given mesocycle falls. The goal in mind is to make sure the body peaks for the high priority competitions by improving each cycle along the way.

===The microcycle===
A microcycle is typically a week because of the difficulty in developing a training plan that does not align itself with the weekly calendar. Each microcycle is planned based on where it is in the overall macrocycle.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization/&gt;

A micro-cycle is also defined as a number of training sessions, built around a given combination of acute program variables, which include progression as well as alternating effort (heavy vs. light days). The length of the micro-cycle should correspond to the number of workouts - empirically often 4-16 workouts - it takes for the athlete or fitness client to adapt to the training program. When the athlete or fitness client has adapted to the program and no longer makes progress, a change to one or more program variables should be made.

==The annual plan==
The annual plan is important in that it directs and guides performance training over a year. It is based on the concept of [[periodization]] and the principles of training. The objective of training is to reach a high level of performance (peak performance) and an athlete has to develop skills, biomotor abilities and psychological traits in a methodical manner.

===Preparatory phase===
This phase consists of the general preparation and specific preparation. Usually which can be subdivided into three different phases. One should always remember that this is a base creation phase with the objective to attain the previous training state, and the longest period of periodization must be devoted towards the preparatory period.
The performance depends on preparatory period, and is divided into '''three''' phases:

'''Phase  I)''' To regain previous training 
*Low volume, but maintaining high intensity is there.
*competitions.

'''Phase II)''' Low training volume &amp; High training load to develop the factors needed for performance.
*works on specific exercise. 
'''Phase III)''' Decrease in the intensity of load and increase in tactical training and aim at improving tactical under competition condition.

===Competitive phase===
This phase may contain a few main competitions each containing a pre-competitive and a main competition. Within the main competition, an uploading phase and a special preparatory phase may be included. This also includes hypertropthy

===Transition phase===
This phase is used to facilitate psychological rest, relaxation and biological regeneration as well as to maintain an acceptable level of general physical preparation. This phase lasts 3–4 weeks (perhaps longer) but should not exceed five weeks under normal conditions and may be sports specific. It allows the body to fully regenerate so that it is prepared for the next discipline.
*there is no competition in this phase.

===Opposition to Periodization===
A review published in the journal 'sports medicine' in 2017 has questioned the validity of the use of traditional models of periodization in sport. This is largely due to the over simplified assumptions put forward in the early development of periodization theory that are not always transferable to the psyco-biological effects of various training methods used in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s40279-017-0823-y| pmid=29189930| pmc=5856877|title = Periodization Theory: Confronting an Inconvenient Truth| journal=Sports Medicine| volume=48| issue=4| pages=753–764|year = 2018|last1 = Kiely|first1 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactical Periodization ==

For many years, football training and its planning has been (and still is) characterised by fragmented thinking of which has perhaps been attributed to the success of such an approach in individual sports. The emphasis of planning and improvement was mainly in regards to the physical attributes of strength, speed and endurance.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalhal, C. (2014). ‘Soccer: Developing A Know-how’,  Prime Books&lt;/ref&gt; Furtheremore, whether it be the undulating model, the reverse linear model or the traditional periodization framework, one of the underpinning assumptions is that it would be best to segregate the programme into distinct training blocks in a sequential hierarchy i.e. a training block to build endurance before speed and strength before power. This is claimed to be based on the ‘science of periodization’. However, Kiely,&lt;ref&gt;Kiely, J. (2010). ‘Periodization, planning, prediction: And why the future ain’t what it used to be!’, UKA, 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the proof on which this is all based on is flawed because the studies used to build this proof have only ‘compared training interventions with no training variation to those with degrees of variation’  but did not offer any insight ‘into how that variation is best scheduled and organised’ (Kiely, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;4). So although it is commonly agreed that training variation is an important design feature which needs to be integrated into the training plan, there is ‘little or no supporting evidence’ which proves that the segregation of the program into distinct training blocks or that there should be sequential hierarchy of how this should be done is in fact advantageous.

Many authors such as Garganta, Maia, &amp; Marque,&lt;ref&gt;Garganta, J., Maia, J. &amp; Marques, A. (1996). ‘Acerca da investigação dos factores de rendimento em futebol’, Revista paulista de educação física, São Paulo, 10, (2), 146-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Oliviera,&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira, G.J. (1991). ‘Especificidade, o pós-futebol do pré-futebol. Um factor condicionante do alto rendimento desportivo. In Oliveira, R. (2014) ‘Tactical periodization: The secrets of soccer most effective training methodology’.&lt;/ref&gt; Castelo,&lt;ref&gt;Castelo, J. (2000). ‘Formação continua. O treinador de futebol. Exercícios de treino no futebol’, Escola superior de desporto de Rio Maior. IPS.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gaiteiro &lt;ref&gt;Gaiteiro, B. (2006). ‘A cienca oculta do sucesso! Mourinho aos olhos da cienca’. In Tamarit, X. (2014). ‘What is tactical periodization?’ Bennion Kearny Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued in regards to the indivisibility of the 4 components which make up a football performance...technical, tactical, physical and mental. This complexity makes football a multidimensional phenomenon which cannot be simply reduced to the sum of its parts. Is defending more important than attacking or vice versa? This question cannot be answered as football needs to be understood as a whole. As highlighted by Tamarit,&lt;ref&gt;Tamarit, X. (2014). ‘What is tactical periodization?’  Bennion Kearny Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; football is a tactical game where players are constantly required to make decisions in response to specific situations. So football needs to be viewed as a tactical game which encompasses with it the physical, technical and mental aspects required for positive performances.  This is the foundation upon which Victor Frade developed a training methodology known as tactical periodisation which emphasises the development of the tactical dimension. Therefore, any physical, technical or mental development must always have a tactical intention. In other words, although the ability to run for 90 minutes may seem vital to play the game, knowing when, where and how to run is much more important.

'''Sportsmanship''' is an aspiration or ethos that a [[sport]] or activity will be enjoyed for its own sake, with proper consideration for [[wikt:fairness|fairness]], [[ethics]], [[respect]], and a sense of [[fellow]]ship with one's competitors. A "sore loser" refers to one who does not take defeat well, whereas a "good sport" means being a "good winner" as well as being a "good loser"&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Joel Fish and Susan Magee, ''101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent'', p. 168. Fireside, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lacey, [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html "It takes a bad loser to become a good winner."] ''The Guardian'', November 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (someone who shows courtesy towards another in a sports game).

== Analysis ==

Sportsmanship can be conceptualized as an enduring and relatively stable characteristic or disposition such that individuals differ in the way they are generally expected to behave in sports situations. In general, sportsmanship refers to virtues such as fairness, self-control, courage, and persistence,&lt;ref name="Shields &amp; Bredemeier, 1995"&gt;Shields &amp; Bredemeier, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been associated with interpersonal concepts of treating others and being treated fairly, maintaining self-control if dealing with others, and respect for both authority and opponents. Sportsmanship is also looked at as being the way one 
reacts to a sport/game/player.

The four elements of sportsmanship are often shown being good form, the will to win, equity and fairness. All four elements are critical and a balance must be found among all four for true sportsmanship to be illustrated.&lt;ref name="abad" /&gt; These elements may also cause conflict, as a person may desire to win more than play in equity and fairness and thus resulting in a clash within the aspects of sportsmanship. This will cause problems as the person believes they are being a good sportsman, but they are defeating the purpose of this idea as they are ignoring two key components of being sportsman like. When athletes become too self-centred, the idea of sportsmanship is dismissed.&lt;ref name="ahola"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07303084.2006.10597902|title =Promoting Sportsmanship in Youth Sports|last1 = Goldstein |first1=Jay|last2=Iso-Ahola |first2 = Seppo|date = 2006|journal =Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|doi = 10.1080/07303084.2006.10597902|issue = 7|volume = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's sporting culture, in particular the base of elite sport, places great importance on the idea of competition and winning and thus sportsmanship takes a back seat as a result.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt; In most, if not all sports, sportsmen at the elite level make the standards on sportsmanship and no matter whether they like it or not, they are seen as leaders and role models in society.&lt;ref name="clifford"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ken |last=Clifford |journal=Newcastle Herald |date=2013 |title=Sport's also about sportsmanship |volume=1 |issue=33 |url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Sport%27s+also+about+sportsmanship&amp;rft.jtitle=Newcastle+Herald&amp;rft.au=KEN+CLIFFORD&amp;rft.date=2013-12-10&amp;rft.pub=Fairfax+Digital&amp;rft.issn=0727-9825&amp;rft.spage=33&amp;rft.externalDocID=3149922301&amp;paramdict=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since every sport is rule driven, the most common offence of bad sportsmanship is the act of cheating or breaking the rules to gain an unfair advantage this is called [[unsportsmanlike conduct]].&lt;ref name="feez"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00948705.1986.9714436|title = Sportsmanship|last = Feezell|first = Randolph|date = 1986|journal = Journal of the Philosophy of Sport|doi = 10.1080/00948705.1986.9714436|issue = 1|volume = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after losing a game or contest is often called a "sore loser", while a competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after winning is typically called a "bad winner". Sore loser behavior includes blaming others for the loss, not accepting responsibility for personal actions that contributed to the defeat, reacting to the loss in an immature or improper fashion, [[rationalization (psychology)|making excuses]] for the defeat, and citing unfavorable conditions or other petty issues as reasons for the defeat.&lt;ref&gt;"MJD", [https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/If-he-s-going-to-lose-Bill-Belichick-would-rath?urn=nfl,64971 "If he's going to lose, Bill Belichick would rather be elsewhere"]. Yahoo Sports, February 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E-releases, [http://www.ereleases.com/prfuel/super-winners-and-losers/ "Super Winners and Losers"] ("The Patriots' coach was eviscerated by sports pundits for leaving the field before the game was actually finished.")&lt;/ref&gt; A bad winner acts in a shallow fashion after his or her victory, such as by gloating about his or her win, rubbing the win in the face(s) of the opponent(s), and lowering the opponent(s)'s [[self-esteem]] by constantly reminding the opponent(s) of "poor" performance in comparison (even if the opponent(s) competed well). Not showing respect to the other team is considered to being a bad sportsman and could lead to demoralising effects; as Leslie Howe describes: "If a pitcher in baseball decides to pitch not to his maximum ability suggest that the batter is not at an adequate level, [it] could lead to the batter to have low self-confidence or worth."&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00948705.2004.9714661|title =Gamesmanship|last = Howe|first = Leslie|date = 2008|journal = Journal of the Philosophy of Sport|doi = 10.1080/00948705.2004.9714661|issue = 2|volume = 31 |pp=212–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six different categories relating to sportsmanship: the elements of sports, the elements of sportsmanship, clarifications, conflicts, balance and irreducibility.&lt;ref name="abad" /&gt; All six of these characterize a person with good sportsmanship. Even though there is some affinity between some of the categories, they are distinct elements.&lt;ref name="abad"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/full/10.1080/17511320903365227#abstract|title = Sportsmanship|last = Abad|first = Diana|date = 2010|journal = Sport, Ethics and Philosophy|doi = 10.1080/17511320903365227|issue = 1|volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In essence, play has for its directed and immediate end joy, pleasure, and delights and which is dominated by a spirit of moderation and generosity. Athletics, on the other hand, is essentially a competitive activity, which has for its end victory in the contest and which is characterized of dedication, sacrifice and intensity." (Feelezz, 1896, pp.&amp;nbsp;3) Hence, the virtues of a player are radically different from the virtues of an athlete. (Feelezz, 1896, pp.&amp;nbsp;3). When talking about misunderstanding sportsmanship, Rudd and Stoll (2013) provide an example from 1995, a U.S. high school athletic league banned the post-game handshake that was a part of sports such as football and basketball. The handshaking was banned because of fights that were ensuing after the handshake.(pp.&amp;nbsp;41) Most players are influenced by the leaders around them such as coaches and older players, ''if there are coaches and administrators who don't understand sportsmanship, then what about the players?''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1080/07303084.1998.10605629|title = Understanding Sportsmanship|last = Rudd; Stoll|first = Andrew; Sharon K|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|p=41|doi = 10.1080/07303084.1998.10605629|volume = 69|issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Sportmanship sculpture.jpg|thumb|A moment of sportmanship when [[John Landy]] helped [[Ron Clarke]] get up after he had fallen.]]

There are various ways that sportsmanship is practiced in different sports. Being a good sport often includes treating others as you would also like to be treated, cheer for good plays (even if it is made by the opposition), accept responsibility for your mistakes, and keep your perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachel|first1=Beverly|title=Scoring big: It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play|journal=Current Health 2, a Weekly Reader Publication|date=2009|volume=35|issue=7|pages=16–20|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Scoring+big%3A+it%27s+not+whether+you+win+or+lose%2C+it%27s+how+you+play&amp;rft.jtitle=Current+Health+2%2C+a+Weekly+Reader+publication&amp;rft.au=Bachel%2C+Beverly&amp;rft.date=2009-03-01&amp;rft.pub=Weekly+Reader+Corp&amp;rft.issn=0163-156X&amp;rft.volume=35&amp;rft.issue=7&amp;rft.spage=16&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=194620867&amp;paramdict=en-US|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of treating others how you would like to be treated would include being respectful and polite to other team members and the opposition because in return you would also like to be treated the same way.&lt;ref name="clifford" /&gt; Cheer for good plays could include if in netball a player of the opposition made a good lead for the ball, which then resulted in a goal, everyone would either clap or make a supportive comment to acknowledge that what the player did was very well done. To accept responsibility for your mistakes will entail not placing the blame on other people.&lt;ref name="feez" /&gt;

Some popular examples of good sportsmanship include shaking hands, help an opponent who may have fallen over, encourage everyone, cheer, clap or hi-five, and be respectful to everyone including teammates, the opposition, parents and officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Josephson|first1=Michael|title=Ethics and sportsmanship (part I)|url=https://charactercounts.org/sports/Olympic/olympic-report-ethicssportsmanship.htm|website=Pursuing Victory with Honor|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly it is often encouraged and said regarding sportsmanship that "It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game."&lt;ref name="feez" /&gt;

Sportsmanship can be manifested in different ways depending on the game itself or the culture of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/concepts-of-sportsmanship-vary-across-cultures|title=Concepts of Sportsmanship Vary Across Cultures|first=Dustin|last=Petzold|date=|website=bigthink.com|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing factors ==

Sportsmanship can be affected by a few contributing factors such as the players' values and attitudes towards the sport and also the professional role models that are shown to the public. Role models in sport are expected to act in a moral and respectful way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Carwyn|title=Drunken role models: Rescuing our sporting exemplars|journal=Sport, Ethics and Philosophy|date=2011|volume=5|issue=4|pages=414–432|doi=10.1080/17511321.2011.561254}}&lt;/ref&gt; When elite sporting role models do not encourage sportsmanship this can also encourage people in society to act in similar ways to the athletes that they look up to and idolize. For example, if an individual looked up to an athlete who was drinking excessively, they may see this as acceptable behavior.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt; The direct correlation between sportsmanship and leadership is also considered to be another contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=M. S.|title=Creating an environment for sportsmanship outcomes: A systems perspective|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=2006|volume=77|issue=7|pages=1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a positive environment in your sporting team will therefore create good sportsmanship from the individuals. Having a positive leadership by the captains, coaches and supporters would then encourage a positive sporting environment.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt;

A '''team sport''' includes any [[sport]] which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing [[sports team|teams]] which compete to win. Examples are [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[water polo]], [[handball]], [[lacrosse]], [[cricket]], [[baseball]], and the various forms of [[football]] and [[hockey]].

==Overview==
Team sports are practiced between opposing teams, where the players interact directly and simultaneously between them to achieve an objective. The objective generally involves teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points.

The meaning of a "team sport" has been disputed in recent years. Some types of sports have different objectives or rules than "traditional" team sports. These types of team sports do not involve teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar item in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points. For example, [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[sailing]], [[dragon boat racing]], and [[track and field]] among others can also be considered team sports.{{Sfn|Baofu|2014|p=202}}
In other types of team sports, there may not be an opposing team or point scoring, for example, [[mountaineering]]. Instead of points scored against an opposing team, the relative difficulty of the climb or walk is the measure of the achievement. In some sports where participants are entered by a team, they do not only compete against members of other teams but also against each other for points towards championship standings. For example, [[motorsport]], particularly [[Formula One]]. In [[Cycling team|cycling]] however, team members whilst still in competition with each other, will also work towards assisting one, usually a specialist, member of the team to the highest possible finishing position. This process is known as [[team orders]] and although previously accepted was banned in Formula One&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paddocktalk.com/news/html/modules/ew_filemanager/07images/f1/fia/033007_2008_F1_SPORTING_REGULATIONS.pdf|title=2008 FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 2002 and 2010. After a controversy involving [[team orders at the 2010 German Grand Prix]] however, the regulation was removed as of the {{f1|2011}} season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/9A195FD4A47DA4E1C12577F8004AA63E/$FILE/1-2011%20SPORTING%20REGULATIONS%2010-12-2010.pdf|title=2010 FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years, the popularity of team sport has continued to grow, positively influencing not just athletes, but also fans, local and national economies. All over the world, the impact of team sport can be seen as professional athletes live out their dreams while serving as role models, youth athletes develop life skills and follow in the footsteps of their role models, fans bond over the love of their teams while supporting their economies with their support.

==History==
{{Main|History of sport}}

Traces of [[sprint (running)|sprint]]ing as a team sport extend back several thousand years - as evidenced in images in the cave in [[Lascaux]] in France which depict people running after animals or ''vice versa''; this was an issue of survival of the fittest.{{Sfn|Barber|2006|p= 25}}
[[File:Pankratiasten in fight copy of greek statue 3 century bC.jpg|right|thumb|Ancient Greek wrestlers]]
[[File:WadiSuraHumans.jpg|right|thumb|Rock paintings of humans in the cave of swimmers]]
Organized athletics in Greece traditionally date back to 776 BC, with ongoing activity recorded up to 393 BC. These [[ancient Olympic Games]] tested warrior skills and consisted of [[running]], [[jumping]] or leaping, [[wrestling]] (combat sport), and [[javelin throw]].{{Sfn|Barber|2006|p=26}} In the [[Bayankhongor Province]] of [[Mongolia]], Neolithic-era cave paintings dating to 7000 BC depict a wrestling match surrounded by crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20110317/PC20/303179904 |last= Hartsell|first= Jeff|title= Wrestling 'in our blood|publisher= Bulldogs' Luvsandor |accessdate= 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prehistoric]] cave-paintings in [[Japan]] show a sport similar to [[sumo]] wrestling.&lt;ref name="Crego2003"&gt;{{cite book|author= Robert Crego|title= Sports and Games of the 18th and 19th Centuries|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XCl1c2yy5ooC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate= 25 October 2015|year= 2003|publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn= 978-0-313-31610-4|pages= 34–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wadi Sura]], near [[Gilf Kebir]] in [[Libya]], a [[Neolithic]] rock painting in the [[cave of swimmers]] shows evidence of [[human swimming|swimming]] and [[archery]] being practiced around 6000 BC.&lt;ref name="Vörös2007"&gt;{{cite book|author= Győző Vörös|title= Egyptian Temple Architecture: 100 Years of Hungarian Excavations in Egypt, 1907– 2007|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=StEyE9jkMHEC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate= 25 October 2015|year= 2007|publisher= [[American Univ in Cairo Press]]|isbn= 978-963-662-084-4|pages= 39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "athlete", according to mythology, derives from the name of [[Aethlius]],{{cn|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;
Compare:
{{OEtymD|athlete|accessdate=2018-05-30}} "athlete (n.) early 15c., from Latin ''athleta'' 'a wrestler, athlete, combatant in public games,' from Greek ''athletes'' 'prizefighter, contestant in the games,' agent noun from ''athlein'' 'to contest for a prize,' related to ''athlos'' 'a contest' and ''athlon'' 'a prize,' which is of unknown origin."
&lt;/ref&gt;
the mythological first King of [[Elis]] (the location of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]) in Greece. The practice of young athletes carrying flaming torches is also traced{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} to the King of Elis, under whose supervision the games took place; some historians{{which?|date=May 2018}} regard this as the first record of Olympic sprint racing. Before the start of the races gods were invoked{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} by offerings of mostly fruits and vegetables. The winner of the race was crowned with a wreath of olive or [[Laurel wreath|laurel]] and [[celery]] sticks were offered{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} as a trophy. In subsequent years monetary attractions were introduced as prize money. However, the practice of offering [[celery sticks]] is still in vogue in the 100&amp;nbsp;m sprint in the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;

The present-day pattern of [[Olympic Games]] resembles the practice followed in ancient times. Sprint was the coveted event. The 200&amp;nbsp;m sprint is known in [[Greek language|Greek]] as "short foot race". The 400&amp;nbsp;m race is equivalent to two ''stades'' and called ''diaulos'' in Greek.{{Sfn|Barber|2006|p=26}}

==Olympic team sports==
Seven team sports are currently on the program of the [[Summer Olympics]].  [[Cricket]]'s inclusion in the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] depends on the decision of the [[International Cricket Council]] and its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5joc4rmEsPr3msn6leaEdvZ1-SnKA |title=Cricket edges closer to Olympic roster |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815194518/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5joc4rmEsPr3msn6leaEdvZ1-SnKA |archivedate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics|cricket tournament]] formed part of the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]] in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], although only one match was played, between teams representing Great Britain and France. However, the British team was effectively a club touring side and the French players were drawn partly from expatriates living in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cricket at the 1900 Paris Summer Games|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1900/CRI/|website=sports-reference.com|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ice hockey]] and [[curling]] are team sports at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] together with the [[Bobsleigh at the Winter Olympics|bobsleigh]] competition where the men's event has classes for both two-man and four-man sleds, but the women's class is restricted to two persons only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BOBSLEIGH|url=http://www.olympic.org/bobsleigh|publisher=International Olympic Committee|year=2015|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Olympic team sports include competitions for both men and women.

'''Tetsuro Kiyooka''' (清岡 哲朗, ''Kiyooka Tetsuro'', July 30, 1970) is a [[Japan]]ese [[entrepreneur]], [[programmer]] and [[FIFA]] Players' Agent ([[Sports agent]]). He holds [[Permanent residency in Canada]], and his ancestors are the [[Shizoku]] in [[Tosa Province]], [[Japan]] as well as a distant relative of [[Roy Kiyooka]].

== Sports agent ==
Kiyooka firmly believed that the [[Japan national football team]] needed players who had experiences playing for clubs in European leagues to develop the national team. In 2006, he passed the FIFA Players' Agent exam and registered with [[The Football Association]] ([[England]]), the [[Royal Dutch Football Association]] ([[Netherlands]]) and the [[Japan Football Association]] as an official agent. After that, he represented top Japanese players such as [[Keisuke Honda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keisuke Honda to play for Dutch side VVV Venlo|url=https://int.soccerway.com/news/2008/January/16/keisuke-honda-to-play-for-dutch-side-vvv-venlo/|website=soccerway.com|publisher=SOCCERWAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keisuke Honda is happy to play for VVV-Venlo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Y9CZoUins&amp;feature=youtu.be|website=youtube.com|publisher=Venlo TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maya Yoshida]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southampton to sign Japan defender, Maya Yoshida|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton/9509866/Southampton-to-sign-Japan-defender-from-Maya-Yoshida-from-Dutch-Eredivisie-club-VVV-Venlo.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=The Telegraph UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led them to the football clubs in European leagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/04/03/soccer/venlo-chief-eyes-new-japanese-talent/ Venlo chief eyes new Japanese talent], The Japan Times, 3 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byfarthegreatestteam.com/posts/maya-yoshida-japan-success-story/ Maya Yoshida: Japan’s Premier League Success Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Japan Pro-Footballers Association (JPFA) ==
In 2009, Kiyooka was designated as a [[chief operating officer]] of the [[Japan Pro-Footballers Association]] (JPFA) by [[Toshiya Fujita]], a [[chairman]] of the board. He repealed the unfair transfer regulations between the clubs of [[J.League]] and the professional players in 2009 and formed the organization as a trade union in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=FIFPro|title=Japanese association JPFA will form a union|url=https://www.fifpro.org/news/japanese-association-jpfa-will-form-a-union/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he represented the players of the [[Japan national football team]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan national team threatens boycott|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/japan-national-team-threatens-boycott-2165329.html|website=independent.co.uk|publisher=INDEPENDENT UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; to protect their rights and payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFA President, Ogura dares players to boycott|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2010/12/22/soccer/ogura-dares-players-to-boycott/|website=japantimes.co.jp|publisher=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Japan Times|title=Players make cash demand to JFA|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2010/12/21/soccer/j-league/players-make-cash-demand-to-jfa/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Web development  ==
In 2005, Kiyooka collaborated with [[NTT Communications]] to create the football site called Nippon World Soccer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NTT Communications 日本ワールドサッカーサービス開始|url=https://www.ntt.com/release/2005NEWS/0005/0520.html|website=ntt.com|publisher=NTT Communications (in Japanese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the mobile internet services ([[i-mode]], [[EZweb]]) in Japan. The mobile football site acquired over one million users a month in 2006 and became the biggest football mobile site in Japan at that time.

'''The Y Plan''' is an exercise programme devised by [[Lesley Mowbray]] and [[Jill Gaskell]] for the London [[YMCA]], and very popular in United Kingdom during the 1990s. Choreographed by [Jane S. Linter] Emphasising short but regular workouts without any specialist equipment, the first book based on the programme, titled ''The Y Plan'', was published in 1990. Television presenter [[Anthea Turner]] was the public face of The Y Plan, appearing alongside the creators in numerous books, videos and magazine features. 
A further video was made, entitled Y-Plan countdown, in which one does an exercise regime of 36 days, with 3 levels of difficulty.

'''World Fit''' is a program of the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC), and the [[United States]] Olympians and [[Paralympians]] Association (USOP)&lt;ref&gt;http://usparalympics.org/&lt;/ref&gt; to promote [[physical fitness]] and the [[Olympic Games]] ideals to school children through kids fitness programs, school fitness programs, and [[childhood obesity]] programs.  World Fit is part of the world's largest obesity-prevention network, EPODE International Network&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epode-international-network.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
World Fit was founded by three Olympians:
* [[Gary Hall Sr.]], M.D., World Fit Executive Director,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldfit.org/about/foundation/&lt;/ref&gt; an Olympic swimmer, silver medals, 1968 and 1972 games; bronze medal, 1976 games, founder of [[The Race Club]], a renowned [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] club known for specific swimming techniques training for [[Olympic games]] swimmers with its swimming training program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theraceclub.net/swimming-training-program/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anne Cribbs, an Olympic swimmer. Gold medal, 1960 Olympic games.
* [[Dick Fosbury]], an Olympic track and field athlete won a gold medal, 1968 games. His signature high jump move would become known as the “[[Fosbury Flop]].”

World Fit&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldfit.org/&lt;/ref&gt; promotes youth fitness programs and Olympic ideals under the [[Olympic Charter]] to [[middle school]] fitness programs for children by having [[Olympic Games]] athletes and [[Paralympic athlete]]s act as [[Role model]]s for fitness and encouraging children to embrace a lifetime of fitness.

United States Olympic athletes and Paralympic athletes adopt schools for life, promote a culture of health and fitness for children, inspire students about the importance of health &amp; fitness, and promote the Olympic values of perseverance, respect and fair play.

Approximately 7,000 USA Olympians and Paralympians are recruited by the USOP to adopt at least one school, and speak annually to its students about the importance of physical fitness activities &amp; a healthier lifestyle, and promote school [[Walking]] programs.

The Olympic athletes and Paralympic athletes encourage the students to participate in the World Fit Walk, which is held each spring on the school’s campus, where the students, teachers and family walk daily for 6 weeks.

==World Fit Kids School Fitness Programs==
The World Fit Program includes the following components for Kids School Fitness Programs:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldfit.org/about/program/&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Fit School Adoption==
Each Olympic athlete or Paralympic athlete adopts up to three schools in the region where he or she lives, and adopts the schools for life, for kids school fitness programs.

==The World Fit Walk==
A daily school [[fitwalking]] program, where the numbers of miles walked, jogged, or run are logged each day and totaled for the kids fitness programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldfit.org/world-fit-walk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The World Fit Curriculum==
Prepared lessons are offered by the World Fit organization to school teachers on the topics of:
* Olympic values of perseverance, hard work, fair play, and respect.
* [[Geography]] and [[history]] lessons about the Olympic cities
* Information about each of the [[Olympic sports]].

==Online Community==
An on-line social media community that facilitates the involvement of USA Olympians, families and students in a project of physical education.

==World Fit Awards==
Students who reach a minimum of 10 miles per week receive a certificate for their achievement signed by the Olympic athlete or Paralympic athlete, the [[Athletic Director]], and the [[Principal (school)|Principal]] of the school.

A '''world championship''' is generally an [[international]] [[sport]]s competition open to elite competitors from around the world, representing their nations, and winning such an event will be considered the highest or near highest achievement in the sport or contest.

==Overview==
The title is usually awarded through a combination of specific contests or, less commonly, [[ranking]] systems (e.g. the [[ICC Test Championship]]), or a combination of the two (e.g. [[World Triathlon Championships]] in [[Triathlon]]). This determines a 'world champion', who or which is commonly considered the best nation, team, individual (or other entity) in the world in a particular field, although the vagaries of sport ensure that the competitor recognised at the best in an event is not always the 'world champion' (see [[Underdog (term)|Underdog]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Certain sports do not have a world championship. Instead, they may organise a [[world cup competition]], or they may organize both, for example cycling ([[UCI World Championships]] and [[UCI World Cups]])). Often, the use of the term cup or championship in this sense is just a choice of words. Some sports have multiple champions because of multiple organizations, such as boxing, mixed martial arts and wrestling.

Certain sports do not have a world championship or a world cup as such, but may have one or several world champions. Professional [[boxing]], for example, has several world champions at [[Boxing weight classes|different weights]], but each one of them is decided by a "title fight", not a tournament.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A certain number of sports hold world championships or world cups which are overshadowed, in terms of prestige, by the same events in the [[Olympic Games]], the most prestigious multi-sports event.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Still other sports may or may not have a true world championship but may designate the winners of a domestic competition to be "world champions." This is especially true of the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]]; world cups and championships exist in all of the major sports, but the domestic U.S. and Canadian leagues are generally nicknamed as the world ''[[professional sports|professional]]'' championships or the equivalent of a world ''club'' championship. (In [[American football]], although an [[IFAF World Championship]] exists, the United States is so far above and beyond the other nations it faces that the winner of the U.S.-based [[Super Bowl]], a competition limited to the 32 teams in the [[National Football League]], is commonly nicknamed as the world champion by the players, the press and fans alike; the NFL itself explicitly marketed the contest as a world championship in its first iterations.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans |first=Simon |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/03/us-nfl-superbowl-world-idUSTRE71295820110203 |title=Super Bowl contenders happy with world champions title |agency=Reuters |date= February 3, 2011|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, certain professional sports do not have a world championship or world cup, but rather hold a series of events recognised as the elite level in their field (e.g. [[tennis]] has a series of four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] events recognised as the pinnacle of the game, in addition to key team events, world tour finals and the Olympic Games, though each year [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] designates a [[ITF World Champions|World Champion]] based on performances throughout the year).

This table includes medals for both individual and team events. "Best" in this list is considered to be the sportsperson who is on top of their sport's [[medal table]], rather than sportsperson with most overall medals. Currently active competitors are highlighted in pale green. ''Italics'' indicates more than one title achieved in a single year.

'''Wrestling headgear''' is protection that a person wears over the ears and chin during [[Amateur wrestling|wrestling]] matches.

==Description==
The main purpose of headgear is to protect the ears of the wrestler, not really the head as the name implies. Thus, wrestling headgear equipment are also simply called '''ear guards''' or '''ear protectors'''. The headgear often covers the ears of the wearer, has two straps that go behind the head, two that go over the front and top part of the head, and one strap that goes under the chin (in some cases the strap will go on the chin). Headgear is often made of durable plastic, [[velcro]], and button snaps.

==Reason==
Wrestling headgear is made to protect the wearer from long term injury. The constant bashing and beating on a wrestler's ears that comes from not wearing headgear can cause blood vessels in the ears to burst. These types of injuries do not cause any external bleeding; however incredibly painful sacs of blood will start to develop in the ears often resulting in permanent disfiguration of the ears. This condition is known as [[cauliflower ear]]. Treatment of cauliflower ear requires the wrestler see a doctor who will then drain the blood out of the ear via a needle. A wrestler may need to see a plastic surgeon to repair and/or treat a Cauliflower ear.

==Mandatory or optional use==
Headgear is required to be worn in [[Collegiate wrestling|high school and college wrestling]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, if a wrestler has face problems, like a history of broken noses or wrestles with stitches on the face, he or she may also have the option of wearing a face mask attached to the headgear. In the USA, a wrestler must have a note from a doctor saying the face mask is required. Since an opposing coach is able to ask for this documentation before each match, it is important for athletes to carry it with them regularly.

In the past in the Senior Level, Olympics, and World Championships, a wrestler could protest and their opponent would have to remove their headgear. This is no longer the case and a wrestler is allowed to wear a headgear even if their opponent protests.
